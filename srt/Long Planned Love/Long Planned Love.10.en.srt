Sorry. The person you're calling

33
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,510
is busy making money.

34
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,640
You troublemaker.

35
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,920
Where've you been these days?

36
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,770
You missed my calls.

37
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,290
Just get to the point.

38
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,600
You registered your marriage
with Zhou Tingyan.

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,330
Yeah.

40
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,230
From

41
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,790
we've been betting up to now,

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,040
it's been half a month.

43
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,280
Which means

44
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,060
when you made that bet with me,

45
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,680
you were confident about winning over him.

46
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,120
You knew you'd win.

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,950
That's why you set up that whole bet

48
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,790
to trap me.

49
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,680
All just so,

50
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,710
you could snatch that 9% stake.

51
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,870
Bingo.

52
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,640
Congrats, you got it right.

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,950
You sly little thing.

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
Back then,

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,400
you even put Changhuai Road
on the table.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,070
You knew I couldn't resist it.

57
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,800
Why didn't you go for more?

58
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,960
You're bold enough.

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,430
Why not think about

60
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,590
matching your brother's level directly?

61
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,240
I didn't believe
you'd win over Zhou Tingyan.

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,120
Maybe,

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,310
my gambling itch kicked in

64
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,750
and I promised to bet.

65
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,590
Because I know you so well.

66
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,310
I had to use my biggest bet,

67
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,630
but only 1% higher than Jian Wenqian's.

68
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,400
That way you'd think

69
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,710
I was doing it just to spite her.

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,240
So you'd take my bet.

71
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,960
So Jian,

72
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,120
you can't blame me for this.

73
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,000
Because you were thinking

74
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,310
if you won,

75
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,910
Changhuai Road would be yours.

76
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
And if I won,

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,520
Zhou Tingyan would be your son‑in‑law.

78
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,840
Either way, you couldn't lose.

79
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,080
Deep down, you felt

80
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,030
a man like Zhou Tingyan

81
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,400
would never marry a loser like me.

82
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,190
How did you manage to win over him?

83
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,030
I heard you pressured him

84
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,910
because he owed you his life.

85
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
Mm-hm.

86
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,350
Yeah.

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,560
I told him straight up.

88
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,910
If he didn't marry me,

89
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,800
I'd jump off Qianyi Group's rooftop.

90
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,520
So Jian,

91
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,190
we've got an agreement here.

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,280
You'd better get those papers done fast

93
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,640
and call me over to sign.

94
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,080
If you try to back out,

95
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,310
I'll hold a banner
outside Changsheng Group,

96
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
saying you don't keep your word.

97
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,150
You rebellious girl.

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,030
Cheng,

99
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,470
as for you now,

100
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,800
you've already married Zhou Tingyan.

101
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,080
When will you bring him home for dinner?

102
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,680
Why didn't you ask me,

103
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,540
why I got the marriage license ages ago

104
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,740
but only made it public now?

105
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,470
You got the point.

106
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,960
Why?

107
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,240
Zhou Tingyan wanted to keep it quiet.

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,710
He didn't want it public.

109
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,280
Why wouldn't he want to make it public?

110
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,360
Obviously, he thinks

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,150
marrying me is embarrassing.

112
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,910
Now he gets annoyed just seeing me.

113
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,080
No, that's not right.

114
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,190
I heard that day at their home,

115
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,950
he kept shielding you.

116
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,120
That was in public.

117
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,040
He had to play the loving husband role.

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,430
In private, when it's just us.

119
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,720
He completely ignores me.

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
What about you?

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,190
Can you… help me out here?

122
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,510
Maybe drop by Master Zhou's place
a few times.

123
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,310
Are you seriously joking right now?

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,630
You think I can see him whenever I want?

125
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,120
So, Jian,

126
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,510
if you're asking me for help,

127
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,830
I'm afraid I can't do much.

128
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,040
Maybe when I can make

129
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,920
Zhou Tingyan truly fall for me

130
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,920
and have real influence with him,

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,960
I can help you.

132
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,120
Alright, enough said, Jian.

133
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,040
I need to build something
with Zhou Tingyan.

134
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,600
Or you'll lose both shares and daughter.

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,440
Okay?

136
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,390
(Aunt Guan)
Sorry, the person you're calling...

137
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,680
And now who is this?

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

139
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,360
Send one even if it's not.

140
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,200
Thanks.

141
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,480
Sorry.

142
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,360
Aunt Guan.

143
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,920
Cheng, can you come
to the Ancestral House?

144
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,950
Lu and Yufeng got into a fight.

145
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,430
Master Zhou is furious with Lu.

146
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,830
I really don't know what to do.

147
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,040
Stay calm.

148
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,880
I'm on my way.

149
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,190
Aunt Fang.

150
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,070
Where's Zhou Tingyan?

151
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,470
He woke up an hour ago.

152
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,190
Had breakfast and went to the office.

153
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,800
He said you should sleep more.

154
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,120
He'll come back for lunch.

155
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,560
Tell him I'm going to the Ancestral House.

156
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,720
We won't have lunch together.

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,520
Alright.

158
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,200
Sir, Mrs. Zhou is already up.

159
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
She didn't have time for breakfast.

160
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,000
She went to the Ancestral House

161
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,360
and won't join you for lunch.

162
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,720
You're driving me crazy.

163
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,640
Dad, stop hitting him.

164
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,070
Please let Lu off.

165
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,510
I'm begging you.

166
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,510
Qingrou, Lu messed up.

167
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,070
He deserves the punishment.

168
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,630
Besides,

169
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,000
he broke

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,920
Dad's favorite vase.

171
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you admit it?

172
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,320
No.

173
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,370
Still talking back, huh?

174
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,350
Hey.

175
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Everyone's here.

176
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,950
Zhou Lu,

177
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,320
have you committed some crime?

178
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,560
Why have you beaten up like this?

179
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,980
What happened to your neck?

180
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,320
I'm just as miserable as you.

181
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,000
Lately, there's been a misfortune.

182
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,310
When we have free time,

183
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,630
I'll take you along

184
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,480
to the temple to get a safety amulet.

185
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,510
That way, we won't

186
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,600
keep getting set up by petty people.

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,400
Dad,

188
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,720
why did you hit Zhou Lu?

189
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,190
He did something wrong.

190
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Dad,

191
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,920
I have a way to prove

192
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,430
that Zhou Lu didn't break that vase.

193
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,910
How?

194
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,270
You.

195
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,920
You said you saw Zhou Lu smash the vase.

196
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,120
Words alone mean nothing.

197
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,150
Bring evidence.

198
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,430
We all saw it happen.

199
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,680
Isn't that enough?

200
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,510
Now I finally see the truth.

201
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,190
And right now,

202
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,620
it's Jiang Yawei,

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,130
my eldest nephew,

204
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,430
and my sister-in-law.

205
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,040
These three

206
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
all claim they saw
Zhou Lu break the vase.

207
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,410
But there's no proof at all.

208
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,710
You can't convict on just words.

209
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,720
That's ridiculous.

210
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,600
So I could randomly accuse someone too?

211
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,320
You, Jiang Yawei.

212
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,000
I suspect you broke that vase

213
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,390
and then framed Zhou Lu on purpose.

214
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,680
Zhou Lu, what are you doing?

215
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,950
(How does she know?)

216
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,600
You have a strong motive.

217
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,190
Because usually,

218
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,310
Zhou Lu doesn't like you.

219
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,000
So you took the chance to get back at him.

220
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,510
My nephew, you...

221
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,080
You're an accomplice.

222
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,480
Because she's your wife.

223
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
You're covering for her.

224
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,960
My sister-in-law's in menopause.

225
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,840
Her words don't count.

226
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,680
You again?

227
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,360
Dad, none of those three can be trusted.

228
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,600
They don't have any proof.

229
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,390
It's possible they falsely accused Zhou Lu.

230
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,120
Unless you make them show real evidence.

231
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,870
Jian Cheng.

232
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,480
You keep asking us for proof.

233
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,620
But Zhou Lu can't produce proof

234
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,080
to clear his own name either.

235
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,960
If he had proof,

236
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,240
he wouldn't have been beaten so badly.

237
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,960
They're the ones who accused him first.

238
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,080
So they should bring evidence first.

239
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,080
With logic like yours,

240
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,250
how do you run the household?

241
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,630
You...

242
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,210
If you think it's unfair,

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,480
why not just call the police?

244
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,320
It's the fairest way.

245
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,750
He got beaten like this
and still kept quiet.

246
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,390
It means he's innocent.

247
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,300
- Jian Cheng.
- I'm Mrs. Zhou.

248
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,630
This is a private matter of my family.

249
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,340
If the police get involved,

250
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,000
people will laugh at us.

251
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,230
Exactly.

252
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,200
The family's reputation comes first.

253
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,720
Let's not blow this up.

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,630
Lu's already been beaten.

255
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,870
So I think,

256
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,030
we should just drop it here.

257
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,240
Zhou Lu's been hurt this badly.

258
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,450
- How can we...
- Jian Cheng.

259
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
What are you doing here?

260
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Such a thing happened.

261
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,080
Why didn't you call me?

262
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,070
Tingyan.

263
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,750
The two-tone vase your mom left behind.

264
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,970
Lu broke it.

265
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,250
It wasn't Zhou Lu.

266
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,200
They said they saw it happen.

267
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,550
But none of them has proof.

268
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
I know.

269
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,870
Don't worry.

270
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,020
When someone is alive,

271
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,150
you never value them.

272
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,000
Once they're gone, don't fake affection.

273
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
Tingyan.

274
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,270
Can a vase ever be worth a life?

275
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,800
And besides,

276
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,360
my mom didn't even like that vase.

277
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,030
It's just you thinking she did.

278
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,180
You forced all your ideas onto her.

279
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,030
She's gone,
and you still won't let her be.

280
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,870
Glad it's broken.

281
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,390
That's great.

282
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,390
Doesn't matter if it was you.

283
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,710
You still got hurt.

284
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,240
I'll give you credit.

285
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,720
Just keep the bar as a side gig.

286
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,750
Once you're healed, come find me.

287
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,910
Manager of Investment Department Ⅱ.

288
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,750
The post is yours.

289
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,130
Uncle Zhou.

290
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,150
You must be joking.

291
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,320
Investment Department Ⅱ.

292
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,000
When have I ever joked with you?

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The capital market
isn't about seniority.

294
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,910
If I say he's capable,

295
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,160
then he is.

296
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,270
Zhou Lu isn't qualified, right?

297
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,630
Qualified or not,

298
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,470
I decide.

299
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,920
Here's the thing.

300
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
Why are you involved in

301
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,240
all the mess lately?

302
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,240
I've been in a bad mood lately.

303
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,200
Please give me some space.

304
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,480
Or do you think your husband is too free?

305
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,600
I could give him more work if you want.

306
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,600
Why did you bring Zhou Lu
into the business?

307
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,340
Don't underestimate him.

308
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,030
Such a thing happened.

309
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,600
Why didn't you call me?

310
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,320
I…

311
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,390
Yesterday it was Meng Tang.

312
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,510
Today it's Zhou Lu.

313
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,910
Meng Tang's your friend, I get that.

314
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,030
But Zhou Lu is your childhood pal

315
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,550
and also my nephew.

316
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,320
Something happened.

317
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,870
Why didn't you tell me?

318
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
Well…

319
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,600
I honestly didn't know

320
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,240
whether this vase is important to you.

321
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,870
If you'd seen it break and gotten furious,

322
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,790
he would've been in trouble.

323
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,460
Besides,

324
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,100
I never planned on hiding it from you.

325
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,870
I was meant to

326
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,960
clear Zhou Lu's name first,

327
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,240
then come talk to you.

328
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,910
Are Meng Tang and Zhou Lu

329
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
really that important to you?

330
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,550
Mm-hm.

331
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,600
Very important.

332
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,320
Who else matters to you,

333
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,600
apart from them?

334
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,630
Anyone still alive?

335
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,470
Yeah.

336
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
Tang.

337
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,680
Zhou Lu.

338
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,800
My aunt.

339
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,840
Uh-huh.

340
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,110
Mm-hm.

341
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,230
That's all?

342
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,960
Yeah, that's it.

343
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,290
Do you think I'm gone for good?

344
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,390
No, you're still alive.

345
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,470
Well, Jian Cheng,

346
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
I didn't make to the top 3.

347
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,720
At least put me last on it.

348
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,360
So what were you doing this morning?

349
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,270
To the hospital this morning.

350
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,670
Qin Zhuo got beaten into

351
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,630
the hospital by Tang.

352
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,360
Is Tang okay?

353
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,040
Meng Tang's fine.

354
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,390
It's Qin Zhuo who's hurt.

355
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,750
That's a relief.
