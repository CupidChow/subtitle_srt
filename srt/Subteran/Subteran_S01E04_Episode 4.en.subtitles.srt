1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,160
Goddamn it!

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,160
So how many?

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,200
-Four men and a woman.
-Four?

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,560
Two in police uniforms,
two troublemakers, one posing as a lawyer.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,080
-Yes.
-Mr. Golescu, do you have a statement?

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,320
I can't make a statement
if I don't know what happened.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,920
Give me some time to find out.

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,040
Look at these toys!

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,360
Yo, brother.

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
-Yes.
-Check this.

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,800
This is crazy.

12
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,960
Yo, Dracu.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,920
How much can we make off these?

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,720
What do you think? Will the boss be happy?

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,640
Tănase doesn't give a fuck
about a few handguns.

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,280
We just won him
three days of cops being busy

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,240
while he's doing that mega-deal of his.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,600
-That's all he cares about.
-What's happening then?

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,880
I had some business, but it can wait.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,640
We can manage without you.

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,640
When I give you the sign, be ready.

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,080
-Are we hacking that laptop or not?
-Let her catch her breath.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,240
I can't.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
What's that? Weren't you the big hacker?

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,640
I mean I can't.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,280
I need equipment, cables, jumpers,
risers, password hacking software.

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,880
I can't just guess my way in.

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,480
Why the hell did they kill him?

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,400
He was working on the laptop found
at Luca's crime scene.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
They took the laptop, our guns,
and all they found in the locker.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Oh, and…

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,520
They posted this on Illegal Non-Stop.

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,120
It's a Telegram group.
We're monitoring it.

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,000
It's usually, thugs filming each other,
showing off.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
And here, take a look.

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,160
Say it again, so everyone can hear you.

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,800
-My heart. My pills.
-Your heart? Are you nervous?

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,040
What the fuck is wrong with you? Pills?
Are you high, you old fucking bastard?

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,880
Look at them.
The Romanian Police! What's up with that?

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,680
Safety and trust.

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
On the floor, like rats.
Look! Come on, squeak!

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,600
Eyes on the ground.

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,280
You fucking squeak for me!
Squeak, come on!

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,920
Grab their guns and let's get out of here!

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,240
Head down.

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,320
Good evening.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,560
VIOLENT ATTACK
POLICE PRECINCT PLUNDERED BY THIEVES

48
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,120
This evening, group of armed suspects
got inside this precinct,

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,240
aiming to steal evidence
tied to an ongoing investigation.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,840
During this incident, shots were fired.

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,000
One officer was killed,
and another one is hospitalized.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,480
His condition is unknown as of now.

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,720
His condition is his heart popped
from eating too much shawarma,

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,400
that fat fucking cop bastard!

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,640
Fuck that dirty motherfucker.

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
To hell with him.

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,880
…whole clip, but we warn you
that the content is extremely violent.

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,200
-Say it again, so everyone can hear you.
-My heart…

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,720
-Your heart? Are you nervous?
-My pills.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,600
What the fuck is wrong with you? Pills?
Are you high, you old fucking bastard?

61
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,360
Look at them.
The Romanian Police! What's up with that?

62
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,400
Safety and trust.

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,200
On the floor, like rats.
Look! Come on, squeak!

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,920
-Eyes on the ground.
-Fucking squeak for me! Squeak, come on.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,640
DID YOU SEE THAT?
YOU LEFT TRACES. FIX IT!

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,800
You posted that?

67
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,000
-You cocksucker!
-You posted it!

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,920
-Just on Illegal Non-Stop.
-Isn't that on the Internet, you idiot?

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,800
We identified an individual whose presence
was confirmed at the crime scene today,

70
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,040
and also at the double homicide scene
at Grand Hotel,

71
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,560
a few moments after the murder
of police officer Luca Voinea.

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,360
We're assuming…

73
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,760
-What were you doing there?
-Yo, Bones!

74
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,840
We can't tell you more.
We're sorry. Good evening.

75
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,680
-What kind of documents…
-Yes, Bones.

76
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,880
-What the fuck were you doing?
-Wait.

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,320
-Bones, were you stealing from the boss?
-Wait a minute. Let's calm down!

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,240
Wait! I don't know what this shit is.
It has nothing to do with me.

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,800
It's not true.

80
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,480
Fucking put that down!

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,840
Come on, spill it.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
The laptop.

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
-Who the fuck are they?
-I don't know.

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
But I'll find out.

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,880
FIND HIM
NETWORK

86
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,400
ETERNAL PEACE
FULL FUNERAL SERVICES

87
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,800
Fucking…

88
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,600
Come home. Now.

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,400
Come. Maybe your guys will find them
before we get there.

90
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,200
I stuck my neck out for him,
that motherfucking thief bastard!

91
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll destroy him, on my mother's life!

92
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,760
What? Afraid Daddy will abandon you
and you'll end up alone?

93
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,440
He abandoned me too,
and I'm quite all right.

94
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
You're really afraid.

95
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
Don't worry, baby, I'll protect…

96
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,920
You know what? Go fuck yourself!
I won't protect you.

97
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,920
Let's see how long you last.

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,440
Fuck this fucking family of lunatics!

99
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,800
Make way.

100
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,400
-What way? Tell us what's inside.
-Keep your distance, please.

101
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,440
Good evening, sir.

102
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,760
-As if we weren't busy enough.
-What was it?

103
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,320
A stun grenade. Police issue.

104
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,640
-Did you recover the serial number?
-Of course. We didn't just hang around.

105
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,960
It's from the other crime scene.
From Precinct 46.

106
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,000
Fucking hell.

107
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,200
Excuse me.

108
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,360
I'd like to speak with a prosecutor.

109
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm very sorry, miss.
This is a crime scene.

110
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,600
So if it's not serious…

111
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,520
If you want,
I can guide you to another precinct.

112
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
No, thank you.

113
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
-Who was that lady?
-Didn't say.

114
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,160
-What did she want?
-To speak to the boss.

115
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Excuse me.

116
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,360
Could you lend me a phone?
My bag was stolen. I need to call my mom.

117
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,480
-I can give you mine.
-Thanks a lot!

118
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,480
You're welcome.

119
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, sorry.

120
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,360
-Here.
-Thank you.

121
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,360
You're welcome.

122
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,800
Come on, Mom. Come on, please!

123
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,760
The person you're trying to call
is unavailable. Try again later.

124
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,400
Yeah, thank you.

125
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,600
You're welcome.

126
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,800
You reminded me
that I need to call my mom too.

127
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,600
Here. It's the least I can do.

128
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
How's it going?

129
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,360
The balance between work
and my personal life has gone to hell.

130
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,960
I just saw Stere.
So it wasn't just a stun grenade.

131
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,400
Obviously.

132
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,480
A bit of everything.
Shooting, blood on the walls.

133
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,640
Did you see them?

134
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,320
I'll introduce them.

135
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,360
It's a Kinder Surprise.

136
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,400
Number one…

137
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,800
and two.

138
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
From the precinct robbery.

139
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,720
How did you know?
From the shitty tailoring?

140
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,680
Someone is cleaning up after themselves.

141
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,480
-Your foot soldiers?
-No. Come on.

142
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,520
Wait. Tell me something first.

143
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,960
What should I say?

144
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,520
That bastard was at the hotel.
He knew about Bank.

145
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,240
He lied to us about other stuff too.

146
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,600
Who's that little slut?

147
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,520
-Who is she?
-Let's talk to him.

148
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,480
-And tell him what?
-Everything.

149
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
What I know and what I think.

150
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
So?

151
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
So… So far, we only know
what you saw on the news.

152
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,800
He was there, but he didn't tell anyone.

153
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,360
And you didn't see him?

154
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,160
-No.
-So you killed everybody.

155
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
Except the traitors.

156
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,840
Is he a cop?

157
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,000
Not likely.
Why would he help us with the laptop?

158
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,120
He could have set a trap.
No, the cops didn't know.

159
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,400
And Crisi was last seen with him.

160
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,320
And then, where is she now?

161
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,760
Our guys over in Dubai haven't seen her.

162
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,640
Oh, and that girl hanging out with Bones.
Sonia. Who is she?

163
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,600
We're not sure, Daddy. We think--

164
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,080
So all we know for sure right now

165
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,720
is that you had my fucking computer
and my money

166
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,920
and you let them slip
through your fingers.

167
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,200
And not only did you lose all my money,

168
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,960
you also lost Crisi.

169
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,920
Right? Good job.

170
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,120
How long have you been taking care
of my little girls?

171
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,240
Ten years?

172
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,000
Boy… Boy!

173
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,600
Twenty years.

174
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,080
I've been taking care of you for 20 years.
I raised you like my own kid.

175
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,080
You weren't my blood,
but it didn't matter to me.

176
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,600
What were you doing?

177
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,360
And you?

178
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,160
Didn't I ask you to protect your sister
as if she was made of glass?

179
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,480
God forbid perfect little Crisi
went down the wrong path.

180
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,840
Crisi still has a chance!

181
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,320
A chance to do what?

182
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,680
Do you think it was easy for me
after your mom died?

183
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,440
You? You went completely off the rails.

184
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,440
Parties, drugs…

185
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,080
You would fuck every lowlife
who would come near you for one second.

186
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,160
And if he said something you didn't like,
you just stabbed him.

187
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,840
Do you know how hard it was
for me to clean up after you? Tell her.

188
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,200
Did I ask you to?

189
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,160
Lots of people wanted revenge.

190
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,640
Lots of people wanted you dead.

191
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,920
There are still plenty who want that,
but I can handle shit on my own.

192
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,280
Getting others in deep shit.

193
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,320
Myself, your sister…

194
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,480
Listen.

195
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,120
I swore on your mother's grave

196
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,040
that I wasn't gonna let Crisi
end up being a tramp like you.

197
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,080
Without this,
your sister couldn't enter Dubai.

198
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,200
-Daddy--
-You keep your mouth shut.

199
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,080
You are who you are.

200
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,440
You are what you are.

201
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,920
So you get the fuck out of here
and do what you do.

202
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,280
Only this time, you do it right.

203
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,640
And find me that laptop, for fuck's sake!

204
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,400
Find my money!

205
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,120
How do you feel?

206
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,400
Just great.

207
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,520
What do we do now?

208
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,640
We find Bones. We find that slut.

209
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,040
We find out what happened to Crisi
and we get that fucking money back.

210
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,520
If he gets it back, he'll be happy.

211
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,240
It's all he cares about.

212
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,520
That and his new life.

213
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
His clean life.

214
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,360
It's just you and me now.

215
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,720
And him.

216
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,920
He wants to get rid of all his problems.

217
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,680
Don't be stupid.

218
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,800
You're his own flesh and blood.

219
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,640
We have to be smarter than him.

220
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,960
Two steps ahead of him.

221
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,600
I'll go to Bones's place.

222
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,160
Find out where the cop's girlfriend lives.

223
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,520
If she's there and…

224
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,000
If she's not dead, you call me.

225
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,320
I want to know why.

226
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,000
Mom?

227
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
Where's your daddy?

228
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,640
Hello?

229
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
Who was it? Mom?

230
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,080
No, Matei. No.

231
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,760
Go back to sleep. It wasn't her.

232
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,480
It's me.

233
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,720
I'm going to let go.
Please, don't scream. Okay?

234
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,000
Okay, let me…

235
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,800
Explain it to me.

236
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,000
Don't you move.

237
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,200
No. Don't answer. You'll endanger them.

238
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,760
Goddamn it…

239
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,680
Why the fuck were you at the hotel
the night Luca died?

240
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,680
-Wait--
-Did you use him as bait?

241
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,360
No. I was working with Luca. I told you.

242
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,320
I was downstairs for safety
in case anything happened.

243
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,440
Yeah, maximum safety, bro.
You helped him a lot.

244
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,080
When I saw that he was in danger,
I ran upstairs, but it was too late.

245
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,160
And why didn't you tell me until now?

246
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,480
-You have every right to be upset.
-Really?

247
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,120
I don't know.
I wanted to spare you all these details.

248
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,360
I did not sacrifice Luca.

249
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,640
I was just stupid. That's it.

250
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
I have to live with this guilt.
It's not easy.

251
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,240
Luca is dead. I couldn't care less
about you and your guilt.

252
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,640
I really need your help.

253
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,600
If you hack this thing,

254
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,400
I have all the evidence
I need to catch Tănase.

255
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,080
And you… You get your old life back.

256
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,120
I'll do this for you, but after this,
I don't want to see you again.

257
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Thank you.

258
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,560
-How's the boy? Is he okay?
-He's fine.

259
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,680
-He thought it was his mother.
-Of course.

260
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,160
It only rang once?

261
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,320
I think so.

262
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,440
Listen.

263
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,160
-What if someone broke her door?
-To her apartment?

264
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,120
Yes. It doesn't add up.

265
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,840
Only Cami had the number.

266
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,000
This number?

267
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,080
Do you think it was her?

268
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,080
No. Come on… Chin up.

269
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,000
She'll be back.

270
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,600
You know how she is.

271
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,600
She won't quit until she gets her way.

272
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,280
Yes.

273
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,000
Bank wasn't kidding
when he said he upgraded it.

274
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,800
Yes.

275
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,000
Tell me about Bank.

276
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,440
Interests, hobbies,
anything that could help me.

277
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,840
He was a simple man. He liked food,
booze, money, and sex with prostitutes.

278
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,080
Thanks. You really helped me a lot.

279
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,000
I only have a billion combinations.

280
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
-I hope you have good news.
-I got that her address. Camelia Serbu's.

281
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
-Really?
-I'm going there now.

282
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,200
Share the location. See you there.

283
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
It's her.

284
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,680
I'm in.

285
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,040
There's no more time.

286
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,800
One of the partitions
was turned into a cold wallet.

287
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,480
I'll copy it onto my desktop
to access it remotely,

288
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,960
but it will take a while.

289
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,320
Crypto is…

290
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,840
-What's she doing?
-She's on her phone.

291
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,640
WAIT 2 MORE FUCKING MINUTES

292
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,160
-Yep.
-Listen.

293
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,880
Is there a file named Corrupt Files?

294
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,880
Yes.

295
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,640
Here it is.

296
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,160
Scroll down to T.

297
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,080
Jesus, look at this.
Lists of names, of payments.

298
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,640
-Everything.
-Everything.

299
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,480
The cream of the crop.
And they're all working for Tănase.

300
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,760
They're coming.

301
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,120
No more time. We have to leave.

302
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,760
If I disconnect it now,
I'll lose a lot of data.

303
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,000
You'll be losing a lot of blood
if that psycho gets here.

304
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,600
-On the ground floor.
-It was three minutes, you dick!

305
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
We leave now.

306
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,560
-Only a few minu--
-Not even five seconds!

307
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,600
Come on.

308
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,000
I found it.

309
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,440
-Lost connection.
-Do we have the data?

310
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,840
Yes. It's downloaded.

311
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,200
Come on!

312
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,680
CAMI, I LOVE YOU. LUCA

313
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,400
What is it?

314
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,800
I found these.

315
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,880
And this was in Sonia's clothes.

316
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,080
-So Sonia--
-She's the cop's girlfriend.

317
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,040
Cami Serbu.

318
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,680
INCOMING CALL
THE COUNTRYSIDE

319
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,600
Cami? This is your mother.

320
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,000
Did you try to call me earlier?

321
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,800
I hope it was you.

322
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,600
Baby, please,
don't stay there alone and upset.

323
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,840
We'll stay here for a few more days.

324
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,320
Call me, baby, okay? Do it for Mommy.

325
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,640
The countryside.

326
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,200
IZVOARELE DE JOS
JUNE 2022

327
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,320
So Crisi really is…

328
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,800
She messed with our family.
We'll do the same.

329
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,640
-Hello, are you free by any chance?
-No.

330
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,000
-Why not?
-Come on.

331
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,840
-This one?
-No.

332
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,600
Here. Ask this guy.

333
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,800
Yes.

334
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,680
Hi. We want a ride outside Bucharest,
about 62 miles. Are you free?

335
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,200
-Yes?
-Sure.

336
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,920
Mom. I got a long one.

337
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,640
Okay, don't wait up.

338
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,400
Where to?

339
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,800
Izvoarele de Jos.
I'll show you when we get there.

340
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,000
It's me.

341
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,960
I think we got something.

342
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,720
-Sir.
-How is he?

343
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,120
Sleeping. Well, sedated.
But he is out of critical condition.

344
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
It was a coronary spasm.

345
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,560
-Did he say anything?
-Nothing.

346
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,160
She was here all night.

347
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
She's waiting for him to wake up
and take him home.

348
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,400
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, madam.

349
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,400
I really am sorry.

350
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,080
It's this damned job, Mrs. Tatu.

351
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,280
Carmen, please.

352
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,840
-Carmen.
-You know, this is my fault.

353
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,080
He wanted to go and see the game.

354
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,720
I said that the commotion
would do him harm. Look at him now.

355
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,240
Thank God it wasn't worse.
He's going to be up and about in no time.

356
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,200
Yes.

357
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,320
Between you and me, I was at the game.

358
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,920
You were right. He could have ended up
with a heart attack.

359
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,520
I was hoping he'd be awake.

360
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,680
I wanted to ask for his advice
about a case he was working on when…

361
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
He's a really good investigator.

362
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,360
-He was when he was young.
-Now too.

363
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,600
He has an eye for it. Yes.

364
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,560
-Wait… Is this his phone?
-Yes.

365
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,880
May I borrow it, if you don't mind?
Maybe he caught something on camera.

366
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,400
-Take it.
-Something that could help us.

367
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,800
Yeah.

368
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,280
-Good-bye.
-Yes, thank you.

369
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,240
I'll buy some water.

370
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,240
ETERNAL PEACE
FULL FUNERAL SERVICES

371
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,600
These.

372
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,120
These too.

373
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,600
What's up with the cables?

374
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,680
I had every cable you might need
back in my apartment.

375
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,840
I just need these.

376
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,320
Okay.

377
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,080
But that's for an iPhone.
Yours is an Android.

378
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,400
What?

379
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,640
What the hell?

380
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,280
This isn't our driver.

381
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Stop it. Both of you, stop it now!
Stop it!

382
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,720
Good. And if I ask you,

383
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,440
"Wie heißt du?" What do you answer?

384
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,000
-Ich…
-Ich…

385
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,680
-heiße…
-heiße…

386
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,000
-Matei Serbu.
-Good. Write it down.

387
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Matei!

388
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,680
I want you to run fast. Go to Mr. Zisu.

389
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,200
-Go.
-What's wrong?

390
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,880
Nothing. Around the back,
through the garden.

391
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,280
-You run fast to him.
-But who's there?

392
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,560
Nobody. You tell him
that there's someone at my door.

393
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,760
He'll know what to do. Go.
Go around the back. Quick.

394
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,480
Go! Around the back.

395
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,200
I'm sure they know where we're going.

396
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,800
Who are you?

397
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,840
Mrs. Serbu? Cami's mother?

398
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
What do you want?

399
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,240
We're friends.
She sent me to deliver a message.

400
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,200
What is it? Go ahead!

401
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,200
She didn't call?
She sent me to explain everything.

402
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,800
I'll make some tea.

403
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,520
-Let me explain why I came.
-I have to get it. Might be important.

404
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,400
Leave it.

405
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,840
-Let me go!
-The kid?

406
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,840
Matei isn't here. Let me go.

407
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,520
-Call him.
-He's not here.

408
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
You're hurting me.

409
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,080
Matei!

410
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,120
Matei!

411
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,400
Turn right here.

412
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,360
Matei!

413
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,480
It's all right. I'm your mom's friend.

414
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,960
If you can hear me, come out.

415
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,400
I'll take you to your mother.

416
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,800
-Are you here?
-Yes. I'm here.

417
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,320
Okay, I'll be right there.

418
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,680
Mom!

419
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,520
There's… There's blood!

420
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,840
-Don't move her.
-Where's Matei? Matei!

421
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,520
-Matei!
-I'll go.

422
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,320
Do you hear me? Mom?

423
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,560
MOM

424
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,840
Hi, Sonia. Or is it Camelia?

425
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,520
Cami Serbu. Luca's fiancée.

426
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,360
Sure. Here's why I called.
I wanted to show you around.

427
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,600
Look at this forest.

428
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Such beautiful trees!

429
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,000
It's really quiet here.

430
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,560
Mom?

431
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,320
-Look, a little boy.
-Mom!

432
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,000
-Matei!
-Mommy!

433
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,520
-My baby! Mommy's coming.
-You know him?

434
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,800
-How cute!
-Matei!

435
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,000
-Mommy!
-Mommy isn't coming.

436
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,280
We'll come after Mommy when it suits us.

437
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,120
