1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,200
Luca…

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
I really think
we complete each other, you know?

3
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,480
DADDY

4
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,600
How are you feeling?

5
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,520
Look, I've been thinking.

6
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,960
And I'm grateful for all your help, but…

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,440
I need to go to my boy.

8
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,880
You can't.

9
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,080
-How--
-If you leave, you die.

10
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,080
And you'll endanger him.

11
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,240
It's dangerous for us all.

12
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,000
Hello.

13
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,720
Mr. Prosecutor, is there any connection
between this and yesterday's murders?

14
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,840
Did you identify the victim?

15
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,520
-Clear the area.
-Do you have details?

16
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,120
-Thanks. Good morning.
-Good morning.

17
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Cristescu.

18
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,920
License plate.

19
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,200
-The VIN number…
-Swallow first.

20
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,280
I checked. The owner is one Camelia Serbu.

21
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
Camelia Serbu?

22
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
I spoke to her yesterday.

23
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
Let's see if you get another shot.
There's a body.

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,280
Guys, clear the area, please. Thank you.

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,160
May God forgive her.

26
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,720
Crisi isn't answering.

27
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Maybe she's working.
She's busy with the party.

28
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,200
Daddy's girl, right?

29
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,200
The way she's acting,
you'd think she's the last one.

30
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,880
What do you say? Is it the last one?

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,280
If you behave, if you don't drink alcohol

32
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,240
and you don't lose your temper,

33
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
you might have one or two more.

34
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,720
I asked for non-alcoholic champagne.

35
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,640
Maybe we'll get a call from the hospital.
I have a good feeling.

36
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,920
-And the horoscope is okay.
-Is it? What does it say?

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,400
The Sun is in conjunction with Saturn.

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,160
Really?

39
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,880
If you need me to translate it,
it's 100 euros.

40
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,320
Okay.

41
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,720
BOSS

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,320
Happy birthday, boss!

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,480
Cut the crap!
Get up and come to the office. Now!

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,680
Lars already called me and ruined my day.

45
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,760
I need to know how much money we have.

46
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,840
And find Crisi, okay?
I want everything ready for tonight.

47
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,280
-Get your ass to the office.
-Right away.

48
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
We need a plan to get the laptop back.

49
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,400
I know.

50
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,640
I'll think of something.

51
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
What's that?

52
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,800
It's from Claw.

53
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,640
He says it's "For cutting your enemies."

54
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
Jesus Christ! How old are you, eight?

55
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,000
Out of the way!

56
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,400
Bank, fuck your crypto bullshit,
you motherfucker.

57
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
Come on.

58
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,080
-I have a TV.
-I see that.

59
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
I don't know
if the subscription is still valid.

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
Internet?

61
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,240
Dead people don't go online.
They start to look alive.

62
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,520
I'll be back tonight.

63
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,680
Okay. So what's the plan?

64
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,840
Okay, besides keeping me
locked up in here.

65
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,520
What if someone knocks?

66
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,320
Nobody's going to knock.
I'm not very friendly.

67
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
I wouldn't have guessed.

68
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,840
I'm trusting you to stay here.
For yours and Matei's sake.

69
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,760
You don't seem too trustful.

70
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,720
I'll be back as soon as I can.

71
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,400
How the hell do you know Matei's name?

72
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,160
Help!

73
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,400
Easy.

74
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,240
Easy. Grab the legs.

75
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,800
So we have Camelia Serbu.

76
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,440
No priors. Not even a traffic ticket.

77
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,720
Her dad was a cop.

78
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,600
She works in IT.
Something about cybersecurity.

79
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,640
Get off that damn phone.
Let's use our brains for a change.

80
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,640
Let's assume it's all connected
to Luca's death.

81
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Were they in it together
or is the partner collateral damage?

82
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,040
We need to find out what Luca was doing.

83
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,960
If he was working against Tănase.
Or maybe for him.

84
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,600
Luca was shot by a woman.

85
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,560
And we don't know the whereabouts
of two women in Bucharest.

86
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,840
His partner and his killer.

87
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,920
And we have another dead body,
maybe a woman, completely burnt.

88
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,240
The forensics team is working,
but it's going to take a while.

89
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,960
Until then, we're just guessing.

90
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,520
We don't know if Serbu is dead or not.

91
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,600
We're dealing
with a missing person's case.

92
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,320
And where does
a missing person investigation start?

93
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,040
In her home.

94
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Well? Go.

95
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,280
-Do you like it?
-Is it for cutting cake?

96
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
It's a present from Claw's people.

97
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,240
Send it back.
Tell him to shove it up his ass.

98
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,960
I don't need a sword. I'm not eight.

99
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,800
I want actions, not presents.

100
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,400
How are we for money?

101
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,520
Everybody is collecting debts
and making cash.

102
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,720
They'll deliver to Florin daily,
not weekly.

103
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,080
Hey, Lars is coming
for his two million in five days.

104
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,440
You mean those whores
are making 400K a day?

105
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,040
What's up with Bank's computer,
that fucking pig?

106
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,920
Working on it. Hey!

107
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,080
If you break it,
you're fucking paying for it!

108
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,000
Where the hell is my daughter?

109
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,280
She wouldn't disappear like that.
It's my birthday.

110
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,840
What's up, guys? Counting?

111
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,720
-Hey!
-What's up, dude?

112
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,280
Here he is.

113
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,760
-What's up, dude?
-Check it out.

114
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,880
Yo, are you crazy?

115
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,720
You wanted it. Bro's got you covered.

116
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,080
Move over!

117
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,080
Is it authentic?

118
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,920
Yeah! Took it straight
from a singer's neck.

119
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,240
Yo! Check it out.

120
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,440
-Congrats. You're the man.
-Of course, dude.

121
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,440
Authentic, made in China,
but no one will notice.

122
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,640
That'll work too, my man.

123
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,920
Whoa! What's up with this?

124
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
Is it for the gas bill?

125
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,600
You know what they say.
It's all about the money.

126
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,520
They're freaking out, Bones.

127
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,880
If somebody owes you money,
time to shake their pockets.

128
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,920
Dracu is really giving us the whip.

129
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
For real now. What's this?
Are we buying Facebook or--

130
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
There's a big deal in the works.

131
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,840
How big is it? What's he buying?

132
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,520
As if he'd tell me.

133
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,640
No.

134
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
No.

135
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,200
Hey.

136
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
What's up?

137
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,600
What are you doing here?

138
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,000
Hello.

139
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,560
What's up with you?

140
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,000
Here. Come to me.

141
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,400
There.

142
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,480
Wait.

143
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,000
What's your name?

144
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,800
Tell me. Will you stay with me?

145
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,760
Let's see…

146
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,680
-Hello.
-Hello.

147
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,520
Golescu, Chief Prosecutor.
This is Superintendent Tatu.

148
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Is Cami okay?

149
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,800
May we talk inside?

150
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,240
Yesterday she went to give a statement
to the police.

151
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,840
And after that, she said
she was going to Luca's apartment.

152
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,320
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

153
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,680
She used to stay at work overnight.

154
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,880
But she would always call Matei
to say good night.

155
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,120
We found her car.

156
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,360
Really? Where?

157
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,560
In the old train depot.

158
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,240
Two hundred gigs?

159
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No…

160
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,680
Yesterday when she left,
did she seem nervous?

161
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,200
Was she acting weird? Or did she look
like something was bothering her?

162
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,800
No. She was shaken up by what happened.

163
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,840
Is it likely that she met someone
in Agent Voinea's apartment?

164
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't know. I don't remember.

165
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,560
I'm sorry.

166
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,560
-Is this urgent?
-I found something that you'd like to see.

167
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
What kind of something?

168
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,320
Something you need to see

169
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,000
and then think really hard
if anybody else should see it too.

170
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,040
I'm coming.

171
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,200
I have a meeting.
You finish taking Mrs. Serbu's statement.

172
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,680
Check if it was Camelia's.

173
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,320
Get a DNA sample.

174
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,480
Then go to Luca's apartment.
With any luck, she spent the night there.

175
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,680
What the fuck are you doing?
Getting a tan?

176
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Go inside and start counting!

177
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,480
Bitch, are you out sick? Out!

178
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,080
-Where are you going?
-To take a piss.

179
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,600
You can piss yourself while you count.
Come on.

180
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,480
How much did you get?

181
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,640
One million lei.

182
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,560
We need much more.
Ten times more than that. Yo!

183
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,920
No more smoking and snorting!

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
…criminal organizations…

185
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,000
Get the word out that we need money.
Florin, I want every dime accounted for.

186
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,400
Neat, tidy, like a fucking accountant!

187
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,120
Any connection between this
and yesterday's murders?

188
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,440
THE POLICE INVESTIGATES
A CAR EXPLOSION IN BUCHAREST

189
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,880
It's too early to speculate
if there's any connection.

190
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,040
DOUBLE MURDER INVESTIGATION
AT THE HOTEL IS ONGOING

191
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,400
-There is.
-But do you have a suspect in that case?

192
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,240
We're still gathering evidence
for that case.

193
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,440
Did you watch the security footage?

194
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,840
-Well, yes!
-Did anyone see?

195
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,840
The investigation is ongoing.

196
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,400
We'll provide more information this week…

197
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,680
What about the woman in the hotel?
I told you how she looks. You saw her.

198
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,680
As you can see,
we don't have much information.

199
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,480
The police are reluctant to…

200
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,120
What are you doing? Watching TV?
What's on the news?

201
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
-No. I was just checking what's going on.
-Go see what's going on with that laptop!

202
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,480
You told Tănase not to call
his inside man.

203
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,600
-You fucked it up, you fix it.
-I'm working on it.

204
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,640
Then fucking work on it!
Give me something by tomorrow morning.

205
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,800
Otherwise, if the boss doesn't kill you,
he'll make me do it.

206
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,560
And he wants to know
where his princess is.

207
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,320
Does anyone know where the fuck Crisi is?

208
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Bones!

209
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,600
You took her to that cop's place.
You saw her last.

210
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,800
She hasn't answered her phone since.

211
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,800
We found no clues.

212
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,760
No computer, no signs
that he was in league with Bank.

213
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,640
But the police had been there.

214
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,360
I asked if she wanted me to drop her off.
She said no, she's going to some preacher.

215
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,680
Did she say "preacher" or "priest"?

216
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,240
She said "priest". Who's that?

217
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,040
The guy that helps us with funerals.

218
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,360
We'll come back with more information
as soon as we get it.

219
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,680
Thank you, Claudiu, for this interview
on the spot with the D.A. Golescu.

220
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,960
There's not much information,
but we'll keep you posted

221
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,720
as soon as the police reports
on their progress.

222
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,480
Investigations, actually, because
we remind you that in the last 48 hours,

223
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
no less than three dead bodies…

224
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,760
Good God, our Lord.

225
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,960
You, that are the Way,
the Truth and the Life,

226
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,160
bless this, your servants' car,
Titi and Nicole.

227
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,840
Give them, oh Lord, a guardian angel that…

228
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,600
Here, hold this.

229
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,320
You're blessing second hand cars too?

230
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,960
What can we do, my son? We--

231
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,800
I heard Crisi was here.

232
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,280
Yes. She's the only one in her family
that still comes, since her mother died.

233
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,520
You could come more often.

234
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,680
I'm not from the family.
When did she come here last?

235
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,320
Here. She brought this painting
for me to bless a few days ago.

236
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,880
She was supposed to come last night,
but she didn't.

237
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
She said it's a present
for her father's birthday.

238
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,320
May God keep Mr. Tănase in good health.

239
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,840
Send it to me.
It's a present from us both.

240
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,680
Yes.

241
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,280
And light a candle for me.

242
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,400
For the living.

243
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,720
Come on, spare me.
I had no idea she started going to church.

244
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,720
Good for her. At least one of you
is afraid of something.

245
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,840
Where's that idiot?

246
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,520
She went with one of our guys
to that dead cop's place.

247
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,120
-After that, nobody knows.
-Which one?

248
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,160
Some guy Bones. He's trustworthy.

249
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,480
Nobody's trustworthy nowadays.

250
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,680
Those from my dad's generation
can be trusted.

251
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,840
Young people will sell you for a dime.

252
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,720
I'll talk to him again.

253
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,960
Let's go to that cop's place.

254
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,160
See what's what. Maybe we find something.

255
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,960
Nice progress.
From precinct to a five-star hotel.

256
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,440
Yes. But my heart is still
at the precinct.

257
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,680
Come pick it up. We have too many hearts.

258
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,800
Oh, dear!

259
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,520
-So what is it?
-A video.

260
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,000
Filmed by some hotel employee
on the night of the murder.

261
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
After the alarm went off.

262
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,360
The girl was filming the evacuation.
Look who's leaving the Deluxe apartment.

263
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,600
Play that again.

264
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,960
Pause.

265
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,840
You know him?

266
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,040
He's not a guest.

267
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,280
I checked the CCTV. I couldn't find him.

268
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,880
No. But keep looking.
Maybe we can get a clearer picture.

269
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,760
Hello. Can I help you, sir?

270
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,960
Well, yes.

271
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,600
I'm looking for something for a woman
who is tired of her looks

272
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,000
and wants to look completely different.

273
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,560
How does the lady look now?

274
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,920
She's got brown hair,
or something like that.

275
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
This one.

276
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,720
Cheers to me!

277
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,800
No, no, no!

278
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,920
I'll give you five hundred for all this.

279
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,760
Oh, fuck!

280
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,720
This guy had no life.

281
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,080
Just look. He was dirt poor.

282
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
THE ROMANIAN POLICE
CAMELIA SERBU - GIRLFRIEND

283
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,320
He might have been dirt poor,
but maybe he was happy.

284
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,080
Sure. He was living like a king.

285
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,120
And when you shot him, he sure was happy.

286
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,520
How about you? Are you happy?

287
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,360
What's this all about?

288
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,760
Well, you were going on about happiness.

289
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm curious. Are you happy?

290
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,160
I don't know.

291
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,480
I am, like anybody else.

292
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,760
Wrong. If your woman asks you
about happiness, you say yes.

293
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,600
I'll tell the Chief Prosecutor. Yes.

294
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,520
Thanks.

295
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,440
Mrs. Serbu?

296
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,760
Camelia Serbu?

297
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,600
I'm from the police.

298
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,960
Is anybody home?

299
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,600
Mrs. Serbu?

300
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
Boss.

301
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,040
Did you check Voinea's place,
or couldn't make it past the fridge?

302
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,040
I'm in here, yes.

303
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
No sign of her, but she's been here.

304
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,640
-The coroner called with some info.
-Right.

305
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,480
The body in the trunk
is definitely a female.

306
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,400
-That's it?
-It's a mess. Not much to work on.

307
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,600
Was there a rug here
when the forensics came?

308
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,120
Why?

309
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,480
It seems something happened here
after they went through the place.

310
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,160
I found broken glass.

311
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,600
There are signs of a missing rug and…

312
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,080
a bullet hole in the wall.

313
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
Judging by the angle,

314
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,240
it seems that there was a fight.

315
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,800
That burnt body in the trunk, was it shot?

316
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,200
Well, you could ask the coroner.

317
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,240
Do you have anything more specific?

318
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,360
Check if they found any rug fibers
in the burnt car.

319
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,040
-Call the forensics team again.
-Yes, sir.

320
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,800
We have to talk to this Bones guy.

321
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,840
Now.

322
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,280
So? You enjoy watching me naked?

323
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,760
How did you do that?

324
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,680
You left me alone with a laptop, buddy.
What did you expect?

325
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,960
Next time don't leave me alone
with body parts either!

326
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,760
What? Are you a psycho?

327
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,520
Six months ago, Tănase killed someone
with his own hands.

328
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,280
He ordered the body to be chopped up.

329
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,560
I helped with the cleaning.

330
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,720
You kept that hand as a souvenir?

331
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,040
I kept it as evidence.
It has his DNA under the nails.

332
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,360
Take it to the cops. Why wait?

333
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,800
I can't. Not yet.

334
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,240
I need more proof.

335
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,200
I want to give them a foolproof case.
If not, he walks. And I don't want that.

336
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,600
Luca wouldn't have wanted that either.

337
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,640
Speaking of Luca.

338
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Do you realize how creepy it is

339
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,640
to be locked up by someone
whose laptop is filled to the brim

340
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,880
with sneaked pictures
of you and your whole family?

341
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,560
Yes, I know it looks weird, but--

342
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,880
But it's not. Right?

343
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,520
Great.

344
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,760
Nothing is what it seems.

345
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,600
Isn't that right?

346
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,800
Officer Marius Roman.

347
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,240
TIMIȘOARA POLICE ACADEMY
CLASS OF 2009

348
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,120
I know you went through the place,
but something happened after that.

349
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Exactly.

350
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,200
Bolt-Nut, give me Bones's address.

351
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,480
Last year, I went undercover
in Tănase's organization.

352
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,760
I knew he had
lots of police officers on his payroll,

353
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,440
so only two people know
about this operation.

354
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,920
Myself and my contact.

355
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,920
I don't care about your story.

356
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,760
I just want to know why…

357
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,040
Luca had to die.

358
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,880
I became friends with Tănase's accountant.

359
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
He played cards.

360
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,000
He was in huge debt and I knew

361
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,680
that he was sinking fast.

362
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,640
He wanted a way out.

363
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,440
I only needed a cop that I could trust
so I could deliver him.

364
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,040
And I found Luca. I had him checked.

365
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,360
He was okay. Clean.

366
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,680
-Did he know that you--
-No.

367
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,200
He didn't know about my cover.

368
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,480
Only that we had the same goal.

369
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,400
To finish Tănase off.

370
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,920
Only he finished you off first.

371
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,960
Nothing's going to happen to you.
I promise.

372
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,560
I'll show you something.

373
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,880
Okay.

374
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,560
Where is she?

375
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,200
Bones, right?

376
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,240
We haven't met.

377
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,840
I'm Tili.

378
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,240
-Tili Tănase.
-Twins, of course.

379
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,000
Miss Tănase…

380
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,080
-Where is she?
-Who?

381
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,880
Who the fuck do you think?
Crisi! Is she here?

382
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,120
Why would she be here?

383
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,040
-What did you do at that cop's place?
-Yo! Okay, wait.

384
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,240
Crisi made me swear I wouldn't tell.

385
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,120
While we were there,
that cop's girlfriend showed up.

386
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,280
And?

387
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,720
She said she recognized her,
that she shot her boyfriend.

388
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,040
How the fuck could she?

389
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,800
No clue. Crisi shot her.
I didn't get a chance to ask.

390
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,680
Who would've thought?

391
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
So? Where is she?

392
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,640
Sorry. I thought you were my sister.

393
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,000
But she's more of a hottie.

394
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,680
We're twins.

395
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,640
So?

396
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,600
Where did Crisi go?

397
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,000
Don't tell her that I told you.
She made me swear.

398
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,080
She said it would upset her…
your dad, that she killed someone.

399
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,680
Poor Daddy!

400
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,040
He thought at least one of us was sane.

401
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,280
She said she's going to Dubai.

402
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,240
She wanted to hide for a week or two,
until everything blows over.

403
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,280
Dubai?

404
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,040
That little slut.
Bulgaria was too low for her.

405
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,720
-That's what she said.
-And the other woman?

406
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,880
She's ashes. Crisi told me to clean up.

407
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,520
I burnt the car with the body in it.

408
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,240
There's no trace.

409
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,200
The cops don't have a suspect.
It's on the news.

410
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,880
She thought Crisi was me.

411
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,200
How the fuck did that cunt know
that you killed him?

412
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,360
Nice little siren in the bathroom.

413
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,320
Who is she?

414
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,480
His ex.

415
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,400
Sonia.

416
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,160
Hey.

417
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,480
-Why did you break up?
-Well, 'cause…

418
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,120
He caught me with another.

419
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,000
A girl.

420
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,720
And now,

421
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,760
if you don't mind,
we were just getting ready

422
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,320
for a make-up fuck.

423
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,960
So if you got what you came for…

424
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,640
Or…

425
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,240
I could join you two.

426
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,480
Leave it. We have stuff to do.

427
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,640
Are you coming to the party tonight?

428
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,520
-Both of you.
-Well…

429
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,000
I should start working
on that plan for tomorrow.

430
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,880
Well…

431
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,400
weren't you getting ready to fuck?

432
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,200
It's either, or.

433
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,200
So you're coming.

434
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,600
Where did my sister find the guts
to kill that bitch?

435
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,760
And save your ass.

436
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,720
Bones's girl is kind of pretty. You like?

437
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,640
I'm in love.
Why did you invite her to the party?

438
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
I wanted to offer you a threesome.

439
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,480
Is it for me or for you?

440
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,280
We'll see.

441
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,120
It depends on how you behave.

442
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,080
If you wear something nice to the party,
maybe I'll behave.

443
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,720
Come on.

444
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,480
We need to go somewhere before the party.

445
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,520
I killed an innocent woman.

446
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,960
Everybody is guilty in that family.

447
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,640
Who was the nutcase with the gun?

448
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,480
Tănase's right hand. Dracu.

449
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,520
Dracu.

450
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,920
It's been a long day.

451
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,680
We need to get ready.

452
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,640
We're going to a party tonight.

453
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,320
May God rest his soul.

454
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,160
-Thank you for coming.
-Be strong.

455
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,800
I know you are.

456
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,600
Mrs. Serbu. Hello.

457
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,400
I'm Vasile Coman.

458
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,040
Thanks for putting this together.

459
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,680
It's best for his colleagues
to pay their respects.

460
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,680
I did this for my husband too.

461
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,480
How is Matei?

462
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,120
Luca used to bring him
to our soccer matches.

463
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,200
It's… It's hard.

464
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,040
I didn't let him go out with his friends,
and now he won't leave his room.

465
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,800
-Do you want me to talk to him?
-Would you?

466
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,680
-Yes.
-Yes, that's a good idea.

467
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,600
Matei?

468
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,960
It's Vasile.

469
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,600
Do you remember me?

470
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,800
Ma--

471
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,960
-No!
-Wait.

472
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,120
Wait! Wait…

473
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,160
Wait.

474
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
Matei.

475
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,480
Look.

476
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,480
Hey, didn't your mommy tell you
not to roam the streets alone?

477
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,040
-Where's your mommy?
-Tell me.

478
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,920
What's up?

479
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,240
We found this kid alone on the street.

480
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,600
It's good you came.

481
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,800
Matei, go to your grandma. She needs you.

482
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,840
Go on.

483
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,080
Come on.

484
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,880
Matei is going to be okay.

485
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,720
He is safe.

486
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,600
They came to check my story.
To make sure that you're not here.

487
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,200
Come on.

488
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,400
Come on. Let's go.

489
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,760
Come on.

490
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,120
Boss of the Gypsy and Romanian

491
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,760
He brings in the cash
The man with the plan

492
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,960
He's the man, man, man
With the plan, plan, plan

493
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,240
He's the man, man, man, man
He's the man with the plan

494
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,080
Boss of the Gypsy and Romanian

495
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,040
He brings in the cash
The man with the plan

496
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,320
He's the man, man, man
He's the man with the plan

497
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,400
He's the man, man, man
He's the man with the plan

498
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,280
He's really good!

499
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,080
People are watching.
Pretend you're having fun.

500
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,280
I saw my kid on the street
with two criminals.

501
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,080
-Do you want me to jump for joy?
-Let's go this way.

502
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,160
He's boss of the Gypsy and Romanian

503
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,680
He brings in the cash
The man with the plan

504
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,080
He's the man, man, man
He's the man with the plan

505
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,600
He's the man, man, man

506
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,480
He's the man with the plan

507
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,720
He's boss of the Gypsy and Romanian

508
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,560
He brings in the cash
The man with the plan

509
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,840
He's the man, man, man
He's the man with the plan

510
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,080
He's the man, man, man
He's the man with the plan

511
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,040
Put your hands together for the boss.

512
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,160
Happy birthday, Daddy.

513
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,680
Where do you think your sister is?

514
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,920
She said she's going on vacation. Dubai.

515
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,280
To work on her tan.

516
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,600
Why the fuck would she go there?
Are you crazy?

517
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,480
Maybe she got tired of working.
Or maybe you have two crazy daughters.

518
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,680
Or maybe you get it together
and watch your sister. How about it?

519
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,840
Come on! Have fun!

520
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,120
The surprises just keep on coming.

521
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Everything for the boss!
And now, the star of the moment!

522
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,880
Theo Rose!

523
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,120
Happy birthday, Mr. Tănase!

524
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,440
We're here to have fun,
so the party goes on!

525
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,680
Miami, Arabia

526
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,680
There's no place like Romania

527
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,200
Dancing like in Africa

528
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,360
And dough like in Switzerland, yeah

529
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,320
North, South, East, West
All around the globe

530
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,640
Wherever you look
You won't find a vibe like this

531
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,320
Miami, Arabia

532
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,440
There's no place like Romania

533
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,640
My, my

534
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,000
Won't you dance with me?

535
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,520
I'm up here, see, boss
You're looking up at me

536
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,720
I'm saying "No” in English
I'm talented, what the hell

537
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,080
Don't talk about horsepower
If you're walking on foot

538
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Look how this girl is moving
Throw some pesos at her

539
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,200
Oh, it's the Romanian style

540
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,280
A bit of everything
This gives foreigners a pause

541
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,000
Right, Bones.

542
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,920
What's your story?

543
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,360
No story. I work the streets.

544
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,720
I don't ask questions
and I sleep well at night.

545
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,640
Get out of here. You're not like that.
I'm sure you want something.

546
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,120
I want to make some money
and stay out of trouble.

547
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,640
But how about her? What does she want?

548
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,840
She's a good girl.
I don't think she needs me in her life.

549
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,440
There's no place like Romania

550
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,520
My, my

551
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,680
Wanna dance?

552
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,920
No, thank you. Not now.

553
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,120
Come on.

554
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,560
-I'm not in the mood.
-It'll come to you.

555
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,160
Hold that thought!

556
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,120
Is this your present, Dracu?
Fucking up my birthday party?

557
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,280
Problems?

558
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,080
No.

559
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,400
Go get the girl something to drink.

560
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,240
Go see if it's snowing outside.

561
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,040
Nicolae Tănase.

562
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,840
Sonia Lazăr.

563
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,280
Happy birthday!

564
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,440
Thank you.

565
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,560
Hey!

566
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,520
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-You have eyes. Can't you see?

567
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,280
A little jealous? Just a bit?

568
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,000
Jealous, my ass!
Don't you think it's strange?

569
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,960
Your dad and his deal with Lars.
Bones, up in our business.

570
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,440
What the fuck is going on?
Why don't we know about it?

571
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,800
I was trying to find out,
until you came barging in.

572
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,440
Do you mind?

573
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,320
You don't want
to upset Daddy tonight, right?

574
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Come on.

575
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,520
Be a smart guy and fix this.

576
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,320
I like you jealous.

577
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,160
At least my daughter
has a good taste in music.

578
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,840
Oh, did she…

579
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,080
No, I meant the other one.
My other daughter. Crisi.

580
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,480
-You know her?
-No.

581
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,600
Boss.

582
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,880
I'm sorry about earlier.
I had a few drinks.

583
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,800
Sit down.

584
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,720
I've been thinking.
We should talk to our friends to find…

585
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,800
-What?
-The missing object.

586
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,920
-What object?
-Our girl, boss. To track her phone.

587
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,760
My daughter is not a missing person.

588
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,200
When the cops smell blood,
they start asking questions.

589
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,080
I don't need questions now
when there are millions at stake,

590
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,520
and my new life.

591
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,120
So you'd better find her for me.

592
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,240
Discreetly.

593
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,720
It's been a pleasure.

594
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,360
-Enjoy the evening.
-Thank you.

595
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,560
I can't do this.

596
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,720
You have to.

597
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,880
They're looking for her.

598
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,600
I don't think we have enough time.

599
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,080
