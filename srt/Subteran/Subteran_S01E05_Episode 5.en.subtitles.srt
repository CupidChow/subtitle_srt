1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,800
-Are you at the location?
-Five minutes, ma'am.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,440
Don't move the patient.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,800
Is your neighbor trustworthy?

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,560
Yes. He's a friend of the family.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,800
They know who I am.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,200
So they know that it wasn't me in that…

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,440
in that car.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,280
-They took my boy.
-If she wanted, she would have hurt him.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,960
-We need to wait--
-Wait for what?

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,200
You think I can wait and do nothing?

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,040
Their big deal is in two days.
They'll hold him as insurance--

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,920
You're obsessed. You've been saying
"two days" for five days now.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,880
We take care of Doroteea first.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,680
Then we figure out
how to get Matei back, okay?

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,000
Did you find her?

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,880
I found something even better.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,320
I put him to sleep.

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,200
So she'll come to us.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,880
How are you feeling?

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,880
Alone.

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,560
MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,480
Doroteea Serbu, 72 years old, head trauma.

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,800
Glasgow score 15, pulse 80.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,440
Last blood pressure, 110 over 60,
saturation 97.

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,600
The doctor on call
has all the necessary information.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,200
Room two.

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
I'll have to ask you to wait here.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Where have you been?

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Sorry…

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,840
What's wrong? Where's Matei?

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,920
-You have to tell me so I can help.
-Cornel.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,680
I know you've always been by our side.

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,080
Since Dad died,
we could always count on you.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,400
But you need to let me handle this.
You have questions, but I can't.

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,200
You have to tell me so I can help you.
I know some people.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,680
For now, I need you
to take care of my mother. Please.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,440
All right.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,720
Thanks.

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,640
How are you?

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,160
How the hell do you think?

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't know how my mother is,
or where my son is…

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,040
At least I have this.

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,240
When will they know
they can't get the money?

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,840
As soon as they try to log in
on the Compaq.

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,440
If they hurt him,
they won't get that money.

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
She has a subdural hematoma
from the trauma.

47
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,280
The doctor doesn't think
there's time for further tests.

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,000
If he doesn't operate quickly,
her brain function might be affected.

49
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,600
What do you mean? Paralysis or…

50
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
Or she might die?

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,480
They need to reduce
the pressure on the brain.

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,360
If he operates on her now,
everything will be all right.

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,640
Please read and sign this.

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,520
We need your consent
in case anything happens.

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,720
Everything they did to her, we do to him.

56
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,400
Who, Bones?

57
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,960
The boy.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,720
You wanna kill him?

59
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,920
And set him on fire while she watches.

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
We have no proof.

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,320
When we do, we tell your dad.
Until then, your sister's alive.

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,600
Only she's not alive anymore.

63
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,960
And why is she not alive?

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,600
How did she end up there?

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,120
She overheard me talking to your dad.
She wanted some action.

66
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,560
She asked to go with Bones.

67
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,280
So it was her idea?

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,320
You sure it wasn't your idea?

69
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,400
I told you, she wanted to.

70
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,120
And you let her walk all over you.

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,600
Did you like her too?

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,400
Say what?

73
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,200
It's no big deal if you did.

74
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,120
After all, she and I are the same, right?

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,680
He'll walk in on us.

76
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,880
This means we're in the wrong place.

77
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,360
Get undressed!

78
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,600
Yes.

79
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,800
Come on.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,080
No point in fretting.

81
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,560
They said it'll be
another three hours. Sit down.

82
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,880
-I hate this sense of helplessness.
-I know the feeling.

83
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,480
-Thanks.
-Cami, calm down.

84
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,720
You know the feeling too?

85
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,800
You both know the feeling. You have kids
and you've been through this already?

86
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,160
You have no clue.

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
We just want to help.

88
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,360
If you want to help,
Cornel, go get some clothes for Mom.

89
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,080
She'll need them after surgery.

90
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Thanks.

91
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,960
I'm going to need a laptop.
I have to be ready when they call.

92
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,320
-I don't want to leave you alone.
-Please, do this thing for me.

93
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,040
They won't find us anytime soon,
but they'll call.

94
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,200
-How do you know that?
-I just know.

95
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,600
EMERGENCY ROOM

96
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,400
Why did you get her involved?

97
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,960
She killed Crisi Tănase. I had no choice.

98
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,080
What does she know?

99
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't worry. She doesn't know about you.

100
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,400
Good. Keep it that way.

101
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,440
Tănase?

102
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,680
He got Bank's laptop back.

103
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,360
Cami says it's encrypted.
He can't get the money without her.

104
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,800
-The problem--
-Is that he's got Matei.

105
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,960
He'll want to trade him
for the money in two days, tops.

106
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Why?

107
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,800
He's got a big deal coming.

108
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,880
We can catch him red-handed.

109
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,400
The boy changes everything.

110
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
He must be the priority.

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,520
Why is that?

112
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,200
Is he yours?

113
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,600
-I thought you cared about them.
-Precisely because I care…

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,840
That's why I want to get Tănase.

115
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,080
She thinks she can manage,
but she's way in over her head.

116
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,280
If she arranges an exchange,
we need to be there

117
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,600
and somehow bring the cops

118
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,360
to arrest Tănase
for blackmail and kidnapping.

119
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,080
And? Is this better?

120
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,600
Instead of catching him doing
a drug deal worth a few million euros?

121
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,560
-I don't know.
-You don't--

122
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,000
But if we have a chance, let's take it.

123
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,880
-We don't have a cop we can trust.
-We might. Ion Tatu.

124
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,760
He was my professor at the Academy.
But he didn't recognize me.

125
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,280
And he wasn't on Bank's list.

126
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,760
Where is it? Do you have the list?

127
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,480
I only took a picture of it
from the laptop.

128
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,240
But we have it.
I mean, Cami has access to it.

129
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,520
I get why you got her involved.

130
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,960
But I hope you know that there's a risk.

131
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
NO CALLER ID

132
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,240
You called Superintendent Tatu's phone.
Golescu speaking.

133
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,280
Good evening, Mr. Golescu.

134
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,160
Who am I speaking to?

135
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,400
I'm Ion's father.

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
I wanted to talk to him.

137
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,040
Mr. Tatu, Ion was caught up
in a shooting at the precinct

138
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,560
and suffered a coronary spasm. He's fine.

139
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,200
I still have his phone.

140
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,760
Carmen can tell you more.
He's at home. He's resting.

141
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,800
Yes, I'll call their landline.

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,920
Thank you, sir.

143
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,920
Come on, Vali. It's late.

144
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,800
Working overtime?

145
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,040
Way to go. How can I reach Tatu's parents?
I want to let them know.

146
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,240
I know his father is dead.

147
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,720
His mom is still alive… I don't know,
I'll check if I can find her number.

148
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
Did you find the guy
from the hotel footage?

149
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,760
Yes and no. It's strange.

150
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,680
Here, it looks like he's a cop.

151
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,320
TIMIȘOARA POLICE ACADEMY
CLASS OF 2009

152
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
But there's no M. Roman in our database.

153
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,120
Roman?

154
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,440
Either this guy was doing
deepfakes ten years ago,

155
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,600
or someone wiped his info.

156
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
But why?

157
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,440
I used to know a Roman. Ex-cop.
Dismissed after a year.

158
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So he got mad and switched teams?

159
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,400
-Should we release his name?
-Leave it.

160
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,480
Two dead cops. My superior will kill me
if the press finds out about this one.

161
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
Let's keep this between us, okay?

162
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
-How was the surgery?
-The doctor says it went well.

163
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,360
You can relax now.

164
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,600
Thank you so much.

165
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,560
I don't want to get in your way.

166
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,360
-Easy there. Easy.
-You're Roman.

167
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,960
-I recognize you.
-Easy. We're here to talk.

168
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Ion, you should be in bed.
I could have answered the door.

169
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,440
If I hadn't given you the pills,
you wouldn't be here now.

170
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,440
It's okay. I got this.

171
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,640
I know you too.

172
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,600
Yes, you do.

173
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,960
Prosecutor Cornel Zisu. Former prosecutor.

174
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,840
We worked together a while ago.

175
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,600
-Who is it?
-Work colleauges. You don't know them.

176
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,080
Go back to bed. It's all right.

177
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
At this time of night… colleagues!

178
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,600
A prosecutor…

179
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,280
Well, former prosecutor.

180
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,880
-With the most wanted man in Bucharest?
-He works for me.

181
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,080
He's been undercover
in Tănase's gang for a year.

182
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,360
Undercover? You're not an agent.
Neither is he.

183
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,040
No, wait. Roman used to be.

184
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,640
He was dismissed after ratting out
a guy that was on Tănase's payroll.

185
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,800
Really, does anyone in the police
know about this operation?

186
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,840
Whatever this is?

187
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,080
Could we risk that?

188
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,280
Tănase has many cops on his payroll.

189
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,880
He does? How do you know I'm not included?

190
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,800
Calm down! I'm just getting my phone.

191
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,080
Bank. His accountant.

192
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,520
Had a full list on his laptop.

193
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,080
You weren't on it.

194
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,440
The laptop you came barging in for
last night at the precinct?

195
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,480
There shouldn't have been victims.

196
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,800
But Tănase's man got crazy.
Marian Negrescu. Dracu.

197
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,880
Okay. What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

198
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,800
Tănase has a big deal coming up.

199
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,240
It's our best chance to get him.

200
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,800
We need a cop we can trust
to make the arrest.

201
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,040
MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL

202
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,480
Mommy?

203
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,600
Mom!

204
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,520
-Cami?
-Yes.

205
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,400
You…

206
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,960
-You're here. Alive.
-Yes.

207
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,760
-You're alive, Mom. Thank God!
-What happened?

208
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,280
Matei…

209
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,520
A woman came…

210
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,440
Forget about her. Try to relax.

211
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,200
She attacked me, that bitch!

212
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,600
Listen.

213
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Cami.

214
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,520
The cops were saying that…

215
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,800
Cami, are you in trouble?

216
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,160
Yes.

217
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,000
But someone is helping me.

218
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,080
A cop.

219
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,560
We're almost out of the woods.

220
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,640
And you trust this guy?

221
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
I don't know.

222
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,080
EMERGENCY ROOM

223
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,800
Oh, good.

224
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,280
Thanks.

225
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,560
Doroteea.

226
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,200
-Ouch!
-I'm sorry.

227
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,920
How are you feeling?

228
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,600
Like I drank a whole bottle
of that plum brandy of yours.

229
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,760
Who's the gentleman?

230
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,400
Marius. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Serbu.

231
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,400
He's the cop I told you about.

232
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,600
Mr. Marius.

233
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,080
If I knew I'd have guests,

234
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,000
I would have done something to my hair.

235
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,680
Any sign yet?

236
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
Not yet.

237
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,160
You look better like this.

238
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,160
I can't believe we did it here.

239
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,160
It didn't seem to bother you last night.

240
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,920
If your dad finds out,
our necks will be bothered by knives.

241
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,720
With you, he'd start somewhere else.

242
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,920
Chill. Even if he finds out,

243
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,600
it will be after he receives the shipment.

244
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,640
When we have the drugs,
we'll be riding the wave.

245
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,320
He'll be under it.

246
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,600
Tili!

247
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,560
We don't tell him about Crisi.

248
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,000
Not yet.

249
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,200
Look at this!

250
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
I still get presents for my birthday.

251
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,520
I've been a good boy.

252
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,840
Early bird. Employee of the month.

253
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,800
You came just in time.
I want my money back.

254
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,280
CALL

255
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,160
-Boss, we got it, but there's a problem.
-What the fuck is this?

256
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,560
A phone number.

257
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,760
I know it's a phone number.

258
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,880
Why the fuck do I have to call it?

259
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,920
-Temper! Take it easy.
-Shitty hacker.

260
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
Sonia, Bones's girl.

261
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,640
They want to take your money.
But it's all right. We're covered.

262
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Okay.

263
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,680
Hello.

264
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,720
-Hello!
-Hello.

265
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,600
-Everything all right?
-Yes.

266
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
The doctor wants another CAT scan.

267
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,120
-Why?
-Okay.

268
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,000
If it's okay, you can go home.

269
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,400
-I'm fine.
-Yes.

270
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,040
Yes, I'm doing fine. I'm talking, eating.

271
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,800
-I'm laughing.
-Good.

272
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,760
-Yes.
-Mom, we'll be here, okay?

273
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,880
Yes, I'll do all the CAT scans.
And then we go home.

274
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,280
Don't show them the key.
Let them ask about it.

275
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,120
Don't give them a time, a place.
Let them pick.

276
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,080
-And then we'll give them ours.
-Okay. Cornel.

277
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
You'd better leave.

278
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,000
If you stay,
don't say a word no matter what.

279
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,720
I'm going to keep him talking
to find his location.

280
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,920
Who am I speaking to?

281
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,520
The guy that has your son's life
in his hands.

282
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,640
Well, I'm holding your life in my hands.

283
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,760
Well, in that case,
maybe we can help each other.

284
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,160
I want to see him first.

285
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,000
He's right here. We're good friends now.

286
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,120
Switch to video.

287
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,280
You gave me a run for my money,
Miss Sonia.

288
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
You didn't strike me as a thief.

289
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,680
You fooled me.

290
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,560
And not many people do that.

291
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,240
We're even.
You fucked up my life big time.

292
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,200
I want to see Matei.

293
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,360
-Mom?
-Matei, baby!

294
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,200
It'll be okay.
I'm coming to get you. I promise.

295
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,800
I promise. Matei…

296
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,040
Good. I showed you mine.
Now, you show me yours.

297
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
Where is my money?

298
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,600
You tell me now,
or I'll send him home in pieces.

299
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,840
You need this.

300
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,560
Without it, you can't access the crypto.

301
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,760
We'll trade.

302
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,240
I give you the key, you give me my boy.

303
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,840
And then we go about our lives.

304
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,680
Listen, what does the kid like to eat?

305
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
If it's a special occasion, pizza.

306
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,640
I think this is
a pretty special one, don't you?

307
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,520
Okay.

308
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,840
Keep your phone charged and turned on.

309
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll get your boy a pizza.

310
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,280
If you try to screw me,

311
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,720
it'll be a very special pizza.

312
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,680
-No.
-Because it'll be his last.

313
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,160
No. I--

314
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,480
Did you manage to locate him?

315
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,480
No.

316
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,320
FOUND HIM

317
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,960
Boss, we found them.

318
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,560
What are you waiting for?

319
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,400
Get Tili and bring me that bitch
with that fucking key. Go!

320
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,000
How are you doing?

321
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,040
At least he doesn't know about…

322
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,280
Crisi.

323
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,840
-Is this live from his place?
-Yes.

324
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,680
-And on the inside?
-No.

325
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,480
He only has them outside for intruders.

326
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,680
But we know
that's where he's keeping Matei.

327
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,400
Let's see where he is.

328
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,320
In Snagov.

329
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,000
We need a plan.

330
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,720
Where the hell are they going?

331
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,480
-Hello, madam.
-Hello, Mr. Prosecutor.

332
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,400
How is he?

333
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,840
He's better today. Please, come in.

334
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,000
Thank you.

335
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,680
They sent you home?

336
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,600
Don't get up.

337
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,960
Yes, it was a small attack.

338
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,000
Panic attack?

339
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,000
No, it was a heart attack,
but, as you can see, not a serious one.

340
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,640
-I brought your phone.
-Thank you.

341
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,840
Did it help? Did you find evidence on it?

342
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,280
Your father called.

343
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,720
Yesterday.

344
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,280
Really?

345
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,520
He was really worried.
In fact, we all were.

346
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,560
That's how Dad is. Always worried.
You know how old people are.

347
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,880
We went on with the investigation.

348
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,440
We're now looking for that guy
in Luca's picture.

349
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,520
-The one you were looking into.
-And? I didn't find him in the database.

350
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,080
Nicknamed Bones.
He's one of Tănase's guys.

351
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
He was at the hotel that night.

352
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,120
He's our prime suspect.

353
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,320
I think Luca was trying to get Tănase.

354
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,040
I have a different theory, boss.
Take a look.

355
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,400
We have a new lead.

356
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,440
The woman at the hotel.

357
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
Seen near the crime scenes.

358
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,200
Here.

359
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,480
She takes off her wig.

360
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Where is it from?

361
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,600
The boys collected CCTV footage
from all the cameras in the area.

362
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,040
This one came in today.

363
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,440
So our killer is one of Tănase's twins.

364
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,480
I heard that one of them didn't show up
for her father's birthday party.

365
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,800
I'll see what I can find out.

366
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,920
-Get well soon.
-God willing.

367
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,560
MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL

368
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Let's go!

369
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,880
They said she's okay.

370
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,760
Just wait for me
to bring the discharge papers.

371
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,240
We signed them.

372
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,840
I need to give you a copy. It's protocol.

373
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,920
My bosses insist on that.

374
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,120
Please, excuse me.

375
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,600
-It's okay, right?
-Yes.

376
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,600
Let me get out first.

377
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,880
You downstairs?
Did you use the entrance I told you?

378
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,200
Yeah, I'm downstairs.

379
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,040
What floor?

380
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,000
The elevator to the second floor.
Then the stairs. Room 12.

381
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,560
Who was that on the phone?

382
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,320
Tell me!

383
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,120
RECENT CALLS
DRACU

384
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,640
Where are they?

385
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
-What is it?
-They're coming.

386
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,120
Sit him down.

387
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,960
-What did you do to him?
-Come on! We're leaving.

388
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,800
-Now!
-Where?

389
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,200
-What's going on?
-Come on!

390
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,240
-Who are you knitting for, ma'am?
-For my granddaughter.

391
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,280
Good health to her. God willing.

392
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,040
-What?
-Come. The stairs.

393
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,600
-Did you take the laptop?
-Yes.

394
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,520
No, let's go this way. Come on.

395
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,400
Sit here.

396
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,640
-Fuck this!
-Those motherfuckers!

397
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,080
What are you looking at?

398
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,320
Come on!

399
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,240
Come on!

400
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,040
-Come on!
-They're coming!

401
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,680
-I feel sick!
-Easy.

402
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,160
I'll meet you outside.

403
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,200
Come on!

404
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,080
ECO-FRIENDLY CLEANING

405
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,280
God fucking dammit! No!

406
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,720
-Fucking motherfuckers!
-Fuck this shit!

407
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,200
Hi, Boss. From the Morgue.
We identified the burnt corpse.

408
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,400
We couldn't even get DNA samples.

409
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,800
It was very badly burnt.

410
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,480
As you know, our first hypothesis was
that it was the vehicle's owner.

411
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,800
-Camelia Serbu.
-Who is it?

412
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,840
We finally got the right dental records
for comparison…

413
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,160
It's not her. So?

414
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,920
So we thought outside the box.

415
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,560
We identified a partial serial number

416
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,680
on a piece of platinum jewelry
that the victim was wearing.

417
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,560
We looked for the store that sold it.
We found the buyer.

418
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,000
Who is it?

419
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,480
So we got a name which--

420
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,640
Which led you to the dental record.

421
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,400
Cristina Nicoleta Tănase.

422
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,880
Thanks.

423
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,000
Camelia Serbu is alive.
She was the lawyer.

424
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,960
Find her. Bring her in for questioning.

425
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,160
Come on.

426
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
Easy.

427
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,520
Come on. This way.

428
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,240
-Come on.
-Stairs.

429
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,720
Come on… There you go.

430
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,160
Come on.

431
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,960
-How is she?
-Okay.

432
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,480
I hope she'll sleep.

433
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,920
Maybe you should rest too.

434
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,160
That's what I'm in the mood for,
when my son is with--

435
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,320
-Cami--
-No.

436
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,040
I'm sick of hearing
that it's going to be okay.

437
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,600
Someone came to their house.

438
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,440
Who could it be?

439
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,280
Oh, I know him!

440
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,760
He was with Luca's boss
when he took my statement.

441
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,800
Golescu.

442
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,600
Prosecutor Golescu.

443
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,240
Maybe he'll find Matei.

444
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I have some news.

445
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,840
And it's not good.

446
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,600
I'm sorry, Nicu.

447
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,560
Who was it?

448
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,080
All the clues point to Luca Voinea's
partner, Camelia Serbu.

449
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,880
I still have some pieces to put together,
but she was working with one of yours.

450
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,720
Do you have a photo?

451
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,280
There wasn't much left…

452
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,280
to work with.

453
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,320
A photo of the cop's girlfriend.

454
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,200
And one more thing.

455
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,320
He's with your guys, right?

456
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
He's…

457
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,400
I have reason to believe
that he's an undercover cop. Or ex-cop.

458
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,080
He has a bone to pick with you.

459
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,200
Go now.

460
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,800
Go!

461
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,760
What's he doing? He's leaving?

462
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,200
No. Go back!

463
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,080
Matei is in there. Go back!

464
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,080
-Can we talk to him somehow?
-No.

465
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,080
-No. I'll call the police--
-Cami.

466
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
-Cami!
-What?

467
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,360
He's leaving because he works for Tănase.

468
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,360
I'm sorry, boss.

469
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,880
They got away.

470
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,720
Tănase wouldn't bring his business home.
He'll find another way.

471
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,080
Look. He has some sources in Bucharest
that can organize this for him.

472
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,800
What the hell is he waiting for?
He needs this money tomorrow.

473
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,480
Even with a different hacker,
he doesn't have the decoder.

474
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,720
Why didn't he call? Something's off.

475
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,200
He's humiliated. Nobody's put him
with his back against the wall like Cami.

476
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,200
Doesn't his reaction scare you?

477
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,320
That's why we're checking his offices,
his access, his buildings…

478
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,440
We're making a plan, just in case.
We're so close.

479
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,880
What's wrong with you, Marius?

480
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,360
It's different now.

481
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,040
A child's life is at stake.

482
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,320
Did you forget our mission?
Should I remind you?

483
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
No, tell me!

484
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,200
What is your mission?

485
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,040
So you know each other. And you…
What? You were planning this all along?

486
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
-Behind my back?
-No…

487
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,480
Which one of you
got Luca involved in this?

488
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,600
Who are you really? Who are you, Cornel?

489
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,680
Our family friend that we're counting on?

490
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,680
And you? Who are you?

491
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,280
Zisu and I…
We've known each other for a long time.

492
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,880
-He was my professor at the Academy.
-I recruited him.

493
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,440
I was following Tănase for years
with nothing to show for it.

494
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,480
He got inside last year. We're close.

495
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,640
-Now you can catch him.
-Yes.

496
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,080
Great! And the bait is my nine year old?

497
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,640
-No, this--
-He's the bait.

498
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,120
You think that you've infiltrated
his family? That you're destroying it?

499
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,600
Wrong, my friends!
You have infiltrated my family.

500
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,560
You're destroying us. You're fighting
my mother, Luca, myself, and my son!

501
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,080
And one of us is dead already.
For what? To catch a crook?

502
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,600
I couldn't care less about your crooks!

503
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,040
This country is full of them,
but nobody cares!

504
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,440
He's no ordinary crook.

505
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,880
No? What changes with his arrest?
Good luck with your mission!

506
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,800
He killed Doru.

507
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,200
What?

508
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,440
Tănase killed your father.

509
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,920
My father died
in a car crash chasing that dirtbag--

510
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,640
No car crash. That was the cover-up.

511
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,680
That's Tănase's MO,
but nobody could prove it.

512
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,080
That's how he got away again.

513
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,080
Thanks for dragging my father
into this as well.

514
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,240
-Come on--
-The only one missing from this plot.

515
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,680
I don't believe you anymore!
I don't believe either of you!

516
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Missions, objectives, and all that crap!

517
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,480
-Cami--
-I'm going to get Matei.

518
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
Cami. Cami.

519
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,880
Cami!

520
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,800
Stolen vehicle, Ilfov 20,
Romeo, Alpha, Whiskey.

521
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,560
Heading towars Splaiul Unirii.

522
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,520
What do we have?

523
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,040
Dark-haired woman. About 30 years old.

524
