1
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,600
Don't answer.

2
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,880
It's Mom!

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,240
My mom, she's with my boy!
I have to let them know I'm okay.

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,720
Please!

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,080
Two days.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,920
They must think that you're dead
for two more days.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,160
That's all I'm asking.

8
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,920
36 HOURS EARLIER…

9
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
My love?

10
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,040
I'm sorry. I'm super late.
Can you please go and--

11
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,200
Pick up Matei?

12
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes. Pick up Matei from school.

13
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,360
See? We complete each other.
I keep telling you…

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,240
Okay, then. Thank you.
Kisses. I have to go in.

15
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,520
-See you!
-Wait a minute! When do you get home?

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,400
No! I'll be there
at six o'clock, tops. Promise.

17
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,400
Okay, then. Hugs and kisses. Bye.

18
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
"Hugs and kisses." What the hell?

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,480
It pisses her off.

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,280
Only her? It's really gross!

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,520
See? Two birds with one stone.
It's efficient.

22
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,200
Come on. He's waiting.

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,000
Camelia Sârbu, IT consultant.

24
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,200
What's the problem?

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,960
I was hoping you would tell me.

27
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,080
THE NATIONAL AGENCY
FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

28
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,080
Look here. This is why you have
a slow internet connection.

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
Who is Alina?

30
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,680
Alina is the lady with the red hair,
over there.

31
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,880
Look here! She's downloading
Game of Thrones, all eight seasons, in 4K.

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,800
There's also a gentleman here
who is watching porn.

33
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Also in 4K. I'll let you guess who.

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,280
It's Leftimoaie.
The one in the gray shirt.

35
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,960
Well… at least you know who to fire now.

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,920
That's not how it works here.

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,400
I know another way.

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,920
I'm listening.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, we're on it.

40
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,760
Yes, we'll be quick about it. I promise.

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,920
Yes, sir.

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,400
Guys, it's just petty medicine theft.

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,840
It's over 100 pounds, boss.

44
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,000
It doesn't matter!

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,680
If my two best guys
can't even come up with anything…

46
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,920
I have to handle the victims,
the insurance, the prosecutor.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,920
BONES

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,120
We have 70 hours
of surveillance camera footage.

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
You want me to wait that long?

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,800
If I'm bothering
and you need to get that, be my guest.

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,520
No. Sorry, boss.

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,520
It's the plumber. I have some issues.

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
What can I say, Luca?

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,440
Five minutes, boss. Five.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,320
-Why the hell do you keep calling?
-You don't answer.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,920
You're a cop. You answer when CI's call.
My ass is on the line.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,840
Didn't we say…

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,240
Here, in front of the precinct?
Come on. Follow me.

59
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,440
I hope this is worth it.

60
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,880
Tonight at 7:30 p.m. you need to see Bank.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,760
He's leaving Tănase. He'll talk,
but he wants Witness Protection.

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,400
Yeah? How about a massage?

63
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
It's not my call.

64
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,640
I've got bosses!
I have reports to write, approvals to get.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,080
Tonight is our only shot,
don't you get it?

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,440
Our? Our shot?

67
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,280
You'll get Tănase, don't you get it?

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,360
His distribution network,
his informers, his dirty guys.

69
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,240
Bank is his accountant.
He has papers, contacts.

70
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
He's giving you everything.

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,840
What's in it for you?

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,080
Forget about me. Tănase is my business.
Just leave it. It doesn't matter.

73
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,000
I've been on his ass for a long time.
He finally gave in.

74
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,880
-If we miss--
-No! Stop saying "we".

75
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,600
This is not our op.
It's all in your demented head.

76
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,840
What if it's real?

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,360
What if it's your chance
to stop being a lowly clerk

78
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,040
and fucking do something important?

79
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,280
Bucharest Grand, 7:30 p.m.
I'll text you the room number.

80
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,880
Hey!

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,560
What the hell?

82
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,160
If you screw me, I need to know
who to put the APB on.

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,360
Do I look like I want to screw you?

84
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,800
That's the problem. You do.

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,720
-Do you need anything else?
-Now.

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,840
Thank you.

87
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,760
-And tasty…
-Yo! Quiet!

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,360
-Who are these guys, Crisi?
-I got them for weddings.

89
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,320
They're not good.
People will pay them to stop, okay?

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,480
Get them out!

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,480
Yes, Daddy.

92
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,040
Keep an eye on that fat bastard.
Make sure he doesn't leave.

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,240
I'll send someone.

94
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
What's wrong, Dracu?

95
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,040
We have a problem, boss.

96
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
Yes, naturally.

97
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Why should I start my day with good news?
It's got to be trouble.

98
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,800
It's my destiny to have problems.
So how bad is it?

99
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,200
It's really bad.

100
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,840
I checked the accounts today.
There's nothing left.

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,840
Did it disappear into thin air?

102
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,000
There isn't a single bitcoin
in the accounts.

103
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,520
That bastard Bank transferred it
through a private network and cut me out.

104
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,800
Are you insane?

105
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,520
I just promised Lars
two million Euros in a week!

106
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,120
-Are we still doing that?
-Wait a second. Not "we"!

107
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,480
Me! I'm doing it! Okay?

108
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,480
You keep quiet and do the job.
That's what you do.

109
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,600
And don't you say a word to the girls.

110
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
You just focus on getting my money back.

111
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,600
On it. I got a guy at Bucharest Grand.
The fat bastard is there making a fuss.

112
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,360
-It'll get sorted.
-And my money?

113
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,880
Crypto is different.
He can't sell it for cash that easily.

114
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,000
What's that, crypto? What is it?

115
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,920
Crypto?

116
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,400
Come on, tell me! Isn't it money?

117
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,120
Didn't I buy it with money?
Didn't you tell me to?

118
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,360
Didn't you say
banks are for old farts and bozos?

119
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,760
You fucking idiot!

120
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,440
If you think you can run my business,
tell me how to get my money back.

121
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,080
It's in a crypto wallet.
We need his laptop.

122
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,680
So right now, how much money do I have?

123
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,640
Yo!

124
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,320
Come on. Move it!

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,440
Just our savings
and what's coming in from the street.

126
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,240
-Where's your sister?
-I thought you didn't care about her.

127
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,840
Last time I checked,
she was dancing on tables in a club.

128
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,000
If you need anything, I can help.

129
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,600
You're working on setting up
my birthday party, remember?

130
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,040
You're more help to me doing that.

131
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,200
Find Tili. Now.

132
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,280
So? Are we done?

133
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,320
-Yes, chief.
-Attagirl!

134
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,360
In I go…

135
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,640
-What is it?
-Don't you have anything for me?

136
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,120
Look how pretty it is.

137
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,880
You could drain the heavens,
and you'd still ask for more.

138
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,640
Always asking…

139
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,400
Have this. Good enough.

140
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,720
Just that, chief?

141
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,840
Come on, our families know each other.
We're kin.

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,360
You don't say. How are we friends?

143
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,480
You know my dad.

144
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Really? Who is he?

145
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,240
Nicolae Tănase.

146
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,640
He was mad because you didn't want to sign
for his casino in the Old City.

147
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,560
Don't worry. He'll work it out
with the guy replacing you.

148
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,400
Who's replacing me?

149
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,160
Nobody's replacing me, girlie.
Leave me alone…

150
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,840
Wanna bet?

151
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,240
You have a board meeting tomorrow.

152
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
Vote how you're supposed to.

153
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,000
Is that clear?

154
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,240
Do you miss me already?

155
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,040
-Did you take care of him?
-It's done.

156
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,920
We have another job for you.

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,080
Of course! He wouldn't call me himself.
He wants me to take care of his problems.

158
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,840
He says it's your kind of job.
See you later.

159
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,880
Okay, bye.

160
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,880
Come in.

161
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,600
It's settled for 7:30 p.m.

162
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,320
His name is Luca Voinea. He's an officer.

163
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,240
Couldn't you find someone higher up?

164
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,960
My stuff is premium.

165
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,440
The higher they are, the more likely
that they're bought by Tănase.

166
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,600
This Voinea, I trust him.

167
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,040
Tell him everything.
He'll send you to the right people.

168
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,720
Please understand
that I need one last party

169
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,200
before they start taking me
to courts and different dumps.

170
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
I made plans.

171
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,960
What plans?

172
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,400
Well, reading the Scripture.

173
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,120
Booze, some girls, some blow. Chaos!

174
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,920
What plans?

175
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,400
Don't go online and keep your head down
until the cop comes.

176
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,080
…we'll show you
what civil servants do at work.

177
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,080
CIVIL SERVANTS ILLEGALLY DOWNLOAD
AND MINE CRYPTO!

178
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,720
You're not going to believe it.
Some are mining bitcoin.

179
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,680
Others download whole TV shows

180
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,600
or are watching porn.

181
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,880
A source that wanted to publish…

182
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,120
Get it! No! Get…

183
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,880
Darn it! Come on!

184
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Sorry.

185
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,480
-Aim for the heart.
-I like to mess up their hands first.

186
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,840
It's not efficient.

187
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,720
To kill it,
you need to shoot it in the heart.

188
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,640
Come on! Go!

189
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,240
Hit it in the…

190
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,680
Hey! What did I say?

191
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,360
What week is this?

192
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,760
No-screens week?

193
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
And what's this?

194
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,480
Hey, wait!
He was really close to levelling up.

195
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,760
It'd be so nice if you'd
support me from time to time.

196
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,120
I can't be your mother too.

197
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,560
Bubu, go!

198
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,720
Go read your chapter. Go.

199
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,440
Right. Bye.

200
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,040
I'm sorry I'm late.
My day was really… blah!

201
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,080
Do you want some wine?

202
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,040
Not now. Later.
I have some stuff to do for work.

203
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,280
-Well, weren't you at work all day?
-Yes. One hour, two tops.

204
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,440
Okay. I'll save you a glass.

205
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Two.

206
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,520
Hey, didn't you have homework?

207
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
Weren't you in a hurry?

208
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,560
Bubu? Matei!

209
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,160
Listen. If you finish your math
and geography homework, just maybe…

210
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
BONES
DELUXE APPARTMENT

211
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,800
Maybe we forget about the no-screen week.

212
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,400
Good!

213
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,640
I'll put in a good word for you.

214
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,040
Come on! Pop! Go!

215
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
Maybe.

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,680
I read that online gaming
is really good for the brain.

217
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,040
-Yes. Science says that it helps develop--
-Some stuff.

218
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,000
So when you're buying him
those shooter games, you're actually--

219
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm helping him develop.

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The same way
I'm helping develop this relationship

221
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,720
that is getting more and more serious.

222
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,680
Well, I was also dead serious when I said…

223
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
that I'll think about that ring.

224
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,760
Oh, the ring. Good thing you mentioned it.
I need to get it back from the pawn shop.

225
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,080
Who is it?

226
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,880
Luca Voinea. Bones's friend.

227
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,680
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 18TH

228
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Is this one taken?

229
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,200
No. Have a seat.

230
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,880
Champagne, please.

231
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,360
Hello.

232
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,880
Don't worry. I'm alone.

233
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,680
Oh no. I'm meeting somebody.

234
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,120
Come on!

235
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,760
Bottoms up!

236
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Like a shot.

237
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,240
I want immunity, a new identity,
Witness Protection, the whole deal.

238
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,840
And don't keep me here.

239
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,120
I want something more tropical.
Like Thailand.

240
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,520
I want style.

241
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,040
You want style? Very well.

242
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,560
If you want five stars,
you'll get your five stars.

243
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,840
What I'm giving you is worth six stars.

244
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,360
A laptop that's worth ten million Euros.

245
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,640
Not that one.

246
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,480
This one.

247
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,160
Yeah. It's… much better.

248
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,320
You can't even use it for Solitaire.

249
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,840
That's the beauty of it.

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,520
It's impossible to hack.

251
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,000
There's no Wi-Fi.

252
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,560
It only works when connected to a desktop.

253
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,720
In here you'll find everything you need
to get Tănase.

254
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,400
I transferred all his bitcoin
into this hard-drive.

255
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,120
You can only access it
through this laptop.

256
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,800
And I encrypted the volume.

257
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,000
This is a decoder key.

258
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,680
It only works on this laptop.

259
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,240
To access the bitcoin, you need both,
so you better not lose it!

260
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,440
There's a folder on the hard drive
with some files.

261
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,440
There are names, dates, payments, details…

262
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,680
Dirty cops, politicians, and journalists,
bought by Tănase.

263
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,640
I named the folder "Corrupt Files".

264
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,560
Get it?

265
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
-Corrupt Files.
-Yeah. Brilliant.

266
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,880
I need a second opinion.

267
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
What's up?

268
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
What's up, baby?

269
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
I'm good.

270
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Hanging around. Reading a book.

271
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,960
I'm waiting for you.
You're still coming, right?

272
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Yes. It's just that I have something
to finish here.

273
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,680
But I need your opinion.

274
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
-Go ahead.
-Check this out.

275
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,400
Who's the hot chick?

276
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,520
Is she a cop?

277
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,160
She's my fiancée.

278
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,400
Really?

279
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,080
Whatever.

280
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,160
Not officially.

281
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,480
No, I'm… I'm all right. Really.

282
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,240
It's for your own good, believe me.

283
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,400
I know the guy. He's a pig.

284
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,840
No way!

285
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,080
That's a vintage Compaq.

286
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,440
-Jeez! Is it still working?
-Of course it is. I upgraded it.

287
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,920
The hard drive, the ports. All of it.
Hello, Miss. Nice to meet you.

288
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,200
-Good evening.
-So?

289
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,080
I love that this one was modular.
You could change the hardware.

290
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,640
See that little slot?

291
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,760
To the left.

292
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
There.

293
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,360
You could remove the floppy drive
and put a CD-ROM in instead.

294
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm waiting for a girl.

295
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,720
No. Stay here.

296
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,280
-Luca?
-Baby, hold on.

297
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,200
Yes.

298
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,720
Baby!

299
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,640
Go take a shower.
The gentleman was just leaving.

300
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,720
Come in.

301
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,760
I'll take the laptop to my bosses.
You should come with me. Now.

302
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
He walks to the ball and…

303
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,800
Luca!

304
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,920
Can you hear me?

305
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,080
The crowd is not pleased
after Turcu's error, and…

306
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,080
It's in!

307
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,600
Man… We're cursed, I tell you!

308
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,440
Our goalkeeper…

309
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,400
Hello!

310
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,200
The referee isn't interested…

311
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,440
Wait! You're not…

312
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,160
Okay, bye!

313
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,440
Come on!

314
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
-911, what's your emergency?
-Please, send an ambulance!

315
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,800
And a police car.
I think my boyfriend has been shot!

316
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,200
Where should we send it?

317
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,120
I don't know! He was…

318
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,720
Bucharest Grand Hotel. The Deluxe Suite.

319
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,200
I heard gunshots.

320
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,320
Mr. Chief Prosecutor, sir!

321
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,880
What do we know?

322
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,240
Horațiu Uncheșelu.
The room was under his name.

323
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,400
Bank?

324
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,040
-Tănase's accountant?
-He had his ID.

325
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,560
He was easy to identify.

326
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,000
Even with that bullet hole in his head.

327
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Now, the most probable scenario

328
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,280
is that the culprit

329
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,680
came out of the bathroom,
first shot Luca… I mean Agent Voinea.

330
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,960
One to the chest.
His gun is still in the holster.

331
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,480
He was caught by surprise.

332
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,520
Bank got killed by the same MO.
A single bullet to the forehead.

333
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,280
They might have used a silencer.

334
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,560
We have a laptop charger.

335
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,080
But there's no laptop in the apartment.
The culprit must have taken it.

336
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,520
There's one other thing. Cipri.

337
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
This thing.

338
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,880
Why did Bank carry this around?
Did he collect antiques?

339
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,160
We'll take it to IT.

340
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,600
And the security cameras?

341
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
We're getting everything now.

342
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,720
Amateurs don't use silencers.

343
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,680
No.

344
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,920
What the hell was Voinea doing here?

345
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,880
-Check his accounts and his apartment.
-Already on it.

346
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,720
-Any family?
-He has a girlfriend… had.

347
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,240
He died in the line of duty.

348
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,280
A hero.

349
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,920
Like your dad.

350
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,720
He died in a hotel
where he went by himself.

351
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,840
I told him, Mom! I warned him!

352
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,800
"Don't die! I'm not falling in love
until you promise me you won't die."

353
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,680
I know it's hard.

354
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,680
I know it hurts.

355
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,760
But you can't give up again.

356
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,360
Come on. Not now. Please.

357
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,400
Matei needs you to be strong.

358
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,800
-We'll tell him together tonight. Please.
-Yes.

359
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,920
But be strong.

360
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,000
My baby.

361
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,040
I need to speak with the guy
in charge of the investigation.

362
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,480
Yes, of course.

363
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,440
A KILLING JUST LIKE IN A HORROR MOVIE

364
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,360
"You can't even imagine!"
Those were the words of a police officer

365
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,400
investigating the crime scene
at the Grand Hotel,

366
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,280
when our reporters asked him
what was going on.

367
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,880
TWO BODIES WERE DISCOVERED LAST NIGHT

368
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,400
We still don't have a full picture
of the events that unfolded…

369
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,600
Daddy, did you see?

370
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,880
My sis went on a spree last night.

371
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,880
Well, Tili helped us big time.

372
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,360
She saved us once again.

373
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,880
And big time.

374
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,360
I only want to know one thing.
When do I get my money back?

375
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,320
Today.

376
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,280
Tili said she's seeing someone
for the laptop

377
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,760
and she'll bring it here later.

378
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,680
Okay.

379
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,920
You go see our people in town.

380
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,400
They should be ready to sell
as soon as the stuff comes off the truck.

381
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,400
You got it?

382
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,760
-Yes.
-Go.

383
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,320
Let's go see the footage.

384
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,080
Turn it around.

385
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,720
It's from the Grand Hotel.

386
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,920
That woman is around 5'5'' to 5'7''.

387
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,200
These are from the floor
where we found the bodies.

388
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,640
She was at the bar, with…

389
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,160
When the firemen came, they found her
sleeping in the bar's toilet.

390
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,760
An escort. She was going to a client.
In Bank's apartment.

391
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,880
The suspect drugged and replaced her.

392
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,720
But nothing explains
what Luca Voinea was doing there.

393
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,480
If I may… Excuse me.

394
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,920
We went to his place.

395
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,680
It was clean.

396
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,640
We didn't find drugs or money.

397
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,000
Nothing strange in his accounts.

398
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,440
Either he was there
to get on Tănase's payroll,

399
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,320
or he was trying to turn Bank on his boss.

400
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,200
If it's the second one,

401
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,680
how did they make contact?

402
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,280
Why didn't he report it?

403
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,840
And the laptop?

404
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,520
IT said it's going
to take a while. Dobrescu.

405
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Ioan Dobrescu, from IT. Hello.

406
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,120
That brick is 30 years old.
I need to find the right cables.

407
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,080
They don't make them anymore.
I'll look around. I'm on it.

408
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,120
Voinea's girlfriend.

409
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,040
Hey!

410
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,160
Are you crazy?

411
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,480
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

412
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
I'm coming too.

413
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,440
No way. I've got stuff to do.

414
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,080
I'll take you back.

415
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
How's my sister?

416
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,200
I mean your girlfriend?

417
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,000
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Like hell you don't.

418
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,120
What? Did she fuck your brains out?

419
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,000
You think I'm stupid enough to do that?

420
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,720
You think I'm that stupid not to notice?

421
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,000
What would Daddy say?

422
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,160
I just want some action.

423
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,920
Show me what you do all day.

424
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,400
Come on. One day. That's it.

425
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,640
Buckle up.

426
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,600
I was on a video call with him…

427
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,760
when it happened.

428
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,880
The woman that killed him was blonde

429
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,040
and had a big snake tattoo on her chest.

430
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,240
Her?

431
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,200
Yes.

432
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,920
Yes, that's her.

433
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,200
-Do you know who she is?
-We're working on it.

434
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,760
So Luca called you…

435
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Yes.

436
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,560
They had a really old computer,

437
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,320
a Compaq laptop,
and they wanted to know more about it.

438
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,320
-Do you work in computers?
-Yes.

439
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,920
I have a small IT company.

440
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,600
The laptop belonged to the guy
Lucas was with.

441
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,120
He was really proud
of the upgrade he did.

442
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,200
Who was that guy?

443
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,400
He was part of a very dangerous gang.

444
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,120
Do you know why Luca was seeing him?

445
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,560
No.

446
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,440
Do you?

447
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,440
He didn't make any prior report.

448
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,480
Which is unusual.

449
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,240
Luca named you his next of kin.

450
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,640
These are his things.

451
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,560
We're keeping the phone for now.

452
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,920
There might be something helpful
for our investigation.

453
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,480
Thank you.

454
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,360
It's Bones.

455
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,760
-What's up, man?
-What's up?

456
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
We have company.

457
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,280
You don't say?

458
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,040
If you want a drink, help yourself.
You know what to do.

459
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,400
-Did he say anything about me?
-He said you sing well.

460
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,560
-That's it?
-Yeah.

461
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,480
Who's this?

462
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,160
-Bones. He's one of ours.
-Hello.

463
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,760
Crisi Tănase.

464
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,480
Why "Bones"?

465
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,800
He offed some guy and threw him in acid.

466
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,600
But he didn't break the bones,
so he was caught.

467
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,640
-And the sentence?
-Eight years. Spain.

468
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,760
Well, now he knows
what to do with the bones.

469
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,400
You live and learn.

470
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,400
Yo! The boss wants to talk to us.

471
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,920
Yo!

472
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,920
Get out of here! Don't let him see you.

473
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,280
Is it working?

474
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,840
Yes, it's okay.

475
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,280
Come on, Dracu. I'm in a hurry.

476
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,440
Is everybody there?

477
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,320
Yes, boss.

478
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,960
I have a problem to solve.
We retrieved a laptop last night.

479
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,240
But it was the wrong one.

480
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,440
The right one is in the evidence room.
Here's the plan.

481
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,160
I'll talk to my guy on the inside.
He'll get it out, and you go pick it up.

482
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,560
Are you sure it's a good idea?

483
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,280
Who's that?

484
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,240
Me.

485
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,920
Who in the fuck are you?

486
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,240
Boss, he's…

487
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,920
We call him Bones. You know him. He--

488
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,120
The one that took care of The Baron?

489
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,560
Yes, that's right.

490
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,760
Since you took care of a body for me,
you think you can make fun of me?

491
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,120
Oh, no! I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for it to sound like that, but…

492
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Here's what I'm thinking.

493
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,440
I don't know why you want the laptop.
I guess there's something on it.

494
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,800
You can call a cop
and have him take it out.

495
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,600
But if I were that guy,
I'd wonder why you need it.

496
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,120
I would first check what's on it.
And that might give me something on you.

497
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,240
What do you think, Dracu?

498
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,760
If Bank used it for what I think he did,
it's kind of a bomb.

499
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,520
Okay.

500
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,880
We get it back ourselves.

501
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,320
I don't know how, but you will.
That's what I pay you for.

502
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Until then, search the cop's apartment.

503
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,160
Find out what he was doing with Bank.

504
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
What did he know? Who did he tell?

505
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,480
-Bones, you're on it.
-Yes, boss.

506
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,720
Dracu, you take to the streets.

507
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,200
Go to the pimps and dealers.

508
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,480
We need cash
until we get the fucking laptop back.

509
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,400
Yes, boss.

510
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,360
Come on.

511
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,840
-I'm coming with you.
-No way.

512
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,880
Then I'm coming with you.

513
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,200
Out of order.

514
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,080
OUT OF ORDER

515
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
ROMANIAN POLICE
POLICE ID

516
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,120
What's your Insta handle?

517
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,880
Are you following me?

518
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,040
I'm not into that Instagram stuff or…

519
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,280
Well, you should be.
I'm on all the networks.

520
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,840
That's how you know
what your friends are up to.

521
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,560
You socialize.

522
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Crisi.

523
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,920
Everyone I know is in prison for murder.

524
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,920
So I kind of know what they're up to.

525
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,240
Jesus!

526
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,760
You're really no fun at all.

527
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,800
CAMI, I LOVE YOU. LUCA

528
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,360
I'm going in alone.
You wait outside. Understand?

529
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,600
Do you understand
that I'm your boss's daughter?

530
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,960
So spare me from your orders.

531
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,840
Come on already.

532
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,760
When we're done, take me to church.
I need to see the priest.

533
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,320
Can I help you?

534
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,480
We wanted to express our sympathy
for Luca. We worked together--

535
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,480
-And friends. He always talked about you.
-Really?

536
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,520
And what did he say?

537
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,720
Wait. Are you his sister or his lover?

538
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,600
Anyway, don't worry.
He spoke nicely about both.

539
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,600
-Luca didn't have relatives.
-Look, sorry… Wait.

540
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,760
We're sorry.

541
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,880
We don't want to harm you.

542
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,920
Again, we don't want to harm you.

543
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,920
We just want to talk.

544
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,320
I'll take my hand off.
Please, don't scream.

545
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,240
Okay?

546
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,680
-What's your name?
-What's yours?

547
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,000
Why are you here?

548
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,960
I want to know what happened to Luca.
Why he was killed.

549
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,400
It's obvious.

550
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,000
He was working with Bank.

551
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,280
Tell us, baby girl.

552
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,560
-Who else knew that he was seeing Bank?
-The woman that killed him knew for sure.

553
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,880
How do you know it was a woman?

554
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,840
Because I saw her.

555
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,800
I saw everything.

556
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,400
Oops.

557
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,280
We have witnesses.

558
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,720
Eyewitnesses even.

559
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,800
Tell me, doc.
What do we do in this situation?

560
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,600
-Crisi.
-No! Please!

561
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,240
-Wait.
-Please, no! I have a kid! Please!

562
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,480
Maybe your father wants to see her.

563
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,120
Maybe I can do stuff
without my Dad's permission.

564
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,040
My dad was a cop.

565
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,000
So was my boyfriend.
I know how to defend myself!

566
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,280
-Wait. Let's talk.
-Yes, you'll be talking to the cops.

567
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,920
No! If you call the cops, we're both dead.

568
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,880
Surely before we see
the inside of a courthouse.

569
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,840
I was working with Luca.
Someone set a trap for him yesterday.

570
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,280
The girl that you killed is the daughter
of a very dangerous crime boss.

571
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,000
Nicolae Tănase.
He's got cops on his payroll.

572
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,680
What the fuck are you saying?

573
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,560
We were trying to find out
who Tănase's mole is in the police.

574
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,200
If they managed to get to Luca,
you can be sure we're next.

575
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,280
Luca would've wanted me to protect you.

576
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,880
If the cops come through that door,
I can't do that.

577
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,840
-Show me her chest.
-What?

578
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
Show me what's on her chest! Now!

579
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,520
I knew it.

580
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,920
She killed Luca.

581
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,240
You're in grave danger.

582
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,000
You need to disappear.

583
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,480
What do you mean disappear?

584
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
You need to die.

585
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,720
I mean, people need to think you're dead.

586
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,120
I need 48 hours, tops,
and I can protect you and your family.

587
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,720
But you need to do exactly
what I tell you.

588
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,720
Why should I believe you?

589
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,880
I could've killed you seconds ago.

590
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
But I didn't.

591
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,480
I just killed someone.

592
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,240
I just killed someone.

593
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,640
What did I tell you?

594
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,680
To wait for me naked and with a hard cock.

595
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,040
We need to talk about something.

596
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,360
Not now. Later.

597
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,200
Crisi has lost her mind.

598
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,720
She thinks she's in an action movie.

599
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,840
And she knows about us.

600
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,280
Fuck my stupid sister too!

601
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,040
I have a safe place.

602
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,360
You can sleep there.

603
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,800
And then we pick up where Luca left off.

604
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,720
Get it through your head.
From now on, you're dead.

605
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,800
May God forgive you. Amen.

606
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,960
