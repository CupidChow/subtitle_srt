1
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,040
They took my child! Do you understand?
They took Matei.

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,080
I don't have time to get arrested.
I can't stay here! Please!

3
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,320
You have to help me! Please!
Vasile, you know me!

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,600
No!

5
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,000
Lars will come at ten o'clock.

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Bring the car around.
We'll make a stop on the way.

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,680
Yes, Boss.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,240
Listen.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,560
Did you lose something?

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,480
I thought I left it here somewhere.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,480
Well, don't leave it here.
Get out of here!

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,400
Are you done?

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,000
Halfway there. Almost halfway.

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,120
Hurry up already!
We're going to miss the exchange.

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,680
Maybe it's for the best.

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,000
A lot of people died
for our cause, don't you think?

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Luca, Florin, Bolt Nut…

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,720
Hold on! Now you're thinking
about their dead too?

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,280
In war, when their people die,
you rejoice.

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,800
War?

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,240
Is this a war to you?

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,720
What do you think this is? A game?

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,720
It's war.

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,000
And for you, the stakes are high.
You need to fight to get your life back.

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,120
To clear your name.

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,800
Who cares about my name?

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,240
The children I never had
'cause I've been busy playing vigilante?

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm so stupid.

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,280
Even more for following you.

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,680
Wait here.

31
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,280
We're screwed.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,240
I need to warn you--

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Show me!

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,000
Leave us.

35
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,760
They're going to pay.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,840
All of them.

37
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,800
Come on.

38
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,440
Listen to what I'm going to say.

39
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
Maybe you change your mind.

40
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,960
How nice.

41
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,200
Mr. Prosecutor.

42
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,760
So?

43
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,080
Did you find Luca's killer?
Did you arrest her?

44
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,520
If not, I could tell you her name.

45
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,200
No need for that. I know it.

46
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Camelia Serbu.

47
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,320
How convenient. The girlfriend did it.

48
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,480
Most cases are the same, Miss.

49
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,200
Murderers have killed for the same reason
since the world begun.

50
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,320
My work gets boring sometimes.

51
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,280
Right?

52
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, let's shake you out of that boredom.

53
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,960
Do you know what my job is?

54
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,840
Yes. Something in IT.

55
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,960
Something in IT.

56
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,000
I recently stumbled across a computer.

57
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
A really old one, but a piece of art.

58
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,760
You know what I found on it?

59
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,120
Lists.

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
With people. And the amounts of money
that those people received.

61
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,760
Look… See?

62
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
Money is one of those reasons

63
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
that people have killed for
ever since the world begun.

64
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,240
And your name was on those lists.

65
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,280
If you want to act crazy, I don't have
the time nor the patience for this shit.

66
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
The money is from Nicolae Tănase.

67
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,240
Lots of payments.

68
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,520
Paid over many years.

69
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,400
All right.

70
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,520
I get it now.

71
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,120
You're not acting crazy.
You really are crazy.

72
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,000
This explains a lot.

73
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,640
Your babbling is going
to amuse the judges.

74
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,360
-If I were you, I'd be careful.
-Wait, I'm not done.

75
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,680
-Last night you were at Tănase's.
-You're insane!

76
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,320
I saw you. On the CCTV at Tănase's villa,
where my son is hostage. Did you know?

77
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,560
Bribery is one thing.
But kidnapping children?

78
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,320
Good luck at your trial, Miss.

79
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,240
Excuse me, can I speak to you?

80
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,800
-This thing with the child--
-The woman is crazy. Go figure!

81
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,120
Luca seemed like a sane guy. But her?
What did he see in her?

82
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,520
She says her child is missing.
We should call the school--

83
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,680
Wait! Let's make this clear.

84
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,040
Nothing she said makes sense. She's crazy.

85
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,600
Good.

86
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,680
Call me if she starts making sense.

87
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,280
The child has a grandmother.
He is taken care of. He's fine.

88
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,480
Matei is not with my mom.
They beat her and put her in a hospital.

89
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
You can check. He's not at home.
He's not at school. Check everything.

90
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm begging you! I'm not crazy.

91
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,360
How can I check that?

92
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm running out of time! Help me!

93
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,160
-There's no more time.
-Shut up!

94
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,040
I believe you. Do exactly as I say.

95
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,760
EXIT

96
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,800
-Yes.
-Serbu has escaped.

97
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,000
-What?
-She hit Coman and ran away.

98
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,160
I was just there.

99
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,800
-What do we do?
-Put an APB on her. Now!

100
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,520
Good news, I hope.

101
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,240
We had Camelia Serbu locked up.
She escaped.

102
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,840
Good thing, you idiot.
She's supposed to be meeting me.

103
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,880
Without her, I'm locked out
of ten million euros!

104
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,160
I'll help. Be careful with the boy.

105
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,800
You mind your own business.
Let that woman get to my place.

106
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,920
Fucking asshole.

107
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,720
How come you always find a way out, doll?

108
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
One of my many talents. Go ahead.

109
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,000
-Ten o'clock, Royal Ballroom. You know it?
-Yes, I do.

110
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,400
Listen to me! When you find
Camelia Serbu, you let me know.

111
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,520
You do not engage her
without my say so. Understood?

112
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Understood, then?

113
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,560
Bring him here.

114
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
I heard

115
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,680
something… about Crisi.

116
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
Who's Crisi?

117
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,160
Crisi

118
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,120
was my daughter.

119
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,560
The one that I could really trust.

120
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,360
And the one

121
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,480
that was killed…

122
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,760
by your mother.

123
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,000
You knew about this, yes?

124
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,960
And you said nothing.

125
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,400
I had to find out
from a piece of shit cop?

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,840
They're here.

127
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,360
Take him away.

128
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,440
Where the hell is that slut?

129
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
Hello. Tunari, please.

130
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,680
As fast as you can.

131
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,200
All cars, be advised. Camelia Serbu
is in a taxi, heading for Tunari.

132
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,400
Wait.

133
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
Something happened.

134
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,680
Wait!

135
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,160
Now. Go!

136
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,320
Go!

137
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,400
You check it, Dracu. You know this stuff.

138
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,760
Can't get enough of it, right?

139
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,600
Golescu just put an APB out
on Luca's fiancée.

140
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,760
Every cop in town is looking for her.

141
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,640
Hello.

142
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,560
Cami went to meet Tănase on her own
to give him the money for the deal.

143
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,920
Any idea where they could meet?

144
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,040
She was seen in Tunari.

145
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,040
-Tunari.
-His ballroom is there.

146
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,320
It's his ballroom. We're going there.

147
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,360
Ion, we don't stand a chance on our own.

148
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,160
But we would, with your guys.

149
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,720
-I really don't know how this happened--
-How a prisoner got away from you?

150
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm not surprised.

151
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,680
I saw your last evaluations.
They don't look so good.

152
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,280
Maybe I should send you
to a psych evaluation.

153
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,480
You know I'm fine.

154
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,680
You need to prove that you're fine.

155
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,960
You're either with me or against me.

156
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,400
Got that?

157
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,920
All units, concerning Camelia Serbu,
a wanted fugitive.

158
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,680
She has been seen near Royal Ballroom.

159
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,320
That's Tănase's ballroom.

160
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,600
Tell them to keep their distance
and stay put until I get there.

161
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,360
Please, I'm running late.
Can we hurry up a little?

162
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,800
Thank you.

163
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,920
Daddy.

164
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,400
Do you think I don't know

165
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,480
what you two are up to?

166
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,640
You're no daughter of mine.

167
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,800
Are you crazy?

168
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,960
You snake.

169
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,840
Stop here, across the road.

170
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,240
Welcome, doll.

171
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,520
I've got the key.
I need to see my boy now.

172
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Are you ready?

173
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,640
Okay, stop it.

174
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,120
You can hug later. I want my money.

175
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,680
I'm going to need a laptop.

176
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,480
-How long will this take?
-Just a second.

177
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
What the hell are you doing?

178
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,720
Just wait a second!

179
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,600
Okay.

180
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,960
Done.

181
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,080
The crypto is back in your account.
Log in and check.

182
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Pay the guy.

183
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,320
Did you call for backup?

184
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,960
Tell them not to storm in.

185
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,200
There's a lot of armed people.
Matei is in there.

186
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,240
Go outside and tell them to wait.

187
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,160
Right…

188
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,240
We're leaving.

189
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,120
-Hold on.
-No.

190
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,440
You got your money. That was the deal.

191
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,800
Until I found out you killed my daughter.

192
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,960
You killed my boyfriend.

193
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,680
You took my son. I'd say we're even.

194
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,200
That's not how it works.

195
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,120
Yes, it is.

196
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,040
Check your account. Come on.

197
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,080
When you logged into your wallet,
I got access to your accounts.

198
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,600
Empty again.

199
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,680
No sirens, boys.

200
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,520
First of all, what's going on here?
Second, what are you doing here?

201
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,040
Tănase, Tili, his daughter
and Dracu, his right hand, are inside.

202
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,680
Camelia too. I think she's in danger.

203
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,880
She's a suspect that fled from lockup.

204
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,000
We sit tight.

205
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,520
Until we know what's going on,
we can't risk civilian lives.

206
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,720
They're armed.
We have to go in. There's a child!

207
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,680
I said we wait.

208
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,840
Don't worry. You'll get your money
as soon as we leave this place.

209
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,680
You fucking slut!

210
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,680
Hold on. Let me get this straight.

211
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,680
What are you so worked up for?

212
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,000
Me?

213
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,160
Or those eight million euros?

214
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,320
Don't you dare point that gun at me!

215
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,080
I'm tired of always being second best.

216
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,200
Crisi is gone.

217
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,800
You're stuck with me.

218
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,840
Deal with it.

219
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Shoot her.

220
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,360
Shoot her!

221
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
You piece of shit.

222
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,080
I made you.

223
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,760
I raised you.

224
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,480
I raised you as my own.

225
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,040
This is how you repay me?

226
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,400
I told them not to come.

227
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,640
How the fuck did the cops get here?
Give me the gun.

228
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
Gunshots. Go in! Go!

229
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,360
-Stop!
-Police!

230
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,800
-Matei!
-Freeze!

231
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,360
They took my child!

232
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,040
-Mom!
-Police! Freeze!

233
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,880
Stop! On the ground!

234
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
Gun! On the ground!

235
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,520
On the floor!

236
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,920
Face down!

237
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,760
Stop this goddamn chaos!

238
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
I told you I'd be the end of you.

239
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,720
Who the hell are you?

240
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,960
-Get him a doctor!
-Go after Tili Tănase!

241
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,240
-She took Matei! Go after her!
-Get them out!

242
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,200
Move!

243
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,160
Help! I'm back here. Help me!

244
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,320
You think he's--

245
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,720
-I fucking hope so!
-Help!

246
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,280
Really? You're sad now?

247
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,880
He had a bullet with his name on it.

248
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,120
It's his fault
that bullet came from my gun.

249
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,160
The king is dead.

250
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,120
Long live the queen.

251
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,320
You think I can't handle the business?

252
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,880
-Well…
-Well, what?

253
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,480
That's a job for a man.

254
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,200
A job for a man, you say?

255
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,240
-You think I can't handle it?
-No.

256
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,080
Yes!

257
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,080
See?

258
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,920
I just need to get that eight million
back from that slut.

259
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,760
You're gonna hear things about me.

260
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,800
The cops are going to say
that I lied to you.

261
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,520
That I'm not a cop anymore.

262
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,880
-But that's because I was framed--
-I…

263
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,680
I don't care.

264
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,240
Please, believe me, I'm on your side.

265
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,160
We're going to find Matei.

266
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,840
So you ran
a completely unauthorized operation.

267
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,840
With a man fired from the force.

268
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,720
It woudln't work otherwise.

269
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Roman was always a good cop.
Honest. Wouldn't take bribes…

270
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,440
Tănase has men everywhere.
Even in the Police.

271
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,880
That's a very serious accusation,
Mr. Prosecutor.

272
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,120
Sorry, former Prosecutor.

273
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,640
-You knew about this?
-We told the Superintendent yesterday.

274
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,800
We only found out today
that you're involved.

275
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,080
Given the situation

276
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,080
and the fact that we didn't know
who to trust inside,

277
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,320
I chose to act alone.

278
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,480
We're in a hierarchy here,
Superintendent Tatu.

279
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,320
-You should have told me.
-Indeed. I'm sorry.

280
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,920
But in the end,

281
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,920
we got our hands
on drugs worth a few million euros.

282
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,000
I'd say that's not bad, right?

283
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,840
And you say Tănase has cops
on his payroll?

284
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,120
Do you have names?

285
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,240
All the names are on a list
on Bank's old laptop.

286
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,360
The list is gone.

287
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,600
We checked. No files, nothing.

288
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,360
We got him not only on corruption.

289
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,280
Roman recovered material evidence
that ties Tănase

290
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,600
to a murder case.

291
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,800
His DNA on a dead body.
He's not getting away.

292
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,320
-How long have you been after him?
-A long time.

293
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,600
Since he ordered the assassination
of my good friend.

294
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,520
Doru Serbu.

295
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,160
Camelia Serbu's father?

296
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,320
So 2013. You pushed on since then
just to prove a point?

297
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,240
Yes. And to neutralize him.

298
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,160
Well, you did neutralize him.

299
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,520
He's in the hospital
with a hole in his chest.

300
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,640
-And a busted kidney too.
-It could have been worse.

301
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,040
I, for one, wouldn't have shed a tear.

302
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,600
And the missing child?

303
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,200
If we find Tili Tănase, we find the child.

304
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,720
And I really don't think
we should arrest Cami now,

305
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,240
when her boy has been taken.

306
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,720
I'll think about it.

307
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,560
You may go.

308
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,120
-What do I do?
-Let them go. I'll handle them.

309
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,240
Mr. Prosecutor.

310
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,720
Whether my father lives or dies,

311
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,840
he's not coming home. Got it?

312
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,160
-And we carry on as before?
-We carry on as before.

313
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,880
They're releasing us?

314
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
How did you do it?

315
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,880
Let's just say
I can still pull a few strings.

316
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,960
Thanks. So you pulled some strings.
Now what?

317
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,240
We'll just magically forget
you've lied to my mother and I for years?

318
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,240
I just wanted to right a wrong.

319
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,520
The death of my friend. Your father.

320
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,960
Come on. Let's go.

321
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,520
Just a second, please. You need
to sign here and on the next page.

322
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
What are you doing to find my son?

323
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,880
Every cop is looking for Tili Tănase.

324
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,000
Really? Why don't you call her?
You have her number, right?

325
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,200
Come on, before he changes his mind.

326
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,360
MUNICIPAL POLICE

327
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,600
Wait.

328
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,440
Wait a second.

329
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,440
What now?

330
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,240
You go see my mother.

331
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,800
Check on her.

332
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,360
She deserves to know the truth, right?

333
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,080
We'll meet you there.

334
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,840
We'll go by my place.
I need clean clothes.

335
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,280
Okay. Well, take my car then.

336
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,840
I'll be all right.

337
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,520
Change of plans.

338
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,280
THE BOY FOR MY 8 MILLION.
JUST YOU AND BONES.

339
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,480
No matter what happens, Matei gets away.

340
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,200
If you have to choose, you choose him!

341
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,080
-Is that clear?
-Yes.

342
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,080
Is that clear?

343
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,880
Yes!

344
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,720
Check the glove compartment.

345
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,040
They're waiting with open gates.

346
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,320
Come on.

347
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Where's my boy?

348
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,320
Mom?

349
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Mom!

350
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,520
Where's my money?

351
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,880
Log into your wallet.

352
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,280
It's okay. I'm not leaving without you.

353
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,720
Enough.

354
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,880
I'll transfer it back.

355
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,120
But first, he leaves with Matei.
It's the only way.

356
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,480
There's another way.

357
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,880
I can cut your son to pieces
in front of you

358
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,600
until you give me my money back.

359
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,960
And you, drop the gun.

360
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,600
Drop it!

361
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
Kick it away.

362
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,560
What will it be?

363
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,280
Are you giving me my money,

364
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,440
or do I start counting down
on your son's fingers?

365
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,200
I don't understand

366
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,760
why you keep that pointed at me.

367
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,840
If I die, you won't see that money again.

368
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,760
Just like I won't see Luca again.

369
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,080
Just like you won't see your sister again.

370
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,200
-Do you want to know how she died?
-No, thank you.

371
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,200
Not interested?

372
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,800
Yeah.

373
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,800
I guess you wanted her gone.

374
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,520
You know what?

375
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,400
Fuck that money!
I'll blow your head off. I'm done.

376
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,520
Wait a second!

377
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,120
Mom!

378
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,000
Matei, run!

379
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,360
Kill the boy!

380
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,920
Not her!

381
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,080
Give me my money.

382
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,560
I will.

383
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,880
Right away.

384
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,080
There was something else on that laptop.

385
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,400
Your father's bribe list.
Very important people.

386
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,520
Politicians, cops.

387
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,360
If I don't log into the account every day,
that list goes to Europol.

388
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,680
So as long as I live,
these people can sleep well at night,

389
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,640
and so can you.

390
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,160
Go on.

391
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,360
Get your money back.

392
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,640
I don't care what you do
from now on, but we're done.

393
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,440
You have eight million reasons
to leave me alone.

394
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,200
I'm leaving you alone.

395
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,320
Matei. Baby!

396
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,040
Come on, we're home. Come on.

397
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,840
-Let's go to a hospital. Please.
-No. I can handle it.

398
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,320
I can handle it.
Stay with Matei. I'll go alone.

399
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,040
-Promise?
-Promise.

400
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,280
Come on, baby.

401
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,560
Mom, who was that mean girl?

402
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,800
My dear…

403
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,840
That girl had very big problems.

404
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,240
When they have big problems,
some people become mean.

405
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,600
We're never going to see her again.
She's out of our lives for good.

406
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,720
I miss Luca.

407
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,680
I miss Luca too. Very much.

408
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,520
But we have each other.

409
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,720
I have you, and you have me.
And we'll be just fine.

410
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,120
We'll just take it one step at a time.

411
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,720
ONE WEEK LATER

412
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,360
MUNICIPAL POLICE BUCHAREST

413
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,600
Good afternoon.

414
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,160
Thank you all for coming here today,

415
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,680
when we announce a major step forward
in our fight against organized crime.

416
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,840
Here's how things are now.

417
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,280
Unfortunately,
you'll have to go to prison.

418
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,720
You can name people in court,

419
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,000
tell them how you managed
to corrupt the system.

420
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,800
But you'll end up in prison anyway.

421
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,640
You piece of shit.

422
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,160
Wouldn't it be better there?
I'll get you a new kidney too.

423
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,720
It's better than dying in the showers
with a shiv in your guts.

424
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,080
This decisive victory is the result
of many months of hard work.

425
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,800
It was achieved through the concerted
efforts of multiple state institutions.

426
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,360
-What's that?
-A small present.

427
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,480
In case you decide
you want your dad locked up for good.

428
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,320
This complex operation that involved
undercover policemen and special forces

429
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,120
led to the complete annihilation
of a dangerous organized crime group.

430
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,880
You're under arrest
for suspicion of conspiracy,

431
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,640
attempted obstruction of justice
and illegal use of police forces.

432
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,240
Tatu, you're really lucky
that there wasn't a bloodbath.

433
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,120
You've endangered civilians and agents
by disobeying orders, ignoring procedure.

434
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,520
We're starting a criminal investigation.
You are suspended effective immediately.

435
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,040
-Take him!
-Is it a joke?

436
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,960
Come on.

437
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,600
I'm your Superintendent!
What are you doing?

438
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,080
I would also like to thank those who,
through their professional ethics,

439
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,440
courage and commitment, have played
a part in the success of this operation.

440
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,800
Thank you very much. Have a good day.

441
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,720
