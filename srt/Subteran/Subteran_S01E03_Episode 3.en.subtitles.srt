1
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,280
Forward, march!

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,520
Company, shoulder, arms!

3
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,600
Company, right face! Present, arms!

4
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,280
Company, shoulder, arms!

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,720
My condolences.

6
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,600
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

7
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,600
He had asked me to marry him.

8
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,000
Just before he died.

9
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,040
I did want to marry him,

10
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,200
but I don't know why,
I started saying "no",

11
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,840
that I have to think about it,
that we should talk.

12
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,680
And Matei's father?

13
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
A stupid fling.

14
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,760
I didn't want to see him again.

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,720
I imagine it was hard for you.

16
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,120
If it weren't for my mom…

17
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,000
And Luca.

18
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,800
In the last year,
he was like a dad to Matei.

19
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,880
-His mother's coming back soon.
-But he doesn't know that.

20
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,280
Now he's at his first funeral, Luca's.
And he's alone, and he's scared…

21
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,800
Do you think anyone can erase his trauma?

22
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,840
Fire!

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,560
Load!

24
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,480
Salute! Fire!

25
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,600
Load!

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,440
Salute! Fire!

27
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,520
Forever blessed is God, our Lord,
now, and ever, and forever…

28
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,400
Amen!

29
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,360
Have mercy on us, oh Lord,
as you are merciful.

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,520
This is my fourteenth.
Not that it helps you.

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
The fourteenth?

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,600
Fourteenth what?

33
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,080
My fourteenth funeral.
That's how many I've been to. I counted.

34
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
Quite a lot for a man
with no friends and no family, right?

35
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,600
I'm starting to believe
that it's tied to me.

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,800
Like it's my fault.

37
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,120
That's why you have no family, no friends.

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,600
Because they end up in the ground.
How would this help me?

39
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,840
I don't know.

40
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,920
Sorry, I wanted to say
I also went through some tough stuff--

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,320
And look at you now.

42
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
…and you gave life to your world.

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Let's go.

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,640
…a place with light, a place for rest,
where sorrow and pain did flee away.

46
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,920
And any wrong he might have thought…

47
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,720
LUCA VOINEA, THE ASSASSINATED POLICEMAN

48
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
Join us at 6:00, as we go live
with a panel of specialists

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,760
and we'll watch the match together,

50
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,600
with great hopes, Romania vs Hungary…

51
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,520
Listen.

52
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,000
Once more, at the last moment,
a heartbeat away from qualifying.

53
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,760
Your boss, he really needs
the money in that Compaq, doesn't he?

54
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,680
Indeed. He needs them for a big deal
that's coming soon.

55
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,680
I think that Tili was fishing
for info last night.

56
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
-I think it has to do--
-Yes. I heard something too.

57
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,800
I think Tănase wants to get out
after this hit.

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,880
It's in your best interest
that he gets his money and makes the deal.

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
Wouldn't it be better
to catch him in the act?

60
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,640
-Yes. What's your point?
-I need to get into involved.

61
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,200
Who's getting that list out?
Who's gonna decrypt the laptop?

62
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,920
-Sonia?
-Sonia. Yes.

63
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,280
The most important match is tonight.

64
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
Every Romanian is rooting
for our national team,

65
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,320
as they try to beat Hungary
in a tough match, tonight at 9:45.

66
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,440
The team's coach…

67
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,200
…a solemn atmosphere,
the Attorney General is attending

68
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,040
the funeral of the policeman killed
in the line of duty.

69
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,560
The police are still investigating this…

70
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,120
Hey! Quiet!

71
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,640
…a member of an organized crime group,
also found dead in his hotel room.

72
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,800
Although every effort has been made,
there are no arrests so far…

73
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,040
Quiet!

74
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,360
…and no suspect has been identified.

75
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,760
Ma'am, he has to get his dialysis.
Can we do it without noise or stress?

76
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
Someone has to clean this house, though.

77
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,480
A huge puzzle of questions
without answers…

78
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,440
Puzzle your mom's ass!

79
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,760
What did I say about stress? Take it easy.

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
It's not helping.

81
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,640
Go and get the car.

82
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,960
No. We can't do this. We can't skip a day.

83
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,560
We'll do it later.

84
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,800
-Is the funeral over?
-Yes, it's over.

85
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,680
-And?
-Huge procession.

86
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,560
Like I killed a national hero.

87
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,600
You got the marching band to come out.
And the boy?

88
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,040
With his grandmother.
No sign of the mother.

89
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Something doesn't add up
with this Bones guy.

90
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,760
I'll be there in five to talk
about the plan. How are you?

91
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,320
I'll come to you.

92
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,400
You think you can just bring anybody
from the outside here?

93
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,520
Here, chief!

94
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,680
You wanted a plan.
Sonia is part of that plan.

95
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,680
You don't say.

96
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,760
How is she a part of it?

97
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,920
You're looking for an old computer.

98
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,880
How will you access it?

99
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,280
With what passwords?
Do you know how to get the crypto?

100
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,040
-I do.
-Jesus! Are you one of those hackers?

101
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,560
Let's say I have experience.

102
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,000
So experienced,
yet you hang out with this guy Bones.

103
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,320
If you're that big of a specialist,
can you crunch some numbers for me

104
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,640
and tell me if we qualify with a draw?

105
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,000
We'll qualify
for the hustling championship with a draw!

106
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,280
We need to win two to one.
I put money on that.

107
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,880
I'm no specialist,
but I'm a fucking patriot.

108
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,440
Here. Hack this.

109
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,040
An Android, huh?

110
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,920
We now know who's going to play
in both teams…

111
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,440
Okay, Google. What time is it?

112
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,520
They play a complete style.
They have excellent players.

113
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
What should we look at first? Your texts?

114
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,080
Your recent photos?

115
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,920
Don't look at anything!

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
…choices he made for the starting team,
it seems like he knows…

117
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,320
-So what's the plan?
-Yeah, so…

118
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,160
Is someone coming?

119
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,480
Organized my ass.

120
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,240
What the fuck? What took so long?
Were you taking a shit?

121
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,960
I didn't know you were coming, Boss.

122
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,920
This place is like a pig sty.

123
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,920
What did you say your name was?

124
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,800
They call me Bones.

125
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,440
I see you brought your mystery woman
from the party.

126
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
Sonia.

127
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,640
We had fun last night,
but now we're working.

128
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,960
-What do you do?
-She's helping us with the laptop.

129
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,840
-So that we take the right one.
-Fuck off.

130
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,440
She'll also work on it, once we get it.

131
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,360
-She knows this stuff?
-She does.

132
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
She's good at it.

133
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Okay. Tell me, what's the plan?

134
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,120
Yes.

135
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,240
If you look over here…

136
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
Allow me.

137
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,000
Come on.

138
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,880
Just a sec.

139
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,840
The blueprints of the precinct.

140
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,600
-Where did you get them?
-I told you, she's good with computers.

141
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,320
Here's the front desk
with the officer on duty.

142
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,040
Here is the squad room
where the rest of the cops are.

143
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
And upstairs is the evidence room.

144
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,880
-If we get three people into the station--
-You decided on three.

145
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,680
How many are you here? Five?

146
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,800
Six, with little miss Sonia here.

147
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,080
It makes no sense to send more.
We don't want to draw attention.

148
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,120
In a police station, you have cops,

149
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,800
criminals, and lawyers.

150
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,960
Nobody's counting how many.

151
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,320
But they need to be cops,
criminals, or lawyers.

152
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,720
What are you gonna be?

153
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,200
I can get you cop uniforms. Johnny.

154
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay, it's done.

155
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,480
We get more people in.

156
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,280
-How about getting out?
-A van outside would be good.

157
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
I'm on it.

158
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,000
I want you to do this quietly.
No fireworks, no dead bodies.

159
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,040
Nothing that can link this to me.

160
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,800
This isn't the time to be brave.
You go in quietly, as if it was a church.

161
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,600
Understood, Dracu?
And leave the same way. Is this clear?

162
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,360
-Okay. We go in tomorrow.
-Yes.

163
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,920
Sunday evenings are quieter.

164
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,840
You go in tonight.

165
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm at the countryside with Matei.
I didn't know what to do.

166
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,440
-To get him away.
-You did the right thing, Mrs. Doroteea.

167
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,440
Matei likes it here, yes.

168
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,800
And it's good for the child
to be away from this whole mess.

169
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,480
Yes.

170
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,200
Yeah, well, try to forget about it.

171
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,120
I'll call you
as soon as I have something. Okay?

172
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,240
Yes. Thank you.

173
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,400
Have a good day.

174
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,600
Matei?

175
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,200
Matei, are you up there?

176
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,560
-What…
-Here he is!

177
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,480
What's wrong?

178
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,400
He forgot to tell you he was leaving.
Right, Matei?

179
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,200
I found him by my pond.

180
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,520
Matei…

181
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
He's confused.

182
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,360
He misses his mother.

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,280
I keep telling him she'll be back,
but I don't know what to do.

184
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,800
The cops still don't know
who that burnt body in her car was.

185
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,240
I didn't say anything to Matei.

186
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Why don't I take him fishing
with me tomorrow?

187
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,960
Ice fishing.

188
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Take his mind off things.

189
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,320
-You also need time alone. For yourself.
-Yes.

190
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay.

191
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,800
Thank you, Cornel.

192
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,720
The game is tonight.

193
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,880
You wanted a diversion?
This is the best one.

194
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,080
All the cops will be on the streets.

195
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,520
The big bosses, at the stadium.
And the smaller ones, in the precincts.

196
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,960
Watching the game on the TV.

197
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,160
Well, they don't have a TV.

198
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,960
THE ROMANIAN POLICE

199
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,280
What the hell is this?

200
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,920
A TV set, sir.

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,360
I'm asking who gave the order.

202
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,000
Because I sure didn't.
And I'm the one in charge here, right?

203
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,440
Yes, sir. It's from the Union.

204
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,080
May God bless the guy who sent it.
Just in time for the game.

205
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,880
I gave you everything you need.
So don't screw this up.

206
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,960
Come with me.

207
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,720
Tili, you too.

208
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,400
Where the hell is Crisi?

209
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,280
Who do we know in Dubai?
Make some damned calls and find her.

210
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,560
And I also don't like this thing
with the new people.

211
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,840
-They're doing a good job.
-It has to be good and quiet.

212
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,600
Make sure you don't screw it up.

213
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,000
-What the hell was that?
-Who the fuck knows?

214
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,960
Before the evidence room,
we need to get past the front desk.

215
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,680
We'll kill the cameras.
That's where their brain is.

216
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,160
How many at the front desk?

217
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,400
Today is game day, so probably just one.
But they come and go.

218
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,120
Easy. We cut them up,
shoot them, set them on fire.

219
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,760
Are you stupid, or what?

220
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,800
Didn't you hear the boss? No killing.

221
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,400
Nobody should know we were there, right?
If someone dies, they're going to search--

222
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
-So now you're good at robberies?
-No…

223
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,320
How many have you done?
Hey, let's make this clear.

224
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,920
Once we're inside, I'm the boss.

225
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,880
We go in from two sides.

226
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,800
Three diversions.
The game, the lawyer, the arrest.

227
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,920
What lawyer?

228
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,160
-Your Honor--
-Shut the fuck up!

229
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,920
Sonia, who else?

230
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,040
Why? She should see
about those alarms and laptops.

231
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,360
Look at her face. It screams "lawyer".

232
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,320
-Okay. She'll do.
-Dressed like this?

233
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,880
-How else?
-Come with me.

234
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,920
Come on.

235
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,600
Jeez! Is all this stuff stolen?

236
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,440
No. We got them on Black Friday. LOL.

237
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,880
-I don't know. It's not really my style.
-We don't care about that.

238
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,160
We care about the hard-ass lawyer,
focused on her thing.

239
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,280
Here. Try this one.

240
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,280
Well…

241
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,440
Well, I have to see you.

242
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,600
And?

243
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,080
How did you meet?

244
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Well, it's not the greatest love story
of all time.

245
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,760
He was fresh out of prison
and we were working for the same boss.

246
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,920
-What were you doing?
-Credit card scams.

247
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,280
Cool.

248
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,680
And?

249
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,400
And…

250
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,680
I don't know, there was…

251
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
something.

252
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,000
Every time I see a guy
with a broken wing, I fall for him.

253
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,040
You'd think I am Mother Theresa.

254
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,360
I know what you mean.

255
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,120
No. Take it off.

256
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,200
This one.

257
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Right.

258
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,320
So they can look at something nice
while we take their stuff.

259
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Anything new on Voinea's place?

260
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,520
They're working on it.
But they accessed his phone.

261
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,920
I just got the results.

262
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,880
Let me know if you find something useful.
You can call me.

263
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,000
-Or are you coming to the game?
-I'm staying here.

264
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
Well, go team! What can I say?

265
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,320
POLICE

266
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,920
Are you okay?

267
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,800
No.

268
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,720
It's match day.
Nobody's gonna be there. Don't worry.

269
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,800
You mean not to worry before a robbery?

270
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,400
In the precinct I was in two days ago?
What if they recognize me?

271
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,680
We were all over the blueprints.
The blueprints that you got. In and out.

272
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,640
They won't have time to see you.

273
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,600
Are you okay?

274
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,200
Ready to do your part?

275
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,600
The part where I leave you alone.

276
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,320
That's what I don't like. Sonia.

277
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,360
I'll be all right, Bones.
Jeez! What a name.

278
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,040
-Okay?
-Okay.

279
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,720
So will you do it?

280
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,040
-When is this?
-Now. Tonight.

281
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,200
Are you crazy?
I'm not coming. It's game night.

282
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
And since when does a Syrian watch
Romania's games?

283
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,120
I've been here 20 years. I have a heart.
I'm sorry, habibi, I'm not coming.

284
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,440
What should I say to my dad?

285
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,760
After he covered your ass
for four years in jail,

286
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,080
you wanna watch the game?

287
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,960
Tonight, in the stands
at the National Arena,

288
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,760
at this historic match…

289
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,440
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

290
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,960
-It's starting, boss.
-One heart attack was enough, thanks.

291
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,000
Go, Romania!

292
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,800
I HAVE UNLOCKED LUCA VOINEA'S PHONE.

293
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,840
PHOTOS VOINEA
GEOLOCATIONS

294
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,000
Sorry, I wanted to tell you
that I found the cables.

295
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
I can look at that old laptop now
if that's okay.

296
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,440
Okay. It's in the evidence room.

297
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,320
Romania! Romania!

298
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,560
Olé, olé, olé!

299
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,880
Romania! Romania!

300
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,520
Olé, olé, olé!

301
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,320
Romania! Romania! Olé, olé, olé!

302
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,840
Romania! Romania!

303
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,400
Olé, olé, olé!

304
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,080
Dude! Cops, cops, cops!

305
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,800
We are the cops, you moron.

306
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,120
Let me see how much I've got.

307
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,440
Almost 80 thousand.

308
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,720
Bank, you fucking son of a bitch!

309
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,240
Welcome.

310
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,040
…that we deserve to qualify.

311
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,520
Now, Gâlcă attacks Dobriță.

312
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,720
Spectacular tackle there.

313
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,040
For Sonia?

314
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,080
The first free kick for the visiting team,

315
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,040
after a debatable decision by the referee.

316
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,640
Molnar and Tamas Petofy
are waiting near the ball.

317
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,800
Molnar sends it high into…

318
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,200
-Who are you betting on?
-Hungary.

319
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,400
Three-nil.

320
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,400
We have chips for 10k Euros, 25k or 50k.

321
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,720
Give me the golden one.

322
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,280
The opposing team seems…

323
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,400
Sure. Here you are.

324
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,960
They seem to have awakened
after a slow start of…

325
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,880
What's Lars doing here?

326
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,840
Thank you.

327
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,480
…to score the first goal.

328
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,920
He gets closer and kicks the ball hard…

329
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,480
…gets the ball and tries to start
a counter-attack.

330
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,320
But it looks like our defense is…

331
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,880
Come on, you lazy fucks!

332
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,840
Get it, man!

333
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,720
The Hungarian team takes advantage
of the passivity of our defenders.

334
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,080
-Yes.
-We got the wrong dental record.

335
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,400
-What?
-Yes, they sent a different one.

336
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,240
And what are you doing there?

337
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,960
Our request had the right name.
What can you do?

338
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,360
What can I say?
You know how it is. It happens.

339
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,120
Yes, okay.
I know these things can happen.

340
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,160
But they seem to happen
to you a lot these days.

341
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,840
-We requested another--
-I don't know. Fix it.

342
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,920
-What's going on, boss?
-Professionals, my ass.

343
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,520
The coroner got
the wrong dental record again.

344
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,440
Again?

345
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,360
Let's think positive.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

346
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,200
Again, a childish mistake by the defense.

347
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,960
How do we do this? Do you start it?

348
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,880
Do I? I was thinking--

349
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,960
-What's wrong with you?
-No, what's wrong with you?

350
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,400
We picked you up from the street
and fed you when you were starving.

351
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,560
And what did you do?

352
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,120
Did you keep your head down
and behave? No.

353
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,800
You had to show off
and talk to the boss! What's your angle?

354
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,120
I don't have one. I just had an idea.

355
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,800
Oh, you had an idea?

356
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,040
-And with Tili, on the dance floor?
-She invited me.

357
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,560
And with Crisi? She's still not answering.

358
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,720
Who knows? Maybe she realized
that you are a deadbeat

359
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,840
and she went looking for something better.

360
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,080
Hey! We're trying
to watch the game here, okay?

361
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,080
What the fuck do you want?
Can't you see I'm dealing with something?

362
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,480
Go watch your game.
Or you'll watch it in reruns.

363
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,440
This piece of shit dares
talk to me like this.

364
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,240
Terminus Club, 5 George Enescu Street.

365
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,400
Some guys started a fight,
and the whole bar is kicking their asses.

366
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,720
We're at Victoria, but there's traffic.
We'll be there in 15.

367
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,280
We'll go, Chief. Patrol number two.

368
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,160
We'll be there in five minutes.

369
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,600
-Okay, confirmed. Patrol number two.
-Thank you.

370
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,080
-Careful, they're extremely violent.
-Yes.

371
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,520
Chief, huh?

372
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Oops.

373
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,960
-What do we do?
-Let's go this way. Come on.

374
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,280
Things are going to heat up in here.

375
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,840
Somebody call the cops!

376
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,120
Hey, wait.

377
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,800
I'll put 500 on our guys. Are you in?

378
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,560
I'm in, dude.

379
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,720
-You're rooting for the Hungarians?
-Yeah. They're two times bigger.

380
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,720
DID YOU GET LOST?

381
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,560
Police! Police!

382
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,840
Do I have to do everything?

383
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,560
I'll tear your fucking head off,
you cocksucker!

384
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,400
Things are heating up.

385
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,320
Corner kick for us.
The last of the first half.

386
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,440
Let's go. Let's go.

387
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,760
…down to Mureșan,
who kicks it way over the goal.

388
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,120
Sebi Iordan is not happy
after a mediocre first half, at best.

389
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,960
We'll see you after a commercial break
of about 15 minutes.

390
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,920
Police!

391
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,000
Police, criminals. Criminals, police.

392
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,000
We were delayed, bro.

393
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,400
A better start in this second half
for our boys.

394
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,880
Maybe the coach's speech at half-time…

395
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,280
Can you help me?

396
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,840
…the results are showing.

397
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,240
Edi Popa has the ball. Mureșan… Iordache…

398
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,240
Yes, I have a client. Stănescu.

399
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,160
Not an offside. He dribbles the ball.
Goes past Covaci. He shoots…

400
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,840
Hey! Didn't I tell you
we were gonna score?

401
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,520
Hey! Can we get back to my client, please?

402
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,760
Stavarache, you said?

403
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,360
No. I said Stănescu.

404
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,840
Here's the thing, Miss.
I only have a Stavarache here.

405
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,560
Brought in yesterday, tire theft, from…

406
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,960
-What's that place called?
-Whatever.

407
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,160
Oh, boy.

408
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,920
-Are these the guys from Terminus?
-Hey, hey, hey.

409
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,840
I was hoping you'd never show up.
How drunk are they?

410
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,800
Shitfaced.

411
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,320
Shut it!

412
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Old man, can you take them upstairs?
But don't hang there for the game.

413
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,760
Go up for nothing?

414
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,920
Come on. Please, hurry.
I need to go to the bathroom.

415
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,200
Come on.

416
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,080
Can I please take a look at the registry?
I'm sure it's Stănescu.

417
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,920
Tudor…

418
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,760
You can go. I'll find him
by the time you get back.

419
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,640
Hey, what's the score?

420
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
-Tied, one-one.
-Where do you think you are?

421
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,880
Shh! Easy!

422
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,600
Offside.

423
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Offside, yes.
The referee called the offside…

424
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,440
-It's not here!
-It's not here, either.

425
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,040
-It's not?
-Nothing here.

426
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,640
Motherfucker, tell me where you put it,
or I'll hit you with this.

427
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,800
I don't know.

428
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,600
Gold, drugs, jewelry,
they're at the main precinct.

429
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,000
No, we're looking for an old Compaq.

430
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,920
What's that?

431
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,440
A really old laptop, like in old times.
Big, white, dirty.

432
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,320
Why does everyone want that?

433
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,680
Some guy from IT took it earlier.

434
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,720
How?

435
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,560
Good energy. Dima kicks it
to the middle of the field…

436
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,840
Toma receives it.

437
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,720
-What did you do, fucker?
-I didn't--

438
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,920
Did you crack it?

439
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,360
I tried. I didn't know that…

440
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,120
-Take it easy.
-No, please.

441
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,040
It's the boss's laptop,
with his money and stuff.

442
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,960
He doesn't get to look at it and live.

443
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,120
Come on.

444
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,560
Look at this guy. It's like we're cursed.

445
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,840
They should have subbed him out.
He also missed that free kick.

446
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,240
Password protected.
He didn't see anything.

447
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,840
-I didn't look.
-Tănase said no shooting.

448
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,800
Yes, he did, unless there are witnesses.
Look, a witness!

449
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,040
-I don't know anything.
-He really doesn't.

450
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,120
She knows this stuff. Calm down.

451
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,160
Please, let's get this
and get out of here. Please!

452
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,600
Okay.

453
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,440
I got carried away.

454
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,360
All right, everybody down!

455
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,600
-I said everybody down!
-Hey!

456
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,880
Down, I said!

457
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,280
-What are--
-Stay there!

458
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,560
You fucking cocksucker! Bring him here!

459
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,880
-Relax.
-Calm down.

460
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,480
Dude!

461
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,160
If I blew his brains out,
would you calm the fuck down?

462
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,000
-Calm down.
-On the ground.

463
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,440
-Don't tell me to calm down.
-You think you can get away?

464
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,960
What did you say, fatso?

465
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,320
What? What did you say?

466
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,520
Say it again.

467
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,960
-Say it again, so they can hear you.
-My heart…

468
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,680
-Are you nervous?
-Pills…

469
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,320
Pills? Are you high?
You fat fucking bastard.

470
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
-Down.
-Look at them, yo.

471
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,360
You need to calm her down. Let's go.

472
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,400
Squeak for me. Come on.

473
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,120
You fucking squeak for me!
Squeak. Come on.

474
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,440
Don't even think about it!

475
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,600
-Head down. Don't look.
-What's up with him? Is he dying?

476
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,560
Pills!

477
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,640
We got what we came for.

478
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,120
-My pills, please…
-Get the fuck out with your pills!

479
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Let's fucking go.
Get their guns and let's get out.

480
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,200
-Head down.
-Here, dude.

481
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,760
-Out of the way.
-Keep your head down!

482
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
-Who else has a gun?
-That guy.

483
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,280
-Him? Hey!
-Give me your gun.

484
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,600
-Down. Come on.
-Give it! Faster.

485
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,120
Just give it to me!

486
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,920
Head down.

487
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,400
Come on.

488
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,000
Hold your fucking horses.

489
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,720
Give me the gun. Faster.

490
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,760
Eyes down.

491
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,920
…from the right and wants the ball.

492
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,080
-All done?
-Come on.

493
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,960
Come on. Head down.

494
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Step on it.

495
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,520
Piece of shit cops!

496
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,680
Yeah, dude. They pissed themselves.

497
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,280
It's over. It's done. It's over.

498
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,240
Hacker girl! Are you scared?

499
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,560
Leave her alone.

500
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,160
You took your eyes
out of that laptop and saw real life.

501
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,440
This is real life, my girl!
There's trouble, there's blood and stuff.

502
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,800
Yo, Arab guy! Jaser.

503
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,240
Stop at a drug store
and get some diapers. She pissed herself.

504
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,680
Enough, man.

505
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,000
Goal!

506
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,640
Goal! We're qualified!

507
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,480
With this score, Romania is qualified
for the European Championship.

508
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,400
Very good!

509
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,120
My money.

510
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,640
But you lost.

511
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,320
Yes, I did lose. But Romania has won.

512
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,640
Romania!

513
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,960
Romania!

514
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,280
They don't really care about it.

515
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,720
Bones prefers sports with hands. Handball.

516
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,160
And it's over.

517
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,480
Guys, they found us.

518
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,240
Hold on.

519
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,120
Fucking…

520
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,600
Where the hell is our backup?

521
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,800
Don't piss your pants.

522
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,880
Yes! That's my girl.

523
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,560
She showed them.

524
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,120
Stay in your cars.

525
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,240
Get out of the car.

526
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,840
Stop, or we shoot!

527
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,680
We lost them.

528
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,440
The suspect has fled
on a motorcycle in the Victoria passage.

529
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,720
Come on.

530
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,480
Way to go, my brother! Way to go. Bro!

531
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,200
Come on. Hack it.

532
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,440
All right, Dracu. All right.

533
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,400
-All right. The greatest hacker!
-Come on, bitch! Weren't you an expert?

534
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,160
I think we deserve a drink first.
Right, boys?

535
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,120
My brother Bones speaks the truth.

536
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,480
Way to go.

537
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,720
Here.

538
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,880
Pull yourself together.

539
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,440
That fight at the bar.

540
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,520
It wouldn've received
two million likes on TikTok.

541
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,000
Fighting like bitches.

542
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,360
It's done. We got it.

543
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,240
Did you?

544
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,520
And do you like how it ended?

545
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,800
Who took the shot?

546
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,880
I did.

547
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
You screwed it.

548
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,000
You fix it now.

549
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,920
I don't want witnesses.
Only family comes out of that place.

550
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,560
The second she hacks it,
we finish them off. All of them.

551
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,040
-What the fuck?
-I told you, your father's gone crazy.

552
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,760
Dracu, I love you, man. Get in here!

553
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,080
