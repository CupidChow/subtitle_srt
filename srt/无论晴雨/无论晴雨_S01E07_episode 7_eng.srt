1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:16,930


2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,570
Are you awake?

3
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,080
♫  The lights coming on in the restaurant  ♫

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,650
♫  At the end of a busy day  ♫

5
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,160
♫  Suddenly my heart flutters  ♫

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,660
♫  On my way to see you  ♫

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,720
♫  I smile because it's familiar  ♫

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,670
Then, let's go.

9
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,080
♫  This trembling feeling  ♫

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,200
♫  For some reason, it deepens even more today  ♫

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,700
♫  My heart that misses you  ♫

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,630
♫  Calls out to you without any rest   ♫

13
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,140
♫  As if it'll never end  ♫

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,060
♫  I am a fool in you  ♫

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,430
♫  I'm flying on your eyes  ♫

16
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,980
♫  The time we were together, that day  ♫

17
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,560
♫  I felt everything seems so great in this world
  ♫

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,150
♫  I felt everything seems so great in this world
  ♫

19
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,640
♫  I'm flying in your mind  ♫

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,050
♫  When I feel as if each days is new  ♫

21
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,660
♫  You were always standing by me at times like that  ♫

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,750
♫  You were always standing by me at times like that  ♫

23
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,530
   

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,250
Do I smell like liquor?

25
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,260
Of course you smell like liquor. Think about how much you drank last night.

26
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,000
Is it too much?

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Is it hideous?

28
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,540
Are you embarrassed because of me?

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,160
- It must be due to your small head, right?
 - What?

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:50,140
If your head is small, your capacity to remember must be less than others, right?

31
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,240
Why?

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,590
Did I do something crazy last night?

33
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,090
That wasn't me.

34
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,540
I have too many of me inside me, so I don't know who it was last night.

35
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,740
Anyhow, that's not my current me.

36
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,780
I am alright.

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,020
I am really alright.

38
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,460
What do you mean you're alright? You look like you're about to collapse.

39
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,730
My younger sister's name is on the memorial.

40
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,790
I know.

41
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,840
You know?

42
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,410
Yeah.

43
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,370
How?

44
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,210
Ha Yeon Soo. It's not a common name.

45
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,670
Ha Yeon Soo. Ha Moon Soo.

46
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,080
We have one less house we need to visit.

47
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,150
It's two less houses.

48
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,830
Number 30, Lee Chul Woo.

49
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,200
He's my dad.

50
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:09,470
♫  Your lights in your heart  ♫

51
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,650
♫  It shines on my day  ♫

52
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:22,510
♫  My eyes on the soul  ♫

53
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,770
♫  Your heart comes to me  ♫

54
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,330
♫  Lines our way  ♫

55
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,970
♫  Hold my hand  ♫

56
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,540
Mom.

57
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,100
Mom.

58
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,700
I am leaving for work.

59
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,290
Come in.

60
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,370
At least dry your hair before you go.

61
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,560
Have I told you what your grabbed at your first birthday party? (First birthday - various items with specific meanings are placed in front of the baby to see what the baby grabs).

62
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,630
- You said stethoscope.
 - Yeah.

63
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,700
So everyone was so happy that there would be a doctor in the family.

64
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,750
I am sorry about it.

65
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,450
You're better than a doctor.

66
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,690
I think I am alive to this day thanks to you.

67
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,930
Have I told you which item Yeon Soo grabbed?

68
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,710
You said a microphone (signifies singer).

69
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,170
It wasn't?

70
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,220
A spool of thread (means long life).

71
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,000
She grabbed silk thread. But at that time, I wasn't satisfied with her choice.

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,700
So I helped her grab a microphone so she could become famous.

73
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,220
If I had let her just grab the spool of thread back then, would Yeon Soo have lived longer?

74
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,410
Do you believe in such things, Mom? Then I will be a doctor now.

75
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,370
You're right.

76
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,100
Did you fix the boiler? What was the problem?

77
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,640
We've used it for 10 years. Parts were worn out.

78
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,340
But he said we could use it for several more years as long as we replace the parts.

79
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,980
 I hoped the emotions would be worn down after 10 years 

80
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,460
 so we could replace them with new ones, Mom. 

81
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,960
Oh, yes. Site Manager.

82
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,590
Oh, I understand.

83
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,480
Geez.

84
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,470
- Hey, hey. You need to go take a look. 
- Where?

85
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,600
He said we need to restrict all the entry from today. I was ordered to block entry of all the supplies ordered by Seowon.

86
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,410
Why? How can we proceed with construction without supplies?

87
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,360
I would like to ask him that too.

88
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,300
Hey, you're a contract worker from Seowon.

89
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,530
What's wrong with your boss?

90
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,770
Does it make sense to completely replace the suppliers?

91
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,750
 No, but the soil is so moist, we need to sink an anchor first.  

92
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,970
 How can they just put concrete over it? 

93
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,440
 Whose pocket do you think that anchor cost went into? 

94
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,370
 The supplier and the site manager are in cahoots together. 

95
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,500
 We haven't had any problems till now. 

96
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,390
 Why is he being so picky? 

97
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,980
You're saying it's alright since we haven't had any problems till now.

98
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,620
What if a problem arises? Then you'll just consider yourself unlucky and it will be over?

99
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,660
Why are they doing such a lousy job?

100
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,940
Hey, did I do it?

101
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,360
He runs out whenever he feels like it.

102
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,050
Time is gold.

103
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,310
Don't you know? On a construction site, every single day equals money.

104
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,050
Who are you to change suppliers as you please?

105
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,270
There is a rumor that Site Manager is receiving kickbacks from suppliers.

106
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,990
Site Manager is adamant in insisting he has not done anything he should be ashamed of. Who's spreading such rumors?

107
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,370
He's not ashamed now. Since he has not been caught yet.

108
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,070
Geez.

109
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,320
We're getting inferior supplies for the same price. Weren't you aware of it?

110
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,760
Wasn't cost important to you, Director?

111
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,390
You're polite in your manner of speech but the content of your speech is actually impolite.

112
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,280
You make me come all the way here in the morning.

113
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,370
You must be confident.

114
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,280
Did you secure the goods?

115
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,780
Yes, I did.

116
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,780
Change it, then.

117
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:39,980
In return, if you can't meet the construction deadline, I will hold Seowon liable for compensation of damages.

118
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,100
CEO, a reporter is waiting for your interview.

119
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,450
You're all over the place.

120
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,590
Heed my word.

121
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,550
After looking around your office, I am curious about your home too.

122
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,970
Next month, we will have a feature about lifestyles of young architects.

123
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,570
Can you show us your home too?

124
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,120
My home is quite ordinary. There is nothing to show you.

125
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,010
This way please.

126
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,410
His home must be really well decorated. It must be at a different level from our homes, right?

127
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,140
Yes, I think it would be different from ours.

128
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,270
It must be nice, whoever will move into his home.

129
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,630
No, I could move in there.

130
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:05,640
 The way he looks you, it's how a man looks at a woman. 

131
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,520
Why did she say weird things like that.

132
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,520
- Oh my, really. 
- What is that jerk doing?

133
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,010
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

134
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,540
Why are you blocking the way?

135
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,370
He's a funny dude. Can't you see how trucks are waiting?

136
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,160
- Hurry and move this. 
- You have to move this so we can start the work.

137
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,600
- Hurry and move. 
- Move this quickly.

138
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
 Ugh, I'm going crazy. Hey! 

139
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,410
 Hey, do you know what happens if you stop the construction? 

140
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,160
It will all cost money. Money.

141
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,480
Who are you? Move this quickly.

142
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,210
 Hey, move it now at least. 

143
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,920
 We can't just stay here. We have to hurry and go to other places too. 

144
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,330
   

145
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,230

147
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,130
Number 30 Lee Chul Woo. He's my dad.

148
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,080
   

149

♫  Somehow we are  ♫

152
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:38,070
♫  similar to each other, no.  ♫

153
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:46,190
♫  Do only my eyes see that?  ♫

154
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,500
♫  Our footprints as we walked together  ♫

155
00:13:51,460 --> 00:14:00,270
♫  Maybe that's why I kept liking you  ♫

156
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:11,460
♫  It's an old longing to you, but  ♫

157
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:18,140
♫  It makes me want to lean on you  ♫
   

158
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:27,350
♫  In such a sad story  ♫

159
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,920
♫  You're beautiful comfort to me  ♫

160
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,760
♫  that visited me one day  ♫

161
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:47,340
♫  Inside this cold story  ♫

162
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:54,780
♫  You are a warm place  ♫

163
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:04,570
♫  The day my heart melted, You were by my side  ♫

164
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,230
   

165
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,340
So Mi, I am going home first.

166
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,620
Unni, how about the development elevation?

167
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,960
I've uploaded it to the online storage.

168
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:27,240
   

169
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,350
- Where are you?
 - Where are you?

170
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,670
In front of your motel.

171
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,580
Are you inside?

172
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,470
Yeah, no.

173
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,880
What?

174
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,670
No, I meant I am almost there.

175
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,520
- Where are you now?
 - Coral Bath House.

176
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,830
I will arrive shortly so wait.

177
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,750
- Okay? 
 - Yeah.

178
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,390
Wait.

179
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,740


180
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,850
You said you're almost here, what took you so long. Are you alright?

181
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,030
Yeah. I am alright.

182
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,620
Why? Why are you here?

183
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,780
Have you eaten?

184
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,060
Eaten? Yeah, I did.

185
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,010
How about you?

186
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,800
I ate.

187
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,190
Then why do you ask?

188
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,210
I came by so I could eat with you if you hadn't eaten.

189
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,570
But you just said you already ate.

190
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,190
Yeah.

191
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,090
I don't like sweets.

192
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,870
Are you a kid. Getting food on your face.

193
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,590
Aren't you going?

194
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,910
My younger sister was a model for that ice cream commercial.

195
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,400
 Mild Dairy 

196
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,520
It's true. If you saw the commercial, you'd remember it too.

197
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,900
I do remember.

198
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,990
She was your younger sister?

199
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,030
Yeah.

200
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,380
Do you not look like your sister?

201
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,930
Pardon?

202
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,070
You two really don't look alike.

203
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,290
Fine. She was much prettier than me.

204
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,090
So I hated her

205
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,840
since everyone only liked her.

206
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,880
So I was mean to her.

207
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,380
I should have been nicer to her.

208
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,790
She wouldn't have left not knowing that I liked her.

209
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,370
If she grew up how she was, she would be a star by now.

210
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,350
Then my life would have been much easier too. I could have lived without working, thanks to my younger sister.

211
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,760
Oh, what a waste.

212
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,720
Thanks to you, I could

213
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,600
have dined with and dated an actress.

214
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,450
That could have been nice.

215
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,690
That's not true. How can you date an actress?

216
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,070
Hey, on that day.

217
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,670
On that day, I was supposed to go watch the World Cup qualifying match with Dad.

218
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,360
If I had rooted for the Korean team, we would have beat Saudi Arabia 5-0.

219
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,590
And on the next World Cup game, I would have scored a goal in a dashing manner.

220
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,770
A world cup star and an actress. Don't they go well together?

221
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,740
Oh, what a waste.

222
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,320
I know, whatever it may have been, what a waste.

223
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,780
By the way, did you play soccer?

224
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:36,760
What a waste. A waste for you and a waste for me.

225
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,980
I know. If that was the case, I would have dated a soccer player too.

226
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,920
How can you date a soccer player? That's a different story.

227
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,050
Hey, you never know what will happen in life.

228
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:54,460
How can you be sure that my younger sister wouldn't have become uglier after she grew up and I wouldn't  have become prettier?

229
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,420
Hey, you're all grown up now. But why are you like this?

230
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,760
Oh, what a waste.

231
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,530
Yeah, what a waste. What a waste.

232
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,570
You know very well that I can't make it public yet, Director.

233
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,750
Did I ask you to make it public?

234
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,500
Just tell me. Just to me.

235
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,390
Dad is still alive. What are you doing now?

236
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,890
- Hey, did Dad promise you something beforehand?
 - Oppa.

237
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,220
You're the favorite in our family.

238
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:41,490
- I am late. 
- Since when did we have to wait for you?

239
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,420
Sit. We don't have time.

240
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,310
Please sit.

241
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,800
Why did you ask us here? Even my mom.

242
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,820
Let's tidy up our relationship before Father passes away.

243
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,890
What do you mean? Chairman's health is improving lately.

244
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,690
Health?

245
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,130
Isn't it better for you to make him survive a day longer, Ahjumma?

246
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,140
If you took that much with my Father as collateral, then—

247
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,210
My mother hasn't received anything.

248
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,350
It's not like she moved into that house because she wanted to.  Chairman asked her.

249
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,800
Asked her. She's the one who seduced Father who was only focused on work.

250
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,930
Stop it. Did you call us here to talk about the past?

251
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,240
Since you two will move out after Father passes away,

252
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,820
let's give them what we need to give them now and get it over with.

253
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,200
In order to decide about those things, do I need to become Father's legal guardian?

254
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,220
Father's body may not have full capacity but there is nothing wrong with his mental capacity.

255
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,610
Isn't this what you've wanted too?

256
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,220
You two, aren't you tired of playing Romeo and Juliet?

257
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,590
Aren't you tired of pulling immature tricks like this?

258
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,150
Why? Does passion only grow if there is an obstacle?

259
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,940
- Was that how it was for you, Ahjumma?
- Director!

260
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,960
I am sorry.

261
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,660
I should have handled something like that.

262
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,650
You've established yourself a bit now.

263
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,930
Rather than for you to be misunderstood by others,

264
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,820
I will move out of the house.

265
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,490
No.

266
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,530
We can't move out just like this.

267
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,890
The walls here, at least Father built them.

268
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,790
Being humiliated is fleeting.

269
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,170
If Chairman passes away like this without preparing a power of attorney,

270
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,920
it will be difficult for Director Jeong to take over the management control.

271
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,790
- Then we have a chance too.
 - What are you talking about?

272
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,180
Don't say such things.

273
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,910
That family helped us when we were going through difficulties.

274
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,700
Mother.

275
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,460
Let's not cause useless troubles.

276
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,140
Mom!

277
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,620
I am afraid to be left alone. I don't like it.

278
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,510
I could take care of Chairman on my own.

279
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,610
Why do you say such things?

280
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,340
Don't tell me.

281
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,340
Did you love that ahjussi or something?

282
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,890
Is that why you moved into that house?

283
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,050
Joo Won.

284
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,980
Why didn't you lie?

285
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,770
Honesty isn't always the best policy.

286
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,900
Yoo Jin. Please talk to Joo Won. Joo Won,

287
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,950
I don't want to. Please don't ask any favors of me.

288
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,720
I already gave way once.

289
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,800
I plan to stay by Joo Won's side this time no matter what. I want to see what will happen.

290
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,340
Please go home. Father will be waiting.

291
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,210
 That family helped us when we were going through difficulties. 

292
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,430
 I am afraid to be left alone. I don't like it. 

293
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,400
- Go on.
 - Go in.

294
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,840
Leave first. I will go in after I see you off.

295
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,030
It's right here. Just go in.

296
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,930
Moon Soo.

297
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,050
Mom.

298
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,870
Oh, hello. Nice to meet you.

299
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,490
Weren't you standing here earlier?

300
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,990
No.

301
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,640
I am leaving.

302
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,850
I will leave then. Good bye.

303
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,750
You're leaving? Wait.

304
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,080
- Who is he?
 - Someone I work with.

305
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,830
Work? He looks like a hoodlum, what kind of work do you do with him?

306
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,770
Why do you judge a person by his looks. He's really hard working.

307
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,470
- Then work only. Don't hang out together.
 - Mom.

308
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,720
I don't like him.

309
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,440
His eyes look weird too. As if there is a story behind them.

310
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,420
Then how about me?

311
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,660
What about you?

312
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,340
I have a story too.

313
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,200
Then no one will want to hang out with me.

314
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,200
I don't know about others but we shouldn't say such things.

315
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,040
Always a smarty pants. Come in quickly.

316
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,400
Geez. Hello, nice to meet you?

317
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,410
What was that? It's not like you're on a job interview. Also, why did you flee? It's not like you've committed a crime or anything.

318
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,150
You're an idiot.

319
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:11,760


320
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,470
Did you drink?

321
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,380
Wait for me at the bar. Let's have another drink.

322
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,300
Aren't you leaving? You want me to get changed with you here?

323
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,300
It's not like this is my first time seeing.

324
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,170
Why are you so annoyed?

325
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,960
Are you upset to hear that your mother loves another man?

326
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,560
What do you know about my mom to talk about her?

327
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,950
How about you? What did you know?

328
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,960
I think I at least know about your mother's heart.

329
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,820
You're tall but you're still a kid.

330
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,920
My mom can only love my dad. Is it something like that?

331
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,360
I don't want it like this.

332
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,350
You're not here because you've missed me.

333
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,430
Did you come here because you were lonely?

334
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,950
Do you need someone to spend the night with?

335
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,010
Then I will call a woman like that for you.

336
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,230
I was wrong to come here.

337
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,900
I am sorry.

338
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,910
   

339
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,880
   

340
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,990
Then we could use everything here on the living room?

341
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,100
- This is the strongest, right?
 - Yes. Thank you.

342
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,830
He didn't come into the office either?

343
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,580
It's kind of hard for me to pick out the sample alone.

344
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,470
Is he very sick?

345
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,400
 Warm Porridge 

346
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,300
Team Leader.

347
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,040
I was just going to leave this by the door.
    

348
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,450
Are you alright?

349
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,170
Please come in.

350
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,410
No, I was just going to leave this.

351
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,120
I guess you've moved in recently.

352
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,500
I've lived here ever since moving back to Korea.

353
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,490
I am too tired now.

354
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,250
Oh, right. Just this—

355
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,800
If you can't eat this now, should I put it in the fridge?

356
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Please do that then.

357
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,640
I need to lie back down.

358
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,750
Oh.

359
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,500
   

360
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,070
Unni, I've heard that you went to CEO's house today.

361
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,050
Yes.

362
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:59,920
Is it luxurious like a magazine spread? Or very modern? Is the porch as big as a playground?

363
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,390
How is it?

364
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,340
It had a great view.

365
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,870
But what's going on? Why is it so hectic today?

366
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,350
I don't know. I've heard something happened on the job site.

367
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,320
It's worse since CEO isn't here.

368
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,380
   

369
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,580
   

370
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,830
   

371
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,100
   

372
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,510
   

373
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,040
   

374
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,690
This is just one person's schedule?

375
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,340
That's why everyone is in chaos if CEO misses work for even one day.

376
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:10,200
Jeong Yoo Taek said the value of time differs by the person; he was right.

377
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,600
The time I waste like trash, I wish I could share it with him.

378
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,290
Who said your time is trash?

379
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:23,450
How can it differ by the person? It differs by how you spend it.

380
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,560
Why? Do I have something on my face again?

381
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,830
No.

382
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:44,020
Jeong Yoo Taek should have seen this. CEO Seo does the job of ten people.

383
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,340
But what should we do? CEO couldn't come to work today because he's not feeling well.

384
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,450
It's alright.

385
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:54,730
He needs to rest even like this in order to properly fight back.

386
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,370
Fight?

387
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,170
You know better than anyone how much stopping construction for a day will cost us, Site Manager.

388
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,800
Am I the one who stopped it?

389
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,450
It was CEO Seo who stopped the construction while insisting on changing the suppliers

390
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,560
when everything was going smoothly on the site.

391
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,650
There must be a reason for CEO Seo to do that.

392
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,350
Stop waging a battle of nerves unnecessarily.

393
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,820
I guess you don't know the situation since all you do is give orders while sitting at a desk.

394
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,730
At the construction site,

395
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,960
waging a war of nerves is necessary.

396
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,090
I'm managing more than 100 workers right now.

397
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:51,780
If the captain is indecisive, everyone will die.

398
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,100
Why don't you talk after you set out the sail first? We can just switch out the captain.

399
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,570
I believe the investment company is here on an on-site evaluation.

400
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,610
You're not going to spread rumors saying there are problems at the site and ruin the construction, are you?

401
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,210
I'm a member of this company! A family member too!

402
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,180
My job is to neatly wrap up the construction.

403
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,200
Then CEO Seo and the manager have the same goal.

404
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,460
Finishing construction without any accidents, safely, and on time. But why are you two fighting?

405
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,790
Who's the bad guy among you two?

406
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,590
You're only a security guard. How dare you butt in, huh?

407
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,970
Who seems like the bad guy?

408
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,420
What? Why?

409
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,840
What are you looking at? Why are you looking at me?

410
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,210
Why? You feel guilty?

411
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,240
   

412
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,460
   

413
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,930
I'm really sorry. There's no work. Please go home.

414
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,550
This isn't right!

415
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,940
I'm so sorry. I can't help it. The order came down from the top. I can't help it.

416
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,410
- We came to work and you say we can't work? What do we do then?
 - Why are you saying this, too?

417
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,310
- This isn't right. 
 - You think I want to do this, huh?

418
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:45,010
- Are you really going to do this? 
 - Why? Why aren't you opening the gate?

419
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,180
They say there's no work today. Site Manager told me to send everyone home. What else can I do?

420
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,310
What are you saying?

421
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,660
Hey!

422
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,820
- Come in. 
 - Let's go, let's go!

423
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,600
- Wait! Wait! What are you doing? 
 - Come in!

424
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,130
What do you mean there's no work?

425
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:07,630
Hey! Hey! How dare you open up the gate to the site?

426
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,440
I'm sorry. I misunderstood the order.

427
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,180
- Where's Yong Chan? 
 - That jerk...

428
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,360
The vendors aren't answering our calls either...

429
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,360
Who would do that?

430
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,980
I really have no idea...

431
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,240
Oh, Moon Soo.

432
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,860
Yes?

433
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:47,970
I had no idea that I had such a nice view from my house. Thanks.

434
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:51,920
CEO, I think you should go out to the construction site yourself.

435
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,170
All right.

436
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:06,560


437
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,270
Open the gate right now. Don't be so childish.

438
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,860
Okay.

439
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,890
Oh, this, too? Fine.

440
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:25,890
There. It's open. Where are all the materials?

441
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,460
I'm sure you stopped everyone.

442
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:33,540
Then, bring them all back. I'm not sure if you can get them back though.

443
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,810
Good work. Fighting!

444
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:47,910
Pushing your way in when talking doesn't work. I've done it a lot and it's no use.

445
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:53,420
- Let go. 
 - The reason the manager is behaving so strongly is because you're too threatening, CEO.

446
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,620
Doesn't that mean we have the advantage?

447
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:03,320
Levelling out the ground and things. We can start working on that right away without any materials. So, leave that to me.

448
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,610
Isn't that why you stuck me in here? Use me then.

449
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,180
There's nothing you can do here anyway, CEO.

450
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,140
Why don't you get the materials back that the manager put away? I'll take care of it here.

451
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,080
   

452
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,250
Once we complete the on-site evaluation next week, the results will come out right away.

453
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,430
Well, you worked hard on that task that was already decided at the top.

454
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,570
All right then.

455
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,580
Hello, Director!

456
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,260
Why are you here? What are you doing here?

457
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,040
Sales. We'll treat you well. Please come visit us.

458
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,850
   

459
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,870
You do this kind of thing, too?

460
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,970
I do even worse things than this.

461
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,030
It's nice! It must feel so cool to work in an office like this.

462
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:15,570
Hey, hey, what do you mean cool?

463
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,590
The people on top weigh me down; the ones below me try to climb up whenever they can.

464
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:25,240
This position may look easy, but it's incredibly difficult.

465
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,790
Since it's me...

466
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,040
You're right. You must have it hard, Director.

467
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,900
I feel the same. Everyone thinks this madame makes easy money as long as I manage the girls well.

468
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,450
They don't even know that I try to market our place like this.

469
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,530
I know. I know. What that is.

470
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:51,670
I guess if I take off my makeup and you take off your title, we're both the same.

471
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,520
Didn't you tell your sister? That my brother...

472
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,240
Director, I ask for your sponsorship please.

473
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,650
I'll get going.

474
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,640
What's this?
   

475
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,100
You sponsor organizations like this? Why?

476
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:52,270
It's near the construction site. I'm trying to work well with them, so that there are no complaints.

477
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,360
Why does your sister keep looking down on my brother?

478
00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:00,170
Before he's the site manager, he's my brother. Tell her to mind her manners.

479
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,850
Okay.

480
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,700
What did you expect?

481
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,480
No, no...

482
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,980
Hello?

483
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,410
Yes, I know. But...

484
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,940
Yes. Then even the leftover materials—

485
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,220
   

486
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,310
What do they say?

487
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,810
CEO, did you get it?

488
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,280
How did it go?

489
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,890
I asked you how it went.

490
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,490
There is a vendor who is willing to supply us with the materials, but it's impossible this week.

491
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:41,050
Even if it's far away, we'll have to look into another region.

492
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:45,330
By chance, did you look everywhere in this area?

493
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,970
- Yes?
 - Hey, underground water is leaking from the drain. Send someone to check.

494
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:58,920
That's up to the manager. Call the manager.

495
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,450
I can't contact him! That's why? Isn't anyone there?

496
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:06,560
I mean, who'd look at the drain right now? Even the manager went home.

497
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,850
This is Seo Joo Won. I'll go.

498
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,450
Yes, it's here.

499
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,410
Yes.

500
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,070
Please be careful.

501
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,600
I'll hold it for you.

502
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,920
 Oh, no... 

503
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,700
Gang Doo? He left.

504
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,900
Already?

505
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,400
No, he didn't go home. He got hurt, so I sent him home early.

506
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,280
He got hurt?

507
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,020
Does he think he's some superhero or something? What if he fell into the drain? Why throw himself over?

508
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,920
How was he hurt? Is he hurt badly?

509
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,870
The hospital.  To which hospital did he go?

510
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,100
It hurts.

511
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,980
You should be glad your bone didn't break!

512
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,130
You need to watch out for even a stone sticking out on the street.

513
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,780
You can die even if you slip in rain. That's your body!

514
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,500
You understand?

515
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,310
You dork...

516
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,260
I'm sorry. Because of me—

517
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,240
She said my bone didn't break.

518
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,590
Granny talks like that.

519
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,110
It's my fault. Taking care of my body is part of work too.

520
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:42,160
I trusted myself too much.

521
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,790
Why do you live so hard? You can take it easy.

522
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,920
How much is adequate?

523
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:58,440
Well, I heard the building will be built anyhow.

524
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,190
The building will be built.

525
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,990
When you compromise like that, it also collapses.

526
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:09,540
When that happens, an individual pays for it and not the company, most likely.

527
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,850
That's why I work so hard.

528
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,510
Because you don't want to be responsible?

529
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:22,230
No. Because I don't want to compromise.

530
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,910
Done talking?

531
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,330
Yes. I'm sorry. Lee Gang Doo is hurt because of me.

532
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:47,260
You did that on purpose? Did you beat him up or something?

533
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,230
No. That's not it.

534
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,640
If not that, it's not your fault.

535
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,590
Looks to me, you're also not in good condition.

536
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,200
You look fine on the outside. Do you sleep at all?

537
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:07,900
If you can bear it any longer, mix this and drink it strong.

538
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,370
Don't take the sleeping pills.

539
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:17,950
Why? You think I gave you poison or something?

540
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:22,330
No wonder you can't sleep. Because you can't trust people.

541
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:26,180
- Don't complain and take it when I say so. 
 - Okay.

542
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:31,500
You can't even take care of your own body. How can you build such a huge building?

543
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,820
Why don't you answer the phone?

544
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:52,450
You. I can't even see you because you're so small. What are you doing hunched over like that?

545
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:56,070
If you're not going to answer your phone, why do you even carry the weight?

546
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:04,220
The battery. It died.

547
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,240
Did you get hurt badly?

548
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,490
I didn't get hurt.

549
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,770
It's true. What you see is what you get.

550
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,430
Why do you touch me all over?

551
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,510
It's nothing. Can't you tell by seeing me walk just fine?

552
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,860
I got scared!

553
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,270
Scared over what?

554
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,540
I really got scared.

555
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,710
I'm okay.

556
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:03,080
It's late. I'll take you home. Let's go.

557
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,940
Forget it. I can go alone.

558
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:12,910
You go inside and rest. Come out all healed tomorrow. Got it?

559
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,570
Yeah, Unni.

560
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,520
 If I don't call you in 10 minutes, just come inside no matter what. 

561
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,660
I don't have a watch.

562
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,920
- You're not leaving? 
 - I can't leave.

563
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,470
Let go and talk. I didn't call you to do this.

564
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:56,560
You said you knew Unni from three years ago, and he posts terrible comments like that? Why did you even let him in the house?

565
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,920
Both of you, let go. On the count of three, both of you let go, okay?

566
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,510
All right. One, two—

567
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,780
- Ten minutes passed, right? 
 - Three.

568
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,690
Moon Soo! Moon Soo! Ha Moon Soo!

569
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:16,460
- Moon Soo! Moon Soo! 
 - What to do...

570
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,420
- Wake up. 
 - Moon Soo.

571
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,800
911. Ambulance.

572
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,170
My cell phone!

573
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,080
Bring water, man!

574
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,090
- What to do. Moon Soo! 
 - Wake up!

575
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,460
Moon Soo. Moon Soo.

576
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:32,390
I'm okay. I'm okay.

577
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,230
What's your name?

578
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,460
Ha Moon Soo.

579
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,840
What's my name?

580
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,100
Kim Wan Jin.

581
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,580
How old are you? What date is it today? Who's our President?

582
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,140
Tell me your phone number.

583
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,900
Now...

584
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:52,570
- What are you doing? 
 - She hurt her head before and lost some of her memory.

585
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,770
I have to check.

586
00:56:54,770 --> 00:57:00,600
Hey, you. Who is this guy?

587
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:11,450
Lee Gang Doo. I remember everything. It's true.

588
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,490
I got so scared.

589
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,710
Hey!

590
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,660
Are you really all right?

591
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:27,060
You're not hurt? You don't feel dizzy or anything like that?

592
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,010
I'm okay. I'm perfectly fine.

593
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:37,020
But Unni, shouldn't you be the one to be his assistant?

594
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,400
Hey...

595
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:44,820
Rather than his drawing, I should look at his personality. I also need to check out his drinking habits.

596
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:49,440
I should never deal with anyone with bad drinking habits.

597
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,080
Hey!

598
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,530
You'd better drink a lot without turning it down. Drink until you get completely drunk.

599
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:58,350
So, why are you drinking there...

600
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,580
Wow! It's really nice up here just as you said, Moon Soo.

601
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,580
The best place for a party is the rooftop.

602
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:17,570
You know, you and me... We look so similar.

603
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:23,770
I feel like I'm looking in a mirror. This is so neat.

604
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:27,420
Hyung! Don't he and I look alike?

605
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:38,020
- Gang Doo, what's your relationship with that doctor we saw at the hospital? 
 - What?

606
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,080
You're so able. You even have a doctor girlfriend.

607
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,800
Moon Soo, what did I say? I told you all the good men have women.

608
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,220
My hyung's sister is a doctor. She's very pretty.

609
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,830
Who? Jae Yeong?

610
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:56,760
- Really? Your real sister?
 - Yes.

611
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,550
What? I can't have a doctor sister?

612
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:03,100
Oh, my. What in the world?

613
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:09,080
That rare good man without a woman is here.

614
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,740
Me? You're talking about me right now, right?

615
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,130
Here.

616
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,000
You're so innocent. Have a drink.

617
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,270
What? Need something?

618
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,310
Do you have a headache?

619
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,000
No.

620
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,690
Let's just order fried chicken.

621
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,620
Shall we?

622
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,200
   

623
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,850
I'll schedule your surgery.

624
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,460
No need to fuss over it.

625
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,040
I have to make a fuss. Or as a terminal patient—

626
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,390
Do you know how old I am?

627
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:07,710
It just said I'm a terminal case. But others see it as getting old and dying.

628
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,800
If you're going to say that, just leave.

629
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,810
Does Oppa know?

630
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:17,040
What if he knows? Just because that dunce knows doesn't mean I'll live longer.

631
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,150
He'll only struggle.

632
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:23,050
Don't ramble on with any of this nonsense. Be sure not to say anything.

633
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:26,350
How is a relationship between a debtor and creditor so close?

634
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:29,690
Your oppa doesn't owe me anything anymore.

635
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,920
He paid it all by living like that.

636
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,300
Why are you standing there like that? Aren't you going to help me?

637
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,380
This is illegal. If I get caught doing this, I'll lose my medical license.

638
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,870
Illegal? License?

639
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:56,280
Hey, leaving a person in pain alone is what a doctor does?

640
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:37,490
 The fact that there's landfill leachate 

641
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:41,280
 means there's more waste filling the space. The gas pipe alone won't be enough. 

642
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,630
 That means there's already an empty space underground. 

643
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:55,790
I was never anything to begin with.

644
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,000
Isn't it really fast?

645
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,700
 She hurt her head before and lost some of her memory. 

646
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,810
Is there a soccer match playing on TV?

647
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,370
No, last years' Champion League.

648
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:20,360
Why do you watch last year's game as if it's your first time watching it?

649
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,430
I usually watch the game after finding out the result. If not, I get too nervous to watch it.

650
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:29,880
Then instead of last year's game, watch the game between Liverpool and AC Milan.

651
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:36,410
One of the players scored a heading goal and brought the score to 3:3 at the Champions League. And they even went up to the penalty kick stage.

652
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:39,010
Do you know what the Champions League is?

653
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,370
I don't know.

654
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:44,700
There's a team called AC Milan.

655
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:48,210
Everyone said that team would win...

656
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:56,370
They won the first half of the game with the score 3:0.

657
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:04,830
Within six minutes of starting the second half, Liverpool scored three goals.

658
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,080
There's a player I like on the Liverpool soccer club.

659
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:19,070
His name is Gerrard.

660
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:28,860
That player scored a heading goal and it became 3:3.

661
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:36,160
And they had to do a penalty kick. You know what penalty kick is, right?

662
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:42,830
Yeah. I know.

663
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,550
Who do you think won?

664
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,790
Are you listening to me?

665
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,470
Can't you hear me?

666
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,870
Are you listening to me?

667
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:41,550
I'm listening. Who won?

668
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:44,130
Guess.

669
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:50,780
Do you think a miracle happened or not?

670
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,800
How cute, are you having fun?

671
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,880
And? Who won the penalty kick?

672
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,090
It went up to 2:2. At the end, Liverpool won with 3:2.

673
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:13,840
And I hear they call that game Istanbul's Miracle.

674
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,200
 Miracle, B.S. 

675
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:27,180
Hey, Ha Moon Soo. You're funny, girl.

676
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:30,710
You have no interest in soccer and yet you act like a know-it-all.

677
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:34,710
I know this. I heard it's a famous game.

678
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,910
I heard... Where did I hear that?

679
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,620
Forget it.

680
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,250
Come out and push my wheelchair.

681
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:51,180
Or I'll sue you.

682
01:05:53,540 --> 01:06:00,430


683
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,730
Make the rain come down!

684
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:10,100
It's raining!

685
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,460
Sang Man. Give it to me!

686
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:16,540
Why?

687
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,830
She'll catch a cold!

688
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:21,470
- Why not? 
 - Give it to me.

689
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:22,980
Why not, Moon Soo?

690
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,320
- Hey! 
 - Stop!

691
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,770
- This is fun. 
 - It's cold. Give it to me.

692
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:30,670
Stop, stop!

693
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:34,340
- Moon Soo, why? 
 - It was fun.

694
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:38,210
- It was fun. 
 - She doesn't know how to be romantic.

695
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,990
No romance.

696
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,980
Be quiet.

697
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,540
What did I do so wrong?

698
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,020
Be quiet.

699
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:03,730
I can't hear you. Can't hear you. Can't hear you. Shut up.

700
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,680
Please.

701
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:10,890
I can't hear you. Get lost. Please.

702
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,100
I can't hear you.

703
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,730
Are you okay?

704
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,640
How about you?

705
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:35,030
Me? What are you talking about? I'm asking if you're okay.

706
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:37,260
You disappeared all of a sudden. What are you doing here?

707
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:42,940
You. Are you okay?

708
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,280
I'm fine.

709
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,490
Why?

710
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:06,470
How? How are you okay?

711
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:16,060
You're really... okay?

712
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:42,270
♫  I have something to say  ♫

713
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,770
♫  Everything was fortunate  ♫

714
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:54,480
♫  Starting with meeting you and being with you  ♫

715
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,370
   

716
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:02,010
 So Mi, can I use that one just once? 

717
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:06,230
 You said you're going to the construction site. Why do you ask me for that? 

718
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:09,630
 - You look different. 
 - What? 

719
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:11,930
 Do you look more cute? 

720
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,700
 It's not there. 

721
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:17,420
 Don't like Ha Moon Soo. 

722
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:22,220
 You buy her good food, listen to her struggles, then, being a daddy long legs you lose her to the other guy in the end. 

723
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:25,180
 I don't want the man I like to be in that role. 

724
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:29,070
 Ha Moon Soo, Lee Gang Doo. Didn't you know the two of them like each other? 

725
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:32,660
 Who took that picture where you're smiling so prettily? 

726
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,420
 The CEO is just a CEO. 

727
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:41,980
 I wish you'd meet someone who grew up so well without any dark side. 

728
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:46,800
 Being sad and hurt. Those things are always with us. We have to accept that. What else can we do? 

729
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,240
 It's not fair. 

730
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:53,040
 You can meet someone better and live a fun life. You can do that. 

731
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:59,680
♫  In such a cold story, you are...  ♫
