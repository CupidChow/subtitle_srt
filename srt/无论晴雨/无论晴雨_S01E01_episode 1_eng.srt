4
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,970
Look at me.

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,790
You look pretty.

6
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,550
Oh, so pretty.

7
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,180
It's all done.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,960
Hey! Stop frowning.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,010
What's with the pout? Stop frowning.

10
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,130
Why do I have to go too?

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,190
When I am treating the director to a meal, who will babysit Yeon Soo then?

12
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,710
Your dad says he's too busy and he doesn't care about it. At least you should help if you don't have school.

13
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,800
I can only be in one place at a time.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,760
I have previous engagement today.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,570
With whom?

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,160
With a friend.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,780
Push it back.

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,530
Does only Yeon Soo's schedule matter? How about my appointment with my friend? How can I reschedule all of a sudden?

19
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,610
You said it's a friend. It's not like you might never meet her again if you don't have time today.

20
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,010
Seriously.

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,860
Don't make me repeat myself.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,520
Yeon Soo, don't sit back. Your curled hair will get messed up.

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,700
Hey, give me your cell phone.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,690
- Why?
 - Hurry.

25
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,320
Go over there.

26
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,340
- Mom, Unni (older sis) is meeting a boy.
 - Hey, be quiet.

27
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,260
Don't say anything.

28
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,070
- Mom!
 - Do you wish to die?

29
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,860
Hey!

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,940


31
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,110
You didn't leave anything behind, right?

32
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,960
If you can't find where to go, look this number. This is the number for the manager who helps Yeon Soo.

33
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,640
Don't get distracted, alright?

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,170
- You are going to buy me a cell phone for real, right?
- Just go. You always try to negotiate about everything.

35
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,170
Everyone else have it. It's always me who doesn't have it.

36
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,810
Says who? Should I check to see if everyone else really have a cell phone?

37
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,560
- Even Yeon Soo has it.
 -I just give it to her briefly whenever she has a shoot.

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,200
Hurry and leave.

39
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:27,080
Unni, the weather is so nice. Look at the sky.

40

41
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,130
Oh, so pretty. Just like a doll, like a doll.

42
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,020
She's so pretty. Look at her skin. It's like porcelain.

43
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,550
Unni.

44
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,030
Unni, I want to come too.

45
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,970
You can't.

46
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,130
I will just see his face and leave.

47
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,460
Don't follow me. You're going to die if you follow me.

48
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,350
Unni.

49
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,250
What?

50
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,120
What?

51
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,440
It's a dream.

52
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:12,000
A dream with the same ending regardless of what I do.

 Episode 1 

59
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,230
So you don't want to work.

60
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,220
I am not saying we won't work.

61
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,330
Please give us at least half of the overdue pay.

62
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,110
You must be full of yourself.

63
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,640
We are saying this since we are not full.

64
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,180
What?

65
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,160
Bastard.

66
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,960
Listen carefully.

67
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,870
You should consider yourselves lucky for being able to work.

68
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,450
It's not like I am not paying you when I have the money.

69
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,550
Look at those piled up containers.

70
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,370
We are not even able to pay the docking fee, so many of them get seized due to nonpayment.

71
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,790
It's difficult for everyone all around.

72
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,340
To share this difficulty, weâ€”

73
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,750
Why do we need to do that?

74
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,020
Who are you to keep interrupting?

75
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,720
Isn't it true? We didn't get to enjoy any of the rewards.

76
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,480
Why are we, the ones who get mistreated, always the ones to share in the financial difficulty?

77
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,010
You, step forward. Please step forward.

78
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,780
This punk, is he out of his mind?

79
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,990
How dare you blabber?

80
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,280
Just do what you're told. Instead of smart mouthing.

81
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,930
Do you understand?

82
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,350
Do you understand?

83
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,140
If you understand, get lost. You beggar.

84
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,070
Beggar?

85
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,410
Do you think I am begging for alms now?

86
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,810
This punk.

87
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,060
Aren't you going to let go? Let go. This bastard.

88
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,290
Pay up for my work. This bastard.

89
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,630
Call your mom. We have a customer.

90
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:40,820
 Please pay the entry fee at the hair salon.

91
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,080
Mom.

92
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,760
Mom, get up. We have a customer.

93
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,630
She wants to get a perm. Hurry.

94
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,250
Get up. Get up.

95
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,140
Oh, I am dead tired.

96
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,350
Why in the world

97
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,120
does someone want a perm?

98
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,690
Hyung!

99
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,540
Did you get into another fight? Did you lose?

100
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,270
If my face looks like this, what do you think happened to the other guy?

101
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,360
- He's pretty much dead. 
- That's right.

102
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,170
Eat this, Hyung.

103
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,460
It's good.

104
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,730
Hello?

105
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,210
I got it.

106
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,340
Where are you going?

107
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,760
To work.

108
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,470
You don't get paid even if you work. Just play with me.

109
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,620
I can't.

110
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,600
Why not?

111
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,460
I don't have a good mom like you do.

112
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,910
Then let me come too.

113
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,530
Mom said I shouldn't come here. She said it's dangerous here.

114
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,140
Anything you could make money is dangerous. So stop following me.

115
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,600
 Oppa, have some fun here. I will treat you well. 
- Go home, I said.

116
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,610
I will give you lots of freebies. Come with me.

117
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,830
Answer.

118
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,210
I am leaving. I am.

119
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,020
Go.

120
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,400
Oppa, have some fun here.

121
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:39,300
  Mary &amp; Club 

122
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,220
 At this size, instead of the building model 

123
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,560
CEO.
 we have to go with city planning. 

124
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,620
CEO.

125
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,570
Oh, I...

126
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,960
Weren't you supposed to be here next week? You've finished it already?

127
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,450
Did you even check the blueprint?

128
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,560
The blueprint?

129
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,330
Using piloti structure, columns are going to be spaced out every 13 meters?

130
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,030
You can't build it like that.

131
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,520
Are you the architect? Just make it.

132
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,660
Any revision, it's their responsibility.

133
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,020
Once it starts snowing, snow could pile up 30 cm in no time in this area.

134
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,450
Your estimate for roof weight is this low?

135
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,120
What if it snows? The building will collapse.

136
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,940
- Hey!
 - What!

137
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,020
Just do it as instructed. Please.

138
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,200
This is only for presentation purpose, anyway.

139
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,370
Fixing mistakes during the inspection

140
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,300
is their responsibility. We just have to

141
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,910
make the models.
 - CEO.

142
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,560
What?

143
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,710
- Why?
 - Do you want to live in a place like this?

144
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,550
Can you live here with your kids?

145
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,840
Please ask them to change the blueprint.

146
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,280
I will make the models in time no matter what.

147
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,810
That kid, she's really good with her hands.

148
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,010
But she's needlessly picky.

149
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,210
How can I make them break up again?

150
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,480
I wonder why I have to agonize over

151
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,390
these two characters being lovey-dovey with each other.

152
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,160
Aren't you going to make them get back together anyway?

153
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,220
Exactly, that's what I am saying. They are going to get back together but why would they break up? Why?

154
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,880
In other cartoons, people say it's too chaotic since the main character acts as he pleases. But these two,

155
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,340
- they don't budge. 
- Why do you need reasons?

156
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,340
Is there a specific reason why people would get together or break up?

157
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,840
Don't you know logical development?

158
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,310
Don't you know that the story has to make sense or it needs to be justifiable?

159
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,730
Forget about all that. You need to draw your main character more beautifully.

160
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,050
Your online cartoon is a romance, but you're being needlessly realistic.

161
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,600
Make the main character a drop-dead beauty.

162
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,020
Then even if it's not logical, everything makes sense.

163
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,940
So are they going to fix the blueprint?

164
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,630
What other work all of a sudden? What's so great about it?

165
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,790
Bio Town?

166
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,140
I don't want to. If they want me to just build a study (practice) model.

167
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,190
How great are the terms that they're offering?

168
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,230
Hey, why isn't she here? She asked me here.

169
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,290
Owner of the store is here.

170
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,740
Give me a glass of ice water.

171
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,200
They have loud and filthy mouths.

172
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,060
You're early.

173
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,900
- Are you alright?
 - Of course, I am.

174
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,370
You don't seem to be doing okay though.

175
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,700
It's not anything new.

176
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,900
- Why did you ask me here?
 - After putting the work in,

177
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,490
I was about to make good use of her. He beat her up like this.

178
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:06,440
You've heard that Bio Town will be built in Wooseok-dong, right?

179
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,350
- Where?
 - The rumors have been

180
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,590
rampant about developing the area behind the store.

181
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,890
The director of that company brought him here.

182
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,160
He was showing off saying he's the on-site manager and he behaves this way.

183
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,200
Forget about him since we won't be able to get through to him.

184
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,750
Go straight to Director.

185
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,590
Pretend like she's your younger sister.

186
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,550
We have to get some monetary compensation for her to get herself together.

187
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,830
He is looking for you.

188
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,740
Okay.

189
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,020
He will be a handful. Be careful.

190
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,240
I will take 20%.

191
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,530
This is why I like you.

Good bye, Auntie. Thank you for your hard work.

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,200
Your mom.

197
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,580
I am leaving.

198
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,540
Stop drinking.

199
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,820
- Why?
 - I have a meeting tomorrow.

200
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,630
You have to manage the bath house by yourself tomorrow.

201
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,950
How can I manage it alone?

202
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,370
Do you know how hard it was today, because you weren't here?

203
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,760
That's why you should stop drinking.

204
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,940
And make sure to get the correct amount for the entry fee.

205
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,020
- Like the last timeâ€”
 - You know what day tomorrow is, right?

206
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,780
People say your child only takes after you in looks but not in thoughts.

207
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,230
I can't read your mind.

208
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,210
Are you a bear (dense) or a fox (wily)?

209
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,400
Please eat some food with the alcohol.

210
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,450
I don't deserve to have food with the liquor.

211
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,040
I should eat it then.

212
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,510
You could criticize me instead.

 Mr. Technician. 

218
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,390
 If you just leave like this, who will do the rest of the work? 

219
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,910
 Then I will leave after welding some more steel sheets. 

220
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:29,410
 I will finish it fast. Wait for me over there while eating ice cream. 

221
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,080
 No! No! There is someone here. 

222
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,930
 There is a person here. 

223
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,600
Who are you?

224
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,490
I am her older brother.

225
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,790
If you came to have fun, then you guys should just enjoy alcohol.

226
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,730
Your guest completely destroyed my younger sister's face.

227
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,050
How did you get in here?

228
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,100
Get out. Get out.

229
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,290
Are you doing your job as a security guard? How can a loser like this come all the way into my office?

230
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,260
I came here on my own, so don't blame an innocent person.

231
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,770
I want to leave quickly too. So shall we talk numbers?

232
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,220
Her face is really swollen.

233
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,130
What was he so displeased about?

234
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,760
No, that's not it.

235
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,420
Even if he was displeased, he can't do this to a person.

236
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,780
When your younger sister works at a bar, as an older brother you try to rip people off?

237
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,010
Work, if you need money.

238
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,390
Don't try to take other people's money. Shi*.

239
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,310
That's what I am saying.

240
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,100
My sister just turned 20 and worked hard to earn some money

241
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,210
because she saw that as work.

242
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,170
When she's someone who could be your daughter,

243
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:02,260
she tolerated people like you and smiled to your faces. But this is too much.

244
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,790
Let's not get emotional. Just pay up. Just pay up.

245
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,500
That's what you guys are good at.

Seeing the world from a high spot like this,

248
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,520
don't people seem like people to you?

249
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,420
How do you know the CEO?

250
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,990
I guess we'll have to see about your skills.

251
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,350
Seeing that the CEO wants to work directly with you,

252
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,620
well, do you know him on a personal basis or something?

253
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,000
With whom?

254
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,720
Don't you know architect Seo Joo Won?

255
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,690
I don't think so.

256
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:03,410
This project is a large project. You'll have to make quite a few models.

257
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,730
Every time a new blueprint comes out, we'll need the study models for our presentations.

258
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,030
You'll have to come into office full-time for the duration of the project.

259
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,030
Work in the office?

260
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,050
I haven't heard anything about coming in to work.

261
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,320
Were you going to do this huge project at home as handcraft work?

262
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,260
All the famous companies are participating.

263
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,640
We're the only private company. Our CEO is so amazing.

264
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,900
It's not a project you can easily land with your experience...

265
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,760
The third floor here... Is it connected by the spatial structure?

266
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,240
With the open top, it does have an open view. I guess the sun will shine all day, right?

267
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,340
So that the movement is all the same wherever you enter the building from...

268
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,440
I guess you can do it like this, too.

269
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,380
What are you doing right now?

270
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,620
When do I begin?

271
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,570
This is storage, but

272
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:18,500
if we organize this, and when we get our laser cutting machine and work tables, it will be a useful space.

Yes, CEO.

275
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,210
Sorry?

276
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,900
Didn't you give the design sample to CEO?

277
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,700
That file hasn't come to us from the design team, so I gave him the original...

278
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,050
I gave it to him, but why is it sitting here?

279
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,630
Don't you know there's a meeting at 1 p.m.?

280
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,770
Who's going to take it to him?

281
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,290
I'm Seo Joo Won who has a meeting with him at 1 p.m.

282
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,340
He went up just a moment ago.

283
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:03,210
I'm sorry for being late, Director.

284
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,600
Did you have a previous appointment?

285
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,030
You came just in time.

286
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,680
I'm done, so get to work.

287
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,220
I'm Seo Joo Won.

288
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,750
I didn't ask.

289
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,310
Didn't you enter using my name?

290
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,170
Don't touch someone you don't know.

291
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,950
 I brought the files. 

292
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,410
 Where do I need to go? 

293
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,560
 See me in front of the elevator on the 16th floor. 

294
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,640
Sixteenth floor?

295
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,150
Ugh, I'm not even halfway there.

296
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,450
Look in front of you when you walk.

297
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,640
Are you...

298
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,080
going to stay like this?

299
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:39,850

00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,380
Why do you have that...

302
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,850
I'm Ha Moon Soo who was introduced to you by Builder Models.

303
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,570
Nice to meet you.

304
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,480
Oh.

305
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,350
Here.

306
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,920
All right then.

307
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,360
Excuse me.

308
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,010
Yes?

309
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,210
 1 

310
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,790
Take the elevator.

311
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,050
It's okay, this is more comfortable for me.

312
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,380
 16  

313
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,140
- Do you have any umbrellas?
- Hold on a sec.

314
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,030
It's 3000 won ($3).

315
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,550
Put it out in the front. It's going to rain.

316
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,470
Rain?  It's forecast to be sunny.

317
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,150
 You know what day tomorrow is, right? 

318
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,450
Hop in.

319
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,270
No, it's alright.

320
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,620
It's raining, get in.

321
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,000
I can take the bus.

322
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,190
I'm sorry for making you run an errand when you're not officially signed.

323
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,180
It's alright.

324
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,900
On top of that, you came here for nothing. My meeting got canceled.

325
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,110
I'm terribly sorry.

326
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,230
Please stop.

327
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,850
I'm really alright. If you keep apologizing, it only makes me feel uncomfortable.

328
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,570
Oh, I'm sorr...

329
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,750
I think it's become a habit for me to apologize.

330
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,180
It's better than not apologizing.

331
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,960
I looked at the blueprint.

332
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,650
The things you pointed out were very accurate.

333
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,480
In order to be able to bear the load, columns should be spaced out every 8 meters.

334
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,360
The weight of the roof will increase at least by 30%.

335
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,830
And if the snow piles on,

336
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:12,950
it will probably collapse as you mentioned, Ha Moon Soo.

337
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,230
That's why I urged the CEO to introduce you to me.

338
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:24,080
By the way, you walked all the way to the 16th floor?

339
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,050
Why did you skip the elevator?

340
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,430
Just because it's a bit stuffy not being able to see outside.

341
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,580
Here.

342
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:50,500
- You're going to get fired anyway. Just work with me.
 - I don't want to.

343
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,130
Then have a drink before you go.

344
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,450
I don't want to.

345
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,900
Why not?

346
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,660
There are no windows here. It's stuffy.

347
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,550
- You know the building that Cheong Yoo is building?
 - Yeah?

348
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,850
If it's a big construction, don't they need people on the construction site?

349
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,570
What? And you don't want to work with me?

350
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:20,310
I don't care what it is, just find me a job there.

351
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,250
 Ow! 

352
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,560
You got a boil the size of your fist on your butt and you had no idea?

353
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,960
Don't be dense. If you be that way, you'll end up spending more money than you earn.

354
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,810
Is it raining outside?

355
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,450
No, it stopped.

356
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,660
Aigoo, you must be hurting.

357
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:18,220
It's only called painkiller. They're all drugs.

358
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,860
Take it easy taking these. If not, you'll ruin your liver.

359
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,290
Why is there so much?

360
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,110
Please send it to Jae Yeong for me.

361
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,080
You can't even pay your interest on time, yet you want to act like an oppa?

362
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,840
She should live properly. She's different from me.

363
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,730
You were born from the same mother. How different could you be?

364
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,530
We're different.

365
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,410
I'll leave it to you.

366
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,780
Auntie.

367
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,770
Why are you here? What about Mom?

368
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,250
There aren't any customers at the bath house.

369
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,560
Your mom, she left earlier and...

370
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,010
Auntie, my bag.

371
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,850
Say it in front of me.

372
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,940
You think I don't know that you go around snickering?

373
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,770
Aigoo! She said she didn't! Stop accusing her!

374
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,720
I definitely heard her!

375
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,430
What? What did you hear?

376
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,750
Looking so terrible. You're drunk in broad daylight. Is letting your child die before you anything to brag about?

377
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,210
Living quietly wouldn't even be good enough.

378
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,780
You should be ashamed!

379
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,260
If you opened up your bath house with the money you sold out your child for,

380
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,780
you should put your head down and live a diligent life.

381
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,230
All you ever do is drink and go around all over the neighborhood. Aigoo, you're shameless.

382
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,910
Mom, your daughter's here. Let's go.

383
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,020
How many bottles did she drink?

384
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,690
Mom, let's go. Goodbye.

385
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,510
Mom, let's go.

386
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,730
Go and put her to sleep.

387
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,580
I will. Goodbye.

388
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:21,830
Do you also think I'm being unreasonable?

389
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,830
Did I seem that way?

390
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,550
Yeah.

391
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,350
Why did you do that?

392
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,350
- So that I won't forget her. 
 - Huh?

393
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:38,830
I should get yelled at so that I won't forget that I had to send off Yeon Soo first.

394
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,950
If I don't, I forget that sometimes.

395
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,640
If you can, forget it. I really can't remember it either.

396
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,510
You and I are different.

397
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:59,720
Mom needs to remember

398
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,600
because this is all my fault.

399
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,120
Why is it your fault?

400
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,110
It is.

401
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:13,260
It's the mother's fault when their child goes first.

402
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,410
If I live well, they'll say I live well.

403
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:23,930
If I destroy myself, they'll say I couldn't come to my senses even after letting my child die.

404
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:28,130
If I laugh or cry,

405
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,630
people will point fingers at me.

406
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:40,270
So, even if I drink and throw a tantrum,

407
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,070
don't hate me too much.

408
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,920
You don't age anyway.

409
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,320
 Moon Soo! 

410
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,370
 Moon Soo! 

411
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,370
 I'm so relieved. 

412
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,540
 I'm so relieved. 

413
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,570
 Moon Soo! Moon Soo! 

414
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,700
 Moon Soo, are you okay? 

415
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,130
 Moon Soo, can you hear me? 

416
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,710
 Mom. 

417
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,780
 Yes, it's Mom. 

418
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,340
My baby, you're alright!

419
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,550
 - How about Yeon Soo? 
 - Yeon Soo... 

420
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,730
 What are you talking about? 

421
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,420
 You were together. 

422
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,590
 Moon Soo, come to your senses. 

423
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,510
 Where's Yeon Soo? Where is she? 

424
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,690
 You were together, right?! 

425
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,870
 I don't know. 

426
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,810
 Why don't you know?! Why?! 

427
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:32,860
 Think about it! Yeon Soo! Yeon Soo! Where is Yeon Soo? 

428
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,620
 Why? Why are you the only one here? 

429
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,910
 Why are you here alone? 

430
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,990
 Yeon Soo! 

431
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,610
 Think carefully! 

432
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,540
 Is it her? 

433
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,990
 It's better if you don't see her. 

434
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,800
 No. Yeon Soo! 

435
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,300
 - Honey!
 - Yeon Soo! 

436
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,660
 I told you to be together. 

437
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,030
 I told you to be together! 

438
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,690
 What about you? 

439
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,880
 Where were you, leaving your two kids behind? 

440
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,900
 I told you not to go around selling out Yeon Soo! 

441
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,530
 Am I the only one who did wrong? 

442
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,270
 This is my fault? 

443
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:51,430
 Who's the one who didn't even care for the kids because you were so busy outside the home? 

444
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,130
 Where were you when I was going all over the place looking for Yeon Soo? 

445
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,580
 Where were you? 

446
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,500
 Ha Yeon Soo's guardians. 

447
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,580
 You still don't remember? 

448
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,860
 What happened at the time of the accident? 

449
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,620
 Forget it. It's not something pretty to remember anyway. 

450
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,650
 It's a relief at least you made it alive. 

451
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,100
 Despite everything, it could've been worse. 

452
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,610
 There's no such a thing as being relieved because things could've been worse. 

453
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,320
 Being unfortunate is 

454
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:20,460
 just feeling miserable. 

455
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,150
 Kimbap, Noodles 

456
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,060
Welcome.

457
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,570
I'll have noodles. Please make it spicy.

458
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,000
Aren't you going to ask if Mom is doing well?

459
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:29,460
Today's Yeon Soo's birthday. You should've stopped by home.

460
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,520
You came here to tell me that?

461
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,020
Yeah.

462
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,830
I thought you forgot.

463
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,970
 Coming on strong in opposition. 

464
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,330
 In the end, the Gookmindang and Minjudang are negotiating the differences in their main points... 

465
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:28,440
 Milky Way 

466
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:15,200
 Five hundred won, 500 won! Seriously!  

467
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,610
 What's wrong? 

468
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,970
 - Come over here. 
 - What are you doing? 

469
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,130
 What's wrong? Come here. 

470
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,820
 Don't do that. What's wrong? 

471
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,930
 Stop, come here. I just think you're so pretty. 

472
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,320
 - I'm telling the truth. 
  - Why are you doing that? 

473
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,110
 Come here, stay still! 

474
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,940
Aren't you going to sleep?! Let's keep it to a minimum!

475
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,620
It's not just today! Just keep your mouth shut and do it!

476
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,570
Is it good?

477
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:23,440
You feel like drinking when you fired me and ripped me off?

478
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:29,510
I get all the suffering and you get all the fun?

479
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,520
These days!

480
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,180
Bad guys live well comfortably!

481
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,050
What the crap is this?

482
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:47,260
Right? Ahjussi!

483
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,070
Why are you pointing at me?

484
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,020
Are you happy that you ripped me off, but you're eating pork?

485
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:00,490
If you're old enough, act your age, a**hole. Don't rip people off, man.

486
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,320
What's going on, Hyungnim?

487
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,880
Who the hell are you?

488
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,560
Excuse me.

489
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:16,770
Excuse me.

490
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,570
Are you okay?

491
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:32,010
Excuse me.

492
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,540
There weren't any hospitals that were open.

493
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,310
I can't just leave an injured person on the street.

494
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,800
Anybody in?

495
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,790
Yes.

496
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:03,610


497
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:51,440
  Noodles, Kimbap  

498
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,220
Are you awake?

499
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:28,300
I briefly cleaned your wounds, but you should go to the hospital. It seemed pretty bad.

500
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:34,350
It 's been ringing since a while back. I didn't want to intrude by picking it up.

501
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,960
Excuse...

502
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:30,990
You. Why did you come here? Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

503
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,790
- Did I say I wanted this from you?
 - Hey.

504
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,530
What's wrong with a brother giving his younger sister spending money?

505
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:49,070
You yourself live in a crappy motel like this, and yet you want me to accept it?

506
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,530
Have you been well?

507
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:51,730
Why don't you answer your phone?

508
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:54,290
Are you studying hard?

509
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,920
What happened to your face?

510
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,350
Did you eat?

511
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,450
Don't be like this and come home.

512
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,660
This is my home.

513
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,260
Are you really going to live stupidly like this?

514
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,600
Stupidly? I'm living my life to the fullest for you.

515
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,180
Stop acting like you're fine. It's no use to me.

516
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:32,220
Go. You're not suited here.

517
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,190
Bro! Where were you?

518
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,590
Why are you here and not in your own room?

519
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,900
Mom told me to leave because she's cleaning.

520
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,700
Did you fight again?

521
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,650
No.

522
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,600
Does it hurt?

523
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,760
It hurts, it hurts.

524
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,860
See... if there's beer left in the can.

525
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,150
A really pretty girl came looking for you.

526
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:24,960
She left after crying here for a long time.

527
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,080
You shouldn't make girls cry. You'll get punished.

528
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,020
She's not my girl, she's my younger sister.

529
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,960
Is it okay to make your sister cry?

530
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,970
No, it's not.

531
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:48,510
I think I've seen her before.

532
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,640
- Huh? 
 - Uh?

533
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,070
Nothing.

534
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:56,430
I don't buy coffee outside. The espresso machine here is an expensive one.

535
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,870
It looks expensive.

536
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:01,320
The CEO remodeled this place himself.

537
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,010
He got all the materials himself.

538
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:08,990
Seriously... He looks like he just put on any outfit, but he has such a great style.

539
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,890
Doesn't he look rich at a first glance? I hear his family is very rich.

540
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:15,900
Not just with lots of money, but should I say from a good family.

541
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:21,880
I guess that's why he already has his own studio with his name on it at his age.

542
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,490
He must be talented.

543
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:31,030
- Pardon? 
 - He didn't open up his own studio because he comes from a good family, but he must be also talented.

544
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,690
How is Father?

545
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:06,290
He's not feeling well today. I think it will be difficult for you to see him today.

546
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:08,880
You made time to come here. What can we do?

547
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,630
I can come again next time.

548
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:14,510
Let's eat. It's been a long time since I had your food.

549
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:19,880
I can't tell whose home this is.

550
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:23,430
You should take care of Father's meal first.

551
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,890
Go ahead.

552
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:36,540
When is your sister coming back to Korea?

553
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,760
Next week.

554
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:51,920
She insists on coming back. Who can make her change her mind?

555
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,410
Wasn't it planned out to be used for a commercial purpose anyway?

556
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:01,230
What's with the public medical center and energy materials?

557
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:06,460
There was an accident on the District C lot, and there are a few questionable issues with using the lot for profit.

558
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:09,280
Who still remembers that?

559
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:15,290
That was all because of your father. And my father is the one who had to clean up after all that!

560
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:18,230
Stop it. Why do you bring up the man who passed away already?

561
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,650
That's what I mean.

562
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:27,930
So, think of your deceased father and do a good job without any mistakes.

563
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,480
Don't worry.

564
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,060
Joo Won!

565
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,280
Take this with you. You only have to warm it up.

566
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,970
Okay. Go inside.

567
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:53,340
Joo Won. I heard Yoo Jin is going to come back and take over your business.

568
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,410
Will that be okay?

569
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:57,260
It should be okay.

570
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:01,150
I don't like you doing that type of work.

571
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,180
Doing the construction there at the same place...

572
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:09,710
I feel like I'm looking at your father. Makes me nervous.

573
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,830
It can be problematic. I wonder if you're getting involvedâ€”

574
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:16,140
Father didn't do anything to cause problems.

575
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:26,840
I know. I know that, but I was stupid enough to come into this family...

576
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:31,450
I know it was because of me. So, I thank you.

577
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:40,030
No matter how hard I tried, how talented I am, I couldn't have come this far to this position without those people's help.

578
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,010
 SOS 

579
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:53,840
I wonder if people saw me do this, would they still say I became his second wife greedy over his fortune?

580
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:57,840
I'm just an unpaid maid.

581
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,340
Go inside. Don't get scolded again.

582
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,910
Okay.

583
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,860
 I told them in advance, so go. They say it's a site maintenance team. 

584
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:33,290
 It might sound nice, but I don't know what kind of work it is. 

585

  Cheong Yoo Construction, Medical Innovative City 

586
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,800
Where did she ever find a guy like you? Does she think we accept just anybody?

587
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:50,160
What have you been doing all this time? Nothing's written here.
 Resume, Lee Kang Doo, Birthdate: May 3rd, 1990, current address: Gyeonggi Province Moksan City   

588
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,420
Spit your gum out, jerk! How dare you chew gum during your interview?

589
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:02,460
We rotate every week taking the overnight shift. Today, you'll work full-time. 24 hours. You'll work the night shift tomorrow night.

590
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:06,750
So, come to work by 7 p.m. tomorrow. As for your official first day,

591
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:11,220
Sunday... Hey, are you listening to me?

592
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:11,960
Ah, yes.

593
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:17,550
Anyway, the most important task during the day is to manage the access point. And that's District C where the research building will be established.

594
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,910
And I hear there's going to be a park here.

595
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:23,170
It will be built at the end, so you don't have to worry about it.

596
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:26,880
And if you go over there...

597
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,280
Hey, what are you staring at? Huh?

598
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:34,000
Move diligently! This is the beginning!

599
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,500
Okay!

600
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,760
Please analyze at least last 10 years of weather and recalculate the number.

601
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,110
- Yes.
 - This region is humid and the storms are frequent too.

602
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:48,690
Please analyze the users, equipment usage time, and transfer route to calculate the external forces.

603
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,250
Do you have the three-dimensional sketch of the lobby?

604
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,410
Yes, it will be ready today.

605
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:03,140
Today's meeting... I think the CEO is in a bad mood.

606
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:06,800
I heard from Cheong Yoo that a new director who is going to be on the project will come next week.

607
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,710
He's just looking over everything in detail before then.

608
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:12,260
They're still debating whether they'll hold an unveiling ceremony or not.

609
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:16,810
Oh, yeah. I feel uneasy about that, too. Must we hold the ceremony?

610
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:18,090
What about?

611
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:19,400
Don't you know about it, Unni?

612
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:23,140
Our construction site, there was a huge accident there.

613
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,120
Accident?

614
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,280
I hear they're going to commemorate by putting up some memorial before the groundbreaking.

615
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:32,900
It's worth commemorating. Only 48 people died in such a huge accident.

616
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,510
Only 48 people died?

617
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:38,620
Hundreds of people die these days when a disaster happens. Let alone 10 years agoâ€”

618
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,100
Forty-eight people.

619
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:50,160
Not only 48 people, but as many as 48 people died.

01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:25,540

â™«  I wave my hand and erase you away  â™«

â™«  No matter how much I try, even if I do that again  â™«

â™«  You're still smiling in front of me  â™«

â™«  I missed you, you were precious to me  â™«

â™«  All the memories you left behind  â™«

â™«  In all of those moments, in all of those times  â™«

01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:33,680
â™«  You always looked beautiful  â™«

634
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:47,940
â™«  All the memories that pour into me, numerous words that pop into my head  â™«

635

â™«  How can I hold you back?, I'll be here, I'll be here  â™«

 The person who brought me here. Who is she? That woman? 

638
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,320
 Did you see the man who just walked in? Who is it? 

639
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,240
 He seemed like someone from the construction site. You must like the type who is rough around the edges. 

640
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,730
 Do you work there? I think I've seen you before. 

641
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:15,190
 We were going to end up being a family. It would have been better if we did it first. 

642
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,740
 - That would have been harder for me.
 - How about now? 

643
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:22,380
 I am sorry about earlier. I wasn't considerate of the fact that you don't take elevators. 

644
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,460
 No, not at all. You don't need to be mindful of that. 

645
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:27,990
 I am mindful of that. 

646
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:32,260
 Don't expect too much from him. You won't be able to marry him anyhow. Don't have lingering feelings. 

647
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:34,850
 Did you get married out of love? 

648
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:37,600
 The result of love doesn't always end up in a marriage. 

649
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,350
 You might seem fine on the outside, but you're not normal. 

650
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:43,240
 Just because you're young, don't abuse your body. 

651
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,190
 How can I live without going crazy in this crazy world? 

652
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:48,760
 Do you still see things? 

653
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:55,960
â™«  All the memories that pour into me  â™«

654
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,230
â™«  Numerous words that pop into my head  â™«
