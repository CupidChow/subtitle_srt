00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:13,790


3
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,240
Gang Doo.

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,320
Did you buy Jae Yeong's gift?

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,900
Let's go.

6
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,850
Mr. Technician.

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,510
If you just leave like this, who will do the rest of the work?

8
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,390
From several days ago, I told you today is my daughter's birthday, Project Manager.

9
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,330
If I take all of that into account, how can we finish construction by the deadline?

10
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,290
I even brought my son to work here.

11
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,560
Then I will leave after welding some more steel sheets.

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,480
I will finish it fast.

13
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,220
Wait for me over there while eating ice cream.

14
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,730
Moksan Middle School.

15
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,900
 People say this as a word of comfort 

16
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,290
 This too shall pass. 

17
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,010
 They are right. 

18
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,490
 No matter how crappy the situation is, it does pass. 

19
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,190
 We remember the souls of victims who died in the unfortunate... 

20
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,780
 Except 

21
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,300
 Lee Cheol Woo, Lee Hyung Joon, Im Soon Ok.... Ha Yun Soo, Hwang Kwan Woo 

22
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,250
 The problem is they always come back. 

23
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,610
  Casualties 

24
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,100
 We remember the souls of victims who died in the unfortunate accident. We will remember their spirit and remember the pain of that day. The life they could not live out in this world, we hope they could live it to the fullest there. 

25
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,030
 We remember the souls of victims who died in the unfortunate accident. We will remember their spirit and remember the pain of that day. The life they could not live out in this world, we hope they could live it to the fullest there. 

26
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,940
  Space 

27
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
 Episode 2 

28
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,260
Hey, hey. It's slippery.

29
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,600
Why are you cleaning so thoroughly in the morning?

30
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,170
Ms. Ha Moon Soo, she's not here yet?

31
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,880
I don't think so.

32
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,090
Please call her.

33
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,200
Today is the only time I have to go do the site visit during the week.

34
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,390
- Unless it's very difficult for her—
 - I will come.

35
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,610
I think it will be better if Ms. Ha Moon Soo goes herself.

36
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,180
Yes.

37
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,530
 "Unbelievably disastrous collapse site"
 2005 S Mall Building Collapse Disaster Case Study and Measures 

38
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,420
 48 people... 

39
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,410
 Not only 48 people,  

40
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,250
 but as many as 48 people died. 

41
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,010
Oh my. Why are you still here? Aren't you going to work today?

42
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,410
Ask your mom to come down and hurry and leave. I will finish it.

43
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,840
- Here.
 - You have to do a thorough job.

44
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,030
It's not like this is my first time.

45
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,150
Aren't you leaving?

46
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,240
Oh, we have a customer.

47
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,450
Welcome.

48
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,070
 Pay the Entry Fee at the Hair Salon 

49
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,120
I was worried that you might be sick. But luckily that doesn't seem to be the case.

50
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,650
So Mi told me she sent you a text message. You didn't get it?

51
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,570
I did receive a message.

52
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,460
Did you intentionally not come in?

53
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,950
You are not planning to quit already, are you?

54
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,580
I am sorry for not calling.

55
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,690
Since I came without calling ahead, let's just call it even.

56
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,380
I am sorry.

57
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,200
There is no reason to be sorry.

58
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,170
It makes me feel like I am keeping a student from ditching school.

59
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,640
It makes me feel like I am not tactful.

60
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,970
I am sorry.

61
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,520
You said it's uncomfortable

62
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,590
when one keeps apologizing when the other party said it's alright.

63
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,120
By the way, where are we going?

64
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,140
Project site.

65
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,260
An accident took place in the past, so we have to be thorough in our preparation.

66
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,870
Please check the site so the model can reflect all the possible variables.

67
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,720
Don't put your trust solely on the blueprint.

68
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,930
Back then, it was hotter than the historical average, so many cracks formed during the concrete hardening process.

69
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,700
Due to the pressure from the landlord, they weren't able to postpone the opening day.  So they began the repair work of adding the metal sheets.

70
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,930
The building wasn't able to withstand the weight of metal sheets,

71
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,390
so a truss must have collapsed.

72
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,160
It did.

73
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,730
Because of the accident forty—

74
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,200
eight people died.

75
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,470
No.

76
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,480
It was concluded that the cause of the accident was a miscalculation by the engineer.

77
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,120
Since the engineer committed suicide,

78
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,100
as many as 49 people died.

79
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,630
 Front of S Mall 

80
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,020
Ms. Ha Moon Soo.

81
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,810
Are you alright?

82
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,320
Yes.

83
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,940
Please go ahead first.

84
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,930
I will stay here for a bit first.

85
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,720
It should still be warm. Drink it.

86
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,670
 Unni, isn't it such a nice day? 

87
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,670
 Look at the sky. 

88
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,470
 We remember the souls of victims ... we hope they could live it to the fullest there. R.I.P. 

89
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,330
Oh.

90
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,020
I wonder why this is shattered.

91
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,390
Seriously.

92
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,960
There is nothing here.

93
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,860
It's not like there is anything here.

94
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,080
Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen.

95
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,900
Nothing will happen.

96
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,270
What is she saying to herself?

97
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,040
Someone shattered this on purpose.

98
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,840
 It was perfectly fine even yesterday. Why did it shatter? 

99
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,360
Well, let's clean this up first and take a look around to see if everything else is okay.

100
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,890
Okay.

101
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,330
Please don't report it to the headquarters just yet.

102
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,870
If you find out anything, please call me right away.

103
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,900
Yes, I understand.

104
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,840
When did you get here?

105
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,120
Let's go.

106
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,090
We need to look around in many places.

107
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,660
So I wasn't the only one who was uncomfortable with it.

108
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,900
Pardon?

109
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,410
"This is the place where people died."

110
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,850
What kind of landlord would like announcing that to the whole world?

111
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,070
Announcing it to the whole world?

112
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,330
It looks like that.

113
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,610
- Just cover it up neatly, and start fresh—
 - If you cover it,

114
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,590
will it be like it never happened?

115
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,540
- No, what I mean is—
 - We are not business people with the sole intention of selling the merchandise.

116
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,870
Don't say it as if it's nothing.

117
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,450
Who did this?

118
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,040
 Noodles 

119
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,890
What kind of noodle restaurant opens this late?

120
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,890
You don't open for lunch?

121
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,270
 Noodles, Seaweed Rolls 

122
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,270
Ajussi, you know me, right?

123
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,550
It's hard to forget what you looked like.

124
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,270
Then you must know how I got here.

125
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,670
I wasn't thinking clearly so I just left last time.

126
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,540
The person who brought me here.

127
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,290
Who is she? That woman?

128
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,670
If you find out, so what?

129
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,460
Well, if I know, I will thank her.

130
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,270
It seems you work around here.

131
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,140
Just stop by for noodles when you're hungry.

132
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,700
Why won't he tell me? I am even more curious now.

133
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,760
 Ha Yeon Soo 

134
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,040
 Milky Way 

135
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,540
How come you are always beat up one way or another.

136
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,640
What's wrong with your hand?

137
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,820
Just give me rice.

138
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,300
For a while now, you've kept coming here to eat.

139
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,270
Your rent this month, I am taking money out for food too.

140
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,260
It's not like you ever gave it to me for free.

141
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,200
Mom, Hyung,

142
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,820
You're a hyung (older).

143
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,370
Anyone taller than you, you call him hyung. Frustrates me.

144
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,680
It hurts.

145
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,780
I hit you so it will hurt.

146
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:15,550
Same goes for you. If he's lacking, you need to correct him. You just let him call you that?

147
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,350
How is Sang Man lacking? He's normal.

148
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,940
No one acts their age anyway.

149
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,620
Do they?

150
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Eat a lot since you'll work through the night.

151
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,280
You need to save up money when you have work.

152
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,510
Don't even think about bringing Sang Man to weird places.

153
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,520
Don't get him hyped up for no reason.

154
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,940
Oh, baby, baby. What's this?

155
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,070
Let's drink some water.

156
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,920
Here.

157
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,530
Slowly.

158
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,550
You eat well.

159
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,050
Ahjumma, give me some more rice.

160
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,510
 Coral Public Bath 

161
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:15,250
 A fraud? You got hit elsewhere and why are you venting it out here? 

162
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,980
 This isn't even worthy to be called a countryside outhouse and you call it a sauna. This is a fraud. 

163
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,110
Hey? Are you done? Who has a outhouse as large as this?

164
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,850
Look. I have a bruise here.

165
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,050
Red clay in the red clay room is falling off.

166
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,960
- How can I enjoy the bath when I feel anxious about it?
 - Oh, here!

167
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,750
We only have women here.

168
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,440
We meant to repair it but never got around to it.

169
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,450
That's why you need a man around to run a business.

170
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,740
You mention "a man" in every single sentence.

171
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,810
Are you showing off that you mooch off a man?

172
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,900
- What? /  - Hey!
 - Don't be like this.
- You're so proud about it.

173
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,420
I meant to repair it. I will fix it over the weekend.

174
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,160
Auntie, please tell the customers to stop hanging their underwear in the red clay room.

175
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,570
This is a bath house, not a laundromat.

176
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,820
Red clay keeps falling off because it's too humid.

177
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,160
Oh, right. It's never their fault.

178
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,220
Geez, all she knows is how to be a man's mistress. Look at the way she speaks.

179
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,340
What's wrong with being a mistress?

180
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,010
Are you proud that your husband ran away and you're miserable alone?

181
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,540
Hey!

182
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,860
Seriously, did you hear what she said?

183
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,680
Moon Soo, you heard her.

184
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,910
That's not right.

185
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,280
You and my mom, you two have known each other forever.

186
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,780
Then please be a bit more understanding and overlook some things.

187
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,040
If you attack her with her weakness, that's like cheating.

188
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,890
Your mom attacked me with my weakness first.

189
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,080
- Mooching off a man.
- That's not your weakness.

190
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,870
Not every woman can mooch off a man.

191
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,420
Look at yourself in the mirror.

192
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,650
With your looks and your figure,

193
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,730
Eeven I would ask you to mooch off me if I were a man.

194
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,210
Who's side are you on?

195
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,090
Of course I am on your side, Mom.

196
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,630
You look dense like your father but your cunning in your actions.

197
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,530
Your father just smiles when he has nothing to say either.

198
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,220
He was only nice to others. He never took care of those around him.

199
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,340
He has no skills whatsoever but he's so proud.

200
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,750
He takes off when things get hard.

201
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,740
Why are you bringing Dad up now?

202
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,410
What's wrong?

203
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,450
Did something happen?

204
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,880
Does your dad have a new woman?

205
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,470
What?

206
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,530
 Application for a Divorce, Ha Dong Cheol 

207
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,760
Give it back to him.

208
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,380
It's not like I am putting up with him out of love.

209
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,000
This is all so your in-laws won't criticize you when you get married.

210
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,640
Mom. Stop.

211
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,900
I got it.

212
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,810
Got it, my butt.

213
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,470
Hey. You said nothing happened yesterday.

214
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,360
Then why did the perfectly fine memorial stone shatter?

215
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,320
I know. It's out of nowhere, so it won't be easy to find.

216
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,440
I know, right?

217
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,680
Who would shatter that for no reason?

218
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,080
It's frustrating.

219
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,350
How shall I report this?

220
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,980
What if I get blamed for this?

221
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,880
No, that won't happen. The site is so big.

222
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,650
It's not easy to manage this alone at night.

223
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,000
Right, right.

224
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,330
You could figure that out even after working here just a single day, right?

225
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,140
However, the higher ups always tell us to reduce the number of people.

226
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,420
Oh, you work hard every morning and night.

227
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,820
How about a cold glass of beer later?

228
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,410
Beer.

229
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,770
It sounds nice.

230
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,040
My mouth is watering just talking about it.

231
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,720
- Then I will get to work.
 - Okay.

232
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,520
Hey, don't fall asleep and watch closely, alright?

233
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,420
Don't worry about it.

234
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,520
There are no security cameras on site.

235
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,250
I checked the entrance too, but no one stood out other than our employee.

236
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,510
Is there anyone suspicious among the employees?

237
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,420
We did hire a new night security guard.

238
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,210
But he seems pretty dumb.

239
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,950
Please send me his personnel file.

240
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,890
Thank you.

241
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,500
 Don't touch someone you don't know. 

242
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:07,790
 Name: Lee Gang Doo, Born: May 1990 

243
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,500
 Since the engineer committed suicide, 

244
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,500
 as many as 49 people died. 

245
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,560
 If you cover it, 

246
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,340
 will it be like it never happened? 

247
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,690
No, it won't.

248
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,130
Seriously. Mom.

249
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,770
Mom.

250
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,500
Mom.

251
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,490
Mom.

252
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,870
Mom! Mom! Mom!

253
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,130
Mom!

254
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,940
Mom!

255
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,950
Mom, are you alright? Are you alright?

256
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,690
What are you doing? Hey!

257
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,790
Moon Soo. What's wrong?

258
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,770
What's wrong? Why are you doing this?

259
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,830
Hey, what are you doing?

260
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,770
Eun Soo, why are you throwing those away? It's a waste.

261
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,850
Seriously.

262
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:51,000
Hey. Moon Soo. I will take my time with those.

263
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,120
- I will only drink a little bit at a time. 
- Let go.

264
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,080
Why are you being like this?

265
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,140
Here, give it to me. Give it to me. Stop!

266
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,350
Let go.

267
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,320
You, so why did you?

268
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,520
- Are you alright?
 - Do you think I am alright?

269
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,930
I couldn't sleep so I drank a bit.

270
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,230
Then I kept on thinking about your dad and that woman who threw a fuss earlier.

271
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:30,380
So I got worked up so I was going to cool off a bit in the cold water.

272
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,020
Mom.

273
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,190
Yes.

274
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,950
If you're going to die, tell me first before you die.

275
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,890
Don't just leave without saying anything.

276
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,790
What are you talking about?

277
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,890
I would prefer it if you were sick.

278
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:53,710
While I am taking care of you, I will say the things I shouldn't say. I am tired of it.

279
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,700
"Mom is in pain too. Right, I should just let her go now."

280
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,490
That would be better than this.

281
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,080
Promise me.

282
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,420
You're not going to promise?

283
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,030
Why would I make such a promise?

284
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:18,340
Do it. I am scared, Mom.

285
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,920
I am really scared!

286
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:51,730


287
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,110
Do you work there?

288
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,330
I work there too.

289
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,250
I think I've seen you before.

290
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,620
Oh, okay.

291
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,160
Isn't the name of this bus stop ridiculous?

292
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,680
Excuse me?

293
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,750
Look. It says "Front of S Mall."

294
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,210
That's been gone for some time already.

295
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,930
This is the first draft sketch.

296
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,230
I could finish the rendering before tomorrow's meeting.

297
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,820
Regarding configuration of the building site,

298
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,220
I revisited the site this morning,

299
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,220
but I couldn't finish the land survey, so it will take a while.

300
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,410
Thank you for your hard work.

301
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,270
Oh, Ms. Ha Moon Soo.

302
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,910
If you don't like this project, you don't have to participate in it.

303
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,690
I am not telling you to quit. You could participate in the Sinsoo-dong office building project instead.

304
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:49,190
No. I will continue on this project.

305
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,910
Since it's a site of an accident. If it's uncomfortable for you.

306
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,610
I want to continue even if it's uncomfortable.

307
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,150
I will work hard.

308
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,940
Moon Soo. Do you know how many cups of coffee you've head already?

309
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,020
Your face is the color of coffee. It looks rotten.

310
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,860
Who is she? Who is she?

311
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,020
This project won't be easy until we begin construction.

312
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,720
Since if the company gives a donation, they could change the zoning,

313
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,830
the board of directors will try to make it into a more profitable business district instead of a medical center—

314
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,720
That's why I fought tooth and nail with my brother so I could take over this project while insisting on coming to Korea.

315
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,410
Of course, I did it all for you.

316
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,890
Thank you.

317
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,840
That's all?

318
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,100
Aren't you tired? Go home and rest.

319
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,180
Your mom and my brother. Home is more tiring.

320
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:25,620
We were going to end up being a family. Instead of your mother and my father,

321
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,760
it would have been better if we did it first.

322
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,540
No.

323
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,210
Thanks to that, I received a lot of help from your father.

324
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,160
I could have helped you.

325
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,780
No.

326
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,560
That would have been harder for me.

327
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,790
My mom doesn't like your father,

328
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,750
but my feelings were sincere.

329
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,230
Why is it past tense? How about now?

330
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,850
It's work hours. I will leave first.

331
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,820
 Moksan City Hospital Cancer Center 

332
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,290
Please bear with it. Just a moment.

333
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,890
What are you doing?

334
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,140
Wait a moment. Are you in your right mind?

335
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,310
You didn't even know that it entered through the respiratory tract and you're forcing it in?

336
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,040
I am sorry.

337
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,060
What if that patient suffers aspiration pneumonia? What will you do then?

338
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,400
I am sorry.

339
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,630
Are you just going to say you're sorry after you kill a person?

340
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,840
If this is how you do things, you might as well be a mortician instead of a doctor.

341
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:06,360
You've been awake for 36 hours now, haven't you? You must be pretty tired, huh?

342
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,700
Who asked you to put a schedule together like that?

343
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,170
You are the one who planned to have time off like this.

344
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:18,420
If you don't have any brains then at least get better stamina!

345
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,040
I knew you'd be like this.

346
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,630
 Korea Scholarship Foundation 

347
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,530
 Information About Repayment of Reliable Student Loan Principal and Interest 

348
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:11,720
 Principal: ₩60,000,000 ($60,000), Remaining Balance: ₩47,200,000 ($47,200) 

349
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,540
I think your bone is okay, but you might lose your nail.

350
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,860
You do a good job.

351
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,850
I'm not that good. I'm barely enduring.

352
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:08,880
Find a clean studio near the hospital. It's far and it already sold to another person a long time ago.

353
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,220
What are you doing paying monthly rent for this old house?

354
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,500
When I finish my internship next year, I can get hired as a paid doctor.

355
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,750
Then, I'll buy back this house somehow.

356
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,860
Why? It's not necessary.

357
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,680
Don't you know how much Mom cried selling this house?

358
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,900
Well, how would you know, Oppa? All you did was get annoyed with Mom lying in the hospital.

359
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:43,380
If you're living your life any way you want knowing how Mom endured, you're really a bad guy.

360
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:40,060


361
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,250
Aigoo, my knee, my knee.

362
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,980
My knee is killing me.

363
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,050
Did you place some food at your mom's memorial ritual table?

364
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,710
Yeah.

365
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,280
You did well.

366
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,240
You used to cry your eyes out as a kid asking for a loan to pay for your mom's hospital fee. When did you grow up?

367
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:34,910
Think about how old you got. No, you were a granny back then, too.

368
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:41,010
You jerk! Why did you call this old granny out this late at night?

369
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,110
The night breeze is nice.

370
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:50,010
Come out and move. Your knee hurts because you're sitting in your back room.

371
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,940
Don't worry about me.

372
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,920
Worry about yourself. Did you take all that already?

373
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,910
You might seem fine on the outside, but you're not normal.

374
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,740
Just because you're young, don't abuse your body.

375
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,630
It's already too late for me.

376
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,960
Something to brag about, huh? Crazy bastard.

377
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,080
How can I live without going crazy in this crazy world?

378
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,720
Do you still see things?

379
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,350
Hang onto your mind tightly.

380
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,110
If your body hurts, you can take medicine. For that, medicine doesn't work.

381
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:37,540
That stinks. Smoke less.

382
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,390
Isn't this better than smelling like an old woman? You want one?

383
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,900
Um...

384
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:45,740
- What's this about? 
- That's what I want to ask. Why are you sending this?

385
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,410
Did you get a girlfriend?

386
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,260
If that's not the reason, then why?

387
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,110
Just continue living as you have been. It's not like there have been many problems with it.

388
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,600
It's because there aren't any real problems anymore.

389
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,700
What?

390
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:10,230
Now that your mother and I don't have any reason to fight and won't have any more problems,

391
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,700
I just want to end it.

392
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,460
Dad.

393
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,350
I heard they're going to redevelop this area as they start their groundbreaking ceremony.

394
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,710
I'm going to run this restaurant until the end of the year.

395
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:31,200
Ten years. That's quite some time.

396
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:38,270
I'm sorry for leaving your mother to you all this time.

397
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,390
I didn't come here for an apology.

398
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,040
You're still husband and wife, so talk to each other face to face.

399
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,260
If you avoid it just because it's uncomfortable or you don't want to, then how can you call yourself family?

400
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,420
So it was his daughter.

401
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,220
Hey! Are you okay?

402
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,850
Excuse me, over there! Come help, please!

403
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,770
Do you work over there?

404
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,420
What are you doing?

405
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,490
He's not wearing a helmet and it looks like he's a minor.

406
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:58,470
It seems you have no license and have no insurance from the night snack bar.

407
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,430
- Shall we call the police?
 - No.

408
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,880
- Then do you want to at least go to the hospital?
 - No, no, no!

409
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,060
He said no.

410
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,110
Can you move?

411
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,270
Raise your arm.

412
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,980
Oh dear.

413
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,190
Look at me. How many fingers am I holding up? How many?

414
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,880
Geez, look at how nosy she is.

415
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,870
Try to lift this.

416
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,490
Yes?

417
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,080
I have to go to work. I was barely able to delay.

418
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,860
Don't worry. I called them already.

419
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,290
Our Gang Doo.

420
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,760
What do you want?

421
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,540
Gang Doo.

422
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,990
You did something that's bad for me, didn't you?

423
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:13,320
While working, there are so many times when things get so nasty, huh?

424
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,730
What is it?

425
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:20,510
I feel sorry for our Gang Doo but what can we do?

426
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:33,150
Great. He's here. Your brother is here. You should say hi.

427
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,780
I guess the relationship between you two siblings must not be that great.

428
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,950
What do you want?

429
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,270
I'm trying to help you make money.

430
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:57,160
Your job is getting beat up and ripping money off of me.

431
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:07,110
What are you waiting for!

432
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,030
Are you joking around? Do it right.

433
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,170
His pride has been tainted already. You should at least help him make some money.

434
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,690
Good job.

435
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,890
Again.

436
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:05,140
Your guests have arrived. Should I give you some more time?

437
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:10,110
Forget it. These lowlifes aren't worth it.

438
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,590
Hello.

439
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,880
Yes. Have a seat.

440
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,490
Have you eaten?

441
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,190
Everyone's trying to make a living, acting like that.

442
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,930
They bow down like that.

443
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,670
You think you're any different?

444
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,980
You should sit down first, Director.

445
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,970
Oppa, let's go.

446
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,900
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

447
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,040
Why show your sincerity at a time like this unnecessarily?

448
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:29,700
I was worried it would give us away if I hit you gently. Let me see it. Are you okay?

449
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,060
If you were worried then you shouldn't have worn that ring.

450
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,710
- Oh, yeah, my ring. Do you know how much this costs? 
 - Hey!

451
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,190
Sorry.

452
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,180
Why smile?

453
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:45,160
Are you okay? You go in there just because that jerk asked for you?

454
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,780
It's work. I don't treat them like humans either. All I have to do is smile at them as much as I get paid.

455
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,440
If I don't, I can't work in this field.

456
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,750
Here's your portion.

457
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,930
We've met before, right?

458
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,780
I wanted to meet with you regardless.

459
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,460
Turns out we ran into each other like this.

460
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,970
 Coral Public Bath 

461
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,680
Mom! I brought fried chick—

462
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,710
Oh. You're here!

463
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,020
Have some.

464
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,000
What about you?

465
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,710
I guess I got sick of it while cooking. I don't even want to smell it.

466
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:04,370
You eat a lot yourself.

467
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,860
How does it taste?

468
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,430
It's been so long since I cooked last. I can't tell.

469
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,780
I'm hungry so it's edible enough.

470
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,030
What's with that? It's bad?

471
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:26,330
It's fine. It's not like every mother in the world is a great cook.

472
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,950
It tasted okay when I tasted it earlier.

473
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,010
You've been so picky about food ever since you were a child.

474
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,310
What do we do?

475
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:42,370
What else? Put some sesame oil and fry it or something. Eat it somehow.

476
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,700
You're going to eat it all, okay?

477
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,660
You're too mean.

478
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,850
What do I do? Geez!

479
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,500
You bought fried chicken earlier, didn't you?

480
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,290
That's right.

481
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,840
- Let's eat this. 
 - Eat this.

482
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,460
I shouldn't have cooked.

483
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,980
I'm glad I bought this.

484
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,910
Let's eat!

485
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:12,050
- This is much better.
 - It's good.

486
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:22,720


487
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:42,180
 He's not wearing a helmet. And it looks like he's a minor. 

488
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,090
 - Then do you at least want to go to the hospital?
 - No, no, no. 

489
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,660
 He said no. 

490
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,890
That's right. That's it.

491
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:55,310
What the heck? He doesn't even think about me saving him last time. He acts so cocky.

492
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,020
That's why he goes around getting beat up like that.

493
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,040
What in the world...

494
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:13,270
Unni, you know that woman who's tall and came in as if she's somebody? You know who that is?

495
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,600
You said she's the director from headquarters.

496
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:20,950
That's not it. I heard that woman used to date our CEO.

497
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,840
What's with that reaction?

498
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,170
No wonder. I thought they looked good together.

499
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:30,510
What do you mean they look good together? I heard the CEO got dumped by her, quit everything, and went overseas to study.

500
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:34,450
And she appears for this project. Did she feel she wasted her chance after she dumped him?

501
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:37,110
What a joke. Why'd she come back—

502
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,650
Are the materials ready?

503
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,960
Should I print it out or send it to you by e-mail?

504
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,780
We're going to take them in person.

505
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,350
You know, I... went to the women's public bath until I was eight years old.

506
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:29,890
What?

507
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:35,400
Father was busy. So, Mother lied and said I was five years old and took me in.

508
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,170
I knew everything by then.

509
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,690
Ah, I used to be very small when I was little. I had a sudden growth spurt in junior high school.

510
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:49,300
But you can't do that nowadays.

511
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,360
We have to pay penalty. The customers feel uncomfortable, too.

512
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:59,020
I didn't feel comfortable either. I even ran into a girl in my class.

513
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,300
The grandmas kept wanting to touch me, too.

514
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,990
Some people are like that.

515
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,130
By the way, why are you telling me this right now?

516
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,020
We're here.

517
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,980
District C Research buildings are 100% energy self-generating.

518
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,730
District B Silver Town will be constructed with solar houses that self-generate 70% of their energy.

519
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,450
Your intention is good and all. The problem is it costs a lot.

520
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:44,360
Why do you keep trying to do art with someone else's money? Let's make the unit price work.

521
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,790
If we have this amount of renewable energy facilities, we will be able to receive 50% of the investment amount through government funding.

522
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,010
It's worth pursuing.

523
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,770
Please continue.

524
00:56:54,990 --> 00:57:00,190
Since Silver Town will be built, our intention is to lower the access points and entryways as much as possible.

525
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:07,050
According to the principle of separating paths for the vehicles and pedestrians, 3m of space will be allocated for the pedestrian walkway.

526
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:13,380
Designing using panels, we will try to avoid the simple office building design.

527
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,990
We're going to have dinner together tonight, right?

528
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,950
I heard your mother was going to join us, too. Did she contact you?

529
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,920
Yeah. I heard about it.

530
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,940
Wait for me. We can go together in my car.

531
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,550
No, thanks. I brought my own car.

532
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,590
Let's go together. Send your car back with your driver—

533
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:59,020
Excuse me. I'll get going first.

534
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,750
I thought you'd be going this way.

535
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,770
She said you were going to dinner though.

536
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:25,490
There's still time until dinner.

537
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,230
I'm sorry about earlier.

538
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,030
Excuse me?

539
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:33,630
I wasn't considerate of the fact that you don't take elevators.

540
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,230
No, not at all. You don't need to be mindful of that.

541
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:38,660
I am mindful of that.

542
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,510
Don't expect too much from him.

543
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:08,670
He knew it would never work out with you. Yet he used his mom to come into our family. He's way above average.

544
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,200
You won't be able to marry him anyhow. Don't have lingering feelings.

545
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,730
Did you get married out of love?

546
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:18,600
The result of love isn't always marriage.

547
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,260
He is mindful of you? How dare he try to flirt with you?

548
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,400
Anyway, men go around poking everyone.

549
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,850
Unni.

550
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,010
He's trying to make a move on you.

551
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:37,190
What must be wrong with our CEO that he would say that about someone like me? He's really really tall.

552
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,330
I feel like a total peanut standing next to him.

553
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:45,260
Men are attractive when they're small and stout. If he's tall, your neck would hurt.

554
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:52,550
And what's supposed to be so wrong with you? Do you think he's that perfect?

555
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:57,780
Look. He's a totally rich and competent person who can do anything.

556
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,880
He may be a bad boy on the outside, but he only has eyes for one woman.

557
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,550
I did make him up, but does that make sense? It's a total lie.

558
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,380
Unni.

559
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,180
Women know it's all a lie.

560
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,250
But why do we all fall for men in dramas or movies?

561
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,600
Because none exist in the real world.

562
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,880
The guy by my side, he looks down on women even though he's incompetent,

563
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,580
treats a woman as a doormat if she is nice to him, criticizes the woman for caring only about money if she rejects him.

564
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:28,490
He gets you pregnant, yet places all the responsibility on the woman.

565
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:32,940
What's this about? What happened?

566
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,330
 We're getting married. 
 Is Gi Ho Sunbae getting married?

567
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,880
Wait, wait, wait. Are you getting married, Unni?

568
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,320
Look at it clearly. 
  Bride, Kim So Hyeon 

569
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,610
Weren't you and Gi Ho Sunbae dating, Unni?

570
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:57,070
I thought we were, but I guess he didn't. I must've liked him by myself.

571
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,010
So what if you liked him more?

572
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:04,190
Sending a text like that. Could he be so rude? Bastard.

573
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:10,110
I know. Why did I like a bad guy like that?

574
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:12,320
In the end, I was the one who was an idiot.

575
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,230
Why do you say that?

576
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,850
That's easier.

577
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:27,240
If I think I was the one who misunderstood him, I can't badmouth him saying he's a bad guy.

578
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,050
I'm just going to group all the men together and badmouth them.

579
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:33,010
I'm going to cuss today. You'll have some beer, right?

580
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:37,680
Let's do that. I also met some strange guy that I want to cuss out.

581
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,420
Who?

582
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,870
Hyung.

583
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,720
Sang Man, nice timing.

584
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,180
You're not working today?

585
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,910
I should take a day off, you know.

586
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:13,600
Are you off tomorrow, too?

587
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,430
No way. You think living is that easy?

588
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:20,040
Then, can I go with you?

589
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,870
No, you can't.

590
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:24,850
- Why not? 
 - What do you mean why? I have to work.

591
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,900
What kind of work?

592
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,040
 Who? 

593
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,940
I'm asking if you did that because Director Jung asked you to do that.

594
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:40,440
Do I have to do it if that moron asks me to do something? Do I look that easy?

595
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,770
Then, you destroyed it even though he didn't ask you to do that?

596
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:48,970
What went on with Director Jung last time? And how did you come here?

597
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:54,710
Look, Ahjussi. This is my turf. You guys came to where I was...

598
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:59,600
Why am I explaining this to you?

599
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,200
It's 18 million won ($18,000).

600
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,170
The memorial that you destroyed.

601
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,100
I never said I did it.

602
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,500
- Can you pay for it? 
 - Why should I?

603
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:17,290
Looks like you'll just pay in jail time if I report you to the police.

604
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:21,610
Shut up.

605
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:23,640
I'll forget about it.

606
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:32,710
Instead, I have a condition.

607
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,840
What is it?

608
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:40,580
Something fun.

609
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,880
I must be my mother's daughter.

610
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:25,340
I'm crazy, crazy.

611
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:41,350
You're the best, Auntie. Thanks.

612
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:46,760
How's Mom? Oh, why all of a sudden?

613
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:51,960
Of course. It's best not to have anything happen.

614
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,340
I got it.

615
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,740
Unni, you're late.

616
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:25,690
- Sorry. Did you see the man who just walked in? Who is it?
 - Oh, my...

617
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:28,290
Why is your face red?

618
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:31,590
You must like the type who is rough around the edges.

619
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:32,570
So Mi.

620
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:34,340
He seemed like someone from the construction site.

621
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:40,020
Once they start construction, they'll need someone who will check the progress on site. Don't you think they picked someone in advance?

622
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,690
What in the world? The smell of alcohol.

623
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:49,960
Unni, you're the worst today of all the days I've seen you.

624
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:57,430
Looking at you closely, daebak— You'll age fast this way. Your pores are this big.

625
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:58,260
What?

626
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:03,450
Before you criticize someone else's face, take a look at your own face first.

627
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:22,660
After considering the suggestion you made... are you asking me to be your spy?

628
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,790
I guess you can see it that way.

629
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:28,920
What do you trust about me? Why me? Don't people usually make their close friends do this kind of thing?

630
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,180
The relationship that's tied with money is more trustworthy.

631
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:38,350
The only experience I have on site is doing odd jobs. Figuring out what's going on at the construction site, that's another story, isn't it?

632
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:43,410
You just have to make a complete record of what goes on at the site. I'll be the one making the determination.

633
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:45,280
What's the reason you would go to that extent?

634
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,790
Twelve years ago when the accident happened, there were a total of 11 workers who died at the site.

635
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:54,240
Do you know what the funny thing is?

636
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,730
The morons who said everything would be okay were never at the site.

637
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:06,710
The people who brought attention to the problems and, despite the criticisms they received, stayed on the site till the end to do the repair work, only those people were harmed.

638
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:12,390
People who would've just wanted to have a glass of soju after work.

639
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,020
I wouldn't let it be left that way.

640
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:23,210
What are you saying? Are you saying there are still problems even now?

641
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:30,700
No. I'm just trying to prevent things before problems arise.

642
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,070
Deal.

643
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:36,310
I like that you're straightforward.

644
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:51,170
You're not asking me why I destroyed that.

645
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:57,210
I'm not interested in what already has happened. It will only sound like an excuse even if you told me.

646
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:02,110
To me, what you're going to do in the future is more important.

647
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,030
You still smell.

648
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:34,010
I can smell the alcohol on you.

649
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,530
I'm seeing you often.

650
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,450
You work at Seo Won, right?

651
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,470
I guess I'll be seeing you often in the future.

652
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:07,300
Excuse me. I'm telling you since you work in this field. But don't be like that on the construction site

653
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:11,990
since one mistake could put everyone at risk and harm everyone on the construction site.

654
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:14,770
You should trust one another and help one another even if it's not your job.

655
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:17,320
Help what?

656
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:24,330
Especially at those places, you shouldn't be relaxed while trusting others.

657
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:30,120
Trust the person next to me in dangerous situations? I don't want to.

658
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:14,280
 Over here... 

659
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,410
 Over here! 

660
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,250
 Here's a survivor! 

661
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,250
 Survivor here! 

662
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,670
 Here! Survivor! There's a survivor! 

663
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:26,090
 Survivor! Hurry! 

664
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,970
 There's a survivor here! 

665
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:16,350
Fine.

666
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,910
 Over there! Careful! 

667
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,620
 No! 

668
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:52,750


669
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:56,290
 There's someone here! 

670
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:59,050
 There's someone here! 

671
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:09,320
When you're about to die, the only person you care for is yourself.

672
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:17,950
♫  I take a breath. I work again  ♫

673
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:25,550
♫  I just go on living another day as if nothing matters  ♫

674
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:35,750
♫  I miss you, I just want to hear you  ♫

675
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,190
 Just Between Lovers 
♫  I want to feel you just for a moment  ♫

676
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:41,010
 I'm going to touch your body. 

677
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:42,320
 What are you doing? 

678
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,890
 All you have to say is thank you. 

679
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:45,160
 - Are you guys close? 
 - Yeah. 

680
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,380
 Why? I'm not supposed to know any woman? You're acting as if you don't know me. 

681
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:50,700
 You don't have to act like you don't know me here. 

682
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,780
 Do you two know each other on a personal level? 

683
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,550
 - Yes. 
 - No. 

684
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:59,050
 People are attracted to someone bad rather than someone very proper. 

685
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:01,750
 It's okay. I don't like sweets. 

686
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,080
 It's really good. 

687
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,040
 Then, I'll just have a taste. 

688
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,590
 You weren't going to tell me? 

689
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,740
 It's nothing much. 

690
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:14,460
 Even if it's not much... I don't feel good hearing about you through other people. 

691
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,620
 I'm sorry. I stepped over the boundary. 

692
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:19,150
 You can keep stepping over your boundary. 

693
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:22,820
 He asked if we're going to rebuild the memorial stone or demolish it. 

694
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:25,910
 The person who destroyed the memorial stone was Lee Gang Doo. 

695
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:28,220
 - Hold it.
 - Do you think he knew it when he asked that? 

696
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:36,240
♫  My days are empty because no one is here. That's why I keep looking for you  ♫
