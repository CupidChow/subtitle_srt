  Episode 14 

12
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,340
How did you know Moon Soo likes a man who eats carrots?

13
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,540
Carrots?

14
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,880
Yeah. When she sees a man who eats carrots or beans, she stares at him without shame.

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
I do?

16
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,320
But isn't it nice?

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,430
What's so good about it?

18
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,120
It's good for your body.

19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,660
He wouldn't be picky about food. Don't you think he'd have a great personality?

20
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,590
You like beans, too, right?

21
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,550
Yeah.

22
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,580
See?

23
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,470
He can't eat chicken feet or soju.

24
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,800
But she says he's not picky.

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,650
Did you see that?

26
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,240
Love... Love makes people become so biased.

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,920
Drink.

28
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,230
But why is that hyung even here?

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,980
To someone who doesn't know darkness, there's no light for him either.

30
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,410
Live conquering darkness.

31
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,120
It says then you'd be able to see the light.

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,260
This is a true teacher.

33
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,090
Why are you out here?

34
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,730
Let's go together up to there.

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,150
It's pretty.

36
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,030
You go first.

37
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,320
I don't ever see a snowman even when it snows.

38
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,040
Do you remember when the last time you made a snowman was?

39
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,890
Um... When I was in elementary school?

40
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,910
Me, too. That was the last time for me, too.

41
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,380
Should we make one?

42
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,120
When did you come and make all this?

43
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,230
I only warmed things up. Your husband is a great cook.

44
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,130
Eat.

45
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,560
She said she's sleeping over at her cartoonist friend's and going straight to work.

46
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,230
I have to hurry up and go down. Your husband is watching the ticketing box.

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,100
Come down after you eat everything.

48
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,910
Hold me.

49
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,310
Yoo Jin.

50
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,950
I won't expect anything.

51
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,100
Hold me.

52
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,330
Joo Won.

53
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,510
Sleep more. I'll go first.

54
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,570
Thanks.

55
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,990
Goodbye.

56
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,050
You came early.

57
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,380
Hello.

58
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,590
CEO!

59
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,980
You two are both wearing the same thing as yesterday.

60
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,690
You must've slept out.

61
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,750
Let's go inside.

62
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,820
- I slept at a friend's house— 
 - As for you, I don't care whether you sleep over at your friend's house or sleep with Gang Doo.

63
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,450
I wonder where the CEO slept.

64
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,560
Did you see how wrinkled his shirt was?

65
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,050
He's not like that.

66
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,730
Could it be Director Jeong? It wouldn't be, right?

67
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,540
 Thanks. 

68
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,180
 Goodbye. 

69
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,300
Unni, the landscape design team is asking you to send over the memorial sample. They're starting on their design.

70
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,240
That will determine whether they'll use stepping stones or blocks for the pavement.

71
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,080
Okay.

72
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,550
Hey, Gang Doo, the Moksan Environment is sending more workers at 11 am for the dismantling work.

73
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,090
Check the number of workers and manage well when the company leaves.

74
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,260
You said it's all the wreckage from the time that the shopping mall collapsed.

75
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,160
Is it okay to take care of all that like it's waste?

76
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,470
When you think about it, it's the same as the waste that you create when you demolish buildings.

77
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,480
The waste management company will take care of it anyway. We don't have to concern ourselves.

78
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,330
It's the same?

79
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,520
- But we should still confirm. 
 - We did. Your CEO did.

80
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,320
- CEO Seo? 
 - Yeah.

81
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,890
I felt uneasy, so I mentioned it to him.

82
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:06,070
He came by himself and checked. And he told me to manage it as waste.

83
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,180
 I wait for you every day in front of the house, Son Choi Seong Jae  

84
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,600
 I wait for you every day in front of the house, Son Choi Seong Jae, To my lovely wife Jeong Mi Gyeong. Moongchi was with her to the end, I'm still waiting for you, Moon Byeong Ho. ] 

85
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,090
Why do you keep sighing?

86
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,940
I did?

87
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,500
Yeah.

88
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,690
Did you make a mistake yesterday?

89
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,810
You wore underwear that doesn't match.

90
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,950
It's nothing like that.

91
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,510
I told you that I slept over at a friend's house.

92
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,760
See? Unni.

93
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,750
It's no use, no matter how hard you try to forget.

94
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,850
The things you really want to forget about, you remember them forever.

95
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,640
It's not something I want to forget.

96
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,830
I'm afraid that I'll forget.

97
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,780
I'm going offsite.

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,400
 Choi Seong Jae 

99
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,100
That's my house.

100
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,490
I'm sorry.

101
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,400
- Excuse me...
 - I'm not buying.

102
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,500
It's not that. Is this Seong Jae oppa's...

103
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,250
Choi Seong Jae...

104
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,800
Seong Jae isn't here right now.

105
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
Sorry?

106
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,900
He's not home right now.

107
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,600
What are you doing and not getting ready? Why was your phone off?!

108
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
Don't you know there's a Board of Directors meeting at 3 p.m.?

109
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,100
I know, get out.

110
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,800
Get out? Hurry up and get ready.

111
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,800
We have to properly manage the subsidiaries at the board of directors meeting.

112
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,900
 Room service. 

113
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,300
I didn't order.

114
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,900
The man who left early this morning asked us to bring you this at around this time.

115
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,380
Wow, wow, look at you. Who were you with all night?

116
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,000
The guy from yesterday, did you already—

117
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,200
Are you crazy?

118
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,100
Then who is it?

119
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,600
By chance... Seo Joo Won... It's not him, right?

120
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,800
- Get out.
- Hey, hey.

121
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,000
You're not that lacking in discernment, are you?

122
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Hurry up and come out!

123
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,800
I need an application for the construction to submit to the Sinsudong city hall.

124
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,400
Why don't we rework the piping behind the soundproof walls?

125
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
If we connect the wastewater and sewage piping, foul odors can occur.

126
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,000
Check the ventilation piping in the first-floor restroom again.

127
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
I'm sorry.

128
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,800
I know there's too much work and not enough time.

129
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,600
But if you miss the details, everything will be ruined.

130
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,700
You don't become an architect simply because you can draw pictures.

131
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,050
Do you have the construction design yet?

132
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,200
No, not yet.

133
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,000
With the change in the lot, the schedule has moved up. Let's rush.

134
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,100
It's also our job to keep to the deadline that's been determined.

135
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,400
Okay.

136
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,600
"You don't become an architect simply because you can draw pictures."

137
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Oh, he's so cool!

138
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,400
I mean, it's good for me, but...

139
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Why is it not the CEO, but rather Gang Doo Oppa?

140
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,900
I mean, why exactly do you like Gang Doo?

141
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,500
Nothing specific, right? I can tell you right away why I like our CEO.

142
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,700
No, it's because there are too many reasons.

143
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,900
Then, just tell me one.

144
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,800
I do like him.

145
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,600
There's no reason I don't like Gang Doo.

146
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,800
You scared me!

147
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,700
You thought I didn't see you, didn't you? When did you get here?

148
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,900
Just a bit ago.

149
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,800
You should've called.

150
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I was about to, but then you came out.

151
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,700
Let's go.

152
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
I became rich.

153
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,600
Aren't you cold? I said let's go inside.

154
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,900
I like the cold in the winter.

155
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,000
It's warm.

156
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,660
I went to a bereaved family member's house today.

157
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,270
Alone?

158
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,200
I went by myself, but I just came right back.

159
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,900
She...

160
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,060
talked like he was still alive.

161
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,500
So I couldn't say anything.

162
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Weird, isn't it?

163
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,880
No. I think I can understand.

164
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,800
I also sometimes

165
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,900
fool myself into thinking that a dead person is alive.

166
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,670
I hear their voice.

167
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,120
- Hey, Hey! Me, too! 
 - There's a person here!

168
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,610
I don't want to be alone.

169
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,600
I'm scared.

170
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
Moksan Middle School?

171
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,200
I went to Moksan as well.

172
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,100
What the heck is this?

173
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,600
I can't die.

174
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,500
There are people outside. We'll get out too.

175
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
I don't want to die.

176
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,900
I can't die.

177
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,980
- Outside—
 - There are a ton of things I still haven't done.

178
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Are you all right? H-Hyung?

179
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,500
M-Mom...

180
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
Mom...

181
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,400
To...

182
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,200
Hongui-dong...13-2...

183
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,800
What? Where?

184
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
My...

185
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,600
Hyung

186
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,700
Hyung!

187
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,200
Hyung! Wake up.

188
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,900
Hyung!

189
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,700
Hyung!

190
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,400
Wake up!

191
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,000
Hyung.

192
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,200
 It's the fifth day since the accident; there are about 20 people who are missing. 

193
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,700
 The rescue effort is facing difficulty due to an unexpected downpour. 

194
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:11,000
Hyung, do you know why the number on my back is 7?

195
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,880
Ronaldo is number 7 for Manchester United.

196
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,800
I'm a mid-fielder but...

197
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,840
Hyung.

198
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,500
Hyung!

199
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,220
Are you there?

200
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,250
I don't want to be here alone, either.

201
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,300
Answer me!

202
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,800
Please?

203
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,420
I'm begging you.

204
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,600
Yeah. I'm here.

205
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,910
Tell me.

206
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,060
A voice?

207
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,400
Yeah.

208
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,510
I probably hear it because it's something worth hearing.

209
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,460
"Don't forget me."

210
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,010
I have dreams.

211
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:18,100
They start differently but always end the same.

212
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,180
Dreams of what?

213
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,980
♫  My eyes on the soul   ♫

214
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,840
Of Yeon Soo in front of my eyes

215
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,180
dying.

216
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,310
♫  Your heart comes to me  ♫

217
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:43,200
♫  Lines our way  ♫

218
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,480
♫  Hold my hands   ♫

219
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,140
Died?

220
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:01,630
The daughter of the owner of that noodle restaurant died in that shopping mall accident.

221
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,020
That must be why he acted that way on that day.

222
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,740
Did I cause the building to collapse? We were awarded the contract, too.

223
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,850
Why doesn't he talk to the higher-ups who ordered that project with such a crazy budget? Why does he pick on me?

224
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,940
So, why did you get your feet wet at such a nonsensical price?

225
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,810
If I stayed still, would the company work?

226
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,010
I would even build a dog house if I could make money.

227
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:32,720
Why are you looking at me like that? We compensated all of them. We did everything we could!

228
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,600
Do you think there's a way to compensate that's enough for that?

229
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,120
There's an old saying that the entire world isn't enough for a parent who loses a child.

230
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,960
Enough.

231
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,610
And I met Lee Gang Doo a few days ago.

232
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:00,970
That punk looked right at me and told me not to meet with you. Real arrogantly.

233
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,020
Gang Doo did?

234
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,520
What's the actual relationship between you two?

235
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,940
You slept together, didn't you?

236
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,750
Having your first thought be that when a man and a woman meet with each other that they must be sleeping together,

237
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,850
maybe you're like that because you haven't been able to meet women other than that. But—

238
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,150
Answer it. It looks like it's from your home.

239
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,960
If you avoid it at this hour she'll think we're sleeping together.

240
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,410
Black Russian

241
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,730
- What happened yesterday— 
- What happened yesterday,

242
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,480
will end with yesterday.

243
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:21,020
I ate dinner tonight with the man Oppa set me up with.

244
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,470
Now that I've given him a second glance, he's not actually that bad.

245
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:34,660
If you came here on your own then it doesn't look like he was that good, though.

246
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,620
You're right.

247
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,860
You really do know me well.

248
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,410
So what you said will be true.

249
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,760
I'll always

250
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,680
put the company before you.

251
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,990
I don't want to go.

252
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,860
Go in.

253
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,580
Can't I stay with you just a little longer?

254
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,240
I could stay with you all night, of course.

255
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,980
But not tonight.

256
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,470
She's your mom. Don't avoid her.

257
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,270
I avoided mine, you see.

258
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,410
And so I regret it like crazy.

259
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,480
"I'm also hurting to death so why do I need to even listen to Mom's crying as well?"

260
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,490
Looking at her made me more frustrated,

261
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,780
so I told her to get lost.

262
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:26,010
Why did I do that? It was only when she was no longer by my side that I realized how stupid it was.

263
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,610
So, you'll be okay. You still have a chance.

264
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:52,780
I'll take on everything that's giving you trouble. So you just stay stuck right next to your mom.

265
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,000
Got it?

266
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,180
Pretty.

267
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,630
Such a good girl.

268
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,590
Go on in.

269
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:25,460
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

270
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:35,320
 A person having a worse time than me comforts me. 

271
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,870
 Then what about you? 

272
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,650
 It's said that everyone has their own personal prison. 

273
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,620
 I'm going. I'm going! 

274
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,840
 Kimbap, Noodles 

275
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:10,830
 I also sometimes fool myself into thinking that a dead person is alive. 

276
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,910
 I can hear their voice. Telling me not to forget them. 

277
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,240
 I have dreams. 

278
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,970
 Of Yeon Soo in front of my eyes dying. 

279
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,820
 Gang Doo. 

280
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:04,010
 Isn't the phrase, "a personal prison," strange? 

281
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,250
 No one's locked us in, but why can't we get out? 

282
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,120
I told you to just come in.

283
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,810
Nothing good will come out of you being seen with me.

284
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,040
The rumors have already spread.

285
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,720
What's going on that I got a call from you for once? I had something to give you anyway.

286
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,080
What is it?

287
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,530
I heard your internship ends next month.

288
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,010
- You didn't eat, right? 
 - Yeah.

289
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,200
You told me not to. What do you want to eat? I'm starving. I'll buy you something yummy.

290
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,850
- Follow me. 
 - Huh?

291
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,510
What's with this?

292
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,570
Weren't we going to get something to eat?

293
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,660
- I don't have time to eat. 
 - Hey!

294
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,680
You have to press on it.

295
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,260
- That's good. Now go. 
 - Hey!

296
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,970
I'm hungry!

297
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,350
 CCTV recording 24 hours 

298
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,170
There's a cafeteria on the 2nd floor.

299
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,130
What about you?

300
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,360
I don't have time.

301
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,240
Unni!

302
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,850
Oh, hello.

303
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,640
Ah, hello.

304
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,980
C-Come on in.

305
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,290
- Unni's here, right? 
 - Yes.

306
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,020
Unni, your passcode...

307
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,410
Oh, I changed it.

308
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,190
Why?

309
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:12,870
It means we've reached a point where you can't just mindlessly let yourself in anymore.

310
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,550
You asked me to stop you.

311
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,130
It's because of you!

312
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,190
No, I guess I should say it's thanks to you?

313
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,300
The other day! The day when Gang Doo was carrying you on his back.

314
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,020
I had a terrible stomachache from my ulcer from eating chicken feet

315
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,390
You fall for someone easily when you get sick.

316
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,530
When would I ever win a lotto like that in my life?

317
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,950
Hey, I didn't lure him first.

318
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,270
I did somewhat to show off that I own a building.

319
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,930
Geez...

320
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,090
As if Jin Yeong would fall for something like that.

321
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,090
Right?

322
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,560
By the way, what brings you here so early in the morning? Aren't you going to work?

323
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,870
Yeah. I have a favor to ask of you.

324
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,930
This is your father's plantation in Gangwon-do, right?

325
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,700
Yeah, that's right.

326
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,820
Then can I go there?

327
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,380
I want to get some trees.

328
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,410
Of course, you can go.

329
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:19,890
The gardeners for rich homes in Korea take our wood.

330
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,660
But what do you need trees for?

331
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,000
It's because of the memorial park.

332
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,020
The landscape design team says it's hard for them to get big trees.

333
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,070
The job you were given was doing the memorial park?

334
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,310
Yeah.

335
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,830
You're really something and your CEO is also something else.

336
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,690
He's making you do that even though he knows you were a victim in that accident?

337
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,290
It's because he knows.

338
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,250
- I'm a victim so I can do it bett— 
- Survivor.

339
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,020
She's not a victim; she's a survivor.

340
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,640
What's the difference?

341
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,090
That she's still alive of course.

342
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,970
That's something really amazing.

343
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,570
 Return dishes here 

344
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,660
Yeah?

345
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,520
Eating. With my sister.

346
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,200
 Do you have time? 

347
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,380
Even if I didn't, I can make time. Where should I go?

348
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,070
The house you visited yesterday

349
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,180
was this house?

350
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,310
I didn't have the confidence to be able to come again by myself.

351
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,230
 Hongui-dong 13-2 

352
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,170
 Hongui-dong 13-2, District 2, Number 3 

353
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,460
 Hongui-dong 13-2 

354
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,930
 Tell my family that I'm here. 

355
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:46,410
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

356
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,140
Perhaps we shouldn't have just come over.

357
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,310
I have something to tell you about Seong Jae Oppa.

358
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,890
Please contact me.

359
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,770
Ha Moon Soo.

360
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,660
Seong Jae Oppa?

361
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,300
Before,

362
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:43,010
do you remember me telling you that I was with someone other than my sister?

363
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,460
The first

364
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,000
oppa I had ever liked.

365
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,540
Because of me he couldn't even grow into an adult.

366
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,580
Let's go.

367
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,260
What is it?

368
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,050
No. It's nothing.

369
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,940
Let's go.

370
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,180
We've seen each other before, haven't we?

371
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,330
Who...?

372
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,700
Looks like you know that you did something wrong. Seeing as you didn't try to block it.

373
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:07,200
They say I should yank your hair at a time like this. What a hassle. Why bother?

374
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,490
Let's talk outside.

375
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,210
You've been here, too. I guess you didn't know that I'm the owner.

376
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:28,130
I built this one for my husband so he can enjoy his hobby.

377
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,730
Even though we're not a husband and wife with a good relationship,

378
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,830
I couldn't just let this slide.

379
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,450
Are you dating my husband?

380
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,430
If you are, then stop now.

381
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:06,780
Father-in-law's health is poor, so it won't benefit my husband at all if he gets on his father's bad side.

382
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,320
We're not dating, but I'll do that.

383
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:16,530
I'm a bar owner, the director is my client. As for me,

384
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:22,260
I smile for him as much as I get paid. If the deal is over, our relationship is over.

385
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,620
There's nothing you need to worry about, Madame.

386
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,670
You're very smart. Discomfortingly so.

387
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,470
Please don't be uneasy. I'll never

388
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,770
be able to be as dignified as you.

389
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:56,150
I enjoyed the drink. And thank you

390
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,290
for treating me like a person.

391
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,500
I'm so tacky.

392
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:45,780
 The first oppa I had ever liked. 

393
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,480
 Because of me he couldn't even grow into an adult. 

394
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,820
Go and take a look.

395
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,370
Pardon?

396
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,430
Ah, o-okay...

397
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,910
But, um, shouldn't we tell the police...?

398
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,770
Police, my butt!

399
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:16,930
Some crazy punk must have just slaughtered a dog or something here.

400
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:22,380
You can probably tell just by looking, but it's too big for a dog bone?

401
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,010
Well? It's nothing, so hurry back to your work.

402
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:32,400
What are you doing? It's no big deal, so hurry up and go. You want to spend the night here?

403
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,150
What are you doing? It's nothing special so what do you need to take a picture for!

404
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,830
What?

405
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,650
I'm gonna go nuts. For god's sake!

406
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:50,180
I got it.

407
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,290
- Go to the worksite. 
 - Yes, sir.

408
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,240
- CEO? 
 - Yes?

409
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,880
I think you need to go in person.

410
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,680
We have a meeting with the measurement company at 4 pm. I should review everything before then—

411
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:20,180
The chief is also saying that you absolutely need to come. It looks like a problem came up on the site.

412
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:26,120
If it's not something that's going to get resolved right away by me being there, let's do this first.

413
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,010
B-But even so—

414
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,150
Control of the worksite is the site chief's job.

415
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,590
I'm responsible for design-related problems.

416
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,830
Anything other than that, they should be able to make a decision about themselves.

417
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,930
 What are you doing?! 

418
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:06,490
 I'm taking a video of it. 

419
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,170
What is it? What the hell is it!

420
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,200
Bring it to me.

421
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,730
Can you tell what that is by looking at it?

422
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,020
Is an animal corpse showing up on site a multiple-day work affair!

423
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,170
Why are you creating problems for no reason!

424
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:35,600
Ugh, ugh...

425
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,630
What'd you get scared for? Did you think it was a person?

426
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:53,510
CEO Seo is the construction supervisor so he should make a decision about it when he's here.

427
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,970
That way the allocation of responsibility later will be clear too.

428
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,470
Why on earth were you assigned here? Can't you just make a living for yourself now?

429
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:05,890
I have to work to make a living for myself.

430
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:13,170
Then do your job only. Don't make situations worse. It's 2018.

431
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:20,540
It's 2018! How much longer will you dwell on something that happened more than 10 years ago?

432
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:32,780
After the design has been changed to put the memorial park in the VIP parking lot area...

433
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,620
I think it will be unavoidable to change the B area left side road near Silver Town.

434
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:49,830
Do you remember what you told me before?

435
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,320
 You said they didn't properly handle the aftermath and just covered everything up, right? 

436
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:02,020
 There were a lot of bodies discovered then that weren't in one piece. Aren't they still lie buried there? 

437
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,000
 If you find it unfair, then find and bring evidence for it. 

438
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,880
- Did you see the video I sent you? 
 - Yes.

439
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,200
The site chief said that as the supervisor this is a matter that needs to be brought to you for a decision.

440
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,660
So that they can put me in the forefront when they need someone to take the blame.

441
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,900
My father as well...

442
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,330
I heard from Department Head Jeong.

443
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:32,020
That your father was also an architect. Architect Seo Ji Oh.

444
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:39,850
So I'm going to believe in you, that you won't make the same mistake.

445
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:43,090
This isn't something that I can make a decision on by myself.

446
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:48,470
Let's say we eat the loss when we stop the construction. But how about the subcontractors who are depending on this construction site work?

447
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:49,820
So what?

448
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:55,600
So it's something that needs to be decided after discussing with the head office. All you need to do,

449
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,410
- is check how the work on site is going. 
 - Even without you telling me to,

450
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,060
I'm going to do that because it's what I should do.

451
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:04,930
But I feel like making sure you all don't do things you shouldn't do.

452
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:09,950
It's more important than doing what I should be doing.

453
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,800
What do you want?

454
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:36,820
I'm tired. If you came to nag at me too, I'm going to pass on it today.

455
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,290
I heard about the worksite. What are you going to do about it?

456
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:45,890
I entrusted it to someone to check if it's human or animal. So we have to wait for the results to come out.

457
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:49,760
Why does our side need to look that up? If it becomes a problem, then so what?

458
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,000
Seo Joo Won even agreed to it so why are you being like this?

459
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,320
Joo Won did?

460
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,600
He's the supervisor, isn't he?

461
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:01,860
Who's the one who drove out my father-in-law from the supervisory position? He should be responsible!

462
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,800
- Did you open up Gate 4? 
 - Yeah.

463
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,620
Close it back up. There's no night shift tonight.

464
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,320
There aren't too many construction sites that are in operation during wintertime. It's bad.

465
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:31,140
If even our side is stopped from working, then all those people aren't going to have a place to go. Goodness.

466
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,950
Close it up and come back.

467
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:45,800
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

468
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,860
One moment please.

469
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,040
I could've met with you in any old place, you know.

470
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,020
This is any old place to me. What was the reason for you to reach out to me to meet up?

471
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,150
Do me a favor.

472
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,380
What favor?

473
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:19,100
The CEO Seo that I know isn't someone that puts off decisions.

474
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,430
But in the end, he never came to the worksite today.

475
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:25,860
Then it must not have been an important enough matter for him to come to the worksite.

476
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:31,700
It's not just any other construction site. There are people who never came out from that accident.

477
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,000
Be that as it may, I doubt that's something for you to get involved in.

478
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,540
Why do you think CEO Seo sent me to work on site?

479
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,900
To be a spy?

480
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:47,470
Well, I thought that too.

481
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,400
But turns out not.

482
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,950
I think it was because he was uneasy.

483
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:59,290
Someone like me who doesn't know any better... He needed someone like that to make an issue out of every single thing

484
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:03,470
so that he can do a double-take over things that are easily overlooked.

485
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:11,300
The deadline is tight, the workers have nowhere to go. I think CEO Seo is cornered and is a bit confused.

486
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,670
Even if it's a dog bone, let's confirm it before we move on.

487
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,600
If there are problems, CEO Seo will take all the blame.

488
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,570
You're too much.

489
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:24,620
- What is? 
 - You've got all the great charms.

490
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,120
Tastes good.

491
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,540
The vibe here is good too. I'll have to bring Moon Soo here.

492
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,310
This place only serves members you know. You pay for today.

493
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,790
Shouldn't the person with a lot of money be treating?

494
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,420
What did you do with the money you got from selling the land?

495
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,430
That's not my money. I have to spend it on something else.

496
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:27,320
A report?

497
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,840
The police forensic team will come out and retrieve the bones.

498
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,220
Why would you do that?

499
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:36,520
I can't let you be responsible for something you didn't do.

500
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,200
If you cover up and issues arise, the blame falls on the site manager

501
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,060
and you as the supervisor.

502
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:48,020
If so, I'm sure the site manager will get himself out of it somehow.

503
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,460
There's one missing person from the shopping mall collapse accident.

504
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:57,710
As long as we get the DNA test result, the construction can restart in a week.

505
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:02,330
It won't be a huge issue. So, don't waver.

506
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,180
From the company's perspective, this is a cleaner way to deal with it.

507
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:12,040
If he's found to be the missing person, our motive behind the memorial park would become more clear.

508
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,660
This is as far as I'll go. You handle the rest.

509
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,140
Yoo Jin.

510
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,610
When did you get here?

511
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:08,920
What happened? Is it Moon Byeong Ho?

512
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,750
They still don't know yet.

513
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,010
In any case, it's a good thing that they found it now, at least.

514
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:16,930
Is it really a good thing?

515
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,830
It's a good thing.

516
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,520
Let's go. We're not being any help staying here.

517
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,930
Hold on.

518
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,950
Wait!

519
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,450
What's wrong?

520
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:54,350
That— Excuse me!!

521
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:55,970
Stay here.

522
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:02,840
Ahjussi! Stop the truck!

523
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,740
Ahjusshi!

524
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,210
Gang Doo!

525
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,230
Gang Doo! Are you all right! Oh, no!

526
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,980
What do we do? Are you okay?

527
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:28,530
Yeah. I'm fine. You're the one that doesn't look okay.

528
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,790
What do we do?

529
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,750
Are you really okay?

530
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,170
Yeah, I'm really okay.

531
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,020
Look. Fine, right?

532
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,560
Let's go.

533
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,970
What's wrong?

534
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:09,370
Gang Doo!

535
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,290
Yes?

536
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:11,250
 The results from Lee Gang Doo's blood test are out. 

537
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,310
Aren't you getting off?

538
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:27,520
Go to the hospital.

539
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,230
Get out for now. The driver needs to go.

540
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,910
You fainted out of the blue. Have you any idea how much you were bleeding from your nose?

541
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:52,700
I'll be fine after I lie down at home for a bit. I'm sick and tired of hospitals.

542
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,220
 Hyung! 

543
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,080
Moon Soo!

544
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,350
 Milky Way 

545
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,230
Hyung, you got another nosebleed?

546
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:13,740
What are you clinging to me for? I keep telling you I'm fine.

547
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:18,110
- Don't be sick, Hyung! I hate illnesses. 
- Of course you do.

548
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:21,840
Being sick is awful, isn't it? That's why you shouldn't get sick either.

549
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:28,830
I can handle being sick myself, but if Hyung or Mom are ever sick, it scares me.

550
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,900
- Don't get sick! 
 - I won't.

551
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:38,780
Moon Soo, lighten up, okay?

552
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,240
Just go to the hospital.

553
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:45,600
You all are really making a big deal out of a little blood coming out of my nose. I keep telling you it's nothing.

554
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,210
What happened to you now?

555
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:03,900
Mom! They said Hyung fainted! And that he got a nosebleed!

556
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,180
No wonder you've looked so ashen these days. I just knew this would happen.

557
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,130
Does it make sense for a young guy to bleed a river and faint!

558
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:13,130
Seriously, what's with you all today? Is this the first time this has happened to me or something?

559
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:15,880
It's because it's not the first time that we're worried, of course!

560
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,090
And what's wrong with her?

561
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,080
It's my fault that he fell.

562
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,120
What are you saying, it's your fault?

563
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,580
If I hadn't stopped that truck...

564
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:30,180
Come on now. It's the truck's fault for leaving without properly tying it down with a rope first!

565
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:36,280
It would've been an even bigger problem if that truck had gone on the highway like that. You prevented a major accident.

566
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,270
Got it?

567
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:41,350
That's enough out of you two. Quickly clean yourself up and come down to eat.

568
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,990
It's because you're so picky and there are so many things you don't eat that your body's in this condition.

569
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:50,510
Get moving! And you eat before you leave too! You look like you'll be the next to faint.

570
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:10,520
Why'd you follow me? What? You want to wash up together?

571
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,030
No.

572
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:15,560
Then wait downstairs. I'll be right down after showering.

573
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,120
I don't want to. Let's go down together.

574
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:25,260
Hurry up and get all that off and shower. I'll get a change of clothes ready for you.

575
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,720
I'll be waiting for you in your room.

576
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,280
Really...

577
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:52,050
 SJ 

578
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,410
 Try not to bring up talk about the accident with my brother. 

579
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:39,340
 Spending several days with a corpse... 

580
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,950
Didn't you say you were going to get clothes for me?

581
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:37,180
What's wrong?

582
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,110
Are you all right?

583
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,860
What's the matter?

584
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:50,510
I think I need to go home.

585
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:53,380
Go after you eat.

586
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,280
No. I'll leave first.

587
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,260
You should rest.

588
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,260
Don't go.

589
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,470
You're being weird.

590
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:29,290
Something's strange. Why am I feeling so uneasy?

591
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:33,320
I'm sorry.

592
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,350
Look me in the eye.

593
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,900
Look me right in the eyes!

594
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,510
Don't—

595
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:15,100
- Gang Doo— 
 - I love you.

596

I love you.
