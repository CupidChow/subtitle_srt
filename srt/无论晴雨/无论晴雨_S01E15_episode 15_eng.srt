No. I'll leave first. You should rest.

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,740
Don't go.

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,410
You're being weird.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,000
Something's strange.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,000
Why am I feeling so uneasy?

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,390
Look me in the eye.

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,420

 Can you hear them?

 Hurry and go.

30
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,200
 you should have been first.

Are you alright?

34
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,700
I said what's wrong?

35
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,600
 Gang Doo 

36
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,900
Moon Soo!

37
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,700
- Oppa, Moon Soo—
- Where is Moon Soo?

38
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,100
What's going on? She didn't show up for work and there weren't any phone calls.

39
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,000
We have to finish the blueprint today.

40
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,100
Look here.

41
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,300
Isn't it nice? It's much better than before, right?

42
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Look here, this. I did this.

43
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,700
Usually, there are no places to sit at a place like this.
 List of family members of S mall victims

Since it's been awhile, they need to talk to them too.
  Call, Call, Visit, Visit, Visit 

45
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,800
I did a good job, didn't I?
  41. Choi Seong Jae, Mother: Lee Soo Hae 

46
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,450
You did a good job.

47
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,300
Yesterday, you—

48
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,100
The voice you hear, it's Oppa Seong Jae's?

49
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,800
When did you find out?

50
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,100
When I came here with you.

51
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,300
When were you planning to tell me?

52
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,100
I wasn't going to tell you..

53
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,350
I thought you'd be at peace that way.

54
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,200
Let's go. I'll come here next time.

55
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,900
No, I will tell Seong Jae's mother that it was me who asked to meet him there on that day.

56
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,100
Don't. What's the point of telling her now?

57
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,650
It's not necessary to know everything.

58
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,080
She's having a hard enough time mourning and missing him.

59
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
You're just forcing her to hate you.

60
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,910
You came here a couple days ago too, right?

61
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,900
Yes.

62
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,200
Because of Seong Jae?

63
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:23,300
You... stopped by my house a few times before too, right?

64
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,000
 Excuse me, do you live here by chance? 

65
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,070
 Here... 

66
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,900
 a few months ago, due to the shopping mall collapse— 

67
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,500
 There isn't anyone like that here. 

68
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,100
 Hongeui-dong, 13-2 2 tong 3 bahn 

69
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
 It is here. 

70
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,500
 The people who used to live here 

71
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 they are all dead. 

72
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,700
He seems kind hearted.

73
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,100
I thought he would be really scary looking.

74
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,900
I don't have many pictures of him. That was taken on his school trip.

75
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,300
I guess he laughed often with his friends.

76
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,770
Do you know my Seong Jae?

77
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,650
Yes.

78
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I was with him until his final moments.

79
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,390
I should have relayed the message back then.

80
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,990
Hyung said

81
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,280
"I am sorry for not answering my phone and going out without telling you."

82
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,330
He asked me to pass those words to his mother.

83
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,920
I am sorry for being late.

84
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,370
I am sorry.

85
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,580
You came before to tell me those words?

86
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,560
I didn't even know...

87
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,670
I am sorry.

88
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,710
Then I will come again next time.

89
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,840
 I have something to tell you regarding Oppa Seong Jae. Please give me a call. Ha Moon Soo. 

90
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,410
I am going.

91
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,630
Not like this.

92
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,280
I am going.

93
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,190
You can't.

94
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,470
If you leave like this,

95
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,700
you won't see me again, right?

96
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,830
Don't do that.

97
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,760
You don't have any negative feelings towards me?

98
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,990
Of course, I don't have any negative feelings towards you. Why would I—

99
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,020
Instead of me,

100
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,680
but you should have come out first.

101
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,900
If so, then you wouldn't have had to stay behind with Seong Jae.

102
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,940
You wouldn't be hearing voices till now,

103
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,170
and your body wouldn't have had to be damaged like this.

104
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,850
If I hadn't asked Seong Jae to that place either—

105
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,370
What kind of bullsh** are you saying?

106
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,660
It's appalling that I left that place first because I wanted to save myself.

107
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,610
I am appalled by me.

108
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,240
Hey. Ha Moon Soo.

109
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,080
Is it all your fault that I turned out like this?

110
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,280
Do you wield so much influence like that?

111
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,410
People dying at the hospital are all your fault too?

112
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,010
Car accidents, plane crashes,

113
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,380
thousands of lives lost on battlefields too, that's all your fault?

114
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,220
All the shi*** things in the world, they're all your fault?

115
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,770
Even to your ears, that sounds ridiculous, right?

116
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,320
So, don't ever think like that.

117
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,660
Even for a day, I want to be happy with you.

118
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,020
Because it feels unfair, I must be happy many times more.

119
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,790
Let me go.

120
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,300
I told you that I won't let go of your hand.

121
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,950
Gang Doo.

122
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,070
- Don't say it.
 - Gang Doo.

123
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,050
I don't want to hear it.

124
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,640
It torments me to see you.

125
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,110
It reminds me of what happened in the past,

126
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,430
so I think I will end up hating myself.

00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,340
I am going nuts.

153
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,100
The remains found belong to more than one person.

154
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,280
So why did you report it so quickly?

155
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,060
Even if I didn't report it, rumors would have spread right away.

156
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,340
Don't you know bad news spreads quickly?

157
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,990
I will try to find out what happened and tell the Site Manager to instruct the employees to not speak about this matter.

158
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,960
You should do a good job so it won't leak to the press.

159
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,260
Especially Seo Joo Won. Don't meet him anymore.

160
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,540
Don't make the problem worse by triggering his needless sense of justice.

161
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,490
Why aren't you answering your calls?

162
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,770
Why aren't you answering your little sister's calls?

163
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,170
Noona.

164
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,940
You said this before.

165
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,270
Don't be relieved thinking that this is the rock bottom.

166
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,690
I did. Why?

167
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,590
If this is not rock bottom, how many more underground levels are there?

168
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,810
Things are not going well with Moon Soo?

169
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,790
Moon Soo said it torments her to be with me.

170
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,480
Do I have to let her go then?

171
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,000
Are you sure you'll even be able to let her go?

172
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,750
Rather than see her suffer because of me,

173
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:24,000
I thought it would be better for her if I just had regrets by myself.

174
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,220
You don't like her enough, seeing how you want to keep your pride.

175
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,890
That's not true. Very much, really, greatly,

176
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,910
really a lot, totally, ginormously, I like her.

177
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,240
So it's driving me nuts.

178
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,210
 Why didn't you go home? 

179
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,470
 I've been waiting so I could see you. 

180
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:05,270
 I'll come tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. 

181
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,890
 I'll keep coming until I don't like you. 

182
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,280
 Saint Moon Soo 

183
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,220
 Not answering the call so you'll be redirected to the voicemail 

184
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,260
 Not answering the call 

185
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,550
So what was his name?

186
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,180
What?

187
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,980
The guy you're dating, the guy who came to see you here.

188
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,640
Why?

189
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,030
What do you mean why? He's the guy you're dating.

190
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,050
Even if he doesn't live up to my standard, I should at least know his name.

191
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,070
You don't have to know his name.

192
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,890
Why? Are you afraid I will go seek him out?

193
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,920
No.

194
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:44,140
Since I won't be dating him anymore.

195
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,650
I... I didn't mean to tell you to break up with him. As long as you're dating someone—

196
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,190
Mom. I won't date anymore.

197
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,330
Why not?

198
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,840
He dumped you? That guy, when he doesn't have much, dumped you?

199
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,330
I wish that was the case.

200
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,020
It would be more comfortable for me if he had dumped me.

201
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,370
I think I am destined to ruin other people's lives.

202
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,360
What kind of nonsense is that?

203
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,410
Who said so? Who said that?

204
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,450
Who's the crazy bastard who said such a thing?

205
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,070
No one said that. I feel like that. I feel like that.

206
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,160
Oh, what is she saying?

207
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,200
Oh, this is upsetting.

208
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,140
Gang Doo, 12 missed calls.

209
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,040
Not answering the phone is playing unfair.

210
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,740
Joo Won.

211
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:15,880
It's getting busy at the site, right? I appreciate your work.

212
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:23,950
If things go as planned, do what you want and don't worry about the money.

213
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:30,390
When Cheongyu wins another public project next time, I'll give it to you.

214
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,830
If this is about the bones we found, there's not much I can do.

215
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:42,000
What do you mean there isn't? There's one thing. Don't talk about it.

216
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,600
The bones and construction site have nothing to do with each other.

217
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,520
Since we dug them up, we can move forward with construction.

218
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,480
However...

219
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,850
In an incident where the news is leaked and the victim's family has been notified,

220
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,880
the family would want to find it somehow.

221
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,030
And if things get out of hand and the construction stops,  are you very scared of that?

222
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,840
Why are you here?

223
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,520
This bastard's crossing the line, butting in everywhere—

224
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,720
I'm most qualified to butt in this matter here!

225
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,300
Did you call him?

226
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,600
Manager Jeong didn't tell you I was coming?

227
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,000
We can't work together. Seriously.

228
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,200
Digging up bones isn't our responsibility.

229
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,920
The police should take care of that matter. It's a separate matter when it comes to building a structure safely.

230
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,990
But why do you think Manager Jeong sent me here?

231
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,090
I think I might know.

232
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,710
Don't you get it?

233
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,870
We're not trying to hide it. I don't think we need to notify them intentionally.

234
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,980
If the site stops work, the workers don't have anywhere to go.

235
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,340
People who are living so hard, they shouldn't have to suffer.

236
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,970
If you start compromising one thing at a time with nice words like that,

237
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,330
people who would've enjoyed a glass of soju after work, you could put them in danger.

238
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,320
I hope you won't do that, CEO.

239
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,750
If you do that...

240
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,500
My father couldn't do it.

241
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,570
but I'll stop you.

242
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:46,140
Hey, I never called for you so get out. Get out!

243
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,600
I'll leave even if you don't tell me to.

244
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,650
Stuff yourself full and live a long life.

245
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,240
Those guys, doubling up on me...

246
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,880
Why did you send Lee Kang Doo there yesterday?

247
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,360
- In case you wavered.
 - What?

248
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,430
Isn't that the reason you placed Lee Gang Doo at the site?

249
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,710
- Don't just spew stuff. 
 - No, I'm saying this because I think that's what you're doing.

250
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:39,960
Ha Moon Soo and Lee Gang Doo. You were keeping yourself vigilant while watching those two, weren't you?

251
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,190
What do you know?

252
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,900
The Area B you're in charge of.

253
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:59,360
It's exactly the same as the blueprint from 13 years ago, including the structural design and floor finishing. Didn't you think I'd know?

254
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,170
You and I both know there's no problem with the design.

255
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,460
We also know the structure isn't built by the design alone.

256
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,370
Then, you're saying, in the end, it was the fault of my father who compromised at the site—

257
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:17,810
No. What you were going to do, continue on.

258
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,810
So that my oppa doesn't look down on you, don't falter.

259
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,340
You should have been like this back then too.

260
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:34,740
I am doing this because I learned from my mistakes back then.

261
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:45,500


262
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,780
Okay.

263
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,220
I got it now, so listen to me this once.

264
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,120
Even if it's hard for you to face me...

265
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,230
The memorial. Let's finish what we began together.

266
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,800
You said so yourself.

267
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,120
Until we finish the memorial park,

268
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,420
see me until then.

269
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,730
I won't bother you more.

270
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,870
It's what you said to me.

271
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,780
Okay.

272
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,430
Let's go eat first.

273
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,670
I don't want to.

274
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,570
Why not? That's part of work too.

275
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,770
You need food to gain energy.

276
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,820
Do you know what time it is? You still didn't eat?

277
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,730
I'm hungry.

278
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,870
Eat with me.

279
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:20,960
You said meat should be grilled, not drowned in soup. What made you crave this?

280
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,700
I can't be picky to be healthy.

281
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,910
I need to eat well and be healthy so as not to worry you.

282
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,920
Breathe. I can tell you're eating holding your breath.

283
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,340
I'm not. Do you know how I'm eating this like an adult?

284
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,910
Eat more of this.

285
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,670
Go on, eat.

286
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,890
What are you doing here? I told you to wait inside.

287
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,760
See? You've got indigestion.

288
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,920
I do not! I just ate it too fast because it was so good.

289
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,420
Take this.

290
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,920
Don't try too hard because of me.

291
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,930
Why do you keep saying it's for you?

292
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,600
Wait for me.

293
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,570
Moon Soo.

294
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,110
I need to go back for a meeting.

295
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,190
Listen to me first.

296
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,930
I'm not doing anything because of you.

297
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,650
Don't feel sorry for me.

298
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,910
I need to be thankful for you.

299
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,740
You already...

300
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,460
saved me several times.

301
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:33,020
♫  When we Where we Why we  ♫

302
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:39,190
♫  On some day it's so gray  ♫

303
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:50,120

304
00:33:50,120 --> 00:34:02,140

305
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,890
You saved me.

306
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,990
But I left you behind—

307
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,830
Did you make the building collapse? Did you?

308
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,930
♫  I sing your song  ♫

309
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:23,570
So don't say stuff like that.

♫  At once we did  ♫

311

That hyung...

312
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,400
Yeah, I was scared.

313
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,920
I was scared, but I endured it because I wasn't alone.

314
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,950
So don't be sorry.

315
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,010
Don't blame yourself.

00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,060
Like Ha Moon Soo.

319
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,600
♫  I sing you a song, you sing along  ♫

320
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,110
I'm going.

321
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:24,260
♫  You sing my song, we sing along at once we did  ♫

322
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,610
You said you were taking a break. Good timing.

323
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,870
I am taking a break.

324
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,920
If you don't get hurt, you faint.

325
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,580
That's all because you only eat ice cream instead of meals.

326
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,730
I mean, you look like a Korean, but why is your appetite like that?

327
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,340
Are you worrying about me or trying to pick a fight?

328
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,870
I'm worried, so worried! Happy?

329
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,860
I thought you were going to rest. Why are you here?

330
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,490
Moksan Environmental's contact info. Give that to me.

331
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,100
Why do you want that? The waste must've gone over to the treatment plant already.

332
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,150
It's not waste.

333
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,540
Oh... We haven't divided up the concrete from Cheongyu yet.

334
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,170
Over there.

335
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:41,740
 Mother Im Jin Hae who used to wait for her son, Choi Il Do, every day by the front door. 

336
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:48,950
 My lovely wife Jeong Mi Gyeong. And our Moongchi who was by her side to the end. 

337
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,700
 We're waiting for you, Moon Byeong Ho. 

338
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:01,790
 I'm sorry to tell you too late. I love you with all my heart, Dad. 

339
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:06,140
 Jeong Woo and Dong Woo's dad, Oh Hyeong Wan. 

340
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,300
 Lee Cheol Woo 

341
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,950
Hyung, where did you go?

342
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,270
Why are you out here?

343
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,460
Your sister was looking for you so hard. She says to call her when you come home.

344
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,220
Okay. Let's go inside.

345
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,870
Where's Moon Soo?

346
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,890
Does Moon Soo always follow me around?

347
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,210
You like her following you around.

348
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,310
But are you hurting? Does your stomach hurt?

349
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,220
What do you mean hurt?

350
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,690
Ah... I don't want to. Seriously.

351
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,500
You're a grown up. Why are you so afraid of this needle?

352
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,580
- Seriously. 
 - Are you going to keep burping?

353
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,300
Poking your finger is the best when you have indigestion.

354
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:37,710
Poke once and burp once.

355
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:42,240
Aigoo, look at this black blood. What did you eat and how much of it?

356
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,740
Tissue. Aigoo...

357
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,620
Why does it keep bleeding?

358
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,420
I only poked once.

359
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,500
My body. Nothing about me is well.

360
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,430
Hyung, you're bleeding a lot. Let's go to the hospital.

361
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,910
It's okay. Why go to the hospital over this? Forget it.

362
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,230
All right? I feel good. Feel good.

363
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,860
You have lots of customers today. You must be tired, huh?

364
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,870
It's nice to be busy. Not thinking about anything.

365
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:18,140
The boiler is too loud. We should call Mr. Kim to come again tomorrow.

366
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,930
I should.

367
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,050
Go home.

368
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,590
Rest up.

369
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,400
Hi, Moon Soo! You're home.

370
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,860
Go in. Go in. You're tired.

371
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,120
- Bye. 
 - Bye!

372
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,720
- You're home. 
 - Mom.

373
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,420
- Are you tired? 
 - Yeah.

374
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,640
I was on my feet all day. I don't know how many perms I gave today.

375
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,260
I'll do it. Go inside.

376
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,920
You will? Do this and wash up. I'll go to bed first.

377
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,380
Okay.

378
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:05,390


379
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,210
 Webtoon/webnovel above its class, JustToon 

380
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,810
It's not ranking higher.

381
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,880
You guys, what should I do to have you read mine?

382
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,630
What do you want?

383
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,860
The comments have increased.

384
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,260
I'm sure they're cussing me out.

385
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,370
Like and Cry is still at the top, right?

386
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,990
Yes. Since it's the season finale—

387
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:47,580
What finale? That one was popular from the get-go.

388
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,190
Cartoonist Cheon must be happy. The reactions are good whatever she does.

389
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,440
Will you hug me?

390
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,990
I want to hug you, but I think you're after something. So, I can't.

391
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,780
Really? Fine.

392
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:15,130
The minute I'm played by cheap pity, that's the end for my sense of self-esteem.

393
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,280
 Moon Soo  

394
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,230
She won't even answer; she's busy dating.

395
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:09,450
 Don't be sorry and don't blame yourself. 

396
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,520
 Chin up as usual. As expected of Ha Moon Soo. 

397
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,110
Why are you taking these?

398
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,290
What...

399
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,730
- Why do you have these—
 - You should've asked me.

400
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,460
I'm a doctor. Couldn't you trust me at all?

401
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,710
- Grandma— 
 - These aren't the ones Grandma used to give you.

402
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:47,300
When you asked for pain killers, Grandma always told you to go get an exam.

403
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:52,100
Do you think Grandma who was like that gave you medicine like this so that you can die?

404
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,360
Why are you acting like this?

405
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,430
Get dressed. Let's go out.

406
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,500
To where?

407
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,260
I heard you fainted recently. You have nosebleed often, too.

408
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,620
That's because I'm overworked.

409
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,960
Are you a doctor?

410
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:18,060
Get dressed. If not, I'll drag you out.

411
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,550
What in the world...

412
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,920
Oh, my.

413
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,330
What do we do?

414
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:38,980
I know.

415
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,160
The pipe burst.

416
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,740
This... we have to control the water pipe, so we'll have to rip out the floor.

417
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,630
It's a huge job.

418
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,910
Can we withstand the winter? How are we to run a business?

419
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:54,380
If this happened after changing out the pipe connection nut and valve last time, there's no answer.

420
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,020
It will burst again anyway.

421
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:02,350
Closing business isn't the issue. We should rip out everything and fix what's broken.

422
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,050
Things won't be solved by plugging it up temporarily.

423
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,850
 MRI Exam Room, CT Exam Room 

424
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,670
 You can lie down flat. 

425
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:30,130
When the exam starts, you'll hear a loud noise. Don't be surprised. You can't move at all.

426
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:34,120
Relax and breathe.

427
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,360
You can close your eyes.

428
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,150
All right.

429
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,740
You can't move.

430
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,820
Jae Yeong! Jae Yeong!

431
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,000
Jae Yeong! Get me out of here! Jae Yeong!

432
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,760
Get me out of here!

433
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,140
Oppa! Oppa!

434
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,680
Oppa, Oppa!

435
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,390
Oppa, it's okay. Oppa!

436
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:47,610
It's bad. The liver numbers are too high. The liver function has dropped way too much.

437
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:51,170
In the medical records from 13 years ago, his liver was damaged.

438
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:55,600
LIS grade was low with grade 2. And there was no organ damage.

439
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,880
It was stable during his physical therapy.

440
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,470
But he should've continued to follow up.

441
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:04,540
On top of that, he's been taking medicine that's poison to his liver.

442
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:11,200
He's fine as far as ascites are concerned. But you can die in a few days with liver failure.

443
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,520
First, put him on the liver transplant list and begin maintenance treatment.

444
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,190
I'll talk to the manager.

445
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:29,080
You have to come to your senses. Wake up.

446
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,330
Why are you looking at me like that?

447
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,890
What? Am I dying or something?

448
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,490
What are you doing? You're scarying me.

449
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:17,150
I'm fine. I'm just tired and my leg hurts. That's all.

450
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:26,770
The liver sends out a signal right before people die.

451
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,260
What liver? I don't even drink that much.

452
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:41,000
You can't go through dialysis for your liver like you can do with your kidneys. If you have liver failure, there's no cure.

453
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:47,970
- While you wait for a transplant, you should treat it to maintain it—
 - Transplant?

454
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:54,610
What... What are you talking about right now?

455
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,680
If I leave it...

456
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:15,630
What happens if I leave it alone? Do I die?

457
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,310
I don't know.

458
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,900
You're a doctor and you don't even know that?

459
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,430
I'm a doctor, not God!

460
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:30,390
My job is to be sure you live another day. Do you think it's my job to figure out when you're going to die?

461
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:35,620
What are you saying? You're talking too much.

462
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,560
I really must be dying.

463
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,240
You won't die.

464
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,370
Why are you crying then?

465
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,060
You won't die.

466
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,490
- Jae Yeong. 
 - Don't call my name.

467
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,230
Call me doctor.

468
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,900
I'm not your younger sister. I'm your doctor who's going to cure you.

469
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:04,270
Don't cry, dummy. I should be the one to cry, why should you?

470
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,820
I'm crying for you.

471
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:14,000
So, don't you ever cry! Don't say things like "I'm dying."

472
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,910
Why?

473
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,140
Isn't this too much!

474
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,260
Why are you doing this to me?

475
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:13,790
 I need to eat well and be healthy. 

476
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,940
 I need to eat well and be healthy so as to not worry you. 

477
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,100
Damn it.

478
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,330
You're late.

479
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,590
Everyone must be at lunch.

480
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,210
Why are you coming now?

481
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:07,430
Something came up. And you?

482
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:16,890
As for me... The memorial. We should finish it.

483
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,120
Let's make it ourselves.

484
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:27,790
I know it's hard to look at it. You'll remember when you look at this.

485
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:36,810
So that we won't forget... I think stuff like this is what we were looking for.

486
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:44,210
Wasn't it like that for you? So the truck that was carrying all these...

487
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,500
What?

488
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,450
Did you get these yourself?

489
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:59,040
Yeah. I wanted you to compliment me.

490
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,650
Why every time? Why do you suffer alone, making me feel bad?

491
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:08,890
I told you before. Suffering should be grouped together.

492
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:11,250
What's the use of suffering together?

493
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:18,630
Anyway, I brought back similar things. I have no idea what to do with it though.

494
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,960
I make models.

495
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,780
Huh?

496
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:28,000
Leave it to me now. I'm confident with putting pieces together.

497
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:40,390


498
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,590
Unni went to work on the memorial—

499
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:18,510
No. Do we have the Shinsudong business leaflet sample yet?

500
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,310
Here.

501
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:31,990
But CEO, did you know that Unni was quitting?

502
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:40,690
She said she's quitting after this project. Unni is very detail oriented and does good work.

503
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,670
So, if she continues to work with us—

504
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:47,450
I'm sure she has her reasons for wanting to quit.

505
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:57,160
This is the blueprint of the shopping mall that collapsed.

506
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:02,910
I heard the architect who built it committed suicide. Have you heard?

507
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,740
I heard.

508
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:12,670
He said a word of apology and committed suicide irresponsibly, according to Ha Moon Soo.

509
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:16,790
That's not true. Unni didn't say that.

510
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:24,720
 You got a cold all right. Take a day off tomorrow and rest. Don't spread it everywhere. 

511
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:38,900
 Unni, it's a bit scary. The soul who committed suicide comes in and... 

512
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,680
 There's no problem with the design itself. The structural numbers were perfect, too. 

513
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,820
 Huh? Why did he die then? 

514
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:51,640
 I know. What's the remaining family supposed to do? 

515
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:59,010
 He should've lived if it wasn't his fault. He should've lived and got to the bottom of it. 

516
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:04,210
 Think about it. What if death was the only way to prove the injustice felt in his heart? 

517
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:07,190
 How terrible a world is that? 

518
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,190
CEO.

519
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,100
The pillar?

520
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:39,220
Yes. I'm thinking of building the memorial out of the pillar that collapsed at that time.

521
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,220
The headquarters won't be too happy.

522
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:45,160
Even if we rebuild it, to use the pillar that had collapsed—

523
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,360
The blueprint for the shopping mall that collapsed... I reviewed it again.

524
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,840
It has the same foundation as the R&amp;D building you've designed.

525
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:56,960
That's...

526
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,740
It showed how much contemplation went into it.

527
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:08,350
I didn't understand why such an accident had happened,

528
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:11,920
but I remembered what you had said, CEO.

529
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,490
 An accident... It rarely happens that bad guys cause it intentionally. 

530
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:21,320
 An accident happens when hard-working people make a small mistake. 

531
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,600
Rather than being an adequately good person to everyone,

532
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,590
even if they talk bad about you because you're picky, it's right to nitpick everything.

533
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:33,650
So, I want to do it as I learned from you, CEO.

534
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:42,850
I can't say not to do it.

535
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,000
Thank you.

536
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,150
 Milky Way 

537
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,920
Not today.

538
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,200
It's not like something's going to happen right this minute.

539
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,200
Does anything change just because I lie there?

540
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:12,780
I mean... Jae Yeong. Jae Yeong!

541
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:19,800
Listen to me. If I really feel like dying, I'll bring myself in.

542
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:25,320
It's true. I don't want to die.

543
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,450
It was composed of earth and sand when I checked.

544
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:43,860
If you found bedrock at a specific place, the cost would have multiplied. Why didn't you report it?

545
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,990
The original contractor is the one who pays, so I have to report to them.

546
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:52,090
Once the construction resumes, we have to put up a temporary wall and nail the H-beams. But we don't have enough.

547
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:56,760
Well, I'll plant 70 of them. And if I feel we're lacking some while working, we'll plant 10 more.

548
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:05,200
Since it's just a temporary fixture, as long as we bury it and put up a building on top of it, no one will know? Is that what you're saying?

549
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,460
The money we saved like that, do you think we're the only ones who ate it up?

550
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,270
- Manager. 
 - Does money come out if you dig the ground?

551
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:17,520
While you do the things you want, we bring the money from elsewhere to cover the cost.

552
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,060
You have no idea.

553
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,810
Move all this!

554
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,000
Y-Yes.

555
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,720
All these documents. Please send them to me via email.

556
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:40,920
But the manager is my supervisor, not you.

557
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,760
In the end, I'm the one who will be responsible, not the manager. Send it to me.

558
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,970
Okay.

559
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,270
Where is Lee Gang Doo?

560
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:18,740
You worked hard today. I'll wrap up tomorrow morning.

561
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,700
No, I don't want you to. Let's do it together.

562
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,810
I'm leaving.

563
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:01,490
Why are you coming now? Hurry up and come!

564
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:06,630
Order everything! I'll raise up the sales for you today!

565
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,050
Today, it's my treat.

566
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:17,830
Why?

567
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:22,950
Farewell drink. We should say cheers.

568
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,980
Why?

569
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,570
I met your wife.

570
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,310
Min Gyeong, why is she doing what she normally doesn't do?

571
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:37,350
Her name is Min Gyeong.

572
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,110
Don't worry about her.

573
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:48,300
I think your wife loves you very much.

574
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,280
She has no interest in me.

575
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,130
She's just worried what I'm up to. Worry, worry!

576
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:57,820
Worrying is also an interest.

577
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:02,580
I shouldn't be the one to say this, but be good to your wife.

578
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:08,990
I envied you for the first time, Director, for having someone to grow old with.

579
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:16,540
Don't be sentimental for no reason! Smile. You were going back to her anyway.

580
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:28,060
It's my treat, so be sure to eat and drink everything. I'll call a girl for you.

581
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:16,800
How could I call this a break up? It sucks.

582
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:44,180
 Architect Seo Ji Ho 
 2005 Space S Mall  

583
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,810
 I sent you the file. 

584
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,190
 Biotown civil engineering, machine and electrical, frameworks, facilities 

585
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,960
 Site blueprint 

586
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,860
 Rather than doing what I'm supposed to do,  

587
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:07,890
 you shouldn't do what you're not supposed to do. I think that's more important. 

588
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,760
I don't think we should leave Moon Soo alone.

589
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,710
While we're down, we should take a break. It's nice to take a trip even for a night.

590
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:30,460
If we go down now, we'll get to see the sunrise in the South Sea. We can see the camellia flowers.

591
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,480
We'll eat yummy food.

592
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,780
It's for the best. We should fix the building while we rip out the floor.

593
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,140
I have money!

594
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:45,080
Eat something yummy with Auntie.

595
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,850
You saw me give her the money, right?

596
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,270
I saw.

597
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:54,770
Don't sleep here alone. Go over to Wan Jin.

598
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:57,710
I got it. Go now.

599
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,990
Call me if anything comes up.

600
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,910
Go. Have fun while you're at it.

601
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:04,410
Okay. Go inside.

602
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,920
Yeah. What?

603
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,250
 I registered you for hospitalization. Come in tomorrow. 

604
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:44,750
Yes, thank you.

605
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,760
Aren't you going to answer me?

606
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,940
I got it.

607
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,380
 Did you tell Moon Soo Unni? 

608
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,910
What's the use telling her? She'd be in pain if she knew.

609
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,470
You're exactly the same as Grandma. Seriously.

610
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:05,570
 What? 

611
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,170
She told me not to tell him.

612
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:14,420
You have to tell him. If he finds out later, he'd be hurt badly.

613
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,790
The patient is so insistent, and for me to do whatever I think—

614
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:21,510
Things that happen so suddenly without warning, I'm scared of them and hate it.

615
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:25,760
I feel that way, so I'm sure Gang Doo feels the same way.

616
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,260
You must tell Gang Doo.

617
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:36,120
So, you tell her yourself. Don't let her find out through other people.

618
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,930
 Be sure to come in. 

619
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,730
 Blood test result  

620
01:07:54,730 --> 01:08:00,410
 Antibody for type B hepatitis virus has been detected in the donor Lee Jae Yeong's blood. She's not qualified to be a donor. 

621
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:31,180
Hyung, let's eat cuties.

622
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:39,090
Why are you sitting there like that?

623
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:41,560
I miss Moon Soo.

624
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:48,200
Ugh, I'm going crazy. I want to see her so much that I might get sick of her.

625
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,310
That won't happen.

626
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:55,780
- Why? 
 - You'll never get sick of her.

627
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,910
Hyung, you don't look good. You look exhausted.

628
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:03,600
I'm tired.

629
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,260
Not just tired. Hyung, you can't get sick.

630
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,520
Moon Soo will be worried.

631
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:23,530
 We're closed due to construction 

632
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:33,570
  The call is not going through. After the beep...  

633
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,620
Moon Soo!

634
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:04,730
 Ha Moon Soo! I have to tell you something. Can you let me see you? 

635
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:11,290
 Moon Soo, I'm sick right now. 

636
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,260
 I'm really sick. 

637
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:18,410
I might faint soon.

638
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:25,920
Open your window and hear me out.

639
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,520
Then, I'll go. I'll never come back here.

640
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:35,950
Show me your face for the last time.

641
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,540
I feel like I'm going to faint.

642
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,990
I'll faint after counting to ten.

643
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:57,000
♫  I don’t want to say anything
 Just want to look at you  ♫

644
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,430
One.

645
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:01,390
♫  I don’t want to forget your face
 Even for a single day  ♫

646
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:06,600
Two.

647
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,970
Three.

648
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,580
 Four. 

649
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:19,570
♫  Let me place you in my heart a little more  ♫

650
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:28,560
♫  My eyes that look at you
I didn’t know it would be this deep  ♫

651
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:35,570
♫  My hands that hold you
I didn’t know they trembled this much  ♫

652
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:39,420
♫  This love, to me  ♫

653
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,040
♫  This heart, to me  ♫

654
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:46,100
 Just Between Lovers 

655
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:49,210
 What was his name? Sounded like a puppy. 

656
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:50,350
 Gang Do? 

657
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:53,290
 Mom, what do you mean Gang Do? Gang Doo. 

658
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:58,290
 You were smiling so big when you were seeing him.
 So, his name is Gang Doo? 

659
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:02,170
 Yeah. Lee Gang Doo. 

660
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:07,990
 He's so handsome without any cuts. 

661
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,600
♫  Until my sad heart settles down  ♫

662
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,830
 He's got big hands. 

663
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:17,400
 You think it's your greed that wants that surgery, right? 

664
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:24,040
 No matter how difficult it is for you, it's our greed that wants you alive next to us. 

665
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,520
 It's not something you can give just because you want to. 

666
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,310
 Because we're not related? Then, I can do it if I marry Gang Doo, right? I can marry him right away. 

667
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:34,110
 Moon Soo. 

668
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:37,930
 Why do you only think of yourself? I'm greedy for the first time in my life. 

669
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:42,530
 And that's you. Who cares about sense of responsibility? 

670
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:45,650
 To live saying only what I want to say... 

671
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:52,290
 I have no time. I only realized that now. 

672
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,440
 Thanks. 

673
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,760
 I love you. 

674
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:05,210
 I love you, Moon Soo. 

675
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:15,420
