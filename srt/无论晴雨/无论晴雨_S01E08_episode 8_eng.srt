2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,830
How?

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,810
How can you be okay?

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,520
Are you...

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,690
really okay?

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,320
It's a relief

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,240
that at least you're okay.

8
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,600
It's a big relief.

♫  Life around your home  ♫

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,290
♫  I hear your voices  ♫

00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,370
♫  Lights resound your hope  ♫

12
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,710
♫  I see your faces  ♫

♫  Being your light  ♫

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,700
♫  Far from you  ♫

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,770
Unnie!

19
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,530
Hey! Why I am here like this?

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,350
When did you get this drunk?

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,710
You didn't drink, right? 
- No.

22
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,410
Carry her on your back.

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,940
Sang Man, please carry the wheelchair for me.

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,470
Okay.

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,760
It was crazy because of us, huh? Sorry.

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,650
I'll leave.

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,350
 Episode 8 

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,110
This is it.

29
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,500
Hey.

30
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,410
I'll entrust you with Wan Jin.

31
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,610
You're not coming with us?

32
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,530
It's turned out that way.

33
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,310
Go.

34
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,530
Ah, I'll take you home. It's dangerous because it's night.

35
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,210
No, it's fine so go up.

36
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:31,090
No, I can't. Gang Doo said not to let a woman go alone at night.

37
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,260
Go up.

38
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,970
I am a bit worried about Gang Doo.

39
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,440
You saw him too?

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,950
Hm?

41
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,890
It's nothing.

42
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,500
Then, when you get home, make sure to let Gang Doo know.

43
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,650
What about Moon Soo?

44
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,660
She said she would go alone.

45
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,520
Hey. How can you let her go alone this late at night?

46
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,460
If you care for each other that much,

47
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,520
why didn't you just walk her home?

48
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,420
Hyung. Hyung!

49
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,020
Do you hear a voice again?

50
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,330
Where is it?

51
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,080
Hyung, do you see it?

52
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,680
Why is it like that to you?

53
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,020
Can't you just say, "I'm sorry?"

54
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,690
It says I can't. It's too late.

55
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,310
It won't accept your apology?

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,610
It's bad!

57
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,230
It's bad, huh? 
- Yeah, it's bad.

58
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,130
It's bad. It's really bad. Don't play!

59
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,070
- Should I? 
- No.

60
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,440
Still, say sorry.

61
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,700
Until it accepts it, say sorry.

62
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,690
Because you did something wrong,

63
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,320
your friend must be mad too.

64
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,570
Why?

65
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,980
- There? 
- Ah, Hyung!

66
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,980
Hurry and say sorry!

67
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,400
Oh, you came.

68
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
- Hello! 
 - Not yet.

69
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,280
Hello.

70
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,250
You came?

71
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:32,480
CEO!

72
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,670
It seems like you didn't go home last night.

73
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,050
Let's have a meeting first.

74
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,650
- Our design. We'll revise the entire design.
 - What?

75
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:13,540
That's too much, CEO. We currently only have 50% of our design budget approved.

76
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,480
If we miss our deadline, I'm sure the client will talk about giving the contract to another company.

77
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,540
They're conducting work offsite as we speak—

78
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,930
There are a lot of reasons not to. I know.

79
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,400
The files we received when we began our design. There's a huge difference between them and the actual construction site.

80
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,370
It's not our fault so if we just let it go, it's okay.

81
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,560
But what if an accident occurs?

82
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,280
Can we still just let it go then?

83
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,630
The subsurface exploration report. That's where you're going to begin, right?

84
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,370
   

85
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,430
Revising the entire design?

86
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,420
No. Please report only current progress.

87
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,810
Report what?

88
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,670
There's nothing for you to know.

89
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,780
 In the past, there was a time she hurt her head 

90
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,180
 so she lost all her memories. 

91
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,920
 We have to check. Who is this person? 

92
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,210
 Lee Gang Doo. 

93
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,850
I'm very satisfied because I think our brand concept has been expressed well in the building design.

94
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,510
I'd like to have Cheongyu work on the additional center that's due to open next year—

95
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,370
Okay. A moment, please.

96
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,850
This is the first place for which CEO Seo was in charge of the design.

97
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,900
It was his first time, but he didn't waver like this without confidence.

98
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,150
It's not that I don't understand that he's doing his best to be even more thorough this time.

99
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,860
But it's too much for him to take responsibility alone.

100
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,720
Did you call me to bad-mouth the CEO?

101
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
Do I look like that terrible a person?

102
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,100
I called you so I could help you.

103
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,010
Before you report situations to Joo Won, first report to me–

104
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,910
I don't want to.

105
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,010
There's something called "order" in work.

106
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,230
If you turn over work like this, you will eventually fail.

107
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,980
Is that bad?

108
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,810
If I'm going to fail anyway. Isn't it better to not be embarrassed doing it?

109
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,690
Director Jeong is not someone who can be treated lightly.

110
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,340
Even though I don't want to either, if we want it to work—

111
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,830
Just because we dislike the same person doesn't mean that we're on the same side.

112
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,610
If we like the same person, can't we at least team up together first?

113
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,970
We both like CEO Seo.

114
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,830
Didn't you come to see CEO Seo?

115
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,470
I came to drop you off.

116
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,370
It hurts my pride to be the one to always seek him out.

117
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,080
If he needs me, he'll probably come to find me.

118
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,790
Do you run errands, too? Give it to me.

119
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,320
Forget it. I'll do it.

120
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,740
You little girl. You sure don't listen to me.

121
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,190
Why do you keep saying I'm small? I'm petite.

122
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,020
Why are you standing here like this?

123
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,500
Didn't you come to see CEO?

124
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,170
Wait a minute.

125
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,950
Don't wake him up.

126
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,740
Let him sleep longer.

127
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,980
I can just ask you.

128
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,540
You're working through lunch?

129
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,990
Everyone is working on revising the plan. There's no time.

130
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,140
What is it you want to ask?

131
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,810
I don't know too much about this...

132
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,430
What's most urgent among these things?

133
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,730
The CEO even went to the factory to place the order.

134
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,830
I guess it's not easy to meet the deadline.

135
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,560
If we have this, we can start the construction for now, right?

136
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,290
Yeah.

137
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,110
Okay.

138
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,630
Leaving?

139
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,210
Eat slowly.

140
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,470
Hello.

141
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,170
How have you been?

142
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,070
I'm looking for...

143
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,970
- I'm looking for some materials. 
 - Oh, yeah?

144
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,230
- By chance, do you know where I can get this? 
 - Let's see.

145
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,210
This, this.

146
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,400
If you find this, please let me know.

147
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,140
Goodbye.

148
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,000
- Hi. 
 - Hi, Gang Doo!

149
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,330
- How have you been? 
 - Good.

150
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,920
Everything's good, right?

151
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,380
Do you know where I can get this?

152
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,310
I got it. Thank you.

153
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,900
Why did you follow and struggle with me?

154
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,260
Go.

155
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,210
I don't want to. Let's go together.

156
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,430
This is pathetic.

157
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,320
No support. No ability.

158
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,560
I don't have a good education and even my legs are giving me trouble.

159
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,970
Even if I don't have much, how could I have nothing like this?

160
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,050
There's nothing I can do with my own ability.

161
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
That's not true.

162
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,600
Even with all those things,

163
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,130
there are many people who would ignore it and not help out.

164
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,330
You don't know what a great guy you are.

165
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,880
   

166
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,680
   

167
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,510
   

168
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,380
What is it?

169
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,980
Hello.

170
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,460
After Jinsoo Maritime Transport went bankrupt, all the containers got stalled.

171
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,410
The agency representing them gave them all up because of the legal fees.

172
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,310
Because the bidding failed, it looks like I won't even get our money back for the cost of the freight.

173
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,780
I get pissed off whenever I see them.

174
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,260
That's why we couldn't pay you guys.

175
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,730
I'm sorry.

176
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,630
This is it.

177
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,580
Ai-ya!

178
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,920
But why do you want these?

179
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,510
I heard that the container freight owner imports architectural materials from Kyeongsan.

180
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,100
Really?

181
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,680
Is that it?

182
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,630
Yeah.

183
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,860
How are you going to move all of these?

184
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,380
Don't worry.

185
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,290
My dad used to drive a freight truck.

186
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,890
It worries me.

187
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,450
It was your dad who was the driver. Not you.

188
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,710
I have a license.

189
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,770
Really, seriously?

190
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,660
It's really big.

191
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,910
You're small.

192
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,900
Let's just call a driver.

193
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,540
It's obvious everyone will be cautious of the manager and will refuse.

194
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,730
Who would you call?

195
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,200
I'm going to leave.

196
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,560
Wait, wait, wait.

197
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,170
Hey, you. Drive slowly. Slowly no matter what.

198
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,950
Got it?

199
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,680
The sound is so awesome.

200
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,680
I sure am glad I got a special license even if it was difficult to do.

201
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,300
I'm taking off.

202
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,340
Why isn't he moving?

203
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,960
Can I honk the horn just once?

204
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,730
Why?

205
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,400
Seriously! Why?

206
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,480
Did you see that? Did you see everyone getting scared and moving out of the way?

207
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,880
It's so awesome!

208
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,530
I... I saw it, so look straight ahead and drive. I think you're crazy right now.

209
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,870
Don't worry. If I die alone, that's fine. But I won't hurt other people.

210
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,850
You called the workers in without any materials and created this mess?

211
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,260
We're preparing, so that we can start right away when the materials arrive.

212
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,980
So, when do you think they're going to arrive?

213
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,400
Why did you have to change the vendor and cause this?

214
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,970
Just do it as it's always been done.

215
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,300
Doing things as you've always done. It's easy, cheap, and effective.

216
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,230
I know that, too.

217
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,080
But you should also know that it can be dangerous.

218
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,390
I'm going crazy.

219
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,280
CEO Seo.

220
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,770
Don't be loud and obnoxious.

221
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,910
The materials that have passed supervision.You say they're dangerous?

222
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,110
Then, how do we do construction?

223
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,390
The materials that fit your taste.

224
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,510
Do you think they will fall out from the sky?

225
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,130
I said stop honking the horn!

226
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,780
- Thank you for lending it to us. 
 - Sure.

227
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,660
- Thank you. Goodbye. 
 - Good day.

228
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,060
Are you that happy?

229
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,030
Take a picture of me.

230
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,650
Geez, doing all kinds of things. Taking a photo with the truck.

231
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,460
Okay, I'll take it.

232
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,960
One, two.

233
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,440
No, no. Go this way.

234
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,090
Yeah. Stand there.

235
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,300
One, two.

236
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,570
Hey, smile.

237
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,400
Smile like this.

238
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,840
Okay.

239
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,780
I'll take it.

240
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,160
One, two,

241
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,650
three.

242
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,580
One more time.

243
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,490
One, two,

244
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,830
three.

245
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,040
Dad.

246
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,580
Huh?

247
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,390
When you used to drive a truck,

248
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,720
was it Sintanjin Service Area?

249
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,000
Do you remember going there?

250
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,390
The pollack stew we had there was really delicious, huh?

251
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,820
They have good pollack stew.

252
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,440
Don't you want to go there again?

253
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,550
Staying in here all the time. Don't you feel all stuffy?

254
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,570
I drove a truck today. I thought of you, Dad.

255
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,070
You were really cool then.

256
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,370
Cool?

257
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,860
I spent all my time on the road. I couldn't even see you guys' faces well.

258
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,140
That's because you were working.

259
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,340
What great thing was I trying to do?

260
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,540
I had no idea how my babies were growing.

261
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,640
Didn't even know how she died.

262
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,290
Aiyoo, forget it. What's the point of talking about it?

263
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,300
It's not like I can turn back time.

264
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,380
Welcome.

265
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,780
- Two mixed noodles. 
 - Okay.

266
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,520
I shouldn't have taken it. I wanted to show it to him.

267
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,840
Who is it?

268
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,930
Who took that picture where you're smiling so prettily?

269
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,400
   

270
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,140
Why is the sign turned off already? Are you already closed?

271
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,900
When I fix one, the other one dies like that.

272
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,480
That happens every weekend. Of all days...

273
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,370
Sauna is totally ruined.

274
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,100
At this rate, we won't be open for business tomorrow either.

275
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,930
Sauna?

276
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,790
Wow, you're much better than any ordinary technician.

277
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,330
Just give me the job.

278
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,060
Where else?

279
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,740
Over there. Below there.

280
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,810
Do you see it leaking?

281
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,640
- This is serious.
 - You don't think you can do it?

282
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,610
Auntie, there's nothing I can't do.

283
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:06,150
There's nothing our Moon Soo can't do. You're a superwoman.

284
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,020
- I don't like superwoman. 
 - Huh?

285
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,180
Feels like you have to do everything well. That's not me.

286
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,240
Why isn't this working?

287
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,200
Then, I'll call her back.

288
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,220
For me to go in...

289
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,050
Geez, I said Moon Soo is busy and can't come out...

290
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,850
Oh, my. How come a CEO is so young?

291
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,410
Come in.

292
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,720
But still.

293
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,320
Geez, you think I'd ask you to come in when everyone's naked?

294
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,930
It's okay. Come in, come in.

295
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:57,480


296
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,090
I feel so secure just watching him.

297
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,140
I've always seen people who are closer to the ground.

298
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,110
I feel so refreshed seeing someone so tall.

299
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,410
You don't have to do this.

300
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,990
It would make me feel better to do this.

301
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,490
We could've wasted our day at the construction site if it weren't for you, Moon Soo.

302
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,800
That wasn't me. It was Gang Doo.

303
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,480
Look at him tightening his arm. Gosh!

304
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,460
Please.

305
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,830
- How can we thank you? 
 - Ask him if he ate.

306
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,890
- Huh? 
 - Ask him if he ate.

307
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,080
Did you eat?

308
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,720
Mom.

309
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,960
No. I haven't eaten yet.

310
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,130
What?

311
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,580
You don't have to eat all of it.

312
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,490
Thank you for the meal. It's been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.

313
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,970
Thank you for eating everything.

314
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,310
You worked hard. You worked too hard.

315
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,130
It was good. I'm telling the truth.

316
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,800
Really?

317
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,580
What do you mean "really?" The CEO's mother is a great cook.

318
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,550
Not anymore these days.

319
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,090
I think her taste changed.

320
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,170
The food she makes these days is too bland.

321
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,780
- Should I pack you some side dishes? 
 - I don't eat at home much.

322
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,770
But please invite me again next time.

323
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,780
Gosh. you speak so politely. You seem so dependable.

324
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,130
Do you drink much? Should I give you a drink?

325
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,140
Mom, the CEO doesn't have that much time.

326
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,110
Hey, do you have time left to drink?

327
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,320
Right? A person can have a drink, don't you think?

328
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,560
Yes.

329
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,940
- Why are you doing this? 
 - What's wrong with you? You won't let me talk.

330
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,400
I'm so embarrassed. Why are you doing this?

331
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,120
What's so embarrassing? What?

332
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,880
Mom.

333
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,050
   

334
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,210
Good night.

335
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,980
Moon Soo. Do you have a younger sister?

336
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,470
- What? 
 - I saw a picture you took together in your living room.

337
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,970
Is it hard to talk about?

338
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,390
Yes.

339
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,060
You worked hard today. Thank you.

340
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,370
All right then. See you tomorrow.

341
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,880
Why are you alone? Did he leave already?

342
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,270
Yeah. I saw him off.

343
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,700
Why do you look so bad?

344
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,610
Me? I must be tired.

345
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,980
I got excited for nothing.

346
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,260
Tons of difficult things would happen when you lived together.

347
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,030
If you say such a thing when you're supposed to be having the best time of your lives, it's a lost cause.

348
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:53,980
I guess. Who cares about what other people think? It's  best when you feel at ease.

349
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,530
- Go in. 
 - Bye, Auntie.

350
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,520
I should go. I'm leaving.

351
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,750
Give it to me.

352
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,630
- Moon Soo. 
 - Huh?

353
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,890
I liked him.

354
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,330
I guess this is what they mean when they say you feel full even if you don't eat.

355
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:26,880
He's good at his job, he's polite to his elders.

356
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,490
He looked like he's not married yet. Does he have a girlfriend?

357
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:34,230
Please. The CEO is just a CEO. Mom, seriously.

358
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:41,910
Why? I wish you'd meet someone who grew up so well without any dark side.

359
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,640
Not like that mutt soaked in rain last time. So pathetic.

360
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,820
I'm getting sick of this.

361
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,440
I want to eat rice.

362
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,490
Did a war break out?

363
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:19,110
Why aren't you eating? You fussed over eating rice, so I prepared it for you.

364
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,650
I don't want to eat it.

365
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,970
You eat things like this and chain smoke. Isn't it such a fraud that you're healthy?

366
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,530
Hey, in my time, we couldn't eat canned food like this because there was none available.

367
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,410
That's why childhood memory is so important.

368
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,390
Geez, what a waste. I shouldn't have opened up all of them.

369
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,290
What do I do now that I opened up everything?

370
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,040
I don't remember anything.

371
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,170
The good times in my childhood. I don't remember.

372
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,360
I only remember all the crappy things that happened later.

373
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:16,620
Gang Doo, it's been over 40 years since my husband died.

374
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:23,970
I lived waiting to forget everything hoping things would get better. And do you know what I realized?

375
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,250
Such a day won't come.

376
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,820
What you can't force, just let it be.

377
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,860
Don't try too hard. Being sad and painful, those things are always with us.

378
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,370
We have to accept that. What else can we do?

379
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,420
It's not fair.

380
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,560
But instead,

381
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,640
you can meet someone better and live a fun life.

382
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,480
You can do that. Don't worry.

383
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,140
What the heck? Are you going to become a fortune teller now?

384
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,760
Why couldn't I?

385
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,870
When you're as old as me, you're halfway to becoming a fortune teller.

386
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,490
Granny.

387
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,570
What?

388
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,470
Live long.

389
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,650
   

390
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,260
You have a lot of tests today, huh? Do you feel good?

391
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,780
I go through this all the time.

392
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,060
Oh, yeah. Gang Doo's younger sister must be at this hospital.

393
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,480
You're right.

394
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,540
After seeing him again, I again realized what a great guy he is.

395
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,930
Let's go to that rooftop again.

396
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,960
He won't let us. Do you know what a scene you made that night?

397
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,490
Whatever. We had fun. Isn't that what matters?

398
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,390
What do you mean?

399
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,660
Don't you remember, Unni? You want me to tell you?

400
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,100
Forget it. Who cares about that?

401
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,500
It was fun. That's the only memory I need to have.

402
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,920
All right.

403
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,640
- Unni. 
 - Huh?

404
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,860
I heard Gang Doo's father also died in that accident.

405
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,850
Is that why you two met?

406
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:53,470
How about you? Did you tell him about your sister?

407
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,930
Yeah.

408
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:06,300
But it's weird. I feel fine when I talk to him about it.

409
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:12,800
That's good. You were meant to meet each other.

410
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:20,040
It's just that you guys aren't talking about it. But you two must be suffering so much.

411
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:30,050
Even I... I get nauseous when I see a motorcycle.

412
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,810
You have no idea what that guy is up to?

413
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,490
I don't know.

414
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,580
I'm sure he's doing fine and that's why he hasn't contacted me.

415
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,280
I'm sure he's fine.

416
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,440
You have to go for your test.

417
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,740
Two people in such a small space... What if Ms. Kim falls off the bed?

418
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,350
What?

419
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:07,000
I've always made coffee for others. It's my first time that someone else is making me coffee.

420
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,930
How is it? Isn't it good?

421
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:22,670
Coffee, fishing. You're a perfect partier. How did you become a director?

422
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,250
I can party like this because I am a director.

423
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,240
What if I didn't have money? There would be nothing I could enjoy.

424
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,100
Such a realist at a place like this.

425
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,690
What are we going to do next time?

426
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,620
Should we ride in a motor home to go see some migratory birds?

427
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,440
- Migratory birds? 
 - Yeah.

428
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,860
Why don't you answer my calls?

429
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,180
What's with you? How did you know about this place?

430
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,450
It's obvious where you hang out. Let's talk.

431
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm here to drink some coffee. Don't worry about me.

432
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,530
What is it?

433
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:15,550
The ledger on the ownership of the land near the road. Before they sue us, go to them first and settle it.

434
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,410
Hey, I told you I'd take care of it.

435
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,730
What did you take care of exactly?

436
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:23,920
Hey, change the way you talk. My wife is waiting to duke it out with you because you're so rude to her brother.

437
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,810
You be careful, Oppa. Your wife knows about this place, too.

438
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:30,520
Be careful of what? She's not interested in me. It doesn't matter. It's okay.

439
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,150
Even if she's not interested, she won't stand for having what is hers taken away from her. That's human.

440
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,380
Doesn't she resemble that woman too much?

441
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,140
Take it easy playing around. It looks a bit dangerous.

442
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,740
   

443
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,440
What the heck is this?

444
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,800


445
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,010
Hello.

446
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,410
We meet here like this!

447
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:34,350
I was wondering how I could meet you again. I thought I should've gotten your phone number. I regretted so much.

448
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,960
I left my phone number in your cell phone.

449
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:44,330
In any case, this is true fate that we meet again like this without contacting each other.

450
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,250
- This is great. 
 - What?

451
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,780
Come in for a minute.

452
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,450
No. No, it's okay. I'll leave after I see you go inside.

453
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:02,690
- I feel bad. Have some tea since you're here.
 - I'm fine.

454
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,880
Let's go in.

455
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,920
Where did you go? You told me to come here all of a sudden.

456
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,040
Why are you here?

457
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,440
Why are you here?

458
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,610
Do you two know each other?

459
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,510
What the heck? How do you two know each other?

460
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,700
Last time, Grandma was on the stree—

461
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,870
On the street, I asked her for some directions.

462
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:32,240
She could've just told me, but she came all the way here.

463
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,350
I brought her in asking her to have something to drink before she goes. So what?

464
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:47,360
I wasted my energy over nothing. People who are meant to meet somehow do so anyway.

465
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,370
Everyone leave.

466
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,350
What's this? You're the one who told me to come.

467
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:57,800
It gets dangerous around here when it gets dark, so you two should hold hands and walk out together.

468
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,210
What are you saying?

469
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,480
Go together. Why are you making me repeat myself?

470
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,870
I'm going to lie down. Be sure to go together.

471
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,330
I didn't know you had a grandmother.

472
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,420
She's not my grandmother.

473
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,560
A friend. Something like that.

474
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:37,870
Kids these days must not play at playgrounds. No one's here.

475
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:45,000
I guess. That's too bad. Let's play for them.

476
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,570
Your parents must've suffered a lot when you were young.

477
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,520
What?

478
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,840
Back of your head is totally round. Like a baseball.

479
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,750
That means you didn't calmly lie around.

480
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:39,520
Or you were crying all day so your mom had to hold you all the time.

481
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:45,300
I don't know. I can't remember.

482
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,540
How about you?

483
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:58,410
I was totally calm. When she laid me down in the morning, I was like that until evening.

484
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,420
Really?

485
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,470
Of course. You think I'm like you?

486
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,600
Then, the back of your head must be totally flat.

487
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,240
It's really flat.

488
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,600
You must be happy that you have a round head.

489
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:46,480
You were a really good kid, huh?

490
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,660
♫  It's not longing  ♫

491
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,180
♫  It's not regrets  ♫

492
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:04,260
♫  What could it be? This feeling that's coming on strong  ♫

493
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,030
♫  It grows when we’re far apart, it comes back when we’re apart  ♫

494
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,550
♫  This excitement is because of you  ♫

495
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,620
I'm leaving.

496
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,660
♫  I'm flying on your eyes  ♫

497
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,310
Can you take the next bus?

498
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,720
♫  The time we were together, that day  ♫

499
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,640
♫  I felt everything seems so great in this world  ♫

500
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,300
♫  I’m flying in your mind  ♫

501
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,880
♫  When I feel as if each days is new  ♫

502
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,210
♫  You were always standing by me at times like that  ♫

503
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,540
♫  As you lean on me,  ♫

504
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:03,300
♫  The sad tears you shed, I will wipe them away  ♫

505
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,750
♫  Days we cried together, Days we laughed together  ♫

506
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,040
♫  I loved all those days.  ♫

507
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,610
I'm not a good kid.

508
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,100
Huh?

509
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,990
I have a huge scar on the back of my head. You didn't know that earlier, huh?

510
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:44,740
I heard I got hurt in an accident, but I can't remember.

511
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:55,540
The only thing I remember is that I left my sister there alone.

512
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:03,580
That there was another person who couldn't come back because of me.

513
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:13,330
But I alone am living a good life perfectly well.

514
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,530
I'm bad, huh?

515
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,320
No.

516
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:55,010
♫  Your lights in your heart  ♫

517
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:01,590
♫  It shines on my day  ♫

518
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:08,640
♫  My eyes on the soul  ♫

519
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,210
 A happy time filled with dreams and music. 

520
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,580
 It's midnight. 

521
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,720
♫  I see your faces  ♫

522
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,510
 An uneventful moment when today becomes tomorrow. 

523
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,020
 I really like this moment. 

524
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:41,100
♫  Living my life away from you, being your light   ♫

525
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:46,430
♫  Far from you  ♫

526
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,460
So Mi. Can I use that just once?

527
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,620
Thanks.

528
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,600
You said you're going to the construction site. I wonder why you're asking me for that.

529
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,010
Unni, wait. It's dark.

530
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,260
Let's put some blush on first.

531
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,060
I wondered why you called me up. You called me to look at this?

532
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,460
You're famous for being great at reading blueprints.

533
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,040
Do I still seem like I'm being stubborn?

534
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,610
Oppa is at the site right now. Let's go there together.

535
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:10,120
I can understand it with this alone, but Director Jeong is different.

536
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,210
Go to the site yourself, show him the problem firsthand and convince him.

537
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,580
My oppa, he's not so pathetic as to deserve your sigh.

538
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,220
He hopes this business succeeds more than anyone else.

539
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,600
What is it?

540
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,360
I'm sorry.

541
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,810
Did you put makeup on?

542
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:44,230
Yes. It looks weird, huh?

543
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:47,460
No. You look pretty.

544
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,530
I'll go to the site.

545
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:01,610
Ha Moon Soo, don't like her.

546
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,600
You buy her good food, listen to her struggles,

547
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,190
Being daddy long legs who loses her to the other guy in the end.

548
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:12,100
I don't want the man I like to be in that role.

549
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:12,880
What?

550
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,260
Ha Moon Soo, Lee Gang Doo. Didn't you know the two of them like each other?

551
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:28,780


552
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,500
The road near the parking lot is still under private ownership. Do you have their consent?

553
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,270
Well, we'll take care of that once we have the approval on the investment.

554
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:45,540
Cheongyu Environment purchased this land back in the 90s.

555
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:52,010
Under the condition that buried waste would be taken care of properly, it was sold cheaply. Was it properly disposed of?

556
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,220
Well, are you holding a hearing?

557
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,460
Our employees are experts.

558
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,630
Let's not speak recklessly just because you're reviewing the files.

559
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:07,910
Did it collapse so shockingly even with all the experts in one place?

560
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,280
It's all been decided by the higher-ups.

561
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:25,600
You just have to sign the documents. That's why we called you here.

562
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,970
Yes, Assistant Manager.

563
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,470
Long time no talk.

564
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:46,110
There's an issue here.

565
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,580
Something's different.

566
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,880
What?

567
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,920
Do you look cuter?

568
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,900
What are you saying? Did you bring the blueprint for the drain?

569
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,300
It's at the office.

570
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,430
Not that direction.

571
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,390
Assistant Manager, this is still...

572
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:44,580
 This is a definite project. We lend money and collect interest. That's our job. Don't do anything unnecessary. 

573
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,740
You were blushing over nothing.

574
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,730
Stop it.

575
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,730
We met before.

576
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You were going around visiting families getting signatures trying to build the memorial and we meet here?

577
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,600
Pardon?

578
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,590
Is this what they mean when people say like attracts like?

579
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:16,770
What's he saying? Who is he?

580
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:20,550
Do you know who this moron's father is?

581
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,100
 You resemble him a lot. 

582
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:36,570
It is because your father was trash the son is working as a dog here, too.

583
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:44,110
Excuse me. Gang Doo's father is a victim who died in the accident.

584
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:46,980
A victim?

585
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,710
Who are you?

586
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,710
Your father is a murderer. What victim?

587
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:56,480
A victim?

588
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:08,160
You're strong. I guess you lived a good life with the rebar your father sold on the side.

589
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:14,340
Huh? You son of a b****!

590
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,600
Stop it.

591
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,050
Stop it! Stop!

592
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,410
Stop it!

593
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:07,030
That's why it collapsed.

594
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,020
Don't go.

595
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:27,280
- I'll explain first...
 - No.

596
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:31,890
Not now. Next time. Let's talk next time.

597
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,150
Next time when?

598
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,460
How come you're so calm?

599
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:07,490
Did you know about Lee Gang Doo's father?

600
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:16,240
This is interesting. "Being in the same boat." Is it something like that?

601
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:22,900
If so, you should've jumped in and stopped them, so that Lee Gang Doo wouldn't take it alone. So cowardly.

602
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,740
Just because Cheongyu is still so successful...

603
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,550
Just because we're the only ones fighting each other, it must seem like someone else's problem to you, huh?

604
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:37,410
Don't speak recklessly. You guys just didn't get punished. Your wrongdoings didn't disappear.

605
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,900
Let's go wash up.

606
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:24,780
Fire me if you want to. I don't care.

607
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,950
Why? Because of your father?

608
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,510
I knew about that already.

609
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:40,640
Did I seem that lax to ask you to work together without such knowledge?

610
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,550
Don't worry about what he said.

611
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:55,260
If the building collapsed just because your father sold a few rebars on the side, I'm sure that building was meant to collapse anyhow.

612
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,170
Even so, It's not that my father did anything good.

613
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:14,440
I'm leaving. It feels so stuffy in here.

614
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,980
♫  I open my eyes  ♫

615
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:53,020
♫  I see you  ♫

616
01:00:53,900 --> 01:01:00,510
♫  I wave my hand and erase you away  ♫

617
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:10,640
♫  No matter how much I try, even if I do that again  ♫

618
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:16,940
♫  You're still smiling in front of me  ♫

619
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:24,560
♫  All the memories that pour into me  ♫

620
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,550
♫  Numerous words  that pop into my head  ♫

621
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:32,610
♫  How can I hold you back?  ♫

622
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:36,590
♫  I'll be here, I'll be here  ♫

623
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:40,490
♫  I held on until it overflowed  ♫

624
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:44,640
♫  I held on until my heart was full  ♫

625
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,620
♫  How can I hold you back?  ♫

626
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:54,070
♫   I'll be there, I'll be there  ♫

627
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:07,240
Lee Cheol Woo? Who's that?

628
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:12,130
Lee Gang Doo?

629
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,960
Birds of a feather flock together to create a fuss, man.

630
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,950
Hey, you a**hole! You didn't even know that as a site manager?

631
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:28,850
Forget it. Fire him right away.

632
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:34,260
The reason? Because I don't like him!

633
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:46,180
Fire him. Right away tomorrow.

634
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:49,560
Who are you firing?

635
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,670
You don't need to know.

636
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,430
There are so many crazies.

637
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,250
Did you have a tough day today?

638
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:14,940
Some crazy guy upset me so much. I'm surrounded by enemies.

639
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:20,900
Don't you become more lonely the higher you go?

640
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:26,120
That's right. You're lonely, too, right?

641
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:37,080
You really know something. This is why I like you.

642
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,380
You said you liked me because I look like your first love.

643
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,770
You do. Really.

644
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,260
Unni, it's not that plan.

645
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:22,080
What's wrong with me?

646
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,000
Moon Soo?

647
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,300
Yes?

648
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:40,000
Would you like some coffee?

649
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,910
Did you sleep okay?

650
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,960
Yes.

651
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,540
Did you talk to Lee Gang Doo?

652
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,070
Lee Gang Doo...

653
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:02,430
 Ha Moon Soo, Lee Gang Doo. Didn't you know the two of them like each other? 

654
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,710
CEO.

655
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,520
Never mind. Get to work.

656
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:21,710
If you don't have any plans tonight, let's eat together.

657
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,730
Hyung. Are you sick?

658
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:33,320
Are you very sick?

659
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,650
Yeah. I'm sick.

660
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,370
You might catch it. So, get out.

661
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:45,880
Should I call Moon Soo and tell her you're sick?

662
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:51,630
Don't call her. I mean it.

663
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:58,460
Hyung. Did you do something wrong to Moon Soo? Did you fight?

664
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:09,280
Then, say sorry fast so that she won't be mad any longer.

665
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,670
And if I say sorry, is that a master key? Will everything be solved?

666
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:19,210
That's why. Apologize until she accepts your apology.

667
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,340
How many times do I have to tell you?

668
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:27,420
Hyung, do you have a screw loose or something?

669
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,850
How are you going to live this tough life this way?

670
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:36,100
I'm so worried for you.

671
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,990
   

672
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:59,640
Aren't you going to answer your phone, Unni? If not, turn it off.

673
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:16,750
 I'm going to go eat noodles for dinner. 

674
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:21,050
 I'm not asking you to come. Just saying I'll wait for you. 

675
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:38,380
Didn't you have something to tell me?

676
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:43,510
No. I just wanted to eat with you, Moon Soo.

677
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,700
Your mother seems nice. She must've been a beauty in her youth.

678
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,110
Do you take after her?

679
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,900
I envied people who ran public bathhouses when I was young.

680
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,430
Did you also go with your friends...

681
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:12,890
Moon Soo. Moon Soo?

682
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:15,380
Yes?

683
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:21,360
   

684
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:59,240
Um, CEO. I'm sorry, but I'll get going first.

685
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,980
Already?

686
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:05,830
I have to go somewhere. I think I should go.

687
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,300
To where? At this hour?

688
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,920
To my dad.

689
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,570
Father. I'll take you there.

690
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,080
No. I'll just go.

691
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:24,330
It will be hard to catch a ride at this hour. If you're going to take a taxi, just go in my car.

692
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:41,630
The older daughter takes after her father.

693
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,020
She's much better than me.

694
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:07,960
She suffered enough. She should live well being treated nicely.

695
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:15,730
Leave if you're finished. Don't be interested in my daughter.

696
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,460
 Moon Soo, do you resemble your mom or dad? 

697
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:31,610
My dad. They say I'm a splitting image of my dad.

698
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,360
Over there. You can stop in the front.

699
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:46,630


700
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:49,870
 Thank you. Be careful going home. 

701
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:59,070
Moon Soo.

702
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:15,770
Do you remember what I said tonight?

703
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:17,250
What?

704
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,810
I knew you wouldn't remember.

705
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,490
So, I was offended.

706
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:33,880
You thinking about someone else in front of me, I don't like it. I'm offended.

707
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,510
♫  Somehow we are  ♫

708
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:51,500
♫  similar to each other, no...  ♫

709
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:58,580
♫  Do only my eyes see that?  ♫

710
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:03,830
♫  Our footprints as we walked together  ♫

711
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,400
   

712
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,660
 I guess the things people do when they're dumped are all pretty similar. 

713
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,240
 I didn't get dumped. 

714
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:18,290
 Still, don't run away. I'll cheer you on, Lee Gang Doo. 

715
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:22,330
 I'll run away. That's better for Moon Soo. 

716
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,340
 Don't be like this here. Go to CEO Seo. 

717
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,080
 - That's better for you. 
 - Who do you think you are? 

718
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,500
 Then us meeting each other meant nothing? 

719
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,080
 Was I excited all by myself all this time? 

720
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,860
 You confused me. You're so bad. 

721
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:39,600
 I'm so angry. It's not like he did anything wrong. Why am I so angry? 

722
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,520
 If you're angry, just get angry! Why are you holding it in? 

723
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,200
 What if he gets disappointed in me when I get angry with him? 

724
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,670
 And I can never see him again that way. 

725
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:51,580
 You don't know Gang Doo at all? 

726
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:56,860
 It's not that he's disappointed. He's afraid he'll hurt you, so he won't open up. 

727
01:12:56,860 --> 01:13:04,000
 Him trying to distance you means he loves you that much more. 

728
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,110
♫  You are a warm place  ♫

729
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:12,620
♫  The day my heart melted, You were by my side  ♫
