1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,100
Hey, don't come close.

3
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,300
Did you catch it?

4
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,000
- How about you? Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

5
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,100
I think I have some medicine left.

6
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,800
No, no, you got it prescribed under your name. Take it all.

7
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,600
Take it. That was my cold to begin with.

8
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,130
Because of what we did last night

9
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,800
what you have and I have is all the same.

10
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,400
Let's go.

11
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,200
Moon Soo. Why is Moon Soo there?

12
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,900
 Episode 13 

13
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,460
Stop looking.

14
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,270
I said don't look.

15
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,400
What are you doing?

16
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
- Being jealous. 
 - Jealous?

17
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,120
He looks cool even in my eyes.

18
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,220
In your eyes, I'm sure more so.

19
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,700
Oh, oh... Hey, it's no use looking at him now. You can't get a refund now.

20
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,000
What refund?

21
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,300
What?

22
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,700
You look especially pretty today.

23
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,300
How could a person become prettier every day so shamelessly?

24
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
What's wrong with you?

25
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,000
Because I can't believe it.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,100
How could you reject a cool man like CEO Seo and

27
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,260
come to me?

28
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,500
We all know that the CEO is a good man.

29
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,300
Geez.

30
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,400
But for me, you're a much better person.

31
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,700
Also a good man.

32
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,900
- Hey, Gang Doo! 
 - Yes!

33
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,400
The land for the memorial park is close to the front entrance. There is a lot of foot traffic.

34
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,100
Since we gave in quite a bit, you'll have to pay special attention to it.

35
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,900
Yes. I'm in the middle of discussions with the landscape design team.

36
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,000
You're aware that chances like this don't come around often, right?

37
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,900
Joo Won said he gave you the job trusting your ability. But I don't believe that.

38
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,100
I'll do a good job without making mistakes.

39
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,300
That goes without saying.

40
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,200
Yes. All right then.

41
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm not done talking.

42
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,070
I wish you'd keep your manners about dealing with the person who's been rejected.

43
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Pardon?

44
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,100
Don't show off your great relationship with Lee Gang Doo in front of CEO Seo.

45
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,100
- That'sâ€” 
 - It's just that CEO Seo doesn't show his feelings.

46
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,410
He's struggling a lot because of you, Moon Soo.

47
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,220
I thought I'd be happy if Joo Won suffered.

48
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,510
But it's harder for me as someone watching him suffer.

49
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,570
I ask you.

50
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,940
Unni!

51
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,700
Where's the CEO?

52
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,700
He went to headquarters with Director Jeong to attend a meeting.

53
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,500
Seriously. Why today?

54
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,300
He's always at the site, so I packed lunch for him as well.

55
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,100
Wow, I'll eat it.

56
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,840
What?

57
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,600
Are you going to waste it then?

58
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,300
You two must be happy. You work together and date and all. You must be so happy.

59
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,500
What a waste. There's so much of it.

60
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,600
What else? We have to eat it.

61
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,700
I have to eat it separately. I have a cold.

62
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,100
You have a cold, too? Did he catch it from you? What did you two do?

63
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,700
Do what?

64
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,700
A relationship where the virus goes back and forth must be so nice.

65
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,700
What do you do when you go on a date? It's been so long for me that I can't even fathom.

66
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,700
Have you gone to the movie theater? There are so many good movies out lately.

67
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,100
A theater feels too stuffy.

68
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,900
Have you been to popular restaurants? Chicken and beer, pizza and beer, stuff like that?

69
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,100
Then, how about the ice rink by the subway station? You can fall over on top of each other. It's perfect to make the next move.

70
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,400
We can't. What if Gang Doo hurts his leg doing that?

71
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,700
So frustrating. Frustrating.

72
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,300
Well, you meet, eat fishcake, take a walk, sit on swings so childishly,

73
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,700
and you walk her home. That's not all, right?

74
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,300
If a theater is too stuffy, go to manga cafe.

75
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,100
Look at this. Isn't it clean? You can even play board games.

76
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,700
If you feel all these things are a hassle and want to take care of things in one place.

77
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,500
If you make a reservation on the day of, the suite costs as much as a motel room.
  Shall we go together?  

78
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,400
Well, you can order food. You can watch a movie, 
  Reservation  

79
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,600
including the physical hunger, all at once.

80
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,000
There are places like that? So interesting.

81
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
So annoying.

82
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,300
Thanks to me, Gang Doo Oppa and site manager are so happy.

83
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,400
So unfair.

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why?

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think I know her.

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,100
If you think you know her, say hi. Why be so serious?

87
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,400
 Concept for Memorial Park Design 

88
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
 Installation of S Mall Victims Memorial Park Plan 

89
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,700
 Consent from the Victims' Family for Biotown Memorial Park 

90
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,900
 Victim's Family - Ha Dong Cheol 

91
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,000
 Restaurant for sale 

92
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,000
Did you know that Moon Soo was working there?

93
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,260
Why did you both leave me out?

94
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
Try to understand Moon Soo.

95
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Fine, fine. I'm the one with the problem.

96
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,800
What is she doing there?

97
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,680
If you're curious, go there yourself.

98
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,430
How can you say that?

99
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,800
Why should I go there?

100
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,600
I'll never go there!

101
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
You and Moon Soo both, how could you...

102
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Let's stop this.

103
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
If you say stop, is it something you can stop? Is that how it is with you?

104
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,800
Let's let go of the person if we're supposed to.

105
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,550
Yeon Soo is dead.

106
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,690
I... I can't let her go.

107
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,800
Do you know whose fault that was?

108
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Who's the one who wouldn't even let me see Yeon Soo one last time?

109
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,400
Who was it, huh? Who?

110
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,800
Do you know how much I regretted that?

111
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,100
I regret it, too!

112
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,380
My last time seeing Yeon Soo...

113
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,790
You'd regret it even if you had seen her.

114
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,100
If you came here to compete for who has it harder, just go.

115
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,730
It must be so nice to be at peace.

116
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,800
How... How could you be perfectly fine like this?

117
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,100
In your eyes,

118
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,600
do I seem perfectly fine living this way?

119
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,800
Look. How could a parent be perfectly fine after losing a child?

120
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,100
Where is such a person who is perfectly fine after going through that?

121
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Hi. Good job, Gang Doo.

122
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Gang Doo. Hey, blood.

123
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,600
Are you the only one working? If this happens, you make it seem like I'm working you hard.

124
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,800
If I'm working, I should show it off.

125
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Lift your head.

126
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,600
 It's commonly used as a painkiller. 

127
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 But it can damage your liver. So, I don't prescribe it to patients with liver problems. 

128
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,000
Can I take a look at medical records from 2005?

129
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,400
This is a pond. I think we can color it blue on the plan.

130
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Unni. I enjoy working like this with my hands more.

131
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,100
When the design team comes back, I'll have to go back to working on the computer.

132
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Next time, I want to work with you from get-goâ€”

133
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,400
You'd be able to do it alone next time, So Mi.

134
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,600
I'm quitting after this project.

135
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,800
Why?

136
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,200
I was to only work on this project from the beginning.

137
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,800
Then, renew your contract. I'm sure the CEO would do that for you.

138
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,500
That's why.

139
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,460
That's why I can't work here any longer.

140
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,110
When you finish coloring, get the plan from the lighting team and try posting it yourself, So Mi.

141
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,800
It's a walkway along here. So, leave it blank.

142
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,600
If we're going to build the memorial park at the original parking lot area, we have to request a change of plans.

143
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,400
We have to get a new estimate, too. We'll talk to the vendorâ€”

144
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,000
You take care of all that yourselves.

145
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
That's why I'm paying you!

146
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,000
The park will be connected to the neighborhood walkway. If the landscape design is worked on separately,

147
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,200
- the budgetâ€” 
 - Keep the quality, but lower the expenses.

148
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,400
That's what's important to me. I don't want to know all the specifics of the process.

149
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,600
And you. Stop playing hard to get and go on a blind date.

150
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,570
Why?

151
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,400
Kim Hwa Min's father is the Vice Minister of Ministry of Land, Transportation, and Tourism. If we can manage them well...

152
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,000
For us to be here...

153
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,300
There's no need for us to have a discussion without an answer.

154
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,400
Is that something a Cheongyu Construction executive director should say?

155
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,600
That's how I got married. I'm not asking only you to do it.

156
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,500
After wrapping up the accident, I got married within two months.

157
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,200
Father pushed me into it saying my father-in-law will be the chairman of the Architecture Industry Association.

158
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,400
You think I got married because I wanted to?

159
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,300
Do you know how Cheongyu

160
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,700
came this far?

161
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,800
Hey. You're not the only one who sacrificed.

162
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,100
Speak. What do you think about that?

163
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,300
If he's such a person, I guess he'd be a great help to Cheongyu.

164
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,770
We'll begin the construction of the foundation work on the parking lot right away.

165
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,000
- Tomorrow at the siteâ€” 
 - How about for me instead of Cheongyu?

166
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,800
Going on a blind date. Do you think it's helpful to me as well?

167
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
That's up to you.

168
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,500
No. Answer me. I'll do whatever you say.

169
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,000
How do you want me to answer?

170
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
I told you not to sigh in front of me.

171
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
I can only sigh.

172
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,200
You whining like this... To me, you're full of it.

173
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,700
Let's say your brother married someone he didn't want to. But I lost my father.

174
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,900
Even you whom I trusted the most. You turned your back on me saying you had to work for the company.

175
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:17,220
How about you? What did you lose?

176
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:25,370
My answer is the same. He'll be helpful to Cheongyu.

177
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:33,000
If that's the case, I'm sure you'll marry him even if I tell you not to.

178
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
Open. Say ah...

179
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,400
Open wide. Ah...

180
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,250
That's right.

181
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,400
I learned it from Mama. She said it'll work like magic with one spoonful of this.

182
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,200
Where did you catch such a nasty cold?

183
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,200
What's wrong with you?

184
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,800
What did you decide to do with this place? Mama must've told you what to do.

185
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,000
She said it's the last fortress.

186
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,300
There's something like that.

187
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,500
How did you know about that noodle place?

188
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,800
What else? I went because the noodles are delicious.

189
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Why?

190
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,400
I went there with Director Jeong and something crazy happened.

191
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,200
We got kicked out.

192
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,700
Noona!

193
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,600
How can you take that moron there?

194
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,200
That's why I'm asking you!

195
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,000
It's run by Moon Soo's father.

196
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,400
What about it?

197
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,800
He must've recognized Jeong Yoo Taek as someone from Cheongyu.

198
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,600
You should've told me in advance. I wouldn't have taken him there.

199
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,200
By chance, Noona, do you like that moron?

200
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,600
I told you he's my client.

201
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,400
You went there with your client to eat some noodles?

202
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,300
Is that... Are you kidding me?

203
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,000
You said you're going to date a single man. Don't you know he has a wife?

204
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I know. I know, but...

205
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He's so childish and petty.The more I see him, the sorrier I feel for him.

206
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Picking up guys because you feel sorry for them... Make me the last person for you to do that.

207
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,900
Or take care of the cats. There are so many out there.

208
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,100
Don't fall for him. You're too good for him.

209
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,740
In any case, he sure does know how to sweet talk.

210
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,700
You're home.

211
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,200
Let's eat. Auntie brought some cabbage, so I made some bean paste stew.

212
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What are you doing? Sit down.

213
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't feel like eating.

214
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,300
Still, eat.

215
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,200
You eat a lot.

216
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,500
What are you doing over there?

217
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,800
Did you come to eat noodles?

218
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,100
No.

219
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,700
Then?

220
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,100
I was thinking. Why did I come here?

221
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,000
I want to yell at someone...

222
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,600
But I have nowhere to go.

223
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
Do you even know what kind of place this is?

224
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
I know. It's Ha Moon Soo's father's restaurant.

225
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,700
Wait.

226
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,200
Have a drink with me.

227
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,900
Why should I?

228
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,400
Just because.

229
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,510
I don't think I should leave you alone.

230
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,500
You're so handsome. So handsome.

231
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,200
Wow. He's more of a hyung than Hyung. A real hyung.

232
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,300
- Wow. Hyungnim! Hyungnim! 
 - Aigoo.

233
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,100
Is he sleeping over? Do you want some blankets?

234
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,180
No, it's okay. Give me one ramen.

235
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,500
One won't be enough.

236
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,500
Wow, you're an awesome hyung. A total hyung.

237
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,300
- I'll pay you back tomorrow. 
 - Take these, too.

238
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's go.

239
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,900
Hyung, I'll bring up some kimchi.

240
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,410
My room is too small.

241
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:12,130
You'll get warm if you eat this. Eating ramen when it's cold is so cool.

242
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,920
What were you talking about earlier?

243
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,780
Yell at whom?

244
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,400
By chance... Moon Soo?

245
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,300
No way. You don't hate someone you like overnight.

246
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,930
Then who?

247
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,100
Me? Were you waiting for me?

248
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:56,310
Lee Gang Doo I envy you. I don't hate you.

249
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:05,030
Lee Gang Doo, since when did you start liking Ha Moon Soo?

250
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
For us to be talking about thatâ€”

251
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I was attracted to her from the beginning.

252
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,600
Do you want to live in a place like this? Can you live here with your children?

253
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,000
It'd be nice if we had buildings that were 100, 200 years old.

254
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,370
Right?

255
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:30,750
 The subsurface exploration. You'll begin with reevaluating the report, right? 

256
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,560
 Monthly Planner 

257
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,940
I met someone with the same heart as me for the first time in a long time.

258
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,970
I was happy. She got me excited.

259
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,000
I didn't think I'd feel that way again.

260
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:57,140
Tell me, Lee Gang Doo, so that I can understand and give her up.

261
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,610
- Just because. 
 - Just because?

262
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,240
Just because.

263
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,260
I saw her today, but I want to see her again tomorrow.

264
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,530
Doesn't that mean I like her?

265
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,640
I...

266
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,540
only had to survive for the day.

267
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,830
But after meeting Moon Soo,

268
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,100
I'm curious about tomorrow. I'm waiting for it.

269
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:53,710
Hyung! Hyungnim! Kimchi. Kimchi...

270
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,860
I'll be back.

271
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,410
Okay.

272
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:53,390
So cold! What do you want to see coming all the way here?

273
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,200
Oh?

274
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,990
So pretty. Why did you want to come here?

275
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,040
You know this doesn't suit you at all, right?

276
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,130
What do you mean it doesn't suit me?

277
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:19,760
When I was in school, I used to be the chairman of the Bird Research Society.

278
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,390
To take a picture of the hooded crane, I went all over the country every season.

279
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,490
You took photos, too?

280
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:33,860
Hey, if I hadn't entered into this industry because of my dad, I would've become a documentary director.

281
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,640
My dream was to make a National Geographic Korean version.

282
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:46,250
I lived in nature, traveling all over the world.

283
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:52,450
Hey, do you know how loud it is when a tundra swan makes a noise when flying?

284
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,600
If they all fly away together,

285
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,260
then it's as loud as a helicopter.

286
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,610
And over there, light brown and white. Do you see that?

287
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:05,220
They come from Russia on a 3,660 km round trip without taking a break.

288
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,330
They fly from here to Khabarovsk in exactly two weeks. Does that make sense?

289
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,760
I guess you don't realize how fast that is. It's as fast asâ€”

290
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,750
Stop explaining. It's no fun knowing everything.

291
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,850
They'll stay like that and leave again without regrets.

292
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,210
That's all I need to know.

293
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,640
- I'm leaving. 
 - Why are you leaving so early?

294
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,730
What do you mean leaving early? I've been here since early morning.

295
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,300
Hey, hey, wow. Your clothes, they're different.

296
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,820
Aren't you going home?

297
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,280
Is there still work left to do?

298
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,030
Aigoo, don't mention it. I thought it would end if we continued to dig and deliver everything.

299
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,090
But there are so many concrete pillars stuck all over the place.

300
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,470
Bam, bam, bam... They're breaking everything up all day long.

301
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,950
My head is still shaking.

302
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,960
I don't think I can hear well either.

303
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,050
Hey! I thought you were going home. Why are you going that way?

304
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,960
What? You said you had to buy something.

305
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,500
Let's go somewhere else.

306
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:10,130


307
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,980
I'm really fine. I don't need anything.

308
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,660
Yeah. You're fine.

309
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,700
No matter how dense I may be, would I ask you to pick out your own gift?

310
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,050
Then?

311
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,290
Jae Yeong. I want to buy her a gift.

312
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,090
What would be good?

313
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,500
- A birthday gift? 
 - No.

314
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,240
She's finishing up her internship next month. Congratulating her finishing up.

315
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,260
She's cool. A doctor.

316
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,000
What would be good?

317
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,850
What did you buy her for her birthday? What does she like?

318
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,490
I've never given her a birthday gift.

319
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,140
What?

320
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,230
The day of the accident was Jae Yeong's birthday.

321
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,740
It's also Father's memorial day.

322
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,540
She's never had a happy birthday since turning thirteen.

323
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,480
That's why I want to get her something.

324
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,420
She grew up all alone. I don't know what would be good for her.

325
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,560
She liked things like this when she was little. But not now, right?

326
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,150
 Medical Records 

327
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,640
 Traumatic liver injury 

328
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,530
Traumatic liver injury.

329
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,710
I heard a lot about you from the executive director.

330
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,350
I really hate blind dates.

331
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,750
Father asked me to come out.

332
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,580
I met the Vice Minister at an industrial estate planning meeting.

333
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,280
Not to mention, there was a business report meeting at the Ministry of Land, Transportation, and Tourism.

334
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,820
He's supporting it so that Cheongyu Biotown will become the Moksan area's main business.

335
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,050
So, that must be why we're meeting like this, right?

336
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,590
What?

337
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:23,940
An architecture major falls under engineering. You must've been very popular.

338
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,980
Engineering department goddess, something like that.

339
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,930
Class has been canceled.

340
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,460
 Class Cancelled 

341
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,380
 You didn't get the notice? 

342
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,120
 I guess only you and I didn't know.   

343
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,520
 You take History of Architecture, right?   

344
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,020
 Excuse me? 

345
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,260
 The group project. Do you want to work with me? 

346
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,000
 Do you know who I am? 

347
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,620
 I know. Jeong Yoo Jin of the entering class of 2004. 

348
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,150
 If it's okay, do the project with me. 

349
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:41,940
Sunbaenim, I sent you a group text saying our class got canceled last week. But why didn't you come to our gathering?

350
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,460
 We drank in the afternoon that day. 

351
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,560
 Oppa, did you decide on the team for your group project? 

352
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,290
 You're doing it with us, right? 

353
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,360
 Oppa, are you working on your group project with Yoo Jin Sunbae? 

354
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,160
 - Who's that? 
 - Jeong Yoo Jin. The construction company that's building the shopping mall in Wooseok-dong. 

355
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,730
 She's infamous for getting into our school with her dad's connections. 

356
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,110
 That sunbae lured you, huh? 

357
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,450
 No, I asked her to work with me first. 

358
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:10,160
 Why? I heard she sticks with a good student and walks away with a good grade. 

359
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,640
 Even the professors give her the only high marks on group assignments. 

360
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,620
 So, everyone avoids her for that reason. 

361
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,640
 For that reason, she works extra hard. 

362
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,060
 Being afraid that things would turn out like the rumor, she hasn't been even tardy once. 

363
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,780
 She's talented, too. I'm thinking of taking advantage of her this time. 

364
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,280
 Bye. 

365
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,930
 Hey, what the heck? 

366
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,670
The next project for the Ministry of Land, Transportation, and Tourism is building rental residences.

367
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,870
If Moksan city wins the bid, the land near Biotown will be assigned.

368
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,970
Regarding that project, Father...

369
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:58,180
If we're going to talk about work, let's meet again at the office. Not here.

370
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,550
 How about you? 

371
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,240
 What did you lose? 

372
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,770
- You're going home without eating dinner? 
 - Yeah.

373
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,440
I have to go home early tonight.

374
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,740
Why?

375
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,450
Mom seems weak these days. I left her alone too much.

376
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,770
The bus is here.

377
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,940
Here.

378
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,350
It's your sister's.

379
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,520
I bought Jae Yeong's separately.

380
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,270
When did you buy it?

381
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,670
Let me pick.

382
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,980
â™«  It's not longing,  â™«

383
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,520
â™«  it's not regrets  â™«

384
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,270
â™«  What could it be  â™«

385
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:22,460
â™«  This feeling that's coming on strong  â™«

386
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,810
â™«  It grows when weâ€™re far apart,  â™«

387
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,290
â™«  Â it comes back when weâ€™re apart  â™«

388
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:36,350
â™«  This excitement seems to be because of you for some reason  â™«

389
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,940
â™«  I felt that  â™«

390
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:43,140
When you weren't looking.

391
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,160
Get in.

392
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,110
I'm leaving.

393
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:52,230
â™«  I felt everything seems so great in this world  â™«

394
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:57,620
â™«  Iâ€™m flying in your mind  â™«

395
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,160
â™«  When I feel as if each days is new  â™«

396
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,900
â™«  You were always standing by me at times like that  â™«

397
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,000
â™«  As you lean on me,  â™«

398
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,830
â™«  The sad tears you shed, I will wipe them away  â™«

399
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:25,880
â™«  LOVE  â™«

400
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,420
â™«  Days we cried together  â™«

401
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,100
â™«  Days we laughed together  â™«

402
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,510
â™«  I loved all those days  â™«

403
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,790
â™«  Iâ€™m flying in your mind  â™«

404
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:53,070


405
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,100
You crazy bastard!

406
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,360
What's with you again?

407
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,470
It's so cold. Give me a ride to that intersection over there.

408
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,070
I'm not going in that direction. Get out.

409
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,830
Where are you going then? Going home?

410
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,890
After seeing Ma Ri, are you okay seeing your wife's face at home?

411
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,630
We're not in a relationship to talk about personal matters, right?

412
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:46,810
If you keep seeing my noona, I think we'll have a personal relationship.

413
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,230
Why? Did Ma Ri say something?

414
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:55,000
What? Is she concerned that I'm a married man?

415
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,240
I'm the one who's very concerned.

416
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:08,020
So that I won't concern myself too much, let's just stay as a very rich client to my noona. Okay?

417
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,580
Hey. Stop minding my business.

418
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,340
You behave.

419
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,710
If you don't want to end up like your father,

420
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:24,450
so that Seo Joo Won won't ruin the project making a mistake like his father did,

421
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:28,270
open your eyes wide and watch him at the construction site.

422
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,790
Get out.

423
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,540
Hug me.

424
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,730
Yoo Jin.

425
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,110
I won't expect anything.

426
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,580
Hug me.

427
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,050
Just think I'm a stranger.

428
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,900
Just feel sorry for me. Just because I look so cold.

429
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,630
Even for that reason, couldn't you hold me?

430
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,000
Mom!

431
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,520
Mom...

432
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,960
Mom.

433
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,610
Mom.

434
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,260
Mom!

435
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,460
Auntie, it's me. Mom's not home.

436
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:01,700
When did she go out?

437
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,460
When did you grow so much?

438
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,630
 Ha Yeon Soo 

439
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,180
Don't you miss me?

440
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,890
Why don't you come visit me?

441
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,170
I'll sleep a lot.

442
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,630
Come to me in my dream.

443
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,260
 Ha Yeon Soo 

444
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,260
What are you doing out here?

445
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,170
Where did you go? You didn't even answer the phone.

446
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,010
Go in.

447
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,670
Did you drink?

448
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,060
I'm going to.

449
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:11,910
What? This is my only friend.

450
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,190
Don't you know what comes to my mind if I can't get in touch with you?

451
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:29,000
What comes to your mind?

452
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,130
You think I went somewhere and died?

453
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,320
If I was going to die, I would've died soon after Yeon Soo died.

454
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,410
For whom do you think I'm living this way?

455
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,160
How about me?

456
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,040
For whom do you think I'm doing this?

457
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,160
What about you?

458
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:05,330
You're good at your job and meet a man on your own.

459
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:08,740
You have a good relationship with your dad.

460
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,800
 Consent from the Victims' Family for Biotown Memorial Park 

461
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:21,260
Should I have pretended not to know like an idiot?

462
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,490
Didn't you think about why I couldn't tell you?

463
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,360
Don't you know how cautious I am around you?

464
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,050
When were you ever cautious around me?

465
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:35,620
You take after your dad. You don't listen to me at all.

466
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,250
Even that day,

467
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,380
I told you to stay with Yeon Soo.

468
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,680
If I had been with her, I would've been dead, too.

469
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,280
Would that have been better?

470
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,950
Or did you wish I had died instead of Yeon Soo?

471
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,570
How could you say that to your mother?

472
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,550
I can't?

473
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,950
You say everything you want to say, Mom.

474
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,720
You b**ch.

475
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,990
Why am I the only bad person?

476
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,100
You're the one who sent us there that day.

477
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:32,880
Then, you should feel bad for me. Why do you keep making me feel bad?

478
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,680
Get out.

479
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,200
Get out, get out. Get out! Get out!

480
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,680
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

481
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,440
Get out! Get out!

482
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,620
You b**ch! Get out!

483
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,380
Get out! Get out! Get out!

484
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:27,470
Dad, go over to our house.

485
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,280
What's wrong?

486
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,140
Go and stay with Mom.

487
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,250
Did you come out like this? Your shoes...

488
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:41,320
Don't worry about me. Go and take care of Mom.

489
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,630
I don't think Mom should be alone.

490
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,030
Your mom said yesterdayâ€”

491
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,540
Just go! Hurry up and go!

492
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,710
 So that Seo Joo Won won't ruin the project making a mistake like his father did, 

493
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,800
 open your eyes wide and watch him at the construction site. 

494
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,180
What are you doing here in this cold?

495
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,360
Why are you here?

496
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,590
I was just thinking that I miss you. You really came.

497
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,710
It's neat.

498
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,180
Aren't you cold?

499
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,270
What brings you here?

500
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:11,080
Telepathy.

501
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,790
I thought you might miss me.

502
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:20,030
Why don't you go inside? Why are you out here?

503
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,440
Stand up.

504
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,920
Why?

505
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,140
I don't want to go inside.

506
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,840
Then, let's go somewhere. You'll catch your cold again.

507
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,320
I'm okay.

508
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,580
Let me down.

509
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,160
I'll let you down when I see a shoe store.

510
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,280
Stay on my back for awhile.

511
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,180
â™«  Somehow we are  â™«

512
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,980
It's nice.

513
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,660
I like your scent.

514
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,040
Why do you like sweat smell?

515
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,870
Your sweat smell is different. I like it.

516
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:38,710
You have such unique tastes. You've completely fallen for me.

517
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,610
Yeah.

518
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,150
I don't want to go home tonight.

519
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:56,910
I don't want to go.

520
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:03,410
Don't go then. Stay with me.

521
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:09,060
I...

522
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:13,240
really hate myself.

523
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,230
â™«  You're...  â™«

524
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:19,950
Then, I guess I have to like you even more.

525
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:25,420
I want to run away.

526
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,760
Sure, why not? Where do you want to go?

527
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,220
â™«  Inside this cold story  â™«

528
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,490
I don't know. I've never gone away.

529
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:40,530
â™«  You are a warm place  â™«

530
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,380
Let's go somewhere.

531
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:49,430
Okay.

532
00:54:50,480 --> 00:55:00,240
â™«  The day my heart melted,
 You were by my side  â™«

533
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,430
This is the only place I know.

534
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:21,370
Or I felt like I'd run away with her.

535
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:24,690
Oh. Lay her down first.

536
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,600
What's wrong with her?

537
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,130
I don't know what happened.

538
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,820
I came running because Moon Soo's dad called me.

539
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:53,040
Aigoo. How upset was she alone that she's knocked out?

540
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,130
Let her sleep. I'll go.

541
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:58,240
Oh, wait, wait.

542
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,660
We were about to go out.

543
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,410
Oh, yes. We were about to leave.

544
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,970
I don't think you should leave her alone.

545
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:11,620
Why don't you stay with her until she wakes up?

546
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,240
Let's go.

547
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,110
Pack up.

548
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,560
- So cold. 
 - Didn't you have to go somewhere?

549
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,130
- Why did you come out? 
 - Hey.

550
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:48,020
You're an assistant for romantic genre work, yet you have no sense?

551
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,790
Who do you think Moon Soo wants to see when she wakes up?

552
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:55,290
You're a good friend.

553
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:58,120
It's nice to get some air, isn't it?

554
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,830
How did you and Moon Soo meet?

555
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:05,260
At the hospital.

556
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,660
Moon Soon was in the building collapse accident and I was in a motorcycle accident.

557
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,510
Motorcycle?

558
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,270
I enjoyed fast speeds in my younger days.

559
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:15,240
Motorcycle.

560
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,270
Don't look for words of consolation. I got what I deserved.

561
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:25,760
I was out of my mind acting all strong and bluffing.

562
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,320
Gosh, I was totally crazy and completely annoying.

563
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:36,910
So, how much of a fit do you think I threw?

564
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:40,840
Saying I'd rather die than live in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.

565
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:51,120
Do you think this was easy from the beginning?

566
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,430
I'm finally okay with it now.

567
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:01,580
I would've never made it this far if I were alone.

568
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:09,260
Thanks to that frustrating Moon Soo, she stuck around hearing all kinds of crap from me.

569
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:15,160
So, I have to be good to Moon Soo.

570
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:22,210
Ah! I thought of a place I want to go to. Let's go.

571
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,140
Just a moment. Did it get caught somewhere?

572
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:42,370
Take your time. I'm used to waiting.

573
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,760
Um,  the customers are complaining it's cold. I'll close the door.

574
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,740
Ah, I'm sorry.

575
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:54,460
There used to be a ramp here, but it's gone.

576
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,950
The customers kept tripping over it and falling down.

577
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,420
How about wheelchairs if you remove that?

578
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:03,560
We don't have any disabled customers.

579
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,350
It's not that you don't have any disabled customers. You just don't accept them?

580
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:09,130
We're packed right now. I'm sorry.

581
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:12,860
What do you mean it's packed? We're perfectly fine.

582
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,590
Let's go. They're looking at us.

583
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,690
Who cares? Did we do something wrong?

584
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:22,610
It's not that they don't exist just because you don't see them. They can't come here because it's so inconvenient.

585
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,350
Let's go, Wan Jin. Let's go to a nicer place.

586
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:31,650
I heard there's no threshold in Australia.

587
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:35,450
In the US, there's an incline in the movie theaters so that disabled people can watch movies, not stairs.

588
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,540
Yes, President, it's me.

589
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:43,440
You know the dessert cafe on the first floor of our commercial building? When does the contract expire?

590
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:47,020
Right? March is when they renew their contract, right?

591
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,730
I don't want to have that store anymore.

592
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:54,120
I know that they do good business, but I don't want to do that this time around.

593
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,510
No, I have more than enough rent as is.

594
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,640
Am I doing this over money?

595
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,030
If they have a good mindset, I can even lower their rent.

596
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,390
In any case, tell this to the owner.

597
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:14,710
Tell him to think what the problem is and if he's willing to fix it, I'll reconsider renewing the contract.

598
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,730
Okay, goodnight.

599
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:22,190
Do you own this building?

600
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:26,120
Yeah. My family is a bit rich.

601
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:31,510
Isn't that fortunate? Come see when they renew the contract.

602
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:34,780
Should I talk to Moon Soo and remodel the place?

603
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:38,760
Should I get rid of all the stairs in the building? Let's go.

604
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:41,100
- Yes. 
 - Where are you?

605
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:44,390
Wan Jin Unni's place.

606
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,300
How is Mom?

607
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:52,000
She's sleeping. Don't worry. I'll be here until Auntie comes tomorrow.

608
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
No, I'll come.

609
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,600
 It's okay. Rest there. 

610
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,950
 Moon Soo. 

611
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,700
Your mom and I...

612
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:10,100
We'll continue to be this way. It will be hard to change now.

613
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,280
 So, don't get hurt unnecessarily. 

614
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:19,300
 And don't be too concerned with us, but know this one thing. 

615
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,100
Your mom acting this way...

616
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:29,000
She's hurting. It's not because of you.

617
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:32,480
I know.

618
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,900
Yes.

619
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,250
Yes.

620
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:13,540
I thought you left.

621
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:20,410
Where would I go leaving you here?

622
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,820
Where is Unni?

623
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,600
I think she left on purpose.

624
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,200
Why are you out here?

625
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:49,700
When I see you, I keep wanting to touch you.

626
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,810
Do you feel better now?

627
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:14,810
What?

628
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,700
What would I have done without you?

629
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:24,000
What do you mean without me? I'm here.

630
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,010
I remember seeing you.

631
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,000
There...

632
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,900
I wasn't alone. I was glad you were there.

633
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,800
I remember thinking that.

634
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,300
I was like that, too.

635
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,600
But I don't have other memories.

636
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:01,500
We were together, but why did we meet just now?

637
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:09,600
Tell me. You remember everything.

638
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,330
Just leave what you don't remember.

639
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,170
It's because you don't need to remember.

640
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,300
That's for my own comfort.

641
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,800
Then, do you want everyone to feel uncomfortable?

642
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,600
It's better if one of us feels comfortable.

643
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,560
Why?

644
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:56,700
I think I said some mean things to my mom.

645
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:00,300
It's okay to throw a fit every once in awhile.

646
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,100
It's too exhausting to live kindly all the time.

647
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,900
Why are you always on my side?

648
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:13,700
Are you stupid? Because I like you.

649
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,100
I like you, too.

650
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,300
I like you so much

651
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:27,900
that I wonder if it's okay for me to feel this way.

652
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,600
It's okay.

653
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:34,080
You have to.

654
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:45,500
If it weren't for that accident, I'm sure everything would've been perfect.

655
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,400
Oppa.

656
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,300
You came.

657
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:12,100
 After we allowed them three goals, we scored two goals 10 minutes into the second half chasing after them fiercely. 

658
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,600
 That's right. It appears that Korea made some changes to its formation during this second half.  

659
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,340
 Korea placed mid-fielder player Lee Gang Doo at the front. 

660
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:22,300
 Due to that, the offense has been much stronger. 

661
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,300
 Unlike in the first half, Korea is crushing the opponent right now. 

662
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:28,500
 Yes, while you were talking, Lee Gang Doo is moving fast with crazy footwork. 

663
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,300
 Lee Gang Doo, Lee Gang Doo. Shoot! 

664
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,600
 Shoot! Ahh, Unfortunately, he failed. 

665
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,700
So close!

666
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,500
Manager!

667
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,900
Take your time. I'll go.

668
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,300
No, let's go together.

669
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:53,600
I told you to eat slowly. I'll be back.

670
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,700
Oh! Goal! Goal! Goal!

671
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,000
 Did you see that? 

672
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,400
   

673
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,200
Did we win?

674
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,500
We will win.

675
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,700
Art Director!

676
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,000
Yes, coming.

677
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,490
 It's a nerve racking moment. 

678
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:06,700
 Lee Gang Doo is ready to make the penalty kick. 

679
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,100
 Yes, Lee Gang Do kicks without hesitation. Shoot! 

680
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,300
 Goal! 

681
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:18,300
 Lee Gang Doo! Lee Gang Doo's goal! Long live Korea! 

682
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,700
 Lee Gang Doo did it! 

683
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,900
 He performed a miracle in the history of Korean soccer! 

684
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:28,300
 And everyone in Korea! Korea did it! 

685
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:32,100
 A dramatic penalty kick by Lee Gang Doo! 

686
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:51,070
So, we have to work hard.

687
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:58,400
We have to be happier than anyone out there.

688
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:22,200


689
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:31,300
â™«  Don't close your eyes anymore, I'll hold you  â™«

690
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:39,100
â™«  Don't cry out of fear, I'll be by your side  â™«

691
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:46,100
â™«  When I say the name that I've been hiding and covering up  â™«

692
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:49,870
â™«  My heart is beating  â™«

693
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:54,800
â™«  The two of us  â™«

694
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,300
â™«  What words are needed?  â™«

695
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:02,300
â™«  What words are needed?  â™«

696
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:06,740
â™«  Even hearing your name makes me tear up from missing you  â™«

697
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:09,500
â™«  Even hearing your name makes me tear up from missing you  â™«

698
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:13,200
â™«  What kind of reason is needed?  â™«

699
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,900
â™«  What kind of reason is needed?  â™«

700
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,900
â™«  When the two of us are listening to our hearts  â™«

701
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,800
â™«  When the two of us are listening to our hearts  â™«

702
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,700
â™«  When there's a hole in your heart  â™«

703
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:32,300
â™«  When you want to cry so badly  â™«

704
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:36,200
â™«  Hold me and bury your face  â™«

705
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,900
 Just Between Lovers 

706
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,300
 Why does she like Gang Doo Oppa and not the CEO? I have no idea.  

707
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,900
 Why does she like Gang Doo Oppa? 

708
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:49,000
 There are too many reasons. I do like him. 

709
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,700
 There's no reason I don't like Gang Doo. 

710
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,900
 Why did you call me up to meet me? 

711
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,500
 There are people who couldn't come home from that accident. 

712
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:01,300
 Let's confirm before we move on. If there are problems, CEO Seo will be responsible for everything. 

713
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,300
 You're too much. 

714
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,330
 What? 

715
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:06,900
 You want to do everything that makes you cool. 

716
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:10,100
 We can't make you be responsible for what you didn't do. 

717
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,100
 Why are you doing that? 

718
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:14,900
 I'll do up to here. You take care of the rest. 

719
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:19,500
 I guess I hear him because it's meant to be, so that he won't be forgotten. 

720
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,700
 Gang Doo, isn't it weird? 

721
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:28,290
 Self imprisonment... No one put us away, 

722
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,700
 but why can't we get out of it?
