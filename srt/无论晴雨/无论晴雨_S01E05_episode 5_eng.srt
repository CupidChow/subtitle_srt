00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,500
 I almost fainted when I was digging the ground at Cheongju last year to build an apartment. There were so many human remains. 

3
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,600
 Mr. Technician, I almost fainted when I was digging the ground at Cheongju last year to build an apartment. 

4
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,500
 Get me out of here. 

5
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,900
 Please get me out of here. 

6
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,800
 Please get me out of here. 

7
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,100
 I don't want to die. I don't want to die. 

8
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,860
What are you doing?

9
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,740
It's dangerous.

10
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,960
I said stop.

11
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,700
- If you continue, it will collapse. I said stop.
 - Release me.

12
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,100
Can't you see this?

13
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,500
So what?

14
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,800
What do you mean? It's a person. There's a person inside.

15
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,600
♫  I open my eyes. I see you.  ♫

16
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,000
♫  I wave my hand and erase you away  ♫

17
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:02,800
♫  No matter how much I try, even if I do that again  ♫

18
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,900
♫  You're still smiling in front of me  ♫

19
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,700
♫  All the memories that pour into me,   ♫

20
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,700
♫  Numerous words that pop into my head  ♫

21
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,700
♫  How can I hold you back?  ♫

22
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,900
♫  I'll be here. I'll be here.  ♫

23
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,700
Here.

24
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,800
Some help here, please.

25
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,700
What is this? Why are you here?

26
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
When did you come?

27
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,100
Did you really come here alone? Where is your cell phone?

28
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,700
You're really impossible. Why did you come here alone?

29
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,400
I came here because I was worried. This is all your fault.

30
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,280
- Is anyone there? 
 - Here!

31
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,500
- There is a person here!
 - Here!

32
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,500
- There is a person here! 
 - Excuse me!

33
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,500
 Episode 5 

34
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
Thank you.

35
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,300
Oh, you're here.

36
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,100
What happened?

37
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,400
Everything was perfectly fine yesterday.

38
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,240
 Shouldn't you first ask if she's all right? 

39
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,420
If it weren't for her, you might be moving corpses instead of mud.

40
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,500
 I am leaving first. 

41
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,180
  
  

42
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,900
Eat. You can tell me after you finish eating.

43
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,590
If it weren't for you, this incident would have created more damage.

44
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,700
How did you know?

45
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:28,300
You said accidents occur when you just proceed with lingering doubts.

46
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,100
The ground condition wasn't great and it rained a lot, too.

47
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,700
I had my doubts.

48
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,790
I went over my work hours, so I will leave first.

49
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,500
Wait.

50
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,300
I didn't even have time to drink water. Please get me one from the vending machine, too.

51
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,700
I don't have any coins.

52
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,400
You're so petty.

53
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,440
I said I don't have any.

54
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,600
I really don't have any.

55
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,100
Why did you do that yesterday?

56
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,550
You were in a state of crazy digging there. Why?

57
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,540
I thought it was a person.

58
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,520
It really looked like a person.

59
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,420
Imagine being trapped there.

60
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,810
How scary would it be?

61
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,100
Oh, right. Is your leg okay?

62
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
It's okay.

63
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,600
What do you mean it's okay?

64
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,600
Hey. I am not a man you can just touch like that.

65
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,100
Are you leaving? Just like that?

66
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,900
You haven't even said, "Thank you for helping me."

67
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,860
You said you just need to say thank you.

68
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,300
I know it's inconvenient.

69
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,500
Still, please check.

70
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,900
Yes.

71
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,700
- Are you done?
 - Yes.

72
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,900
I did cover it with a waterproof cloth, but that's just a temporary fix.

73
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,500
Thank you for working hard overnight. Please go home and rest.

74
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,700
- I need to check the retaining wall once, too—
 - It's my responsibility from here.

75
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,100
Go home quickly.

76
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,300
Please write up a report before you go home.

77
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,100
There is no problem (noted) in the surveying firm's report.

78
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,000
Regardless of how heavily it rained, it's odd the crossbeam that was perfectly fine before, only broke in one location.

79
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,930
Okay. Where? Where is the report template?

80
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,700
Does she have to do that now?

81
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,900
She didn't get any sleep last night and came back after cleaning up the incident. Wouldn't it better to let her rest?

82
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,500
It's something she has to do. Am I harassing her on purpose?

83
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,400
- Why are you making me to be a petty person? 
 - I mean—

84
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,500
CEO, I am perfectly fine.

85
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Nothing good will come out from putting off these kinds of things.

86
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,600
The report template is...

87
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,500
Oh?

88
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,500
Your family owns a bathhouse, yet why do you come here to take a shower?

89
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,300
Oh, this is refreshing.

90
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,700
I've been awake for a full day and a half.

91
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,500
Aren't I awesome?

92
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,100
Then go home and sleep.

93
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,900
Why are you so prickly today?

94
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,200
After receiving all the cursing (criticism) in the world, I feel like my stomach is about to explode.

95
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,800
I will live to be 10,000 years old. (Korean saying, you'll live a long time if cursed at by many people.)

96
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,940
Give me a can too.

97
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,500
 Today's isn't fun either, just as boring as I've predicted. 

98
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,900
 I've read it on your behalf, so I am letting you know to aid your mental state. Just sleep. 

99
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,500
 If you can't sleep, read it. Read it twice. You will completely be able to cure your insomnia. 

100
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
 This writer is hard working for no reason. 

101
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,900
 Just take a break. Be on break forever. 

102
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,300
 This is the best way to waste your time. I will draw better than her. 

103
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,700
 She's a con artist attempting to write a romance. 

104
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,000
 You must be totally single since birth. 

105
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,800
Crimson Beherit? (Reference to Berserk manga by Kentaro Miura.)

106
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,300
Whoever he may be, his id is cool.

107
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,100
 Crimson Beherit: If you read this webtoon, 

108
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,900
 you'll realize that love is a useless thing indeed. 

109
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,700
 Don't waste webpage on such a lousy cartoonist. Instead, give a chance to an aspiring cartoonist. 

110
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,100
 It's the worst I've read. Put your guard up if you meet me on the street. 

111
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,700
 Crimson Behelit: You'll end up in a wheelchair for the rest of your life. 

112
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,500
Moon Soo. I will catch this jerk.

113
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,700
I will offer him to God Hand (reference to Berserk manga) as a sacrifice.

114
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,900
- You're my witness.
 - What?

115
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,100
- Eclipse takes place after 216 years.(reference to Berserk manga)
 - What?

116
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,000
You don't have the basic knowledge.

117
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Is it so hard to give me a call to let me k now that you have something to take care of?

118
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,100
Why does your phone battery run out at time like this?

119
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,300
You don't think about how I may be worried about you?

120
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,400
It was raining and I couldn't get in touch with you, so all night long...

121
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,700
I even called your dad.

122
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,600
Forget it.

123
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,500
It's fine as long as you were able to reach her. Moon Soo isn't a kid.

124
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,200
She will always be a kid to me. You don't know since you don't have any kids.

125
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,480
No, I meant.

126
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,300
So, what I am trying to say is kids are useless.

127
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
They only know about themselves.

128
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,600
It's best to live happily as a married couple like you do.

129
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,000
Fine. Be it a kid or a husband,

130
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,500
it's better than being alone.

131
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,700
I am hungry.

132
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,000
Shall we make some ramen?

133
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,300
Hey, if it burst, do the repair. What's the problem?

134
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,100
Don't you know what the problem is? We could have had casualties.

135
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,500
Like you've said, we could have had them, but nothing happened.

136
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,100
Do I even have to worry about something that didn't happen?

137
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,500
You should, since we've experienced it once.

138
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Since I know how damaging things could get.

139
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,900
So handle it, quickly.

140
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,700
Father could pass away anytime.

141
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Let's do a good job so the board of directors can't pick our faults.

142
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,300
Is that what you're worried about now?

143
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,600
Aren't you curious about why such things keep on happening?

144
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,900
Did they check to see if embedding was as deep as is specified on the blueprint?

145
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,500
They must have. Do you think the site is managed without any system?

146
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,300
Ask them to check again.

147
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:29,100
If they happen to find anything from the things we just covered up earlier, then construction will be postponed indefinitely.

148
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,900
- That's why you should have done a proper job of handling the cleanup.
 - Hey!

149
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,500
That's why I called you in to do a proper job.

150
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Do you think it was because I was powerless to just sit back and watch you jump into this project when you have no experience?

151
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,100
Because you're better than that Seo Joo Won SOB.

152
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,500
From now on, take care of things personally. Don't trust him.

153
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,500
With his twisted relation to our family, watching for an opportunity to take what's ours,

154
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,700
I won't overlook it any longer.

155
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,800
If you won't overlook it,

156
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,120
do a proper job, so Joo Won can't get a word in.

157
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,300
   

158
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,300
   

159
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,880
   

160
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,300
   

161
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,000
Please ventilate the room. You could kill someone.

162
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,100
This is the payment for last month's medicine.

163
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
Just don't give everything the girls ask for.

164
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,500
They want to take the medicine with no limit. They should stop drinking.

165
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,880
What's wrong with you?

166
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,000
Noona.

167
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,300
Is my leg scar unsightly?

168
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,500
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

169
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,300
Just because. I was curious how it looks to woman.

170
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,500
Why? Did a woman say something to you?

171
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
No.

172
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,900
Don't meet her. If a woman is critical about someone's scar, she's not a good woman.

173
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
No, she didn't say such things.

174
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,700
Who? Did that woman from earlier say it's unsightly?

175
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,900
Do you have a woman?

176
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,300
I said no.

177
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Your expression says it must be.

178
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,100
What are you two? Are you close enough to show each other your scars?

179
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,900
You have a woman? How long have you dated her? How old is she?

180
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,500
She looks to be about the same age but I don't think she's from this neighborhood.

181
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Who is she really?

182
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,800
Oh, I can't say a thing. These women, curious about so many things.

183
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,900
- This is mine, right?
 - Hey!

184
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,800
Pay first.

185
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,300
This is all I have now. If it's not enough, put it on the tab.

186
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,500
You said that's a strong painkiller. Is it okay for him to take it every day like that?

187
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,100
If he took all the medicine he's gotten from me, his lungs could not have endured it.

188
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,700
It would have been too toxic for his liver and he would have collapsed already.

189
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,300
I just give him enough to not die from pain. It looks the same from outside but it's actually a supplement.

190
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,900
You really play favorites with Gang Doo.

191
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
I've known you for a longer time.

192
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,700
Don't you know how I am? I only eat what I want and play favorites with people all my life.

193
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,100
I am really curious.

194
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,500
What was so great about Gang Doo?

195
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,400
You never lend money to anyone without collateral.

196
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,500
How did you trust that kid to lend him such a large amount?

197
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,080
 How much money can you lend me? 

198
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,700
 How much do you need? 

199
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
 100 million wons ($100,000) 

200
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,700
 - Your collateral? 
 - I have none. 

201
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,100
 This crazy punk. Leave. 

202
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,900
 It says you'll lend money without any conditions 

203
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,000
 This lunatic. I said leave. 

204
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,660
 Ah, for God's sake... 

205
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
 Leave when I let you go. 

206
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,700
 Leave. Leave. 

207
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,900
 I can't leave. I won't leave until you lend me the money. 

208
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,880
 Hey, hey. He will cry. Stop saying useless things and just make him leave. 

209
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,200
 Will you lend me the money if I cry? Then I will cry. 

210
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,300
 So if I do lend you the money, how will you pay it back? 

211
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,400
 I can't pay it back. 

212
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,930
 Since 

213
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,580
 I've hurt my leg, I can't earn any money now. 

214
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,600
 In return, 

215
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:30,320
He said he wouldn't die while owing someone money. He paid his interest on time too.

216
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,680
That's it?

217
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,490
Do you know what everyone says when they come to borrow money? I will surely pay it back.

218
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,670
Those who talk big always lead to the opposite outcome.

219
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,960
They borrow a lump sum and when it's time to pay up, they make a fuss as if I am snatching money away from them.

220
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,200
I was getting tired of being a loan shark.

221
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,630
I thought he would do as my last customer.

222
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,960
You're quite something.

223
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,390
He looked like he's about to die but he was kicking and screaming so he wouldn't die.

224
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,750
Isn't that commendable?

225
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,970
Look at that punk, struggling and holding onto it for more than 10 years, alone.

226
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,400
Of course, he's commendable.

227
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,530
What are you doing? You'll break it.

228
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,160
This is stealing.

229
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,960
No, it isn't.

230
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,790
I deserve to get things from them. 
 

231
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,580
What do you mean?

232
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,790
This kid...

233
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,850
I'm working off-site today.

234
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:09,130
You said you're working off-site today, too, right? Once you start getting brown spots on your face, it's over. Turn your head.

235
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,520
So Mi, just a moment.

236
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,420
Why are you here so early...

237
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,970
Unni, hit on him more aggressively.

238
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,220
If he seems like your man, just... you know. Or you'll lose him.

239
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,160
- That's not it. 
 - Your chin...

240
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,340
There's definitely something there.

241
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,490
You said they didn't clean up the aftermath of the accident properly and just covered it up.

242
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,490
There were a lot of bodies that weren't fully intact among the corpses that were discovered then.

243
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,730
Aren't they buried there just like that?

244
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,480
That could be.

245
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,490
But nothing has been confirmed.

246
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,750
Before we get evidence, we have no reason to stop the work and the risk is too great.

247
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,000
The reason. Why is that so important?

248
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,530
It is important. If I have to stop the work, I need a reason.

249
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,160
If it seems unfair, find the evidence and bring it to me.

250
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,700
You don't have enough influential power by yourself

251
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,980
but if you have my agreement it will become a reasonable doubt.

252
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,580
The evidence?

253
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,630
Okay.

254
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,220
Don't change your word when that happens.

255
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,590
I'm sure you didn't come just to see me.

256
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,170
You're working off-site with Ms. Ha Moon Soo today, aren't you?

257
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:38,640
It's uncomfortable for me to watch her running around with that heavy bag on her shoulder all the time.

258
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,530
You know how to drive, right?

259
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,860
Why? Don't you know how to drive?

260
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,630
Aren't you going to put on your seatbelt?

261
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,800
No. I feel trapped.

262
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,640
You must've had some coins today.

263
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,070
   

264
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,360
Cheongyu is asking  you to come in.

265
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,400
Yes, I got it.

266
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,440
Well, the tone of the Director's voice, he seemed a bit...

267
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:14,400
If the client doesn't like us, we're the ones who will suffer. So, go with the flow...

268
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,850
Go with the flow...

269
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,940
- You're saying I should grovel, right?
 - No.

270
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,920
Cheongyu and we are like family. We should stay friendly—

271
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,380
Team Leader, we're not doing this work just to build a friendship.

272
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,540
"Like family" means we're not really family, ultimately.

273
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,470
Let's not be delusional.

274
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,560
Turn on your signal light. The signal light.

275
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,530
I'm not changing the lane right now.

276
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,470
Hey, come on now! That was dangerous!

277
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:54,090
Just let the cars cutting you off go ahead. Recklessly stomping on the gas like that will cause an accident. Seriously—

278
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,580
What?

279
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,450
You drive.

280
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,960
I want to. I'm sure I'd be super good if I did.

281
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,900
But what can I do? My legs don't listen to me at times.

282
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,400
The country won't give me a permission to hold this steering wheel.

283
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,660
Aren't you going?

284
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,420
Put your leg down. Don't you know that's dangerous?

285
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,840
Yeah.

286
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,260
   

287
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,400
- What does this say?
 - What?

288
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,760
What does this say?

289
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:00,210
Remembering the achievements

290
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,020
It looks like those are all names.

291
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,590
We remember

292
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,960
to be with the people.

293
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,570
Why is it so difficult?

294
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,150
I would've wanted it to be simpler.

295
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,150
So that idiots like me could understand it, too.

296
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,090
What's the point in making it so ornate?

297
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,360
It's a shame if other people like me can't read it.

298
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,480
Where to next?

299
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,340
Is this the right way? You're sure?

300
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,720
It should be.

301
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,860
It says to keep going this way.

302
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,600
What kind of tombstone is at a place like this?

303
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,800
It looks like no one comes to visit.
  

304
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,820
It must have been lonely.

305
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,940
This isn't how it should be either. Right?

306
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,480
Yeah.

307
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,480
You're going to conduct the subsurface exploration again? I'm going crazy.

308
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,740
According to the survey report, bedrock should be there. However, it hasn't surfaced at the site yet.

309
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,090
Aren't you making a hasty decision?

310
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,270
Even if we do the subsurface exploration after the foundation work is wrapped up—

311
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,500
Geez, these people don't think realistically at all.

312
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,170
Is work a place for you to do self-actualization?

313
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,970
The role of the company is to increase sales and decrease expense.

314
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,530
That's why I'm the one in this position, not you.

315
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,330
I have no intention of investing in your dream that's bound to fail. Just do what you're told well.

316
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,410
Then, let's just move forward as is.

317
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:48,190
Instead, if any issues arise in the meantime... Cheongyu should take the responsibility as the original contractor.

318
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,550
Hey, who told you to leave whenever you want to? Hey!

319
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,890
Hey, Jeong Yoo Jin.

320
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,630
You know that I'm your older brother, right?

321
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,770
I wish I didn't know that. Why?

322
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,270
Listen carefully.

323
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,200
Seo Joo Won is a rock that rolled into our family.

324
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,910
He's a thief who's trying to take what is ours away.

325
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,080
You must side with me from now on no matter what.

326
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,010
- Got it? 
 - Right.

327
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,380
So that I can side with you, Oppa,

328
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,160
please do it right so that I won't be embarrassed!

329
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,200
It must be nice.

330
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,400
It must be nice that you even get embarrassed.

331
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,440
I've become so ragged.

332
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,730
I have no more shame in me.

333
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,700
There's no one on my side. No one.

334
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,970
What are you doing?

335
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,960
Are you scared?

336
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,900
What?

337
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,640
Are you afraid that you might make a mistake like your father? Is that why you're acting this way?

338
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,600
Jeong Yoo Jin.

339
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,030
Then, what is it? Why are you making enemies all around you?

340
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,700
I'm doing this because I want to do the job right.

341
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,210
Then, you think we're doing this to ruin the job?

342
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,300
You don't appear to have conviction just because you're being stubborn alone.

343
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,530
Compromise adequately.

344
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:49,790
My father. He compromised logically, abandoning stubbornness as you say.

345
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,680
That's what happened to him.

346
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,150
You're right. I'm doing this because I'm afraid.

347
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,800
So, you, the logical you...

348
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,600
Please be on my side.

349
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,400
There's no point to this. Change it to something else.

350
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,740
Why? It's good to watch.

351
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,650
They aren't even going to take care of them until the end.

352
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,680
In the end, they're just doing that to put on a show.

353
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,690
That's not it.

354
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,420
Like hell it's not. It's all just a show.

355
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,360
- Give me the remote.
 - I told you that's not it!

356
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,090
Then if it's not to get someone's approval, why else would they bother wasting their time with something like that?

357
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,290
What do you mean why? It's because they're human.

358
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,340
People need to be like that.

359
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,840
Hyung, you don' t even know that?

360
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,350
Sang Man.

361
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,920
What?

362
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,900
Just be the hyung already.

363
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,750
Don't want to. I like Hyung being the hyung.

364
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,910
Ah. You scared me.

365
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,160
When did you get here?

366
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,860
Just now.

367
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,040
What for?

368
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,760
Gang Jong Soo, Gwak Seo Yeon, Kim Seong Jin, Nam Dong Shik.

369
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,700
Huh?

370
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:05,040
Seo Sang Woon, Yang Soon Ja, Oh Yeong Wan, Lee Jeong Hee.

371
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,690
   

372
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,100
What kind of people were those people?

373
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,760
Where did they live and what did they do?

374
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,990
How old were they?

375
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,340
Were they parents?

376
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,330
Were they children?

377
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:31,750
I think we're going about this memorial in the wrong way.

378
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,770
Who these people were. That's what comes first.

379
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,460
♫  Your light in your heart  ♫

380
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,800
Let's not make something just to show to others.

381
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,180
Let's do what we're really supposed to be doing.

382
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,990
It's not going to be easy though.

383
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,870
If something like this was easy, wouldn't that be even stranger?

384
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,070
That's true.

385
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,240
Isn't that the list of the bereaved family members? Are their addresses on there?

386
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,950
What?

387
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,890
You. You're not one bit an idiot.

388
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,320
What kind of idiot would be able to come up with something like this?

389
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,660
Give it to me.

390
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,380
♫  Life around your heart  ♫

391
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:42,180
 What we're really supposed to be doing. Remembering. 

392
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,780
♫  Lights resound your hope  ♫

393
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,450
 Choi Il Do, Pyo Seong Geun, Ha Yeon Soo 

394
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,900
 Ha Yeon Soo, 12 years old 

395
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,560
 Seo Yun Elementary School, 5th grader. 

396
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,630
 Her dream was to be an actress. 

397
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,630
 My younger sister 

398
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:28,670
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

399
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,880
Managing Director! You should go home. Please wake up.

400
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,600
Let me sleep a little more. Just a little more.

401
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,360
Please go home and sleep.

402
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,530
You should sleep comfortably if you have to go to work tomorrow.

403
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:10,510
Seriously! If my father is a rich man, shouldn't I have to work less?

404
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,490
Then, do whatever you want. Sleep then.

405
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,480
I'll continue to charge you for the room.

406
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,690
I like you because you're clear and straight forward. Good!

407
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,930
Did something bad happen? I've never seen you drunk like this before.

408
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,770
It did. Yeah, it did.

409
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:45,080
My father said I should never tell someone else when I'm struggling.

410
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,900
Why?

411
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:55,080
If I struggle, 99 people out of 100 people will be happy about it.

412
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,510
Who cares about the 99 people?

413
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,960
There are so many things you have to do to live with that one person remaining.

414
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,350
I'll be that one person.

415
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,980
Really?

416
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,310
As long as the price is right.

417
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,500
Good!

418
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,330
What are you doing tomorrow?

419
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:21,520
   

420
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,410
Have you seen that cartoonist's webtoon?

421
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:29,030
Just write a letter of regret.

422
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,240
- No matter how you insist— 
 - Have you seen how trashy the work is?

423
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,120
Making up such an unrealistic story taking in chump change from kids.

424
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,320
That's conning people!

425
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,770
Who cares if I con people?

426
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,260
Vicarious living through someone else for 200 won (20 cents).

427
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,420
What's wrong with tasting something sweet that's like a mirage?

428
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,940
Just because the world you live in is crappy, must you see stuff like that in a webtoon, too?

429
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,760
And what do I do? I'm already sitting on a wheelchair even without your help.

430
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,030
I have no intention to apologize, so put me away. It will be taken care of by a few hours of social services.

431
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,880
Sue everyone in the future from now on. If all those people serve society,

432
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,800
I guess that trashy webtoon can be helpful to the country in some way.

433
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,590
Hey!

434
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,740
Go home, Writer. We'll take care—

435
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,580
This is better than someone who's crying and whining.

436
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:25,180
You're much better than some pathetic guys going around cursing me.

437
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,250
Please treat him harshly. Extremely.

438
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,660
Hyung, you look so cool.

439
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,170
Wow, you look like a movie star.

440
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,830
Do you know how to tie a necktie?

441
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,550
Huh?

442
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,270
You and me both.

443
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,000
What's going on so early in the morning?

444
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,450
What do you mean? Did I ever say I needed money?

445
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:16,570
If you can't even pay the interest, why did you do that so those people will even come find me?

446
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,100
You said you'd take care of everything!

447
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,720
 Jae Yeong, slow down and tell me again. 

448
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,890
Do you know how embarrassing it was for me this morning?

449
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,670
Please do things that you can handle. Please—

450
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,000
No, no, no. That'll never happen again.

451
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,650
I really forgot for a moment—

452
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,560
Those crazy a**holes!

453
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,780
Hyung!

454
00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:00,250
 The person you're calling isn't answering his phone so you'll be transferred to the voicemail after the beep. 

455
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,630
He's not answering. Why carry a phone around?

456
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,200
 This is Ha Moon Soo who you're meeting today. 

457
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,830
 I'll wait for you in front of the bank. 

458
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,520
Going out today, too?

459
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,090
You've been going out quite a bit lately.

460
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,130
I'm not going out for fun. I'm working off-site.

461
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,100
Whatever it is. It's nice to be out.

462
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,400
What's going to happen today with the weather is so beautiful?

463
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:44,550
Be careful, Unni. It's the perfect weather for falling in love.

464
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,990
 Unni, it's beautiful weather. 

465
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,100
 Look at the sky. 

466
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,220
You came?

467
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,950
Oh, you a**hole, you have a way with saying hello.

468
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,790
Did I ever miss paying off interest? I was late only by a day, yet you couldn't hold back?

469
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,110
That's right. One day. You were late one day alright.

470
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:42,460
So, why didn't you answer your phone?

471
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,240
How dare you go to Jae Yeong?

472
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,780
Don't you go see her again! If you do, I'll...

473
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,550
What will you do? Gang Doo. Don't be full of yourself.

474
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:59,800
Even though Grandma favors you, you should know your place.

475
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,350
For a long time, Grandma has had nothing to do with our business.

476
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,300
We still have your debt!

477
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,480
They say family community.

478
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,700
If you can't make your payment on time, your younger sister should sell her body.

479
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,910
Has he lost his mind?

480
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,200
Don't you ever show up near Jae Yeong!

481
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,010
I'll kill you!

482
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,500
Let go!

483
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,300
 The person you're calling isn't answering the phone. 

484
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,900
He's the one who suggested we do this. Lee Gang Doo, that guy.

485
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,700
   

486
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:19,790
Is the bereaved association still active?

487
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,600
No, it's not that. Just temporarily while the memorial park is being constructed.

488
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,700
You're working hard.

489
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,300
 Moksan Bank, Manager for Enterprise Loan Department 2, Lee Min Yong 

490
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,570
What's wrong?

491
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,100
Looks like you're doing a very tough job.

492
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,200
Since I was able to become who I am by using monetary compensation from father's death towards my studies,

493
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,200
I guess I can say it's thanks to Father.

494
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,600
- I can't sign it though. 
 - Pardon?

495
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,700
I don't condone this memorial park or memorial.

496
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,000
We are doing this with good intentions.

497
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Good intention, after killing someone.

498
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:18,000
According to the regulations, they needed to have space allocated for the greenery. They just name it memorial and give themselves a pardon.

499
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I don't want that.

500
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,800
You know what we're supposed to do today, right?

501
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
I do.

502
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,600
And you show up like this? Did you get into a fight again?

503
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Why are you alone? Didn't you get to meet him?

504
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,400
Why do you look like this?

505
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,100
The next place is a bit far from here.

506
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,900
The second body found on the scene, Mr. Choi Il Do.

507
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:53,920
He was a day laborer dispatched to the site in a rush from an employment agency.

508
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,890
Of all days...

509
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,970
He lived with his mother.

510
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
We're almost there.

511
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,900
Anyone home?

512
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,500
Is anyone home?

513
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,500
Isn't she home?

514
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,400
I'll go over to that house and ask.

515
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,400
 Loan available to anyone at the time of visit, no collateral needed, low interest rate. 

516
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,600
What are you doing in there?

517
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,900
How did you get inside?

518
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,300
You can't just go inside someone else's house.

519
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:15,760
- What if the owner sees you... 
 - Don't come.

520
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,400
- What's wrong? 
 - I said don't come!

521
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:54,480
If it weren't for you, they would have found her body next month at the time of the social worker's visit.

522
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,330
She started losing her memory several years ago.

523
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:13,800
She sat here all day and waited for her son,

524
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,700
even a few days ago.

525
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
What was the name?

526
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,600
Choi Il Do?

527
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,500
No. His mother.

528
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,190
Im Jin Hae.

529
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,110
Why do you ask her name?

530
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,200
The victim who died in the accident isn't the only victim.

531
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,400
Not knowing that her son died,

532
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,200
the name of the person who waited for him alone for over 10 years,

533
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,900
is it okay to forget her name?

534
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,800
The people who survived, yet who are living in torment,

535
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,000
how will they compensate them?

536
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,400
Casualty: Choi Il Do, Bereaved: Im Jin Hae (mother)

537
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,200
When her son made enough money, she said they'd move down.

538
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,900
I heard she was bragging so much.

539
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:52,450
If that accident hadn't happened,

540
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,340
they would be living together down there, right?

541
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,090
 That probably would have been difficult. 

542
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:12,950
 since there is no such thing as "what if" with the past. 

543
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,500
Probably. Most likely.

544
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,100
That's tomorrow.

545
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:35,770
Team Leader, right now, I'm...

546
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,430
No. I know that, but...

547
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,600
Excuse me? Hello?

548
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,800
Go ahead. You look busy.

549
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,800
How about you?

550
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,600
I'm working the night shift. I'm going home to wash up.

551
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,200
I will get some sleep before I leave.

552
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,500
Then I will give you a ride.

553
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,400
Ugh. Really now.

554
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,000
Answer it.

555
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,700
Yes, I am on my way.

556
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,000
- I am sorry.
 - Why would you be sorry?

557
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,400
Go. I will get going.

558
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,600
Sang Man.

559
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,200
Sang Man.

560
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,800
Team Leader.

561
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,800
Where did he go?

562
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,900
I am lonely.

563
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,400
Where is everyone?

564
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,200
- Oh, Gang Doo.
 - Team Leader.

565
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,100
What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop being gross. Stay away.

566
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,200
Oh, that's good. The kid manager hired didn't show up again.

567
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,500
No one is as reliable as you. Get changed and make the rounds.

568
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,800
- Alone? 
 - Of course.

569
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,800
By myself?

570
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,000
My position is not low enough for me to personally make rounds, is it?

571
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,900
Let's get you changed first. Hurry up and come in.

572
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,900
Hurry and come in.

573
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,600
You were late.

574
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,600
You have a lot of work?

575
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,600
Yeah.

576
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,500
Sleep.

577
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,000
 Hey, give me your cell phone. 

578
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,700
 - Why? 
- Hurry up. 

579
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,480
 Can we meet at the new shopping mall at Wooseok-dong instead? 

580
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,740
 Go over there. 

581
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,110
 Same time? 
  

582
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,300
Unni.

583
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,910
 I am here. Where are you?
   

584
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,400
 Meet me at the ice cream shop on the third floor. 

585
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,600
 Unni. 

586
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:06,310
Why did you wake up?

587
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:13,600
Are you crying?

588
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,290
I had a dream.

589
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:22,010
Did you have a scary dream?

590
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:24,530
No.

591
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,100
Then why are you crying?

592
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,000
Just because.

593
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,100
Because it seemed like I could only see her (him) in my dream.

594
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,200
You're being silly.

595
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:46,940
It's not even 1 am yet. Sleep more.

596
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,400
 Can't you see me? 

597
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,810
 You still can't see me? 

598
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,830
 What we're really supposed to be doing. 

599
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:23,290
 Remembering. 

600
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,900
 Name Choi Sung Jae, 17 years old. 

601
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,200
 If it weren't for me, 

602
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,900
 he would have grown up to be an awesome adult. 

603
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,000
 My first love. 

604

01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,400
 What is this? 

609
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,200
 The architecture lady brought this and left it when she came to look for you. 

610
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,800
 Did you finish all those popsicles by yourself? 

611
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,600
 Thank you for the ice cream. 

612
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,200
 She can't even send an emoticon? 

613
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,000
 Stop looking at your phone and quickly do the things I ask you to do. 

614
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,400
 This punk, at least pretend to listen when I am talking to you. 

615
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,200
 She called earlier to take the day off because of something important. 

616
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,700
 Did she go meet Gang Doo Oppa? 

617
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,600
 Since when did she start calling her coworker oppa?
   

618
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,100
That damned love finds you when you think everything is over.

619
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,600
Did you not know are you pretending to not notice?

620
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,400
I feel burdened when I am with him and I feel sorry.

621
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,800
So I tell him to leave first but once he really leaves, I am quite disappointed.

622
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,400
You said he's a good person, so what's the problem?

623
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,400
Because he's a good person.

624
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,100
A good person should date another good person.
