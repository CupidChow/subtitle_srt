2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,900
What the heck.

3
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,710
 Can't you see me? 

4
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,030
 You still can't see me? 

5
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,150
 No! 

6
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,820
 Here. 

7
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,970
 Excuse me. 

8
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,250
 Here... 

9
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,170
 Can't you see me? 

10
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,570
 I can see you. 

11
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,910
 Then 

12
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,100
 I think my legs are stuck. 

13
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,070
 Can you take a look at it? 

14
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,690
 Why? Why can't I get them out? 

15
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,100
 What are you doing? 

16
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,230
 I said please help me. 

17
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,990
You're here? What's going on?

18
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,110
Hey Gang Doo.

19
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,490
♫  I open my eyes  ♫

20
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,760
♫  I see you  ♫

21
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,750
 No, no, it's this way. 

22
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,750
♫  I wave my hand and erase you away  ♫

23
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,590
What the heck?

24
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,950
Let's just go. Let's go.

25
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,840
What, are you picking a fight? Picking a fight?

26
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,540
Geez!

27
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,840
Hey, don't. Let's just go. I think he drank too much.

28
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,070
Hey, if you hit someone, you should apologize!

29
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,020
- Let go of me, you a**holes. 
 - Who the hell are you?

30
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,560
Get lost, you a**hole!

31
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,380
♫  I missed you  ♫

32
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,480
- What the heck. 
 - Hey!

33
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,430
Let go!

34
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,940
Hey, hey, hey, don't. Don't.

35
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,740
Hey! You hit me?

36
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,380
You should pay for breaking me if you hit me!

37
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,320
Hey!

38
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,990
♫  You always looked beautiful  ♫

39
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,300
♫  All the memories that pour into me  ♫

40
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,420
♫  Numerous words that pop into my head  ♫

41
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,470
♫  How can I hold you back  ♫

42
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,410
♫  I'll be here, I'll be here  ♫

43
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,380
♫  I held on until it overflowed  ♫

44
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,390
♫  I held on until my heart was full  ♫

45
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,840
♫  How can I hold you back  ♫

46
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,650
Ten years ago or now.

47
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,560
How could you be the same?

48
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,260
♫  I held on until it overflowed  ♫

49
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,460
♫  I held on until my heart was full  ♫

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,520
♫  How can I hold onto you  ♫

♫  I'll be there, I'll be there  ♫

 Episode 6 

53
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,740
Ugh, my knees. This stupid hill. I can never get used to it. Never get used to it.

54
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,730
Why are you so busy this early in the morning?

55
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,690
Oh, Auntie, good timing. I left the water on in the bath. Will you turn it off?

56
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,140
I told Mom, but she's still not quite awake.

57
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,970
Are you going to a funeral?

58
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,450
There's an 8 o'clock facial appointment with the real estate madam. She's going to her alumni meeting today.

59
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,750
I ask you, Auntie.

60
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,310
Where are you going?

61
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,710
That entire area is a landfill.

62
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,080
Why are we so different that we're making a big fuss?

63
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
The landfill layers are deeper than other areas.

64
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,870
Then you should've implemented that in your design.

65
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,270
Do you think money just appears if you say so?

66
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,010
The measurement did not appear in the files we received.

67
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,270
We should dig it out even now or plant gas pipes—

68
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,130
Digging. You think that's easy?

69
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,220
Are you talking nonsense because you are not aware of the cost that comes with the disposing of waste?

70
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,820
I don't know.

71
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,890
Cheongyu's original business was working with the landfill, so you must know better, Director.

72
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
What?

73
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,100
If there are a lot of costs at hand, then will you be burying it like what the CEO did?

74
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,860
Please reconsider so that we can conduct the subsurface exploration again.

75
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,430
I'll get going.

76
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,660
Did you learn from your father how to be picky at a construction site?

77
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,570
Don't copy him. You'll make a mistake, too, if you do that.

78
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,100
I won't let it go like my father did.

79
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,650
Go now.

80
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,630
I told you to leave. Not leaving on your own accord.

81
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,720
What, what, what, what? Did something happen?

82
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,370
No.

83
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,150
Did Gang Doo go somewhere? He said he was working until the afternoon.

84
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,430
I don't know. He's acting like he's the boss.

85
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,260
He leaves when he wants to and I can't even get in touch with him.

86
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,140
Geez, I can't even fire him because I'm short staffed.

87
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,190
He worked hard the last few days. He must be tired.

88
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,500
Nonsense.

89
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,400
- Have some of this. 
 - Forget it. Why eat a popsicle before a meal?

90
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,710
   

91
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,160
 Is it only the people that died who are victims? 

92
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,160
 How will they compensate the people who survived, yet who are living in torment? 

93
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,580
No, you can't! I said you can't! This area is prohibited to outsiders.

94
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,140
I'm saying I want to take a look at my own land. Who are you to block my way?

95
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,770
Get out! Hey, close the gate! Close the gate!

96
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,780
Hey, you! Open the gate!

97
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,960
Open the gate!

98
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,810
Hey, you! If you don't open the gate...

99
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,140
Open the gate!

100
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,210
Grandma, are you okay?

101
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,640
Hold on to me.

102
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,970
- Drink fee. 
 - No, it's okay.

103
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,430
If you borrow money, I have to pay back with interest at some point. That's the world we live in.

104
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,950
When will we ever see each other again? Thank you for the tea.

105
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,560
Are you all right?

106
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,510
Lie down. You'll still be dizzy.

107
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,650
What do I do? I'm bothering you too much so suddenly.

108
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,050
It's okay.

109
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,750
What do you mean it's okay?

110
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,450
Spending time on another person is the hardest work. Hurry up and go now.

111
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,050
I'll wait until your family shows up.

112
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,950
I'm my own family. Go.

113
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,250
Then, I'll stay until you finish your IV. You're not well.

114
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,050
I said it's okay.

115
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,360
It wasn't okay for me.

116
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,040
If we're together, you feel burdensome and feel bad.

117
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,250
You say to leave first. And if I do leave first

118
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,050
you feel sad and disappointed.

119
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,850
I felt like that.

120
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,950
Do you need anything?

121
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,620
I'll get it back from you with interest. Tell me comfortably.

122
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,850
Canned peaches.

123
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,250
Canned peaches?

124
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,850
It's cold and sweet.

125
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,450
There's nothing better than that when you don't have an appetite.

126
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,650
Why am I so sleepy?

127
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,850
Leave me your phone number.

128
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,500
Grandma.

129
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,370
Grandma.

130
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,450
Let's move this patient to an exam room upstairs.

131
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,050
Her family was with her just a moment ago.

132
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,750
Without family consent? Right now?

133
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,650
Yes, now.

134
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,250
Why am I here?

135
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,250
This isn't the first time I picked you up off the street.

136
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,700
Just throw me out now.

137
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,840
Why do you do that?

138
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,260
"A way to overcome pain is through more pain." Is there some kind of deep meaning behind it?

139
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,850
Whatever it is, stop it now.

140
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,350
If there is no use even after 10 years, then change your strategy instead of ruining your body.

141
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:01,850
I am old now.

142
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,550
My makeup doesn't go on smoothly.

143
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,150
How are you old?

144
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,150
You are the prettiest in this town.

145
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,850
Even though I know it is nonsense, it makes me feels good hearing it.

146
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,320
- Where are you going? 
- Out to work.

147
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,050
Was this the place that you really wanted to go with me?

148
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:41,550
Yeah. Stay and wait here while I am out fishing.

149
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,250
Then, I will make killer ramen for you.

150
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,050
While you're out fishing, catch a big one.

151
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,650
It doesn't work out the way you want it to.

152
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,350
I should show you my old talent.

153
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,650
Stroke my hair.

154
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,450
- What kind of— 
 - Hey.

155
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,250
I'll give you extra pay. Hurry, I'm having a hard time.

156
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,450
How can you say you're tired when you are outside to go fishing in the daylight?

157
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,050
Do you know how hard it is for me?

158
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,250
No one listens to me.

159
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,350
When they see me, all they whine to give them money.

160
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,650
No one knows. No one knows

161
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,150
how hard it is for me.

162
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,750
What are you doing not stroking my hair?

163
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,450
If it's stuff like this, you don't have to pay me lots of money for it. Just ask your wife—

164
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,450
No. I don't want to.

165
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,250
I feel like I'm begging.

166
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,650
We are give and take. It's simple and nice.

167
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,550
Here. Please hurry and do it.

168
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,050
Yeah, right there.

169
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,150
That's nice.

170
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,650
More smoothly up there.

171
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,150
 The caller cannot be reached... 

172
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,850
 If you see this, call me. 

173
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,070
 If you don't call me back, I am going to go and find you. 

174
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,250
Grandma.

175
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,750
Here.

176
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,850
You don't eat this?

177
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,050
I like this.

178
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,850
How can you be waiting without knowing when I would come out?

179
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,050
What if we'd missed each other?

180
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,150
Then I'd eat everything including the juice.

181
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,450
- Are you alone?
 - Pardon?

182
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,250
Do you have a man?

183
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,650
No.

184
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,610
I will pay this debt no matter what, so...

185
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,200
Enter your phone number here.

186
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,850
It's not debt though.

187
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,850
If I forget, there is a guy who will pay the debt, so do not worry.

188
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,450
Even though he looks not all together, he has a great sense of responsibility.

189
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,550
- Did you enter your number?
 - Oh, yes.

190
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,560
I guarantee him.

191
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,450
I don't normally guarantee anyone like this,

192
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,450
but he's thoughtful, can take care of himself.

193
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,650
I'd be proud of him anywhere.

194
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,540
Unnie?

195
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,850
She said she's got important business to take care of today. She called to say she's taking a day off.

196
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,650
Did she leave to see Gang Doo Oppa?

197
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,350
They stick together often these days.

198
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,450
I have to check on the model concept that will be displayed at the model home opening tomorrow.

199
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,250
Please tell her not to make other plans tomorrow.

200
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:36,550
Since when did you start referring to a coworker as 'oppa'?

201
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,050
 The caller cannot be reached... 

202
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,050
 Miss. Ha Moon Soo 

203
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,750
Ouch!

204
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,100
Why couldn't I reach you all day?

205
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,500
What is this?

206
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,500
What is your identity anyway? Why do you keep getting hit?

207
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,400
What do you mean, get hit? If my face is like this, what do you think happened to the opponent?

208
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,500
Probably died.

209
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,900
That's right.

210
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,500
But why are you here?

211
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,100
You won't show up at work, and you won't pick up my calls.

212
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,900
Who is it that made me come all the way here?

213
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,700
Hyung didn't come home yesterday either.

214
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,400
I am going to—

215
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,100
It's chaotic in here. Don't be inside someone's house, leave.

216
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,800
Leave. And you hurry up and leave too, it's late.

217
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Let's go. You should leave too, Sang Man.

218
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,500
This is the basic footwork of Kunlun Sword Method.

219
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,800
Hyung, your fist goes out first because your heart goes ahead of you.

220
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,900
True strength comes from being gentle.

221
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,300
Big Brother. Thank you.

222
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,500
Thank you.

223
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,400
- Hyung!
- I said leave!

224
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,600
Why?

225
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,670
What?

226
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,960
Yesterday.

227
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,370
Choi Il Do's mother.

228
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,630
The people in the neighborhood came by and cremated her this morning.

229
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:33,510
I saw them place her in a public ossuary. I thought I should let you know.

230
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,170
I'm sorry.

231
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,030
For what?

232
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,170
For making you see her alone.

233
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,760
You must've been scared.

234
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,620
Hold tight.

235
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:16,990
♫   I know it feels like you're gone   ♫

236
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,240
♫  I know you'll be ready  ♫

237
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,760
♫   Run away any way, far from the pains   ♫

238
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,580
♫    Passing, tears in your eyes  ♫

239
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,390
♫   I don't want anything from you   ♫

240
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,470
♫  Just because of your love  ♫

241
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,240
I can take a taxi though.

242
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,390
♫   I will let you go   ♫

243
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,920
 Where are you? 

244
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,060
 Where are you? 

245
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,940
 Call me. 

246
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,820
  If you see this, call me. 

247
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,220
 If you don't call me, I am going to find you. 

248
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,070
     

249
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,320
 Yes? 

250
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,730
 I couldn't pick up your call. What's the matter? 

251
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,520
Where are you right now?

252
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,440
 In front of my house. 

253
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,320
Are you with Ha Moon Soo?

254
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,970
No.

255
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,820
Okay.

256
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,500
What is this?

257
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,560
♫  It's not longing  ♫

258
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,150
♫  It's not regrets  ♫

259
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,340
♫  What could it be? This feeling that's coming on strong  ♫

260
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,950
♫  What could it be? This feeling that's coming on strong  ♫

261
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,470
 You worked hard alone today, too. 

262
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,900
♫   it comes back when we’re apart  ♫

263
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,980
♫  This excitement is because of you  ♫

264
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,860
♫  I felt that  ♫

265
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:46,260
♫  I'm flying on your eyes  ♫

266
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,730
♫  The time we were together, that day  ♫

267
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,630
♫  This world  ♫

268
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,460
 Let's do everything together next time. Since we're on the same team. 

269
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,300
♫  flying in your eyes  ♫

270
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,880
♫  When I feel as if each days is new  ♫

271
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,490
♫  You were always standing by me at times like that  ♫

272
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,330
I am going to go crazy. Who is it?!

273
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:38,950
Well, we received a report saying that he's been roaming around your house from early this morning.

274
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,470
He says that he's your brother. Is that so?

275
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,050
Yes.

276
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,060
But just in case, can you call me 5 minutes later?

277
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,130
If I don't pick up, please come back here.

278
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,760
There are times when family is scarier.

279
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,900
What are you doing? How did you find out about here?

280
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,550
The lawsuit. Why did you withdraw it?

281
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,720
Fussing around even when I withdraw. It's up to me. So what?

282
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,460
So, why? I hate any type of kindness without explanation.

283
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,690
Kindness my butt.

284
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,700
I figured it was best for me to ignore a person like you.

285
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,240
Do whatever you want even if it means writing harsh comments on the internet and wasting your life!

286
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,310
Good, right? Leave, leave, leave!

287
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,950
- Flow Money! 
 - What?

288
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,670
My cartoon that I entered in the Webtoon Challenge.

289
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:52,750
Three years ago, you personally commented on it saying I have potential.

290
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,050
I did?

291
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,310
I knew you'd be like this.

292
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,070
Take responsibility.

293
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:07,580
Hey! Hey!! Y-You!

294
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,790
Forget everything else. I'm confident about coloring. If I have to do social service anyway,

295
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,740
I will do it here, so order me to do anything.

296
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:19,290
Who the heck is he that he just comes in like this? You, get out. Get out!

297
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,600
You are not going to pick up?

298
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,590
Please hurry and pick it up! What if the police come?

299
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,230
Leave!

300
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,730
   

301
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,130
Is replacing one security guard something that is so bad to do?

302
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,320
It's because the problem doesn't get solved by replacing a security guard.

303
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,970
Even if it was a small accident without anyone getting hurt, it's not good to have rumors going around during construction.

304
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,250
It will get buried if someone takes responsibility and leaves the company.

305
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,520
If we need someone to take the blame and leave, that's not the security team. It should be the construction site manager.

306
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,300
Then, who will replace the site manager right away?

307
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,820
Someone like a contractor. We can replace him with another subcontractor. Think rationally.

308
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,110
You are the same, Jeong Yoo Jin.

309
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,670
You are the same as back then.

310
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:53,060
Cheongyu. It's a company you and my father grew together.

311
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:58,810
Seeing that he sent you all the way here, your father must be in a very tight spot.

312
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,040
If the company goes bankrupt, all the employees will be out on the streets.

313
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,850
Then, we can't even compensate the victim's families properly.

314
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,250
If you could overlook it just this once—

315
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,350
 Jeong Yoo Jin. Get out. 

316
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,220
 Get out! 

317
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,210
   

318
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,010
 All the management members of Cheongyu feel deeply responsible. 

319
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:04,310
We are sincerely empathetic to the victims and the sadness their families feel. We offer our apology.

320
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,310
 Are you smiling? 

321
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,560
You killed people and all you do is say you're sorry and that's it?

322
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,590
 - Ahjussi.
- Move! 

323
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,480
 I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry. It is my mistake. 

324
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,550
 Why did you make such a mistake! 

325
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,470
 Why out of all days? 

326
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,310
You think you'd be different?

327
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,960
If you were in my position, you would have done the same—

328
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,580
No. If I were in that position, I would have stayed by your side.

329
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,270
It would've been hard.

330
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:56,550
But still, we would've been better people than now.

331
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:21,640
No, but the soil is so moist, so we need to sink an anchor first. How can they just put concrete over it?

332
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,560
Whose pocket do you think that anchor cost went into?

333
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,170
The supplier and the project manager are in cahoots together.

334
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,720
Don't waste your time blabbering about others.

335
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,210
   

336
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,430
What?

337
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,520
You resemble a lot.

338
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,720
Excuse me?

339
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,290
Team manager!

340
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,420
Director Jeong booked a great place. He says to hurry and come.

341
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:53,870
What's this? What are you doing here, man? If you're not in charge of the materials, get out!

342
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,660
Leave! Hurry and go!

343
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,380
Team Manager, let's go.

344
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,990
You surprised me!

345
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,850
Wow. You are eating by yourself?

346
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,170
- How dare you speak casually to me? 
 - You should've waited for me.

347
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,810
How should I know when you'll be coming?

348
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,830
Wow. That was mean of you.

349
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,860
Only caring about food.

350
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,690
Aish.

351
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,200
Oh?

352
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:31,910
What is this?

353
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,330
Oh, that? The lady from the architecture office came by to see you and left that.

354
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,150
Anyway, where did you go yesterday?

355
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,850
Even if I called, you wouldn't pick up.

356
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,530
Hey! It's because it's me, I am letting you off.

357
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,340
Who'd take you in when you have no experience whatsoever on your resume?

358
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,020
You punk! How can you be eating ice cream before eating meal?

359
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,330
Who eats ice cream before a meal? You have no manners towards meals.

360
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,920
Let's go.

361
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,800
   

362
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,340
   

363
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,220
Where are you going? We need to go together.

364
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,610
I still have unfinished business.

365
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,930
Greeting guests is work, too.

366
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,100
It's not my business.

367
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,430
It's the financial team from the bank that's going to invest in our business.

368
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,330
Do you know whose money is feeding your mouth?

369
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,590
No, it's fine—

370
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,730
Then, please hold it for me. Thank you.

371
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,150
Hey.

372
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:09,150
Is she the one who comes after you?

373
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,760
Isn't she too far below the level?

374
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,730
Hey, I got a new car, want to see it?

375
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,990
There are only four available in our country.

376
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,390
Why didn't you answer my call yesterday?

377
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,940
Pardon?

378
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,680
I waited for your call.

379
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,040
Oh, I saw it at a late hour. I was going to ask in the morning.

380
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,960
You can call me at late hours. It is fine for me.

381
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,440
I am sorry.

382
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,770
Thank you for coming out with me earlier.

383
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,670
Otherwise, it would've put me in an awkward position.

384
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,000
It seemed so.

385
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:05,920
Trying to act strong in front of the director. Did it show?

386
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,710
Yes.

387
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,700
So it did.

388
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,730
It's fine. It was natural.

389
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,420
They are building there again.

390
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,320
Demolishing it was easy, and constructing it is fast.

391
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:31,940
It'd be nice if we also had buildings that are 100, 200 years old.

392
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,800
Right?

393
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,070
Sit down, please.

394
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,810
Have some tea.

395
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,620
I didn't know there was such a place.

396
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,980
My father liked it here, so we came often.

397
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,590
It was nice seeing such a view as that.

398
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,030
Yes, it is nice.

399
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:24,670
I am jealous. My father and mother live separately.

400
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,120
My father passed away.

401
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,170
I look forward to what kind of building you will be constructing in the future.

402
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,810
If you anticipate it, it makes me feel pressured. There are a lot of times when it's not that good.

403
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:51,520
Even when remodeling here, I got a lot of scolding from my father.

404
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,240
That I didn't look at the site and that all I'm doing is measuring things at my desk.

405
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,920
Your father worked in this field as well?

406
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,510
If you view this place from outside, it's different as well. Do you want to look around after drinking the tea?

407
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,040
Yes.

408
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:29,150
My friend draws webtoons. I want her to use this background as a reference.

409
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:33,310
There are a lot of people who don't know that there are such buildings that remain.

410
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,770
Isn't it pretty?

411
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,900
It looks perfect to use as the background.

412
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,680
Here, if the main character looks around while riding the bicycle...

413
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,970
Then, love that didn't exist will have appeared.

414
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,120
It is nice, but I am going to pass on the bicycle.

415
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,370
It's too difficult to draw.

416
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,950
What is this?

417
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,480
Who is this man?

418
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,050
CEO.

419
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:13,990
When did I take his picture?

420
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:18,780
You. You're so sly.

421
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,790
Do you not know or are you pretending not to know?

422
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,770
About what?

423
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,330
The eyes.

424
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,750
Look here. He's so mellow, mellow.

425
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,400
The way he looks you, it's how a man looks at a woman.

426
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,970
Why? Are you going to avoid him because a great man is looking at you?

427
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,660
- That's not it. 
- You always say that.

428
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,340
Then, what is it? What's wrong with a nice guy?

429
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,120
Because he's nice.

430
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,940
A nice person should meet a nice person.

431
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,050
What kind of bullsh—

432
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,880
You are a nice person too!

433
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:08,200
At least, for me, you are the best nice person to me.

434
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,590
But he's a bit more western looking in style.

435
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,730
- Oh, stop. 
 - Why not?

436
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,730
Stop it.

437
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,010
Oh?

438
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,970
What?

439
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:38,780
What is this? Did you eat all the ice cream by yourself?

440
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,420
Wow. Ice cream before meals.

441
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,360
   

442
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,960
 It's close to my neighborhood, so tomorrow at 2 p.m. 

443
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,660
 The bus stop at Seoyeondong. 

444
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,670
What is this? Is this all?

445
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,310
She doesn't even ask how I'm doing. Not even an emoticon.

446
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:30,360
Staring at the phone. Aren't you going to do what I asked you to do?

447
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,380
Move the boxes up.

448
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,860
Hey, hey, hey! Wipe off all the dust well.

449
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,520
Remove the water from the mop well.

450
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,650
Why all of a sudden? Since when were you so clean?

451
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,490
Shut up and do as you are told.

452
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,370
If you paid me for my work, then I wouldn't complain.

453
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,180
You think I'd just give you money?

454
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,000
I've heard you saying that for 10 years.

455
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,110
What did you give in return? Labor? Rage? Swearing?

456
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,930
Hey, the stuff in the drawers, take it out.

457
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,720
And clean all the stuff inside as well.

458
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,260
Hey, you can't lose what's in the drawers.

459
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,420
There are logs of medicines that regular customers take.

460
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,950
Also, there are dates for when they paid— Hey!

461
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,780
- At least pretend you're listening to me!
 - Again, again, again!

462
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,930
Look at this. Contact number for the payment.

463
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:28,010
The contracts in the drawers, you need to—

464
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,770
Why are you like this?

465
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,580
Are you going somewhere?

466
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:38,570
Do I have any family or not have any money? If I want to go somewhere, I can.

467
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,260
Then, what about me?

468
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:46,040
Look at you. Did you think I'd stick around you the rest of my life?

469
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:51,840
Don't you see there is dust flying everywhere? Hurry up and clean!

470
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,530
I am not going to do it! Don't go anywhere!

471
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:57,660
Just live as you have lived!

472
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,370
What are you going to do by cleaning?

473
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:04,900
Do you want to go somewhere? Then go exercise at the playground out in the front!

474
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,660
There's no one to give me moxibustion.

475
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,280
Please give me a bottle of soju.

476
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,760
Hey, do you want to drink again after drinking that much at the store?

477
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,910
Oppa, drinking at work, and drinking with my money is different.

478
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,950
She can drink as she wants today.

479
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,560
Even her first customer was a jerk.

480
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,800
We're closing the store for the night, so drink as much as you want and go home.

481
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,910
Yes.

482
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,580
Oh, Oppa, you should have a drink too.

483
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,080
Hey.

484
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,120
What is up with her?

485
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,140
You recommended this place saying it's good, and why are you the one who's late?

486
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,290
Don't even mention it. Granny turned the store upside down today.

487
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,660
Can you see that I can't even move my arm?

488
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,660
Please give me noodles!

489
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:03,090
Hey, hey! Eat something while drinking or else it will upset your stomach.

490
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:22,370
Long ago, my mother warmed up the milk for me when I was sick.

491
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,510
It's dangerous for her.

492
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,730
Owner, please don't give us any free food for service.

493
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:33,420
Weak people.They get excited over something so small.

494
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,090
   

495
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,460
We work at a store nearby, so it's nice to come here for late-night snacks.

496
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,770
Gives you business and they get to sober up.

497
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,720
Please take me.

498
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,770
Why are you going this way? Aren't you going home?

499
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:24,130
I have a customer.

500
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,050
Director Jeong?

501
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,730
Yeah, why? You don't like it?

502
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:32,850
Who cares if I don't like it? I just think you're too good for him.

503
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,670
Don't worry. Customers aren't men.

504
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:40,380
As for falling in love, I'm going to date someone who doesn't have issues and who's not married.

505
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,240
What about you? Aren't you ever going to date?

506
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,950
What do you mean date? How can you do everything you want in life?

507
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,520
You live because you can't do what you want to do and you become more determined.

508
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,050
You don't know what's going to happen in life. That's why life is fun.

509
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,740
Our noonim achieved spiritual enlightenment.

510
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,840
That f***king love comes when you think it's all over for you.

511
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,240
Get ready so you don't lose her. Go.

512
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,130
Is this the front?

513
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,500
Why is she not turning off the lights?

514
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,770
   

515
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,370
Why did the boiler that worked fine burst?

516
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:32,760
Even if it's a person or an object, if it is used for more 10 years, it makes sense that it malfunctions.

517
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,160
So is Mr. Kim coming to fix it or not?

518
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,290
I don't know. We should know when he comes.

519
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,640
Looks like we won't have any business today.

520
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,580
Already?

521
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,320
What else would I do all day?

522
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:05,720
I am leaving.

523
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,850
You are working even on the weekends? What kind of company doesn't give you a day of rest?

524
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:13,880
Even if you are off to work, go out prettily. What are you doing with such dull colors?

525
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,060
Wear frilly skirts.

526
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,720
And curl your hair a bit too.

527
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,480
Hold on.

528
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:29,950
You look prettier. Even if you have color on your lips, you're prettier.

529
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:33,010
That's why, it's nice to be young.

530
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,000
Is it pretty?

531
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,040
 It's pretty. 

532
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,360
What are you doing? Why are you like this?

533
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,590
What are you doing, Mom?

534
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,750
Don't go out like that.

535
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,720
Mom!

536
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,860
You can't! You can't put makeup on your face!

537
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,690
Why? Why can't I do it?

538
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:08,620
Because you can't leave me too!

539
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,610
They say pretty flowers die faster.

540
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,690
I had no idea.

541
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,150
I put makeup on that young child

542
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,160
and went around with her.

543
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:40,930
I am crazy, I am crazy.

544
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,860
Unni, I did wrong. I did wrong.

545
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,970
I was wrong, Unni. I'm sorry.

546
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,060
I am sorry. It's my fault. I am sorry.

547
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:02,880
I'm sorry.

548
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:05,480
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

549
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,990
Let's drink properly, since the store is closed for today.

550
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,740
Hyungnim.

551
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,280
You two are always in sync, making me a weirdo all the time.

552
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,410
Since when? It's a misunderstanding.

553
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,810
Moon Soo is my daughter. Don't look at her so prettily.

554
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:30,170
I won't take her, I won't!

555
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,430
Nice.

556
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,710
I know how you feel.

557
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,890
If I don't know, who does?

558
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,650
If I think about Yeon Soo, I feel like this.

559
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:07,230
I wonder how you must feel, but I'm still envious of you.

560
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,870
I am really jealous.

561
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,790
Do you know how much Moon Soo cares about you?

562
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:18,160
There's no one else in the world who's on your side like her!

563
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,130
Still, you have a husband.

564
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:27,970
They say a bad husband is better than a good son. Forget your young child who grows up and leaves you.

565
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,330
Daughter or husband, tell them I said no!

566
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:44,020
If you get old, all you have is friends.

567
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,670
Really?

568
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:54,830
Yeah. That family has some problems. They're asking us to postpone a bit.

569
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,360
All of a sudden?

570
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,980
Yeah.

571
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,240
They should have called beforehand. I came out for no reason.

572
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,010
Then, next time—

573
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:13,710
Since we're out, let's play.

574
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,250
Wear it.

575
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:35,000
I don't want to.

576
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,480
Wear it.

577
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,100
I said I don't want to. I would never.

578
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,240
Then, I am going to wear it.

579
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:24,010
I don't get why people pay to ride something like that.

580
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,120
I know, right.

581
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,360
 I'm hungry. 

582
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,020
 I want to eat octopus. 

583
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,960
 Octopus? 

584
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:17,270
 Slice it thin, dip it in sesame oil, and wrap it in a spicy scallion salad. 

585
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:25,330
 Talking about it makes me want to eat it more. 

586
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:31,690
 Do you know that the IQ of an octopus is really high? 

587
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:36,940
 It's higher than a dog's IQ. It can recognize people's faces. 

588
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,990
 Now, you can't eat it, right? 

589
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,660
 Then, should I eat oysters? 

590
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,870
 Oysters? 

591
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:50,020
 Put in chives and Cheongyang red pepper. 

592
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:54,930
 It's really delicious if you spiral it inside your mouth and burst it. 

593
00:57:57,330 --> 00:58:01,070
 Even eating a bite of it makes me feel better. 

594
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,280
- Eat deliciously. 
- Yes.

595
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,010
I guess you know how to eat this.

596
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:17,340
I only saw here to eat.

597
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,960
Eat.

598
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,980
You can't eat this, right?

599
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,440
Let's order something else. Please give us the menu—

600
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,540
I-I-I am going to eat this. It's because it's hot, I am going to eat after cooling it a bit.

601
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:50,050
I am going to eat after washing my hands, so don't eat it. It's mine.

602
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,280
Pineapple.

603
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,090
No, it's fine.

604
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:03,070
Please just try. You don't have to buy it. It's because it's really sweet.

605
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,980
Thank you.

606
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,230
It's really sweet right? Really delicious?

607
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,700
Yes, it's sweet. Thank you.

608
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,410
Then, I will give you two for 10,000 ($10) won.

609
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:19,670
I will cut it out for you, so later you can have it as an appetizer when you two drink some alcohol.

610
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,300
It's sour and nice when you eat it.

611
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,300
No, it's fi—

612
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,150
I am really sorry.

613
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,980
My baby got hurt.

614
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,170
I am sorry.

615
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:38,510
Does being sorry cover it all?

616
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:43,070
If you ruined the food that I do business with, then you should compensate me for it.

617
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:44,740
Yes.

618
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,630
Here.

619
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:49,860
What is this?

620
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,460
No, the pineapple is fine.

621
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,420
Why are you saying it like that? Who said to give me money?

622
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,730
You dropped it.

623
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,790
I am sorry. It was the money for the pineapple.

624
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,860
I feel like crap. Why are you looking down on me?

625
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:08,800
Let's talk after putting down your knife. She is apologizing.

626
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,690
Apologize? Telling me to take the money and get the f*ck off is apologizing?

627
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,480
It was my fault. Stay still.

628
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,180
Even if it was your fault!

629
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:23,290
He is treating you like this, and you want me to stay still?

630
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:28,370
Who are you to tell me to do this and that when my baby is hurt?

631
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:41,070
Why are you getting mad? It is nothing much. I said I am fine.

632
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,880
You're fine?

633
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,480
- Yeah. 
- What's fine?

634
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:51,070
Tell me. No matter what everyone says, are you fine with it?

635
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,020
Let go.

636
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:56,120
A small person like you, why are you keeping so much inside you?

637
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,030
Don't pretend to be nice. No one cares for you by doing that.

638
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,690
Let go I said!

639
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:15,320
You're doing well.

640
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:25,490
- This is it? Do more. Shout it out instead of pretending to be normal, you stupid!
 - Hey!

641
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:29,840
Yeah! Like that! Shout more! Hey!!

642
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,930
- Is it yummy?
 - Yeah.

643
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,270
With what taste do you drink it for?

644
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,530
For this taste.

645
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,880
That's why I think my mother drinks alcohol.

646
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:15,270
She can make a long face, she can just cry.

647
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,310
She can laugh all she wants.

648
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,690
She can just say that she was like that because she is drunk.

649
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:31,190
Then, it seems like everything is because of alcohol.

650
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,710
- Ahjumma.
 - Yes?

651
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,360
No, no, it's fine.

652
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,190
Stop drinking. You drank all of this.

653
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:58,710
I did? I didn't.

654
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:02,510
If you didn't drink it, then I drank it? I don't even drink soju.

655
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,520
I like men who eat carrots.

656
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:20,220
I don't know why. I just do.

657
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:23,700
Men who eat carrots.

658
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:42,720
Ahjumma, I will pay for here.

659
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:53,500
One more drink. One more drink, huh?

660
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,110
No.

661
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:05,760
Just one more. No, just half.

662
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,760
I'll buy.

663
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:23,220
Drink, drink!

664
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,190
Will my stomach be upset? Yours will, not mine.

665
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:31,800
Your lips are so thick. They are like sausages.

666
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:46,290
The appetizer with the alcohol would be sausages. Vienna sausages.

667
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:10,820
Why won't you stay still even for a moment?

668
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,930
Is it cool?

669
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:15,600
Why?

670
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,720
Thanks.

671
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:58,380
Hey.
  ♫    I know it feels like you're gone  ♫

672
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,630
♫   I know   ♫

673
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:05,550
Are you sleeping?
 ♫   you'll be ready   ♫

674
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:13,120
♫   Run away any way, far from the pains  ♫

675
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:19,940
♫    Passing, tears in your eyes  ♫

676
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:25,250
♫    I don't want anything from you  ♫

677
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:31,790
♫    I don't want anything from you  ♫

678
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:38,320
♫   Just because of your love   ♫

679
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,220
♫    I won't let you go  ♫

680
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,180
Are you awake?

681
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,730
Then, let's go.

682
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:41,470
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

683
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:49,860
♫   It's not longing, it's not regret   ♫

684
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:56,980
♫   What could it be, This feeling that's coming on strong   ♫

685
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:04,720
♫  It grows when we’re far apart, it comes back when we’re apart  ♫

686
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:10,750
♫  This excitement seems to be because of you for some reason  ♫

687
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:16,980
♫   I felt that. I’m flying on your eyes   ♫

688
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,700
 Are you even doing chores? Give it to me. 

689
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,430
 It's okay. 

690
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,660
 A small kid doesn't even listen. 

691
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:23,860
 Why do you keep calling me small? This is just how I am. 

692
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:28,550
 No matter how disinterested you are, a person cannot watch when something of yours is being taken. 

693
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:33,100
 Did you not know that Ha Moon Soo and Lee Gang Doo have feelings for one another? 

694
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:38,060
 Are you a kid leaving marks on your face while eating? 

695
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,610
 Aren't you two sick of playing Romeo and Juliet? 

696
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,780
 Does passion only grow if there is an obstacle? Was that how it was for you, Ahjumma? 

697
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:48,040
 Please don't ask any favors of me. I already gave way once. 

698
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,660
 I plan to stay by Joo Won's side this time no matter what. 

699
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,690
 You knew about Lee Gang Doo's father's story too? 

700
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:55,730
 Don't say things carelessly. 

701
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:58,870
 Then you should have run in there and stopped him, so Lee Gang Doo wouldn't take the fall for it alone. 

702
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,740
 Don't go. 

703
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,230
 - I will explain—
 - Not now, next time. 

704
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:07,440
♫  On my way to see you  ♫

705
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:14,810
♫  I smile because it's familiar, I like it because it's comfortable   ♫
