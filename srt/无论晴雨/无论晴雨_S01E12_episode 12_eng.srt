I clearly told you to leave.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,800
If you don't leave right now,

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,500
I won't let go of this hand.

♫  When we think of each other with all our hearts  ♫

20
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,570
Did you sleep well?

21
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,300
Why didn't you leave?

22
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,200
Because I didn't want you to be alone

23
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
when you woke up.

24
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,380
I should go.

25
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,200
Sleep a bit more. I can take the first bus.

26
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,100
Thank you.

27
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,360
For staying with me,

28
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,900
thanks.

29
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,800
As long as you're not mean,

30
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,300
I can stay with you whenever (you wish).

31
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,800
 A person uses about ten facial muscles when they smile. 

32
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,900
 But when you frown, you use almost all your facial muscles. 

33
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,700
 Rather than frowning with such a strain, I wish you all a day filled with bright smiles. 

34
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,300
 I'll begin the morning show.

 Strange Stories Of The Afterlife by Im Cheol Woo 

36
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,700
 My poor children. Sadness is your strength. 

37
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:11,100
 Suffering, resentment, and regrets 

38
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
 are your strengths. 

39
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,700
 With those strengths... 

40
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,100
 With those strengths, somehow survive 

41
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,900
 the ugly and scary life. 

42
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,580
Somehow...

43
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,430
That's like Grandma.

44
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,500
- CEO. 
 - Yes.

45
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,400
You're early.

46
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,900
It's good. It's good, but isn't it too accessible?

47
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Some people don't want others to notice how they feel.

48
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,400
That's true, but this is a place

49
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,690
people could cry to their heart's content not caring about how others may view them.

50
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,910
I wish they could just mourn here.

51
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,900
- Ahjussi... 
 - Move!

52
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. It was my mistake.

53
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,000
Why did you have to make a mistake!

54
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,700
Why then? Of all days!

55
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,800
Why did you have to make such a stupid mistake!

56
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,100
Just being only sad... Is that possible?

57
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,090
What?

58
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,100
"Victims are only filled with sadness."

59
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,300
"Poor people are always more kind. Disabled people are always weak."

60
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,100
Aren't all those statements too general?

61
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,300
Poor people can be greedy and disabled people can be frauds.

62
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,700
Victims can also be perpetrators.

63
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
CEO.

64
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,500
The people who'd visit the memorial park the most...

65
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,200
In other words, these are people who'd be living around there.

66
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,500
It's not that I don't know where you're coming from.

67
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,600
But right now, you're an architectural designer rather than a victim.

68
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't forget that.

69
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry. I had told you I'd let you be in charge and I talked too much.

70
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,300
The contractual amount will be deposited immediately today, right?

71
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,200
It will, so that you won't be able to say anything else.

72
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,900
I had nothing to hold in my hands no matter how hard I worked.

73
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,700
You were making money so easily like this.

74
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,900
Hey! Do you know how much we're losing out as we're signing the contract?

75
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,100
Should we figure out how much you are losing out?

76
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,700
Stop it and let's end it here. It's not like you're not going to sign the contract.

77
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,800
I can go out to the construction site starting next week, right?

78
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,500
After I speak with the construction site manager.

79
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,800
Geez. Tell him not to be too tough with me.

80
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,300
Please put in a good word for me.

81
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,740
That a**hole. Even if he's got nothing, how could he not have any manners at all?

82
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,900
Lee Gang Doo.

83
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,100
What? Is there anything else?

84
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,300
Were you very close to the deceased?

85
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,800
Why?

86
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,700
What kind of relationship did you two have that she'd leave you land? I was just curious.

87
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,100
From your perspective where family members measure and compete with each other,

88
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,700
I guess it would be a difficult relationship for you to understand.

89
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,500
What are you going to do from now on?

90
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,300
Does Ha Moon Soo also know that you'll be working at the construction site again?

91
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,700
I'll tell her first.

92
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,100
Why do you look like that? You told me not to run away.

93
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,600
Ha Moon Soo must be happy. I'm envious.

94
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,300
I'll go head on. So, whether you'll retreat or move forward,

95
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,700
decide well.

96
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,700
He doesn't budge at all. What can I do alone?

97
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,900
Then let go of him.

98
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,680
If you don't even have the courage to let go, you should run away.

99
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,400
I have nowhere to run to.

100
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,500
What do you mean you don't.

101
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,700
If people found out someone like you would cling to a man like that, they'd talk crap about you.

102
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,300
Wake up and smell the coffee.

103
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,900
Thanks for helping me with the contract condition changes.

104
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,600
I've figured out everything and did what I did because it was worth it. Don't misunderstand me.

105
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,200
Oh, hey.

106
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,780
Hey, Gang Doo!

107
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,710
- Hey, drink this.
 - Yes.

108
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,590
The site manager. He couldn't even eat lunch and got called at the headquarters.

109
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,560
He got so angry when he heard you were coming. Of course, I'm happy.

110
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,880
Were you all right while I was gone?

111
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,090
Aigoo, don't even mention it.

112
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,320
Because your CEO threw a fit, we had to conduct the subsurface exploration all over again,

113
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,140
because all we did was get rid of the waste.

114
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,590
"Where am I? Who am I?" I had an identity conflict.

115
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,800
So, I waited for you so much.

116
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,870
For me?

117
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,070
Yeah. I was scared by myself.

118
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,970
Why?

119
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,240
There's a strange rumor.

120
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,250
What rumor?

121
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,580
People keep seeing strange things.

122
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,600
You know, right? This is where a huge accident took place.

123
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,540
At that time, I heard they buried everything trying to take care of things in a hurry.

124
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,990
They didn't even retrieve the bodies properly.

125
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,560
Whenever I worked the night shift, the hair on my back kept standing up.

126
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,930
 What are you doing? 

127
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,060
 I said help me. 

128
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,880
 Hey! 

129
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,670
 Hey, me too! Me, too. 

130
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,290
 There are people down here! 

131
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,880
What's wrong with you? Are you all right?

132
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,790
- Ugh... 
 - Aigoo...

133
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,770
What's that? Hey, there!

134
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,080
Be careful! Be careful!

135
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,200
 Victims can also be perpetrators. 

136
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
 It's not that I don't know where you're coming from. 

137
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,230
 But right now, you're an architectural designer rather than a victim. Don't forget that. 

138
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,400
 Hi. 

139
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,900
Hi.

140
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,320
 Hello? 

141
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,620
Hi. What?

142
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,650
What do you mean what? You called me.

143
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,440
 Ah. Right. Did you eat? 

144
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,900
I don't feel like eating. And you?

145
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,130
Me neither. I kind of ate.

146
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,900
 Why did you "kind of" eat? You should eat well. 

147
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,490
Are you off work?

148
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:47,370
Yeah. How about you? What did you do today?

149
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,140
Just... I took a walk.

150
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,850
 To where? 

151
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,430
Just... here and there.

152
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,480
Walking around like that,

153
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,280
I realized I was thinking about you.

154
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,550
I miss you.

155
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,350
 Where are you right now? 

156
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,140
Uh... this is...

157
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,870
♫  It's not longing,  ♫

158
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,390
♫  it's not regrets  ♫

159
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,080
♫  What could it be  ♫

160
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,870
♫  This feeling that's coming on strong  ♫

161
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,700
So good.
 ♫  It grows when we’re far apart,  ♫

162
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,290
You eat so prettily.

163
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,290
Huh?

164
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,900
You're working so hard at being cute.

165
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,910
♫  I felt that  ♫

166
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,670
♫  I’m flying on your eyes  ♫

167
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,750
I thought you didn't feel like eating.

168
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:27,380
Yeah. I did feel that way earlier, but I got hungry when I saw you.

169
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,750
I want to eat a steamed bun, too. Do you want to eat one, too?

170
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,500
Sure.

171
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,010
- Please give us one kimchi steamed bun. 
 - Okay.

172
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,360
Ah. Please give me five more steamed buns to go.

173
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,580
Okay.

174
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,010
My mom and auntie love them.

175
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,920
That's good.

176
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,820
Huh?

177
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,790
I'm glad I got to see you today.

178
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,110
Me, too.

179
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,190
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

180
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,910
So hot! So hot!

181
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,250
Are you okay?

182
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:11,190
No. So hot. So hot...

183
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,190
But it's so delicious.

184
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,730
♫  I like it because it's comfortable  ♫

185
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,360
♫  This trembling feeling  ♫

186
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,530
♫  For some reason, it deepens even more today  ♫

187
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,000
♫  My heart that misses you  ♫

188
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,910
♫  Calls out to you without any rest  ♫

189
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,430
♫  As if it'll never end  ♫

190
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,330
♫  I'm a fool in you  ♫

191
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,690
♫  I’m flying on your eyes  ♫

192
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,280
♫  The time we were together, that day  ♫

193
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:56,660
♫  I felt everything seems so great in this world  ♫

194
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,010
It wasn't much.

195
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,880
What?

196
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,170
Happiness.

197
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,060
Grandma! Can you see us?

198
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,100
♫  I’m flying on your eyes  ♫

199
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,910
Aigoo, cold. So cold.

200
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,540
Auntie.

201
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,610
Oh, you're home.

202
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,170
I'm glad you're here. I was worried you'd left already.

203
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,700
- Steamed buns. 
 - Ooh, looks good!

204
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,490
Who's the man who came with you?

205
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,460
Did you see him?

206
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,460
Don't tell Mom.

207
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,280
Why not? The young kids look so great, so happy together.

208
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,950
Not yet. Mom won't like him.

209
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,130
How many people in this world could make you smile like this?

210
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,610
I'm sure your mom couldn't say anything if she saw your face right now.

211
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,110
Oh, my, oh, my! You're so happy you can't contain yourself.

212
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,440
Hey, let's go inside. It's cold.

213
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,400
I told you not to disturb me.

214
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,070
What is it?

215
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,040
What are you doing with the girls during my peak hours?

216
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,950
I can pay for them.

217
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:30,530
You're not even playing with them. You'll be wasting your money and we'll lose out on business.

218
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,660
Why must we do that?

219
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,950
I had to do this so that you'd see me.

220
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,080
You left like that and won't even answer my calls.

221
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,810
If you feel bad toward me, apologize. I'll accept it.

222
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,230
I can't. That's why I'm doing this.

223
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,470
It's comfortable for me when I take care of things with money. This is the only way I know how!

224
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:19,150
Any affection you might have towards me is gone, right?

225
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:26,510
I know, too. There aren't many people who like me.

226
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,770
You do?

227
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:34,350
I do. People bow down to me in front of me, but talk crap about me behind my back.

228
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,300
Don't you think I know that?

229
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,150
It's a relief if you know. But don't worry about it.

230
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:46,900
Even if they do, they're all under you. That's why they're talking crap about you.

231
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,010
I know that, too.

232
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,240
I signed the contract today. Lee Gang Doo.

233
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,860
Why is that a**hole so confident?

234
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,100
If we signed the contract, he should be grateful to me! But he's not grateful to me at all! Geez!

235
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,800
Right. You should smile. You're pretty that way.

236
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,490
Why? Do I look more like your first love when I smile?

237
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,990
You do.

238
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,220
Well, that's not why I like you.

239
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,390
She was a real b****.

240
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:46,130
At least, you don't bulls*** about love this and that.

241
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,780
I like that clarity about you.

242
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,130
Eulsukdo Island. You'll go with me, right?

243
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,650
Hyung, what are you doing?

244
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,690
I heard the ahjussi in #201 found it somewhere.

245
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,750
I thought I was going to die trying to hang it up.

246
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,930
- Looks good, huh? 
 - Yeah.

247
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,240
You don't get random thoughts in your head while hitting this.

248
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,250
I think it's good.

249
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,650
Writer.

250
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,050
Are you all right?

251
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,870
No. I couldn't sleep for several days and

252
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,120
I worked so hard to meet my deadline.

253
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:03,890
Did I do it to get chewed up like this? I'm so full of it.

254
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:11,510
Forget it. I'll quit everything. That's all it takes.

255
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,190
There's no joy in life.

256
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,550
What would you do if you didn't draw cartoons?

257
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,610
Whatever you do, people will talk about you.

258
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,420
But it's happiness when they're talking crap about you while doing the work you love.

259
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,440
Hey. Don't you remember when you used to post vicious comments?

260
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,440
You seemed to complain even when you had a chance. So, I did it out of anger.

261
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,900
But as for attacking you personally, I apologize.

262
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,020
Forget it.

263
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,760
Why should I continue to do this?

264
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,910
"There's no heaven when you arrive at a place when you run away."

265
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,240
"The only thing there is..."

266
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,630
"A battlefield as expected."

267
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,000
Don't think about anything today and get some rest.

268
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,010
I'll start helping you starting tomorrow.

269
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,730
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy!

270
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,210
 Memorial Park Land Changes 

271
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,760
Director Jeong approved this without any problems?

272
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,210
Not without any problems. Ultimately, yes.

273
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,350
As for the memorial park design,

274
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:59,930
I know Moon Soo is working on it. When I get back to the site, I'll help her from there.

275
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,730
Director Jeong didn't tell you?

276
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,100
It's a bit sudden. What happened?

277
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,310
Somehow, an opportunity came up for me.

278
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,250
So I grabbed it.

279
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,860
You know that I like Moon Soo.

280
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,610
I'm not asking you about your personal affairs. Why again at the construction site—

281
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,830
I'm saying because of Moon Soo.

282
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:40,480
I didn't think I'd be a good person like you, CEO, so I had given up on her early on.

283
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,850
But if I really tried hard, I felt that I could be a good person to at least one person.

284
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,990
So, I'm going to try to do that.

285
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,860
Oh? Why are you here?

286
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,470
Why else would I be here? To work.

287
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,520
Here? You're moving it here?

288
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,080
Yeah.

289
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,860
This is totally central.

290
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:29,760
That's why. It's visible and people can see it as they walk by. It's nice.

291
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,100
Nothing is going to change. You just do what you've been doing.

292
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,240
What's this?

293
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:53,970
When I think about it, I think my dad wrote in this every night when he came home.

294
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,920
I think you'd understand what it's talking about very well.

295
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,180
How the shopping mall was built.

296
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,670
What kinds of problems there were.

297
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,680
- Leaving? 
 - Yeah, I have to do something.

298
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:21,480
Ah. We have to see each other, even for a moment, later.

299
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,030
Why?

300
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,400
I plan to be super cool today.

301
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,050
- Would you like to see something else?
 - Yes.

302
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,400
Just a moment, please.

303
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,980
- Hyung. Let's leave now. 
 - Why?

304
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,780
Look at this place. It looks super expensive. We don't have money.

305
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,460
I do.

306
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,110
You do?

307
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,840
Yeah. Go pick out shoes.

308
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,320
Sh-shoes. All right!

309
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,140
Hey. Oh?

310
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:20,970


311
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:33,890
 Up to 50 million won ($50,000) lent on the same day. 

312
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,690
Is it real?

313
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,570
It's real.

314
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,240
Wow...

315
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,740
Gang Doo. See you again.

316
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,530
Why would we see each other again? Let's not.

317
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,170
Let's go.

318
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,740
Come again.

319
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,800
Did you see how those a**holes were kissing my a**?

320
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,970
Do you know how much abuse I had to take from them?

321
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,510
- You see that? 
 - Yeah.

322
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:22,040
Wow! Money is good! It's great!

323
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,140
Hyung! I'm hungry.

324
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,640
What are we going to eat?

325
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,970
B-11?

326
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,580
 Aug 5th, Zone B-11
1. Due to error in framework and construction, elevator wall part cut
2. Abnormalities in the last stone piece.
3. Rebar reinforcement needed  

327
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,680
The shopping mall blueprint? What about it?

328
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,810
I was wondering if I can take a look at it.

329
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,890
It's been longer than 10 years. The CEO should have it.

330
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,960
Go and ask him for it.

331
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,980
Could you get it for me, Team Leader?

332
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,640
Hyung. From the way things have been going, this isn't right. Don't you think?

333
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,220
What did I say is the best in the winter?

334
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,800
- Fishcake! 
 - That's right.

335
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,340
- Isn't it good? 
 - Yeah, it's good.

336
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,720
Hyung. We have lots of money now. Let's just buy this.

337
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,690
Then, we can eat fishcake all winter long.

338
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,770
It's not my money.

339
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,680
I'll do my best in my life and pay it back to Grandma.

340
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,200
- Hyung. I think God really exists.
 - What?

341
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:24,010
He felt so sorry for you that He sent Grandma to you.

342
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,660
He must've felt really bad.

343
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:34,370
Hyung, I'm going to eat something spicy, too. Please give me some spicy rice cake.

344
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,210
He gave me you, too.

345
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,560
Huh?

346
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,940
No, enjoy.

347
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,890
Give me some, too.

348
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,930
Welcome.

349
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,440
- He's not back yet. Go to his room and wait. 
 - Not yet?

350
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,870
Geez, I don't know. The two of them went out and I haven't heard from them all day.

351
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,640
I'm about to call them right now. Go up.

352
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,600
Okay.

353
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,710
Have some of this. It's still warm.

354
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,270
Oh, smells good. Thanks.

355
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,860
Yeah, where are you guys?

356
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,890
It's way past mealtime. Why aren't you coming home?

357
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,470
 The medicine that Oppa takes, can you bring it to me?  

358
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,110
 These small things. 

359
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:41,730
 When they go inside your body, your brain can't feel the pain. 

360
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,800
 How strong this must be to fool your own body. 

361
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,780
What? Do I look too cool?

362
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,820
I told you. I plan to look cool.

363
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,990
Why did you dress up like this? Is today a special day?

364
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,410
Yeah.

365
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,400
What kind of day?

366
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:47,700
The day I've been reborn as a social person.

367
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,220
Huh?

368
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,630
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

369
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,760
What? How?

370
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,480
Moon Soo, look at me!

371
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,070
Hyung bought me a suit...

372
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,240
Do it. Do what you were doing.

373
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,360
 I'm truly a useless human being. 

374
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,410
 All I know is martial arts. It's all useless. 

375
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,820
Hi, Unni.

376
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,570
Aigoo.

377
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:06,070
What? You told me to hurry home as if something bad happened.

378
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,930
Did I say that?

379
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,110
She said she ran away.

380
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,360
Mother.

381
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,320
From what I heard, it's true. She ran away from a man.

382
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,180
A man?

383
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,840
Hey, wrap up here. I'm going upstairs.

384
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:26,210
You're young, single, and interested. Why run away?

385
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,190
That's my house. Why would I run...

386
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:33,330
If you're interested in him, just date him. There's not much to it.

387
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm going to spend the night here.

388
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,420
Okay.

389
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,280
What is it?

390
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,380
You two are together constantly. Of course, you're starting to pay attention to him.

391
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,380
It's not like that.

392
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,560
I'm going crazy because all I see is his good side.

393
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,930
He's much more dependable than his age. He's harder working than I expected.

394
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:04,380
He seems to have lived a tough life, but he didn't fall by the wayside.

395
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:09,100
- That's not something to go crazy over. It's a good thing. 
 - Hey.

396
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,930
You should stop me.

397
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,020
Why?

398
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:19,310
If I can't get a grip and come on to him, it's sexual harassment at workplace. What else could it be?

399
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,960
He seems to be interested in you, too, Unni.

400
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,820
He posted vicious comments, then he barges in and wants to become your assistant.

401
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,350
When you see how he normally treats you, you have your answer.

402
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,510
Forget it.

403
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,080
No, I can't. Stop. I keep thinking about him more because of you.

404
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,630
How about you? You're seeing Gang Doo, right?

405
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:49,130
Oh-ho? Hey, aren't you going to tell me?

406
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,180
What?

407
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,950
Tell me.

408
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,100
There's nothing to tell.

409
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,940
Tell me.

410
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,770
- Tell you what?

411
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,810
You have to tell me!

412
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:14,830


413
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,180
- I will leave a change of clothes here...
 - Tell me!

414
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,450
- What? 
 - What happened?

415
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,330
No, nothing happened.

416
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,100
- Tell me, tell me! 
 - Hey.

417
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,850
- Nothing... 
 - You'd better tell me.

418
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,380
Hurry up and tell me!

419
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,750
Nothing happened!

420
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,770
Why? I think something happened between you two.

421
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,630
Whatever, whatever!

422
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:28,470
- How is Mother? 
 - She drank all night.

423
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,270
She can't get up even though I try to wake her up.

424
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,780
Unni. The medicine you just took. What color is it?

425
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,610
Huh?

426
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,930
Was it white? Why?

427
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,680
The medicine Gang Doo takes is blue.

428
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,020
Is that important?

429
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,610
No. I wish it wasn't important.

430
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:14,290
Thanks. If I asked for it, I thought he'd pretend to be fine.

431
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:20,910
By chance... If it's not good for Gang Doo, please let me know.

432
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,000
Okay. All right then.

433
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:34,010
What you said last time, about the accident.

434
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,000
 He spent several days with a dead body. 

435
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,220
 It's painful to remember those things. 

436
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,110
You said Oppa didn't tell you anything about it.

437
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,510
If you're curious about it, hear it from him directly.

438
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,630
Even though we're family, I don't think it's something I should ramble on about.

439
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,210
Moon Byeong Ho. His body was never found.

440
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,570
He has a wife and a son.

441
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,790
It's here.

442
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,410
I must be a snob.

443
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:58,920
Seeing that she lives in such a nice house, I feel somewhat relieved.

444
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,900
Just a moment please.

445
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,510
Tae Ho. Go into your room. Okay?

446
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,150
Hurry.

447
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:23,200
Tae Ho thinks that his current dad is his biological dad.

448
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:28,760
I see. I understand.

449
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,310
Please look at this first.

450
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,730
 Installation of S Mall Victims Memorial Park Plan 
 - No.

451
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:39,560
I don't think this is a matter that I need to agree or disagree on.

452
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,950
By chance, other family members of Moon Byeong Ho...

453
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:51,870
Father passed away a few years ago, and I heard his older brother moved to the US.

454
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,210
It's been a long time since we've kept in touch.

455
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:01,390
Do you think I'm being too cold?

456
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:06,180
No, I don't. I'm grateful that you met with us like this.

457
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,510
I heard they're building there right now.

458
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,470
Yes.

459
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,340
I guess he'll be gone for good now.

460
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,810
We couldn't even find a piece of his bones.

461
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:33,890
So, now... he just seems like he took off.

462
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,230
Feels like he just left.

463
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:47,110
No matter how much I thought about it, I couldn't get an answer. So, I'm going to forget about it.

464
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:51,960
If there's nothing to remember, I wouldn't have to suffer either.

465
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,160
I'm sorry.

466
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,380
We'll take care of this ourselves.
  Victim's Personal Information  

467
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,200
 Victim's Personal Information 

468
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:10,270
 Victim's Personal Information
 Moon Byeong Ho, DOB 04/21/1973  

469
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,470
This is what he looked like.

470
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,190
I wanted to forget only the struggles.

471
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,100
Now, I can't even remember the good times anymore.

472
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,240
- What? 
 - Don't you feel the same way?

473
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,560
You just want to forget everything. Isn't it hard for you to do this work?

474
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,750
Why do you talk as if you're talking about someone else?

475
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,600
Isn't it hard for you?

476
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,850
I don't know...

477
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:18,940
whether I can do a good job on this, what's the right thing to do.

478
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,960
There's no right answer to something like this.

479
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,210
We just have to do our best as much as we can.

480
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,560
Let's go!

481
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,970
You said you have to get back to the office.

482
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,330
It's cold. I told you we should take a taxi.

483
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,580
It's traffic time right now.

484
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:50,410
The bus will take me back to the office in one shot. Why take a taxi?

485
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,760
If you were going to do that,

486
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,140
why aren't you wearing something warmer?

487
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,050
I couldn't wear a casual jacket when I had to go over to someone's home.

488
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,800
Geez...

489
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,580
No, no, I don't want you to. Don't take it off.

490
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,630
Why?

491
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,890
You'll get cold, too.

492
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:11,370
I hate seeing you being cold more than me being cold.

493
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,450
I really don't like it.

494
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,890
All right. I won't take it off.

495
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,250
Instead...

496
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,710
Until the bus comes by let's stay like this.

497
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,070
What the heck? You're heavy.

498
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,000
Endure it.

499
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:52,860
Is it because you own a public bath house?

500
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:59,430
You smell good.

501
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:16,940
 Noodles, Kimbap  

502
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,590
Geez, my trainer told me not to eat gluten.

503
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:29,580
You're fine, Director.

504
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,480
I can maintain this because I'm being trained.

505
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,940
If I get a slight belly, my wife will be...

506
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,840
What's wrong? It's not like we're dating.

507
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:46,800
Hey, we eat, drink coffee. What we're doing right now is kind of like dating.

508
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,730
By chance, do you own land around here?

509
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,420
What land? Besides, I don't like real estate.

510
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,760
I like something that moves so that I can take it with me and leave whenever I want to.

511
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,560
Leave?

512
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,740
If you want to make money, stay put here.

513
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,170
I'm going to rebuild all this next year.

514
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,000
The land here has been banned for ten years after it's been designated as a redevelopment area.

515
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,200
If we are not able to get it done this time, zoning for the business district will be canceled.

516
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,880
Forget it. Buy something if you can even now.

517
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,130
Do you want me to buy some for you?

518
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:24,880
 I feel a grave responsibility for the shopping mall incident.
   

519
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,830
 I bow my head and offer my apology. 

520
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:37,060
Do you know how hard we worked on getting it back? All the surrounding area here—

521
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,730
Oh, my God!

522
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,290
What's with you?

523
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,070
Get out!

524
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,810
Owner, what's going on?

525
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,580
I told you to get out!

526
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,200
You crazy man!

527
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,590
Let's go. I'll ask him what's going on later.

528
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,060
Let's go.

529
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:56,780
Geez.

530
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:02,100
 Seaweed Rolls. Noodles 

531
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,670
The shopping mall blueprint.

532
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,280
Ah, thank you.

533
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,650
There won't be much even if you look at it.

534
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:45,630
Our team reviewed it before and pulled it apart but didn't find any problems.

535
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,820
Then, why did he die?

536
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,100
What?

537
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,810
The architect. I heard he committed suicide.

538
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,920
Really?

539
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,190
Did he?

540
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,180
I guess, why die if you didn't do anything wrong?

541
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,940
If it were me, I couldn't die because it would feel so unfair.

542
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,430
Is that so?

543
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,620
It's strange.

544
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,170
He said one word of apology and...

545
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:13,520
how could he die like that, so irresponsibly?

546
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,910
Are you all right, Unni?

547
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,400
Water...

548
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,290
CEO.

549
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:35,770
Go home now. You don't look good.

550
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,550
No.

551
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:58,130
 He said one word of apology and 

552
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,560
 how could he die like that, so irresponsibly? 

553
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,500
 Is a word apology good enough after killing people? 

554
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,560
 Is this such an easy matter to you? 

555
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:29,670
 Cheongyoo Builders 

556
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:14,230
Gosh, look at your face. What to do?

557
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,750
What brings you here?

558
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,320
You think I came here because I wanted to?

559
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,680
I came here instead of Unni.

560
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,850
Instead of Moon Soo?

561
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,980
Moon Soo couldn't come to work because she's sick.

562
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,540
She's sick?

563
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,880
You didn't know?

564
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,580
Ah... I guess you didn't know because you were being chummy with Director Jeong.

565
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,920
What? Being chummy?

566
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,120
I really hate people who drop hints everywhere with everyone.

567
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:44,210
Do you have a pair of work shoes? I can't get dirt on them.

568
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,170
Moon Soo.

569
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,780
How is she sick?

570
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,970
 Coral Bathhouse 

571
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,560
Geez, it's chilly. Come out. Go into the sauna.

572
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,750
It's okay.

573
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,340
What do you mean?

574
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,930
There's nothing better for a cold than sweating it out.

575
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,170
Soak your body and go rest.

576
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:17,230
Hurry up!

577
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,930
Hi.

578
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:38,170
 I heard you're sick. 

579
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,970
I'm okay now.

580
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,750
You don't sound okay.

581
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,310
I'm getting better.

582
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:48,530
Geez. You were dressed too thinly yesterday.

583
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,630
Did you eat something?

584
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,780
My throat hurts too much. I can't eat.

585
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,970
What should I feed you?

586
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,020
Are you craving anything?

587
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,100
Um...

588
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,840
Ice cream?

589
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,560
I should eat ice cream.

590
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,370
Ice cream? Do you have some at home?

591
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,310
I don't know.

592
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,580
What time is it right now?

593
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:23,200
You're up. Come out. Eat and sleep.

594
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,930
I'll call you later.

595
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:44,200
What are you doing not eating?

596
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,920
Aiyoo... Put it in the soup and take a few bites.

597
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,280
I can't eat because my throat hurts. I don't want to eat any more.

598
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,220
Hurry up and eat. You have to take your medicine. Hurry up and eat.

599
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,170
Why isn't she answering?

600
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:16,910
 Women only Bathhouse 

601
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,100
Mom.

602
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,320
Ah, hello. How do you do?

603
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,870


604
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,550
What are you doing?

605
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,110
Are you crazy?

606
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,480
The ice cream—

607
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,640
What's going on?

608
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,900
You said you wanted some ice cream.

609
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:43,120
I thought you were sleeping. So I was going to hang it on the outside.

610
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,940
So cool.

611
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,190
Moon Soo.

612
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,100
What do we do?

613
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,670
 - Are you sleeping? 
 - Hey!

614
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:11,080
It's dangerous. Go under it.

615
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,390
Lie down. Lie down.

616
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,920
Lie down.

617
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,750
I fell asleep for a moment.

618
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,190
Why did you lock the door?

619
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,570
I don't know. I didn't know it was locked.

620
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:35,920
I got scared.

621
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,500
What's wrong with your face? Are you getting a fever again?

622
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:45,750
I think the heater is on too high. It's too hot. Why?

623
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:50,050
Drink this before you go to sleep. I boiled ginger and jujube.

624
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,820
So hot.

625
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,030
You have to cool it down.

626
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:59,880
Put it next to your bed and drink it whenever you get thirsty.

627
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,550
Aren't you leaving?

628
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:09,660
I'll see you lie down. Go lie down. I'll turn off the light for you.

629
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,870
Lie down.

630
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,750
 Sleep, okay? 

631
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,210
You're safe now. Come out.

632
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,370
Come out.

633
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:26,400
Why?

634
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:30,480
What if you catch my cold?

635
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:58,630
You're going to catch my cold.

636
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:01,280
That's good.

637
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:07,430
Then, I'll take it all away.

638
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:32,770
♫  Somehow we are similar to each other, no  ♫

639
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:40,020

You were dying yesterday. How did you get all better in a day?

661
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,360
- I guess I ate well and slept well. I'm full of energy.
 - Aigoo.

662
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:30,800
It's good to be young. Good to be young.

Hey. Put a muffler on. Don't get sick again.

At the site of foundation excavation, they found a pillar. I felt uneasy about it.

672
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:56,600
They can move it by demolishing it. Should I get the equipment and dig it out?

673
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:02,850
No, we don't need to create a hassle. Let's take care of it as waste.

674
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,020
- As waste?

 How did you know Moon Soo likes men who eat carrots? 

680
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,500
 - I do? 
- But isn't it nice?

 He can't eat chicken feet, can't drink soju. Yet he says he's not picky about food. 

682
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,820
 Love makes people be so picky. 

683
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:20,390
 I'm really fine. I don't need anything.

 Yeah, you're fine.

 A little while ago.

 Well, you meet, eat fishcake, take a walk, sit on swings so childishly...

 A suite costs as much as a motel room. You can watch a movie...

 Including the physical hunger... 

699

 There are places like that? So interesting. 

700

 Stay here.
