♫  This love  ♫

9
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:28,150
 My life, which might be entangled even more in the future, if it's going to be ruined, it's better to be alone. 

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,920
 And so... 

11
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,820

 Episode 10 

21
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,280
Oh my, oh my. What is this?

22
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,670
Excuse me.

23
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,280
Look here. Why are you sleeping here?

24
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,560
This room has an occupant. Who are you?

25
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,690
I am sorry. I came here to pick up my bag and lost track.

26
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,840
Are you the lady who goes around with Gang Doo?

27
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,670
Pardon?

28
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,470
Yes.

29
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,890
Gang Doo will be back in several days.

30
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,220
Several days? That long?

31
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,700
The weather is cold, but he insisted on working on the fishing boat

32
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,410
when he clearly knows that Sang Man will ask for him.

33
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,300
Gang Doo. Has he been living here long?

34
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,750
Of course, he's been living here for a long time.

35
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,440
Almost seven years? Why do you ask?

36
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,280
I was wondering why he lives alone when he has a younger sister.

37
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,230
It seems like his younger sister was raised well.

38
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,600
Oh my, but him!

39
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:17,790
Geez, when he first came here, he was nothing but skin and bones. He was practically a beggar.

40
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,780
But after coming here, he looks like a human.

41
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,410
Kids, they suffer when their mom isn't around.

42
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,580
That's why you need a mom, a mom.

43
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,330
What will happen to Sang Man when I am not around?

44
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,160
I will get going.

45
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,190
Okay.

46
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,640
♫  Your lights in your heart  ♫

47
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,680
 Excuse me. 

48
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,690
♫  Shines on my day  ♫

49
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,620
♫  My eyes on the soul  ♫

50
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,300
 Isn't the name of this bus stop ridiculous? 

51
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,620
 Look. It says "Front of S Mall." 

52
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,980
 That's been gone for some time now. 

53
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:56,640
♫  Lights resound your hope. I see your faces.  ♫

54
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,540
♫  Letting it go. Seeing your light.  ♫

55
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,670
The wind is blowing, let's hurry up.

56
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:10,720
♫  Away from you, being your light  ♫

57
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,920
♫  Far from you  ♫

58
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,090
Do you wish to die or something?

59
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,100
Do you want to get tangled and drown in the net? Who told you to be that close?

60
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,910
 The victim who died in the accident isn't the only victim. 

61
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:19,850
 The people who survived, yet who are living in torment, how will they be compensated? 

62
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,550
It seems like you're suffering now.

63
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,040
Don't stay alone at times like this. Come to our prayer retreat center instead.

64
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,340
Even if you're suffering now, you can be saved with faith.
   

65
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,080
God only gives the amount of suffering you're able to bear. Together with us—

66
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,040
How about the suffering I am not able to bear?

67
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,670
You can overcome that with prayer.

68
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:05,050
How about those who are miserable all their lives because they are not able to overcome it?

69
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,840
Pardon?

70
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,570
Those who already died because they weren't able to bear it, what will God do for them?

71
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,290
   

72
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,690
I am not going to believe in Him.

73
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,680
We always fill up the spot with day laborers. They quit after I train them or don't show for work when they don't feel like it.

74
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,140
It's really hard for me lately without Gang Doo here.

75
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,450
Gang Doo may look like a slacker but he was hardworking.

76
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,060
So can you ask Gang Doo to come back?

77
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,080
- I can't.
 - You can't, I see.

78
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,790
He's not coming, Mr. Lee Gang Doo.

79
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,490
I see.

80
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,870
 Over there, there... 

81
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,640
Re-inspection of ground exploration, I heard you've made it happen.

82
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,560
I am not doing this because of you. I prefer things to be thorough, too.

83
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,890
You were going to push forward even if my company opposed it.

84
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,770
Anyway, thank you.

85
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,100
Everyone is looking forward to your outcome.

86
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,070
Isn't anticipation scarier than opposition?

87
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,400
I will support you as much as I can.

88
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,120
You might be able to push me away regarding personal matters,

89
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,800
but you'll definitely need me regarding work.

90
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,050
   

91
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,740
Ouch.

92
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,230
I can't drink soju.

93
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,540
It's medicine, a medicine. You need this to be able to sleep at least three to four hours at night.

94
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,720
 Is it yummy? 

95
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,410
 Yeah. 

96
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,940
 With what taste do you drink it for? 

97
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,890
 For this taste. 

98
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,880
♫  Where to, where to, why to  ♫

99
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,070
♫  It's been gone, it's somewhere  ♫

100
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,810
♫  Every time when I see  ♫

101
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:36,940
♫  It's so gray, it's okay  ♫

102
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,790
♫  Feels like you’re the one I know  ♫

103
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:49,440
♫  It's been gone, it's somewhere  ♫

104
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,280
   

105
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,870
   

106
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,310
Will you continue to be like that here?

107
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,370
Fine, let's go over this once more.

108
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,930
Your memory came back after ten years,

109
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,640
and Gang Doo was in your memory. That's it.

110
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,410
You don't remember anything else?

111
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,900
Just sporadically.

112
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,880
But I think I am certain that I saw Gang Doo there.

113
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,270
Then don't be like this here. Go and ask him.

114
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,770
It's because I can't meet him now.

115
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,560
There is good cell phone reception everywhere.

116
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,220
You can go anywhere in this small country in a day once you set your mind to it.

117
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,180
Why can't you meet him?

118
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,090
This isn't good.

119
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,860
What isn't?

120
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,650
It's all about timing.

121
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,650
- Seeing how you two keep on missing each other; Isn't that a sign you shouldn't meet in the future?
 - Unnie.

122
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,400
I am not just being mean to you because I called dibs on Mr. Lee Gang Doo.

123
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,880
The person who is by your side when you're feeling desperate is the real deal.

124
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,060
Think about it.

125
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,810
What's the point of asking?

126
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,760
Geez, what should I ask?

127
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,930
I think you're right.

128
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,380
What?

129
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:33,530
I think I am anxious now because I can't stay by Gang Doo's side.

130
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,540
Right. That was it.

131
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,610
Hey, I think you misunderstood what I said—

132
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,420
Thanks, Unni.

133
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,100
Hey!

134
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,910
Oh, my. What do I do about her?

135
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,150
   

136
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,190
   

137
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,430
You came.

138
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,910
Oh, so yummy.

139
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,460
Why are you looking at me like that?

140
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,250
Oh, nothing. Do you want to go to Eulsukdo Island next week?

141
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,050
We can see birds and the reeds are—

142
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,760
Is that also a place you went with your first love?

143
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,440
Or you couldn't go with her, so you want me to go with you instead?

144
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,960
Geez.

145
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,390
I don't believe it when men dwell on their first love.

146
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,260
It's not that you miss your first love or feel affection towards her.

147
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,240
Now that you're a snob, you miss your young and innocent self from that time.

148
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,720
Hey, why are you so prickly today?

149
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,930
The person you mentioned about firing. Was it Gang Doo?

150
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,760
Are you upset over just that?

151
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,450
I thought you were good at discerning people.

152
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,870
Why are you being like this toward me tonight?

153
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,120
Did I do something wrong? There's a reason. That's why!

154
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,660
What reason? The fact that you just don't like him?

155
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,490
Where are you going?

156
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,130
- I have a customer. 
 - What about me?!

157
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,440
I have another lady for you. Have a great time.

158
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,800
Hey, who the heck is he to you that you're acting this way?

159
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,220
Who the hell is he to you?

160
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,040
My life saver.

161
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,170
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

162
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,530
You'll have a stroke this way.

163
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,220
Why can't you sleep?

164
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,900
Sleeping when you can is part of your job.

165
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,430
I'm sorry.

166
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:45,220
Aigoo. I'd be happy if there were more fish.

167
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,160
We've been twiddling our thumbs for days.

168
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,350
It's so draining.

169
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,100
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow. There will be some fish tomorrow, don't you think?

170
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,240
The rain doesn't matter.

171
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,150
In the ocean, the wind is scarier than rain.

172
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:08,900
Aigoo. Seeing the waves, looks like there will be lots of wind.

173
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,740
Whether for people or fish, there's this thing called a tide.

174
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,320
As for the tide,

175
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,530
if you miss it, you don't know when you'll see it again.

176
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,310
I don't think it's the right time this time around.

177
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:34,680


178
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,630
Oh?

179
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,370
Grandma.

180
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,730
   

181
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:12,660
Wow. I don't know why I crave this whenever I come to a bathhouse.

182
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,270
Did Gang Doo leave on a ship?

183
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,640
That dork. He does whatever he can do to abuse his body.

184
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,970
Did you see him before he left?

185
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,440
I was too late.

186
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,930
It happens. For you to be so downcast over that, you're way too young.

187
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,470
Gang Doo and I. Did you know we were in the accident together?

188
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,590
What's the use of bringing up the past?

189
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,730
I didn't know. Like a dummy.

190
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,620
Whether it's truly that I can't remember

191
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,630
or if I'm trying to be at peace alone,

192
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,670
I don't know myself.

193
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,760
Why is that your fault?

194
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,760
You got hurt. That was a terrible accident.

195
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,410
I just feel like I'm doing something wrong.

196
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,930
A squirrel has two acorns. He puts one in his own mouth.

197
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:26,360
And he saves the other one for the wintertime by burying it. You know that?

198
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,380
He works so hard for it. And being so dumb,

199
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,390
he can't eat it because he can't find it. He forgets about it.

200
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,530
What a waste.

201
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,050
It's a waste. Rather than being wasteful for a moment,

202
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,040
the acorn that was buried underground in the winter

203
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,260
grows leaves, becomes a tree, then makes a forest.

204
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,650
Aren't we grateful for that?

205
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,430
If it's too hard for you, it's one way to forget everything and bury it.

206
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,860
How would you know how it would turn out later?

207
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,970
In life, it could be a blessing in disguise. You know?

208
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,440
Oh, yeah. What brings you here?

209
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,760
I took a taxi to take a bath.

210
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,040
I don't think I've seen you in the neighborhood. Do you live in the area?

211
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,930
No, it's not that. It's been awhile since I've been to a bathhouse.

212
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,160
Had I known sooner, I would've come more often.

213
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,900
Come more often in the future.

214
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,630
The auntie here is very good at scrubbing.

215
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,710
Really? Should I get a scrubbing?

216
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,550
Yes, do that. You'll feel so refreshed.

217
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,120
How is this? Are you okay with the length?

218
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,530
Yes.

219
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,800
Then, I'll blow dry it for you after you take your bath.

220
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,680
Auntie!

221
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,160
- What? 
 - Auntie, a customer.

222
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,310
Come in. Soak yourself first.

223
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,940
You did well.

224
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,100
- Go over there. 
 - I have to get undressed.

225
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,310
- Where's the grandma?
 - She's getting scrubbed.

226
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,680
How do you know her?

227
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:48,140
Just a friend of a friend, sort of.

228
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,030
Is she sick or something?

229
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,000
Huh?

230
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,440
Feels like she's preparing for something.

231
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,250
I feel a little sad.

232
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,530
What are you saying?

233
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,110
You get those feelings when you're styling people's hair.

234
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,790
Wait, wait!

235
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,680
- What, what? 
 - Auntie.

236
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,120
- Grandma! Grandma, Grandma! Grandma! 
 - Hurry, hurry!

237
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,200
Oh, my goodness!

238
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,940
Hey, hey, hey! It's tangled. Bring the scuba gear!

239
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,880
Pull. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

240
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,930
Hurry, hurry! The rope!

241
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,120
Ugh, geez...

242
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,330
Grandma.

243
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,130
I'm okay. It's just that I got dizzy from staying in hot water too long.

244
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,240
You were like that last time, too.

245
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,570
Let's get you an exam, please?

246
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,250
It's okay!

247
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,420
You're not okay.

248
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:13,530
I told you to wait while I get you hospitalized.

249
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,370
Let's go.

250
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,390
If you continue to leave it like this, you'll die.

251
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,540
You have no idea when the tumor will burst inside your head.

252
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,930
You have to treat it soon for you to survive—

253
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,670
Do you know what people die of the most?

254
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,400
Cancer? Accident? Suicide? None of those things.

255
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,680
People die because of poverty.

256
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,720
They can't receive medical treatment when they are sick because they're poor.

257
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,200
They die from accidents doing dangerous work while trying to escape poverty.

258
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,460
They kill themselves because they hate being poor. People die from poverty.

259
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,060
What? A mere tumor? I'm not afraid of that at all. Move!

260
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,540
The tumor is located in the hypothalamus.

261
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,630
If she gets surgery, she might lose all of her memory.

262
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,570
That's why she's enduring like that.

263
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,160
Could she be cured if she receives surgery?

264
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,300
At her age, I can't give you a firm answer.

265
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,390
Does Gang Doo know?

266
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,690
She told me not to tell him.

267
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,870
You have to tell him.

268
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,590
If he finds out later, he'll be hurt.

269
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,980
The patient is so stubborn. I can't just reveal it.

270
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,620
I was there, too,

271
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,830
at the shopping mall accident.

272
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,390
Things that happen out of the blue unprepared, I'm scared and I hate it.

273
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,770
I feel that way, so Gang Doo must feel the same way.

274
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,270
You must tell Gang Doo.

275
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,560
I really hate things like this.

276
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,910


277
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,250
Hey, go and get me the fishing log.

278
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,420
Okay.

279
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,900
Hey, Mr. Kim! Pack more ice! Why are you saving ice?

280
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,700
- It's okay!
- Go down below and grab more ice!

281
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,670
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

282
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,900
What?

283
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,860
Right now? All of a sudden?

284
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,020
Hey, hey! You crazy? If you leave now...

285
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,530
The tide!

286
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,060
What?

287
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,140
I don't think I can miss the timing!

288
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,760
It's called a glioblastoma. It's the most malignant tumor.

289
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,500
It's got bigger since the last exam. It's growing too fast.

290
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,740
With surgery and if the prognosis is good, she can last another year.

291
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,980
Enough with all the big words.

292
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,650
You're saying she's dying?

293
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,720
Tell me.

294
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,600
She's dying?

295
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,820
What will you do with all that money?

296
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,130
You jerk! You should make some noise when you come in!

297
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,990
Aigoo. Aigoo.

298
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,580
I heard you're dying.

299
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,400
Are you going to take all that money with you?

300
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,880
Yeah, I'm gonna take it all with me. You think it's a waste?

301
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:18,070
Hey, I earned all this by myself.

302
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,680
There's no need for me to be in deep shi* because I don't have money.

303
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,230
I'm going to brag to my hubby. So, what?

304
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,930
Where do you think you're going?

305
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,260
Shut up. I'm not dying right this minute!

306
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,510
I thought you were sick. You are full of energy.

307
00:31:53,220 --> 00:32:00,040
If you're going to brag, go make more money here.

308
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,100
How can you laugh now?

309
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,850
What's the point of crying then?

310
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,580
Gang Doo.

311
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:21,340
When a person dies, do you think he goes to heaven the way he looks then?

312
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,760
I don't know. I've never died. How would I know?

313
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,510
Why?

314
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,580
It seems so unfair.

315
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,520
I'm going to see my hubby when I go to heaven.

316
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,700
He'd look so handsome at age 30.

317
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:42,600
But I'd be an old wrinkly grandma. How could I see him being so embarrassed?

318
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,850
Great.

319
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:50,380
I'm giddy. Your husband is probably flirting all over the place there.

320
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,220
You, look at you talk.

321
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,340
He's got another family already!

322
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,230
He won't even remember you since he'd be with this and that woman!

323
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,320
Even if you went there, you'd be rejected by your hubby.

324
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,130
So, don't go.

325
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,090
Don't go,

326
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,330
and stay here with me.

327
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,760
Why?

328
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,830
What?

329
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,130
Why are you following me?

330
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:15,450
Just, to see if you're okay.

331
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,280
I'm fine.

332
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
When did you come back?

333
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,400
Just now.

334
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,600
- Dinner? 
 - I ate.

335
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,400
Doesn't look like you ate!

336
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,800
Go downstairs. I just have to warm up the soup.

337
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
It's okay.

338
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Where's Sang Man?

339
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,000
Without you, the kid is...

340
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,900
I gave him some medicine and let him sleep.

341
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,420
As for rent, it's okay if it's late.

342
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,450
Don't go far and work rough jobs.

343
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,500
What kind of stench is this? Such a stink! Smells fishy!

344
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,600
Give me all your clothes and wash up!

345
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,200
Geez, the smell! How could the stench come from a human being?

346
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,800
So dirty.

347
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,090
Why aren't you going home?

348
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,000
I waited to see you.

349
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,800
Why? Have something to say?

350
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,800
- If not, forget it. 
 - I do.

351
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,100
The shopping mall.

352
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,620
When the accident happened, you saw me, right?

353
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,300
We were together, right?

354
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,000
Did you come here to ask me that?

355
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,110
When I asked you last time, why did you say no?

356
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,330
There's not much to it.

357
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,400
Not much to it?

358
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,600
Yeah.

359
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,200
What's going to change just because you pull out such a memory?

360
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,800
Forth-eight people died there. People who were injured and rescued...

361
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
There were numerous people.

362
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,500
Among them, you and me. What about it?

363
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,300
What's so special about us?

364
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,140
Then, it means nothing that you and I met?

365
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,300
I'm a nobody to you?

366
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,490
All this time...

367
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,810
Was I the only one who was excited?

368
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,200
You were bad.

369
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,250
Confusing me.

370
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,400
♫  Somehow we are  ♫

371
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,800
I have lots of annoying things going on right now.

372
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,600
I don't have time to talk about the past. Go.

373
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:47,100
♫  Do only my eyes see that?  ♫

374
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,000
Do whatever you want.

375
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,600
♫  Our footprints as we walked together  ♫

376
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,030
♫  Maybe that's why I kept liking you  ♫

377
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,300
♫  Maybe that's why I kept liking you  ♫

378
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:14,000
♫  It's an old longing to you, but  ♫

379
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,800
♫  It makes me want to lean on you  ♫

380
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,470
♫  In such a sad story  ♫

381
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,800
♫  In such a sad story  ♫

382
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,390
♫  You're beautiful comfort to me  ♫

383
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,600
♫  You're beautiful comfort to me  ♫

384
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:42,300
♫  that visited me one day  ♫

385
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,480
♫  Inside this cold story  ♫

386
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,800
♫  Inside this cold story  ♫

387
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,200
♫  You are a warm place  ♫

388
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,200
♫  You are a warm place  ♫

389
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,260
♫  The day my heart melted,  ♫

390
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,200
♫  You were by my side  ♫

391
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,570
Do you work on weekends, too?

392
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:30,770
You weren't at home. When did you change your passcode?

393
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
You should've called me.

394
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,600
Only if you'd answer.

395
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,000
Take it easy. Think of your father.

396
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,600
Working day and night. What did he gain by doing that?

397
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,800
You should enjoy your life. Fall in love.

398
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,800
By chance, do you still have feelings for Yoo Jin—

399
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,000
Mother, you just live the way you want to.

400
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,700
I'm still my father's son.

401
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,600
- But you're not his wife. 
 - Joo Won.

402
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,300
Don't go out of your way next time.

403
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,950
It's late. Go home.

404
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,920
Eat as you work.

405
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Why are you coming home so late?

406
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,680
What brings you here at this hour, Dad?

407
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,000
I came to see you.

408
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,200
- Me? 
 - You didn't come by recently.

409
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,300
As if I stopped by every day.

410
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,980
What's going on?

411
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,800
I heard you work in Wooseok-dong. Does your mom know?

412
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:11,000
I thought so. She'd go crazy if she found out.

413
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,800
If it's not important work, quit that job.

414
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,800
How can I quit the job all of a sudden?

415
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,200
Besides, it's not like I can't go there.

416
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,100
It's not a place you should go out of your way to go.

417
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,200
You have terrible memories.

418
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,900
How about you, Dad? Why do you sell noodles there? (noodles signify long life)

419
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,750
Your mom still drinks, huh?

420
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,200
Make some soup for her in the morning.

421
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,200
You're not going to see Mom?

422
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,900
She'd get upset if she saw me.

423
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,000
Don't tell her I came by.

424
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,300
Do you know what time it is? Lower the volume, Mom.

425
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,400
Speak for yourself. Do you know what time it is? You're so late.

426
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,600
You're acting strange lately.

427
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,700
You go out often and are gone for hours.

428
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,600
Is that grandma okay?

429
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,000
No.

430
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,900
Any kids?

431
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,480
Does she have anyone to look after her?

432
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,200
She does.

433
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,500
- She does? 
 - Yeah.

434
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,200
She has a really nice person.

435
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,800
He got caught anyhow.

436
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,200
♫  On some day, it's so gray  ♫

437
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,800
♫  When to, where to, why to  ♫

438
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,400
♫  It's been gone, it's somewhere  ♫

439
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:48,400
 He's not disappointed in you. He's avoiding you because he thinks he's not good enough. 

440
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,000
 His distancing himself from you is how much he treasures you. 

441
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,000
♫  You sing my song, we sing along  ♫

442
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,900
   

443
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:26,590
Do whatever you want. I'll do whatever I want to do.

444
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,800
Aren't you going?

445
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,800
What?

446
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,500
What is it?

447
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,190
What else? You always get beat up.

448
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,140
This isn't from getting punched.

449
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,050
I got injured while working.

450
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:24,140
Then don't get injured. You'll hurt.

451
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,350
You really are a busybody. Do you act like this with any old person?

452
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,600
Are you just any old person?

453
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,530
See you later.

454
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,370
Why later?

455
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,020
Yeah, do it this way.

456
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,120
This way and toward the tree.

457
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,220
You can do that.

458
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:49,040
What did Lee Gang Doo say? When is he coming back to work on-site?

459
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,340
I don't know.

460
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,560
Don't tell me you two still aren't seeing each other? You said you weren't fighting.

461
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,810
Why do I need to tell you about business between Gang Doo and me?

462
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,900
Because you two have to get along well so that what's mine isn't stolen.

463
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,620
Excuse me?

464
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:11,120
CEO Seo likes you. And I like him as I always have.

465
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,900
I'm saying let's not get needlessly tangled, you and I.

466
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,780
But I like CEO Seo too.

467
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:25,960
Every employee here likes him.

468
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,410
He's a great person.

469
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,210
So I think you don't need to be so particularly concerned with just me.

470
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:40,450
Then what about Lee Gang Doo? Is he also just a great co-worker?

471
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,750
Gang Doo is different.

472
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:53,180
When he's out of my sight, I get curious about him, worry about him, and think of him.

473
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,580
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me?

474
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:01,270
Your answer just now was enough. You may leave.

475
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,710
What are you doing?

476
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,960
Making sure no one else can have what I can't.

477
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:31,320
I've always been bad like that. But, it turns out I went through the effort for nothing.

478
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,360
What are you doing?

479
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:47,490
Getting old. I'm getting uglier and uglier.

480
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:55,350
No, you're not. You're as pretty as ever.

481
00:49:55,350 --> 00:50:00,310
Unnie, apparently the CEO and Department Head Jeong didn't just break up.

482
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:05,900
His mother and her father got remarried to each other so they became family.

483
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,770
That's how it was.

484
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:11,890
Family? If they're family then...

485
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:16,540
They're a total Romeo and Juliet. How can I win against that?

486
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:25,730


487
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,770
   

488
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,250
When did you get here?

489
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,220
Gran didn't come here?

490
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,770
Why would Mama come here?

491
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,710
I'm going nuts. Just where did she go?

492
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:13,700
Who's worried about who? You're just as rash as her. Why'd you get on that boat?

493
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,070
Did you also know that she was sick?

494
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:24,070
I had a suspicion about it for a while now and heard about it a few days ago.

495
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,670
And the hospital? She's refusing to go up until the very end?

496
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:34,600
You should have heard it all from your sister already. Disturbing the tumor could make her unable to recognize us anymore.

497
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,820
Did anyone say they wanted her to recognize them? Who cares about that!

498
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,550
So what if she loses a few memories. Shouldn't saving a person's life come first?!

499
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:49,580
Are you going to act like this in front of Mama too because you're upset? Who do you think is suffering the most right now!

500
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:59,230
I understand you're scared, but saving a person so they can remain as a shell of who they were

501
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:06,760
is us being greedy. Show her your heart only. Don't press her.

502
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,430
Must be great to be so cool about this.

503
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,610
Do what you want then. I'm going to do whatever it takes to drag her there.

504
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:22,240
Don't cross each other. Just go to her store and wait for her. She'll come back.

505
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,510
Give me one too.

506
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,900
That startled me.

507
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,630
It's not like you stop if I tell you to so just smoke your heart out.

508
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,160
Where'd you go? I searched all over for you!

509
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,590
Instead of needlessly chasing after me, go to see Moon Soo.

510
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:19,850
You're a real fool. A fool. Why are you avoiding her? Do you really have that little confidence?

511
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,500
I don't. None.

512
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,540
Why? What's wrong with you?

513
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:32,590
What do you think is wrong? Just look at me! Do I look like someone who could like anyone right now?

514
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:37,870
Did I ask about your circumstances? I asked how you felt!

515
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,810
A crazy bastard.

516
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:59,860
Even though I'm worried that you're sick, I'm a crazy bastard that keeps thinking about how if I go I'll get to see Moon Soo.

517
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,060
Looks like some good came out of me being sick.

518
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,890
It'd be better if I were more appealing.

519
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:18,800
You punk, that's not something you decide. That's for Moon Soo to decide!

520
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,880
You idiot. How dare you try to act all cool in front of me! So unlike you!

521
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:29,410
Don't be a scaredy-cat! That's the one thing that suits you the least!

522
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:36,260
That's how you should be. Yell at me like that and dote on me.

523
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,160
There are a lot of things you still need to do.

524
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,820
So let's go to the hospital tomorrow.

525
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,020
You're bothering with something useless.

526
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,330
We won't know it if it's useless or not until you go.

527
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:53,620
Go! Okay? Or I'll carry you there on my back!

528
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,370
Forget it. What good would that do anyone?

529
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,880
It's good for me! Alright?

530
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,240
I'm asking you to go because I want to be happy! Please let's go! Please, Grandma!

531
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:52,970
You were disappointed because you thought I didn't come, weren't you?

532
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,680
Where do you think you're following me?

533
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,080
Is this my first time going in? Why can't I come in?

534
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,720
You were happy to see me just now after all.

535
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,040
Me? When?

536
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:22,250
I saw your eyes getting smaller, you know. That means you were smiling.

537
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:27,270
What are you talking about "eyes getting smaller"? My eyes are just naturally small.

538
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,890
Go. I'm tired so I'm going to sleep.

539
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,390
Did you come here after seeing Grandmother?

540
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,140
Was it really hard?

541
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:49,840
Then sleep. Don't think about anything and just sleep long and hard.

542
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,470
I'll be back tomorrow.

543
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:05,620
I'll come tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that.

544
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:13,780
I'll keep coming until I don't like you.

545
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:40,320
Hyung! I brought this with me to read with you!

546
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:44,890
A book? Good job.

547
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:50,780
Are you okay? I heard you were sick.

548
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,410
Since you came back, I'm all better now.

549
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,530
That's good.

550
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:19,730
Just leave that as is. I don't like the dark.

551
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,860
It scares you?

552
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,130
Then shall I read this beside you?

553
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,160
You won't be scared if I'm with you.

554
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:36,370
Sang Man.

555
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:41,950
You have to live a longer life than me.

556
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:45,140
I don't like living a long life alone though.

557
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,240
Can't we both live long lives together?

558
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:53,170
Yeah. Let's do that.

559
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,810
Hurry and sleep, Hyung.

560
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:59,470
I'll read this to you until you fall asleep.

561
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,370
The Madame Gyeongwon hugged his back and in a nasal voice...

562
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:12,560
The texture of her body against his back...

563
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,980
He shivered.

564
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,820
Ah, only if I was 10 years younger,

565
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:21,880
I'd hold her in my arms and would love her all night through.

566
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,090
- Ah, ah, Madame—
 - Sang Man.

567
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:29,710
Are you trying to put me to sleep or not?

568
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:43,210
 Gang Doo is different. 

569
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:50,000
 When he's out of my sight, I get curious about him, worry about him, and think of him. 

570
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,000
I told you we can go another time. So early in the morning. Seriously.

571
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,590
When's another time going to be? It's already been a week.

572
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:25,210
You chew food on one side and you can't even drink hot water because your tooth is sensitive.

573
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:29,460
But I'm fine with just going to a local hospital or something. What's with all this?

574
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,900
While you're at it, get an exam.

575
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:37,080
It's strange that whenever you yell at me you complain about your jaw hurting and not your throat.

576
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,550
You really have to be cautious with your jaw.

577
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:46,490
In the past, I dislocated my jaw and didn't get it treated properly. I still suffer a lot from it even today.

578
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,260
What happened to your jaw?

579
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,830
I got hit by my uncle a lot when I was younger.

580
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,290
How can you say something like that with a smile on your face? It makes me feel bad.

581
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:57,930
Then should I say it crying?

582
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,950
It's fine now. He passed away last year.

583
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:08,990
This car was also his.

584
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,500
Take it away. It's so bland that I can't tell what the taste is.

585
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,110
You really do just hate all things healthy, don't you?

586
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,300
Pick up your spoon already. What are you doing wasting all this food?

587
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,300
Here's spinach and the quail eggs look good, too.

588
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,200
Grandmother!

589
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,600
Why are you here?

590
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,060
I called her here.

591
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:02,560
You left all of your meal, I see. Shall I open this for you?

592
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,630
I don't have an appetite right now, so later.

593
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:07,280
What the heck? When did you two get so close?

594
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,750
Be quiet. You should serve a guest.

595
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:15,020
What are you doing? Sitting still like that?

596
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,750
Are you a refugee?

597
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:21,540
They say lots of people come by when you're generous. Keep that in mind.

598
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,060
What are you doing not giving them to her?

599
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,910
Thank you.

600
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:40,120
You shouldn't be thankful to me for giving it to you.

601
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,030
I'm grateful that you enjoy the food.

602
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,770
Delicious!

603
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:05,140
Rooftop Oppa!

604
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,050
Hello!

605
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:08,430
What brings you here?

606
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:16,060
All done. Do you like the color?

607
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,640
I wish it was shinier.

608
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,060
This is good enough. Change it again tomorrow.

609
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,950
Sure.

610
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:29,760
Hey, do hers too. She looks more gloomy than me.

611
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,380
No, no. I'm fine, thanks.

612
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,740
I'm really fine though.

613
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,970
This one?

614
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,030
Let's go with this one.

615
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,780
Hyung!

616
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,660
Hello, Grandmother.

617
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:49,930
What are you all doing here?

618
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:53,720
Our artist was so dense that she didn't even know her molar cracked and she was being so stubborn.

619
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,740
I brought her here.

620
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,400
How did your molar crack?

621
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,710
Gang Doo you've gotten even more rugged looking. But even so, you still have a boyish face.

622
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:05,610
People with a gap (contrast) are charming as always.

623
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:09,250
This is my friend. Say hi.

624
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:12,760
Hello. I'm her friend, Kim Wan Jin.

625
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,490
She writes comics.

626
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:20,070
Grandmother, grandmother! Don't the two of us look the same?

627
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,680
You're a little prettier.

628
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:27,130
Really?

629
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,220
- Grandmother, your fingernails are so pretty! Unnie, did you do them for her? 
 - Yeah

630
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,260
Do you think you could do mine too?

631
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,550
Pick a color.

632
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,550
This one.

633
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:43,530
It'd be fun to change them every day.

634
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:44,960
You should pick a color too.

635
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,610
Please move.

636
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:52,560
Gang Doo's sister? You look alike. So pretty!

637
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,320
We've seen each other before, right?

638
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:03,020
My my, you've got so many grandchildren. You're very fortunate. It's great to see.

639
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,690
Yes, I really do have quite a lot of good fortune.

640
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:10,740
Act like you always have. Why are talking all nice like that?

641
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,800
Hey, you. I'm thirsty. Get me a coke.

642
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,230
You're even in a hospital and it's just cola, cola, cola. Such a child. A real child.

643
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,260
Here's your cola. It's only for today.

644
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,150
Is it refreshing?

645
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,020
I like cola too.

646
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,500
You need to live intimately with a man too.

647
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,990
Other people are here, too, you know!

648
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,370
She likes it. She likes it but says this.

649
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,480
I know.

650
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:55,380
Gran once said, "Living is a repetition of regrets and failures."

651
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:06,560
I sarcastically asked, "Then what's the point of living?"

652
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:16,600
Gran spoke again saying, "It's to make even better regrets and mistakes."

653
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:22,730
"So don't be a scaredy-cat."

654
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:36,770


655
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:24,890
♫  I don’t want to say anything
 Just want to look at you  ♫

656
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:31,640
♫  I don’t want to forget your face
 Even for a single day  ♫

657
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,480
   

658
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,950
   

659
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:36,990
 Until the bus comes. 

660
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:38,320
 What are you doing? 

661
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,590
 - Let's stay like this. 
 - You're heavy. 

662
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:42,330
 Endure it. 

663
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:45,670
 You eat so prettily. 

664
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:47,700
 Huh? 

665
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,590
 You're working so hard at being cute. 

666
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:52,720
♫  I didn’t know it would be this deep  ♫

667
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,620
 Moon Soo, look at me. Hyung bought me clothes. 

668
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:59,490
♫  My hands that hold you
  didn’t know they trembled this much  ♫

669
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:04,660
 Do it. Finish off what you were doing. 

670
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:10,620
♫  This heart, to me  ♫

671
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,610
♫  Do you know how big of a miracle it is?  ♫

672
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:17,280
 Revive her! Didn't you guys study to help people live? 

673
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,450
 Why are you staying still? 

674
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:23,090
 Let go of me and do something, you jerks! 

675
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:28,800
 When a person dies, I heard they go back to the time when they were prettiest. 

676
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,330
 So, don't worry. 

677
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:37,230
 Don't pretend not to know me later. 

678
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:40,620
 Cuss me out. 

679
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,970
 You can't pretend not to know me. 

680
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:50,590
♫  My hopes inside keep growing  ♫

681
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:55,470
♫  Please let me breathe with this person  ♫
