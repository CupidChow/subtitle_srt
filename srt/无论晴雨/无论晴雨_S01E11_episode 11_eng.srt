 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,600
Vitals, (BP) 70 over 40. Continuing to drop.

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Her pupils are nonresponsive and she's unable to breathe on her own.

4
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,200
- Intubate first and page Chief.
 - Yes, I understand.

5
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
What? What's going on? What happened?

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Oppa, Oppa! Wait. There is no use in you following her.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,100
Jae Yeong.

00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,100
 Jeong xxxx Hee (Neurosurgery) Surgery in process 

9
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,870
Jeong Sook Hee
  Name: Jeong Sook Hee, Female, 75, Physician: Lee Soo Young, Nurse: Yoon Jeong Hee, Hospitalized Jan 9th, 2018 

10
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,500
Sook Hee.

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,400
Oh my. Even her name is pretty, Grandma.

12
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
It's alright.

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,300
It will be alright.

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,800
Because the pressure in her brain was too high, we weren't able to stop the bleeding in time.

15
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,900
The edema was also severe, so the surgery spot...

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,200
When she was admitted, she signed the request form refusing medical procedures that are not related to treating her condition.

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,800
If she doesn't wake up, Chief will evaluate her condition

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
and remove the respirator.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,100
With whose permission?

20
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,750
Can't you see that she's breathing?

21
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,600
She's still alive.

22
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,300
She's not able to breathe on her own. It's the respirator—

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,300
Try to touch her. She's warm.

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,600
Treat her. She even cursed at me yesterday. Revive her.

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Visitation is not allowed here. Leave.

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,400
- What are you doing?
 - I am sorry.

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
- Leave.
 - Don't you take off that respirator.

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,000
You shouldn't be like this here. Please leave.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,900
- Oppa, let's talk outside.
 - I am not leaving!

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,950
Treat her with me here where I can see it.

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,100
Revive her! Didn't you guys study how to help people live?

32
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,200
But why are you staying still?

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
Let go of me and do something, you jerks!

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,100
Grandma! Let's leave. Get up.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
Don't touch her. Don't you dare touch her!

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,700
You'll be in trouble if you remove the respirator.

37
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,100
Let go of me. You jerks!

38
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,600
Let go of me. I said let go of me!

39
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you wish to die?

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,600
Gang Doo.

41
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,700
Don't do it. If you continue like this, you won't be able to see Grandma.

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,170
If he causes another scene, he won't be able to set foot inside.

43
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,400
He won't cause a scene.

44
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Please give him some time.

45
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,300
Go.

46
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,900
Go.

47
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,320
Earlier,

48
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,510
I didn't tell you something because I was mad.

49
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,620
When a person dies,

50
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,430
I heard they go back to the time when they were prettiest.

51
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,000
So, don't worry.

52
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,450
Your husband

53
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,800
will be totally bewitched by you.

54
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,900
I should be worried about me,

55
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,000
that I will be totally enticed by you, Grandma.

56
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,550
Later,

57
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,130
if I try to make a pass at you,

58
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,590
don't pretend not to know me.

59
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,840
Cuss me out.

60
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,790
So I will recognize you, Grandma.

61
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,600
You can't pretend not to know me.

♫  Your lights in your heart  ♫

 Episode 11 

75
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,600
Hyung just keeps on sleeping. He sleeps all day long.

76
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Should I wake him up?

77
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,000
No, just let him sleep.

78
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,600
He didn't get any sleep preparing for the funeral. So it's better for him to sleep like this.

79
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,300
- Still—
 - If he wakes up, please give him this for me, Sang Man.

80
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,600
Hyung.

81
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
Tell me when you're hungry.

82
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,600
I have many yummy things.

83
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,190
Okay?

84
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
Unni.

85
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,340
Unni!

86
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,200
Are you leaving after this project is finished?

87
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,400
Pardon?

88
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Team Leader told me to come back to the Design Team beginning next week.

89
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,000
Are you quitting?

90
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,540
Yes?

91
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,200
- You'll be able to finish the entire model by next week, right?
 - Yes.

92
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,800
You've worked hard.

93
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,110
Then, what about me?

94
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,220
This is the draft proposal for the memorial park design.

95
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,480
There is nothing special, but you could use it as a reference.

96
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
Pardon?

97
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,910
We just have space. The design hasn't been properly planned yet.

98
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,190
Try to do it yourself.

99
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,540
Me? I only have a preliminary license.

100
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,190
That's why you need the experience.

101
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,190
Still, how can I do this by myself?

102
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,510
There is a first for everyone.

103
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,030
Tell me whenever you have any difficulties. I will help you.

104
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,420
I am trying hard now so I could at least be a good sunbae (senior).

105
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,500
Still, I don't think this is right.

106
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,040
It's too much of a burden. I feel bad towards you too, CEO.

107
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,130
- After I finish this model—
 - There is no reason for you to feel bad towards me.

108
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,230
I should be the one apologizing.

109
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,440
The company (Cheongyoo) will advertise the fact that the memorial park has been designed by a survivor of the collapse.

110
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,350
They will be able to justify themselves and reduce unnecessary misunderstandings.

111
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,650
That will be burdensome for you.

112
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,480
However, at those times, I was able to get good outcomes in my case.

113
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,940
Gang Doo. Eat and sleep.

114
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,320
Something might happen if you just wallow in your despair.

115
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,450
At least eat a bite. Oh?

116
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,210
Where did he go?

117
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,980
 Outstanding bond
 Attorney Hwang Jeong Seok! 

118
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,310
Here it is.

119
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,100
 Completion of registration transfer
 Gifting of land agreement 

120
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,770
Sign here.

121
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,110
 Donor: Jeong Sook Hee
 Recipient: Lee Gang Doo 

122
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,840
You've hit gold. She said you need to sell it to him.
  Cheong Yoo Builders' Jeong Yoo Taek  

123
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,340
She said they have already agreed on the price.

124
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,910
Aren't you taking this?

125
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,130
I already know who he is.

126
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,250
She said that once you receive the money, you should pay off your debt first.

127
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,670
Then open an account under your name and put the rest there.

128
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,000
She said you shouldn't keep the cash with you.

129
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,100
What? She's dead?

130
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,330
Not too long ago, she ate greasy foods without any problem. How did she die all of a sudden?

131
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,140
What are you going to do about the contract?

132
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,410
That's why she should have handed it over when I said I would give her more money for it.

133
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,870
Why would she lie so that the property would end up with someone else?

134
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,840
I guess there was something more important than money.

135
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,720
Hey, there is nothing more important than money in life. As you get older, you need money even more.

136
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,440
Did you speak like that to her too?

137
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,290
Of course I did. I almost had her then, surely.

138
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:12,490
- Hurry, since it's not a good idea to delay this any longer. If not, the legal team—
 - Have you lost your mind?

139
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,550
The board of directors is out to get me as things stand. I will take care of it.

140
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,650
She didn't have any children. Who did she give it to? It's a hassle.

141
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,690
You'll surely be able to take care of it on your own with such talk.

142
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,880
If someone died, you should at least mourn for them first.

143
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,730
If you can't do it with your heart, at least do it with your head.

144
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,530
Everyone dies after being born. We're all terminal.

145
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,710
Does anyone live forever?

146
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,590
 Yoo Ra Restaurant 

147
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,030
Why are you here? Where is Mama?

148
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,780
She died.

149
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,410
When?

150
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,370
Is it all paid then?

151
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,720
End of transaction.

152
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,390
Wait, what about the store? Will you run it?

153
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,620
He's not here?

154
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,900
He's not. I don't know when he left. He didn't even eat.

155
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,840
Mom. Oh, Moon Soo.

156
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,080
Hyung wasn't at Grandma's store either.

157
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,700
Then where did he go? Is he going to cause more trouble?

158
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,600
I know you.

159
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,270
You won't be able to find him by just wandering around without a plan.

160
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,620
You're more foolish than you look.

161
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,920
I've looked every possible place that he might be, but he wasn't there.

162
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,160
He doesn't answer his phone either.

163
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,680
- If something bad were to happen to Gang Doo—
 - Why would something bad happen to Gang Doo?

164
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
Pardon?

165
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,230
You don't know Gang Doo yet.

166
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,330
Don't worry about him. He won't fall apart so easily like that.

167
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,630
My molars on this side are dental implants.

168
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,310
- They came loose when I was beaten.
 - Pardon?

169
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,330
Has it been ten years now?

170
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,270
I met the wrong man and was nearly beaten to death.

171
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,530
I ran away because I was afraid I really was going to die.

172
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:29,160
When I was getting beat up by him, no one would stop him.

173
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,150
People only believed his words when he said I was a gold digger who fled with his money.

174
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,780
I thought I would die a horrible death there.

175
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,280
 Don't hit her. 

176
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,030
A boy stood and yelled. Trembling in fear.

177
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:57,710
If you hit her again, I will hit you too, Mr.

178
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,290
I will hit you too, Mr.

179
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:07,820
That scrawny boy, against a man who is three times bigger than him. No way that would work!

180
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,940
Both of us were beaten to a pulp.

181
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,770
Is that something to laugh about?

182
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,590
Yeah. I like it when I think about that time.

183
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:27,050
While he was getting punched to a pulp, Gang Doo wouldn't let go of the brick in his hand.

184
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:33,160
So I asked Gang Doo. Why did you hold onto it when you can't even punch him? Guess what he said.

185
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,670
 Because I was scared. 

186
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,920
He wanted to run away but if he had done that, I really would have been beaten to death.

187
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,580
He said he would only be able to endure it if he held onto that piece of brick.

188
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,070
Gang Doo is that kind of person.

189
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,950
So he won't do anything you're worried about.

190
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,770
Trust him and wait.

191
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,670
 Gang Doo  
♫  I open my eyes,   ♫

192
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,400
 Gang Doo 

193
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,510
♫  I see you  ♫

194
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:24,110
♫  I wave my hand and erase you away  ♫

195
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,270
 Unni Wan Jin  
♫  No matter how much I try,   ♫

196
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,410
♫  even if I do that again  ♫

197
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,010
What are you up to?

198
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,300
 I was waiting for your call so we could have dinner together. Why? 

199
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,070
♫  All the memories that pour into me,   ♫

200
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,300
♫  Numerous words that pop into my head  ♫

201
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,220
♫  How can I hold you back?  ♫

202
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,170
♫  I'll be here. I'll be here  ♫

203
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,130
♫  I held on until it overflowed  ♫

204
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,270
♫  I held on until my heart was full  ♫

205
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,290
♫  How can I hold you back  ♫

206
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:16,020
♫  I'll be here, I'll be here  ♫

207
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,740
 Dear Gang Doo 

208
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,360
 Go to Attorney Hwang Jeong Seok's office and follow his instructions. 

209
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:42,310
 Myungmoon Bio at Goyang-dong Commercial District Building 2 Unit 301, pay ₩187,000 ($187) for medicine. 

210
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,770
 Sangmoon Pharmaceuticals at Chorae-dong Seongil Arcade Unit 105, 

211
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:53,980
 pay ₩384,000 ($384) for medicine and IV solutions. 

212
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,070
 Pay ₩220,000 ($220) for medicine to Mr. Park at Moonseon-dong. 

213
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,270
 Hyeonjin Commercial District Unit 101,  

214
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,950
 collect ₩400,000 ($400) for rent from Boksu's dad. 

215
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:12,890
 If Mr. Shin of Flower Snack Shop is late with the rent again, tell him you'll deduct it from the security deposit. 

216
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:18,320
 Collect ₩320,000 ($320) every month from Mr. Kim of KP Engineering and  

217
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,760
  ₩30,000 ($30) for Soo Ah's mom's medicine. 

218
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,560
 Collect ₩20,000 ($20) from Nampheung (Vietnamese), from Daegyeong Micro 

219
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,860
 10. Stop by and clean every few days. 

220
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,230
 Staring at the phone. Aren't you going to do what I asked you to do? 

221
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,560
 Move the boxes up. 

222
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,960
 Hey, hey, hey! Wipe off all the dust well. 

223
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,200
 Remove the water from the mop well. 

224
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,680
 Keep it clean even if there are no customers 

225
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,110
 This is the last resort for people who have nowhere to turn. Do you understand? 

226
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,400
Do you order me around even after your death?

227
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,600
You said the person who caused a scene at the ICU was your older brother, right?

228
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:02,310
It could happen if he's tired, but you never know. So ask him to get tested.

229
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,430
What? Is this mine?

230
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,940
Thank you for the food.

231
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,140
You said let's eat something delicious and it's here?

232
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,450
I crave soup since it's been cold lately.

233
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,760
Why are you so busy lately?

234
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,420
You don't even stop by my studio. Are you dating?

235
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,360
Unni! Is this the time to talk about those things?

236
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,250
What about it? Gang Doo must feel so lonely.

237
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,240
This is the time you two should be dating.

238
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,960
If you can't because of this and that, those are just excuses. Just date him.

239
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,080
Not yet.

240
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:08,210
Why not? You're the one who said you want to stay by Gang Doo's side. Have you forgotten?

241
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:13,060
It's still true but I will bear it.

242
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,540
If he's with me, Gang Doo will continue to pretend he's alright.

243
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,980
He should mourn now.

244
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,530
That way he will be comforted later.

245
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,460
We weren't able to do that

246
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,380
because we were angry and apologetic toward one another.

247
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,320
Don't worry about what Wan Jin said.

248
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,310
I am not dating.

249
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,400
It's good if you date.

250
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,620
It would be even better if you're not dating him.

251
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,790
It's cold. Get going.

252
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,570
- Work hard. 
- Thank you.

253
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,020
 - Welcome.
 - Hello. 

254
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,450
How much is a donut twist?

255
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,370
Thank you.

256
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,200
 Milky Way 

257
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,250
Moon Soo.

258
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,350
 Milky Way 

259
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,370
 Hyung left earlier. 

260
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,050
What's all this?

261
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,040
What do you mean? It's everything you'll eat.

262
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,810
- Moon Soo shops for groceries and brings them to us so you can eat them, Hyung.
 - What?

263
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:29,740
She came every day, but she told me not to tell you.

264
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,860
Oops, I told you.

265
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,330
Geez, you didn't even know where the food you ate came from.

266
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:42,230
Why are you just nibbling? Here is the sausage, your favorite.

267
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,640
- Right.
 - Eat a lot.

268
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,420
Hyung.

269
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,050
Here is the bread with cream. Open your mouth.

270
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,510
You don't have to pay for food for this month, alright?

271
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,720
You like dumplings, right? Here are kimchi dumplings.

272
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,740
Hey!

273
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,090
What are you doing?

274
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,690
- Gang Doo!
 - Hyung!

275
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,780
Look at his temper.

276
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,700
Why are you here?

277
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,620
To catch the bus.

278
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,250
How about you?

279
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,560
Did you go somewhere?

280
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,550
Did you eat?

281
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,040
No.

282
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,580
Good. Shall we eat together then?

283
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,230
No.

284
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,010
Then do you want to watch me eat?

285
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,680
That won't happen. Since it won't happen,

286
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,900
don't buy these things from now on.

287
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,620
Rather, don't ever come again.

288
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,040
You're really a fool.

289
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,040
Don't come. Really, don't come.

290
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,090
Why are you sitting in the dark?

291
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,280
I guess it must be hard to make a living.

292
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,880
That's why there are only food shows and people eating on TV.

293
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,360
Why didn't you set the table properly?

294
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,320
- Mom. Did you finish all of this?
 - Yeah.

295
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,050
Still, I feel empty. No matter how much I eat, I feel empty.

296
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:22,100
You should have reheated them. They were cold.

297
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,020
I am sorry.

298
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,190
About what?

299
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,660
I am sorry for making you eat alone.

300
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,390
It's nothing new.

301
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:51,180
As you get older, you're alone more and more.

302
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,160
Then you should have just lived with him.

303
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,760
What?

304
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,750
Why did you marry Dad if you're going to live apart like this?

305
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,320
I didn't know this would happen.

306
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,710
I shouldn't have brought it up first if it was going to be like this.

307
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,950
What?

308
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,840
Marriage.

309
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,670
You did?

310
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:25,350
I don't know why I did that. I hate him and can't stand him.

311
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,420
Yet you're telling me to get married.

312
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,050
Yeah.

313
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,910
Get married. At least give it a try.

314
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:43,880
Even though I say I hate him, I think it was better when I was with him.

315
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,310
What is that?

316
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,200
That?

317
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,000
Don't buy these things from now on.

318
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,790
Rather, don't ever come again.

319
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,340
Seriously,

320
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,250
I am just letting you off the hook this time.

321
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,000
Dear Gang Doo.

322
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,580
 10. Stop by and clean every few days 

323
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,850
 With everything you got, be happy 

324
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,500
I can't do this, Granny.

325
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,770
You get to work on an independent project? It hasn't been that long since you started working here.

326
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,300
Are you talented or are you talented in something else?

327
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,700
Women have it so easy at times like this.

328
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:45,500
Go along with the CEO's mood and smile at him a few times, then you walk away with a project right away.

329
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,400
- Team Leader. 
 - What?

330
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,900
You're insulting the CEO, not me.

331
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,600
The reason the CEO gave me this project...

332
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,800
I'm sure it's not as low as you think.

333
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,200
What? What did I say?

334
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,500
You have a tendency to tolerate things when you're not sure.

335
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,600
Listen carefully. Moon Soo.

336
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,700
Have some. It's a tea that your grandmother gave me last time.

337
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,700
She gave it to me saying I should drink it when I couldn't sleep and struggled. But it looks like you need it more.

338
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,600
At her age, she was still very healthy.

339
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,300
Why do you bring up her age now?

340
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,700
If you lived a long time, is it okay to die?

341
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,300
Is there such a thing as good death in this world?

342
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,300
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

343
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,200
Well... I didn't come here to talk about that. Never mind.

344
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,300
What are you building here?

345
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,500
It's near the retirement homes.

346
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,700
It's closest to the road, so the VIP parking lot will be built there.

347
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,300
Perfect.

348
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,500
We can transfer the memorial park to this spot, right?

349
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,100
If I bypass the parking lot entrance, it is possible.

350
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,900
But the retirement homes... it costs 1.2 billion won ($1.2 million) per person to move in.

351
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,600
It's the main business for Cheongyu. They won't approve the permit.

352
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,270
That's why it will be in the back of R&amp;D Building where there aren't many pedestrians...

353
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,300
They wanted to build it half-hearted and hide it.

354
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,800
In any case, you're saying it's possible as long as you get the approval from Cheongyoo, right?

355
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,100
What are you doing right now?

356
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,800
I don't know for sure either. I don't know.

357
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,240
But when I come back, please help me out.

358
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,600
It's bitter. It must be really good for you.

359
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,900
Scared me.

360
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,700
You told me not to come here. Why did you come then?

361
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,700
I didn't come to see you.

362
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,600
Then, you weren't going to see me having come all the way here?

363
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,360
Work. Don't mind me.

364
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,150
How can I not mind you?

365
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:54,030
The memorial park design. The CEO gave it to me to work on.

366
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,050
Great.

367
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:02,050
You started it. You can't get yourself out alone.

368
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,040
We're going to do it together, okay?

369
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,530
Excuse me.

370
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,740
I was going to call you anyway.

371
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,550
Let's go.

372
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,850
To where?

373
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:36,050
Where else? We have a lot to talk about.

374
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,110
Let's go then. Even though I don't know what you're talking about.

375
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,750
What's going on? Did she get sick of eating good food?

376
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,050
Why is the director acting that way toward Gang Doo Oppa?

377
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,650
Unni, shouldn't you follow them?

378
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,050
He's doing that on purpose for me to see him.

379
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,050
Oh, my Unni, what's with this confidence?

380
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:09,250
The two of them left so happy.

381
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:14,650
His eyes. His eyes didn't smile.

382
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,250
Only his mouth smiled.

383
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,920
I catch him all the time.

384
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,250
I just got caught to be used, huh?

385
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:50,250
Stay five minutes longer before you go. It'd look funny if you go now.

386
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,850
You're too obvious.

387
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:57,950
Ha Moon Soo doesn't seem like the type of person who'd misunderstand and have a change of heart over things like this.

388
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:05,050
If I don't do this, I don't think I can leave that place.

389
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:10,050
I almost brought Moon Soo out with me.

390
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,850
Thanks for getting caught with me.

391
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:18,950
You're attractive. I like it more because you don't seem to know that.

392
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:23,850
Don't fall for me. My situation is complicated as is.

393
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:27,650
I might fall for you if I see you longer. I'd better get going.

394
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,050
It was true about having something to say to you.

395
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:37,860
The land Cheongyu is trying to purchase. You still haven't met the owner, right?

396
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,850
- Assistant. 
 - Yes?

397
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,450
Water.

398
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:13,250
What are you doing? What don't you like now?

399
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:18,250
The pose. Isn't it a bit awkward?

400
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:22,650
What are you saying? All this is my know-how that comes out of my experience.

401
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:27,250
Is this possible? Are you sure you've done this?

402
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,250
I mean, like this.

403
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,750
See? It's weird.

404
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:42,650
Then... Then, what do you want me to do?

405
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:50,250
First, wrap around the neck and stroke the shoulder with the other hand.

406
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:55,850
Come down slowly, hold the hand.

407
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,350
Ah, right.

408
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,650
Here.

409
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,250
What is it?

410
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,350
My first paycheck was bigger than I thought.

411
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,450
It's a gift.

412
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:26,050
If you do this, it's like I'm taking the money away.

413
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:31,250
When we went to the New Year party for the webtoon artists last week? When you skydived using the VR,

414
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,850
you were having so much fun.

415
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,650
Yeah, I had fun.

416
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,850
Thanks.

417
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:22,370
We have to begin the reinforcement work as we get rid of the waste in order to shorten our timeline.

418
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:28,410
When you say reinforcement, you're saying you want to bury more beams, right?

419
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,500
I feel like I'm looking at myself.

420
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:47,450
I'm talking about you. Looking at someone who's not interested in you. You seem like me.

421
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,950
If they hurry, it will be completed this week. Then, as planned, the construction—

422
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,850
Are you like this with Ha Moon Soo, too?

423
00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:00,250
You can only talk about work when you're face-to-face with her?

424
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:06,250
So, you gave the memorial park design to someone who has no practical experience.

425
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,050
Isn't it too much for her?

426
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,650
She's qualified. She'll do a good job.

427
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,350
You want to believe that.

428
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,750
In the end, you're playing the Daddy-Long-Legs.

429
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:22,550
Continuing to do this with you, it makes me feel uncomfortable.

430
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:29,250
I guess, Ha Moon Soo must feel the same way with me.

431
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,250
Is that something you can say in front of me?

432
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,650
Are you saying this on purpose to hurt my pride?

433
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,650
Yoo Jin.

434
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,830
Do I seem like I'm being stubborn for no reason?

435
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,070
You don't seem yourself. Why are you acting this way?

436
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,890
I thought I'd be different, too.

437
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:55,280
I didn't think I'd be swayed by my emotions like other people. I tried so hard.

438
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,990
But I'm not confident.

439
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,170
If you want to get rid of me, don't be like this.

440
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,740
You've completed the vendor bidding, right?

441
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,980
You really didn't call me because you missed me?

442
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,140
I told you someone asked me to.

443
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,050
How dare they order me to come and go?

444
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,030
You'll know when you go inside.

445
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,870
What's this?

446
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:39,810
I'm not sure. I'm sure you'll know when you talk to him.

447
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,820
 Gifting of land agreement 

448
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,050
I didn't know we'd get involved in this way.

449
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,770
The contract you gave to my granny last time.

450
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,510
You know I'm offering a much higher price than the market—

451
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:18,810
I looked into it and it looks like the land is extremely important. I can't sell it this way.

452
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,610
I knew you were stubborn, but you're also brazen on top of that.

453
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:28,540
I'm not brazen. I'm just not easy. I don't care if I don't sell this land.

454
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,910
But there's this thing called Disposition of Construction Suspension.

455
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:43,440
The first trial alone will take six months. If it goes to the Supreme Court, it will take three years.

456
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,380
It's a lot of money even if you shut down the construction site just for a day. Isn't that right?

457
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:54,460
You're the one who knows about that best.

458
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,560
I'll give you 1.5 times more than this. No more than that.

459
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,980
I wasn't talking about money.

460
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,070
What's more important than money here?

461
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:11,100
The contract condition. I have a request.

462
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,030
Did your talk go over well?

463
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:22,130
Go.

464
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,960
I'll go now.

465
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,670
You're on the same side, right?

466
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:50,600
- What do you mean? 
 - What were you doing at that old storefront that was about to collapse last time?

467
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,320
What did you plot with that grandma and that a**hole?

468
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,480
It's not like that.

469
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:03,430
She left behind that golden property to a guy who's not related to her at all. You want me to believe that?

470
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:04,960
Was she senile?

471
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,060
Stop it.

472
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:10,260
She should've died quietly if she was going to die. Why did she have to give it to a guy like that? So annoying—

473
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,670
I said stop it!

474
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:20,280
If you talk about my Mama that way once more...

475
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,070
What's wrong with you?

476
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,790
I wasn't denigrating that grandma or anything.

477
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:34,660
When you get old people are all the same.

478
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,480
What do you mean same?

479
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,270
People are different.

480
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:51,410
Thousands, tens of thousands, hundred thousands. No matter how many people there are,

481
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,800
there's only one Mama to me. Only one person.

482
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,030
Only one.

483
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,770
Welcome.

484
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,380
Udon please.

485
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,350
All right.

486
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:45,470
 Things you can't change no matter how hard you try,
 just leave them alone. Don't try so hard. 

487
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:51,540
 Sad and painful things. They're always with us. We have to accept it. What else can we do? 

488
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:16,030
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

489
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,840
You came.

490
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,650
Drinking cola again?

491
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,500
There's nothing better than this for thirst.

492
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,640
Is this everything?

493
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,510
Of course this is everything. Am I going to the hospital to live there?

494
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:16,360
No, you're not.

495
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,870
Are you scared?

496
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:31,530
Of course, I'm scared. They're opening up my head. Think about it.

497
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:34,070
How painful do you think it would be?

498
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,570
- If you're doing this by force because of me—
 - That's your problem.

499
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:43,770
Why would I open up my head by force because of you?

500
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,100
Straighten out your face.

501
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,490
- If you're going to look that sad, let's just forget about this— 
 - Ah, n-no!

502
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:55,540
All right. Geez, you and your temper.

503
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,300
Satisfied?

504
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,490
Satisfied.

505
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:11,400
By chance... If I die without saying goodbye—

506
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,480
Geez, why are you saying such an unfortunate thing?

507
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,860
Hear me out.

508
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:23,470
I won't ever get tired of waiting for you so take your time coming to me.

509
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:24,590
Don't hurry over.

510
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:30,960
I don't want to. You go last. Or else, I'll become more rebellious.

511
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,880
- Without you, who's going to tell me to live a good life? 
 - Hey, hey.

512
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,050
Other people's advice, it's the most useless thing in the world.

513
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,850
Don't ever ask other people about your affairs.

514
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:47,360
Don't go crazy because you can't have your own way being afraid of what other people think.

515
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,730
You live the way you want to. Got it?

516
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:56,200
How about what you just said? Isn't this advice?

517
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,250
This is an order.

518
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,170
 You know the mart behind my store? 

519
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,820
 As for cat food, don't spend your own money. Go there and get whatever you want from there. 

520
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,050
 It's one thing if I hadn't become attached to them from the get-go. 

521
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:43,670
 Once you're attached to them, you should feed them as long as you can. What else can you do? 

522
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,690
 Please don't worry. 

523
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:51,130
 This isn't easy to do though. Gang Doo does it one day. Ma Ri does it another day. 

524
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,890
We take turns every day.

525
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:58,140
You can do it on Wednesdays.

526
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:03,900
And it's dangerous at night so be sure to go with Gang Doo.

527
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,830
Understand?

528
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,370
I was reminded of Grandma seeing this.

529
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,470
How about you...

530
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,310
Why did you come?

531
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:05,470
Grandma's things. They were left at the hospital.

532
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,430
This, too.

533
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,690
Our mama. She's got such a consistent taste.

534
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,690
Sit here.

535
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,590
It's so sweet! What's this?

536
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,250
 Brownie Cookies 
 Did Grandma speak very good English?

537
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm sure she did. She was a popular singer at the US military base in her youth.

538
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,660
Look how she loved hamburgers.

539
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:35,940
That's not true. She doesn't like the US at all.

540
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:40,520
She said she was the last surviving guerrilla warfare soldier on Jiri Mountain.

541
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:45,750
She had a cool gun on her and he had more than 100 subordinate soldiers under her.

542
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,740
How about her selling medicine? I thought she worked in medical—

543
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:53,870
It's illegal. Without a license. She used to be a mean loan shark.

544
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:59,910
It's true that she became an orphan during the Korean war and lived on the US military base.

545
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:03,140
But she wasn't a singer, she was a medic.

546
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:08,960
Her husband was a guerrilla fighter and died of tuberculosis without receiving treatment.

547
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,940
Mar... marque?

548
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:14,360
So, she became a loan shark to make money.

549
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,040
With that money, people like us who can't afford to go to the hospital...

550
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,980
Forget it. Who cares about the past? Mama is still Mama.

551
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:25,780
That's right. Grandma said we shouldn't be chained by our past.

552
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:34,940
Being here like this, I feel like Mama is still in that room.

553
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:47,320
 At that moment, it seemed as if Grandma was still alive. 

554
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,670
 It's because she left behind so much for us. 

555
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:07,310
 But... There is deep sadness that no one can console. 

556
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,140
Go out first. I'll be right there.

557
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:44,280
Um... I'm his younger sister just in words. I only see him three to four times a year.

558
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,570
Did Oppa tell you he's hurting anywhere?

559
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:53,710
No. Ah... the medicine... He does take some medication.

560
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,450
What kind of medication?

561
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:59,350
He said it's a painkiller. It's blue.

562
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,410
I'm not too sure though.

563
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:09,320
Why? Is Gang Doo sick?

564
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:15,020
I'm sure he's hurting. My oppa almost died in that accident.

565
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,450
You might know better than me.

566
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:26,330
So, please don't bring up that accident with my oppa.

567
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:29,360
He spent several days with a dead body...

568
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,750
It's painful to remember those things.

569
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:38,210
What? What are you saying?

570
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:40,930
Oppa never told you?

571
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:50,280
You know, can you bring me the medicine that my oppa takes?

572
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:01,370
Why didn't you leave? Go.

573
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:03,470
I'll go.

574
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,740
I ask of you.

575
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,040
Let's go. I'll take you back.

576
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,840
Why are you acting like this? Am I a kid?

577
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,600
Go.

578
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:29,400
That unni doesn't seem to know anything.

579
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,200
- About what? 
 - The shopping mall.

580
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,610
Didn't you tell her how you got out of there?

581
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:39,820
Forget it. There's no benefit in knowing that.

582
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,680
Taxi!

583
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:50,270
Call me when you arrive.

584
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,880
 Hey! Survivor! 

585
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,440
Student, you have to stay awake. Hold on for a little longer.

586
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:22,540
There's... a person in there.

587
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:26,710
Over there. Hyung.

588
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:30,970
Please rescue Hyung.

589
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,000
Over here!

590
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,410
What? Did you find him?

591
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,850
Didn't he say he was alive?

592
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:55,600
I think he's been dead for quite some time.

593
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:40,240
 When I'm not around, don't take medication recklessly. 

594
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:46,140
 Today is the last day. Your pain won't go away just because you take this. 

595
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:50,640
 It will hide the pain and your body won't even recognize that it's in pain later. 

596
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,650
 You'll ruin your body later. 

597
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,440
 I'm going to sleep more. 

598
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,420
 You need to say, "It hurts" when you're hurting. Do you understand what I'm saying? 

599
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:12,670
What are you doing?

600
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,010
Go.

601
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:23,940
I said go.

602
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,340
I don't want to.

603
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,820
Just go. Let me be alone.

604
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:36,660
You were alone all this time. Not anymore.

605
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:43,490
You're acting strangely. You've never talked about Grandma straight out.

606
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:47,410
When other people talked about her, you were the only one quiet.

607
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,730
What about it?

608
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:52,210
It means you're suffering so much that you can't even talk about her.

609
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:57,780
I just don't have anything to say. I'm fine, so go.

610
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:01,830
I won't go. You don't seem fine.

611
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:04,670
Don't embarrass me. Please go.

612
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:11,330
When I was acting dumb and idiotic, you saw me like that by my side.

613
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:16,730
I want to be by your side.

614
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:20,920
Go. Please.

615
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:31,050

If you don't leave now...

I won't let go of this hand.

 Just Between Lovers 

623
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,240
 Why do you look like that? 

624
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,540
 Ha Moon Soo must be so happy. I'm envious. 

625
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:41,170
 I'll go head on with it. So, you decide whether you'll retreat or move forward. 

626
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:44,650
 You two are together constantly. Of course, you're starting to pay attention to him. 

627
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:47,120
 It's not like that. 

628
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,960
 I'm going crazy because all I see is his good side. 

629
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,610
 Just date him if you're drawn to him. There's not much to it once you get involved. 

630
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:57,520
 - You eat so prettily. 
 - Huh? 

631
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,180
 You're working so hard at being so cute. 

632
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,290
 The young kids look so great so happy together. 

633
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:06,880
 Please don't tell Mom. She won't like it. 

634
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,540
 How many people in this world could make you smile like this? 

635
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,620
 Unni, the medicine you just took. What color is it? 

636
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:17,360
 The medicine that Gang Doo takes is blue. 

637
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,070
 Is that important? 

638
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,600
 I wish it wasn't important. 

639
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,420
♫  When we think of each other with all our hearts  ♫
