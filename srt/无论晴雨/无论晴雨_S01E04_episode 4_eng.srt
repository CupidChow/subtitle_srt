1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,010


2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,160
Bulldog Mansion.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,500
What?

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,140
Don't you know Bulldog Mansion?

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,150
I don't know.

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,680
Don't try to change the subject and answer my question.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,560
You really don't know?

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,360
I don't know.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,840
Fine then.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,020
 Hey, where are you? There is a traffic jam in the entry. There are piles of trucks waiting— 

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,120
Yes, I will be there.

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,070
 Episode 4 

13
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,520
You're getting on my nerves. Aren't you going to work?

14
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,510
I will get lost to avoid getting on your nerves. So please answer the question.

15
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,120
About what? You have to ask a proper question for me to answer.

16
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,020
- Here.
 - Was I here during the collapse? Is that your question?

17
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,920
No, happy now?

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,790
It's weird how you answer so easily like that.

19
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,810
- Don't be like that—
 - Why do you ask when you won't even believe my answer?

20
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,540
Coming to see me unannounced and stirring a person until you hear the answer you want. That's a form of violence too.

21
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,240
Do you know that?

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,790
So let's say I was here like how you want it.

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,420
If that's the case, I must be feeling really shi**y then.

24
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,310
But why do you ask?

25
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,460
Just because you want to know?

26
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,160
Out of curiosity?

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,220
You treat other people's unhappiness as if it means nothing, but you can't hold in your curiosity.

28
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,590
You're a bad person.

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,690
- Ms. Moon Soo.

30
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,000
Didn't you say you could only come in by afternoon today?

31
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,520
Please move the car. Trucks go in and out of here.

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,820
Let's work. Work. Don't mind about other people's business.

33
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,020
Go back and move the car. Get in.

34
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,960
I said go. Move the car.

35
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,910
Get back in and quickly move the car.

36
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,900
You need to move your car too, Ahjussi.

37
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,060
Bulldog Mansion. Isn't it the band you like?

38
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,290
Band?

39
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,970
You listened to their music all the time you were hospitalized. So I thought you like them.

40
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,200
I did?

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,320
You don't remember that either?

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,190
Your memory loss isn't limited to the collapse?

43
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,090
Do you remember how we first met?

44
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,860
- We met at the hospital.
 - Forget it. Let's not try to remember.

45
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,050
What's the point of remembering those dark times?

46
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,510
This is it.

47
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,500
What is this? What are you doing now?

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,030
It doesn't hurt to check again.

49
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,250
So you don't trust the result of my inspection?

50
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,410
I can't trust your father's construction inspection company, Project Manager.

51
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,590
Oh, enough is enough.

52
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,220
I am doing this so we can do enough.

53
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,520
Oh, you're driving me crazy.

54
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,330
What's this?

55
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,160
Isn't ground inspection already completed?

56
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,690
Oh, it is.

57
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,190
Before blasting the excavation site, another inspection—

58
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,190
I don't remember signing off on this.

59
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,480
What were you doing when we inspected it the first time? Why are you doing this only now?

60
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,100
Some areas were left out in the previous inspection.

61
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,650
Exactly. Why are you?

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,540
Why are you making the decision?

63
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,070
I am not doing this for my sake.

64
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,180
So I have to approve the cost and you want to show off about it.

65
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,430
You saw that. There are so many thieves like this; will there be any money left at the company?

66
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,900
Hey, you!

67
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,760
You! You!

68
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,570
Hurry up and come, dam*.

69
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,550
Who are you to keep showing up?

70
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,440
It's Lee Gang Doo.

71
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,990
At least remember my name.

72
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,260
Lee Gang Doo. I will remember. But you should remember too.

73
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,010
He's not the person who's paying you. It's me. Got it?

74
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:51,230
Now that you order a gangster around, does this place seem like it belongs to you?

75
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,870
You'll end up like your father if you continue. Be careful, Joo Won.

76
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,900
Oh, he's so good at belittling people. What would have happened if he wasn't made a director?

77
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,820
He's not a bad person.

78
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,020
The problem is his position is too much for him.

79
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,590
What was your business with Ms. Ha Moon Soo in the morning?

80
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,510
Something that has nothing to do with you, CEO.

81
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,660
What? Why? Do I have to report to you about my personal life?

82
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,670
- What is this? 
 - Your things left behind when you ran away with the CEO after ruining the company dinner.

83
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,100
- It's not mine. 
 - It's yours.

84
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,900
- That ahjussi left it behind, then.
 - Who?

85
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,890
That site employee who always stands up for you.

86
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,450
I saw that he followed you and returned with this.

87
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,980
See? It's ointment for a burn injury.

88
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,770
He raised a fuss from the first time. There is something going on between you two, right?

89
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,070
There is nothing going on.

90
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,230
There is. There is.

91
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,160
- There isn't.
 - Fine.

92
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,370
If that puts you at ease, let's say there is nothing going on.

93
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,610
 Burn, Cut, Sunburn 

94
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,980
Isn't he someone you knew?

95
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,720
No.

96
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,350
It seemed like he looked after you during the company dinner.

97
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,550
That's not it.

98
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,400
I don't know either. CEO personally hired him, like your case.

99
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,890
Then do you know his contact information?

100
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,850
There must be a copy of his employment contract there somewhere.

101
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,630
 Employment Contract, Name: Lee Gang Doo, Address: Kyeonggi Provice, Moksan City, Mokdong Street, 41-2  

102
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,900
 You treat other people's unhappiness as if it means nothing, but you can't hold in your curiosity. 

103
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,790
 You're a bad person. 

104
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,240
 Kyeonggi Province, Moksan City 

105
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,470
Welcome.

106
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,800
Please give me a bowl of noodles.

107
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,190
If you're here to eat noodles, just do that.

108
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,910
 That strange song from earlier, who sang that song? 

109
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,990
 Don't you know Bulldog Mansion? 

110
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,980
 What? 

111
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,060
 You really don't know? 

112
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,830
 I don't know. 

113
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,900
We will choose another company to do the ground inspection.

114
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,750
Choose the company you want. Then there shouldn't be any problem.

115
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,320
Since we know the problem, there shouldn't be any accidents.

116
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,160
I've heard there was trouble at the site. You look tired.

117
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,400
You can date a new woman.

118
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,550
However, don't let me see you with her.

119
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,190
- Yoo Jin. 
 - Don't sigh.

120
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,910
I must look laughable since I am clinging on to you.

121
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,310
So don't make yourself laughable anymore.

122
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,580
Are you going to be like this?

123
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,300
It's late. Drive carefully.

124
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,340
I didn't watch it on purpose.

125
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,150
Thanks to you, I couldn't meet the person I came to see. I came here in vain.

126
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,830
Look.

127
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,660
Pretend like you didn't see anything.

128
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,330
How can I pretend like I haven't seen anything when I already saw it?

129
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,390
Why? Are you embarrassed?

130
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,770
Mr. Lee Gang Doo.

131
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,900
Are you playing a game with the CEO?

132
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,980
I thought you were highly educated, but your'e dumber than I thought.

133
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,640
A man and a woman dating,

134
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,860
you lose if you like the person more and you win if you like the person less.

135
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,890
Even an ignorant person like me knows it's not like that.

136
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,330
Thank you for the drinks.

137
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,940
- Bye, Oppa.
 - Bye.

138
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,850
By chance do you know Lee Gang Doo? His address is here.

139
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,810
No, I don't know him.

140
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,520
- Oppa, I—
 - Excuse me.

141
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,970
Are you rich?

142
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,230
Pardon?

143
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,830
- I asked if you're rich.
 - No.

144
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,130
Then follow me. It's expensive here.

145
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,760
Enjoy.

146
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,730
Do you live there?

147
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,140
No, I don't.

148
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,610
Your address was there.

149
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,960
- Then where do you live? 
 - Here you go with questions again.

150
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,810
If you're here to drink, just drink.

151
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,580
Aren't you drinking?

152
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,350
I don't drink soju. It's bitter.

153
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,380
I didn't come to drink either.

154
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,460
I came to apologize.

155
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,880
Apologize?

156
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,380
Belittling other people's unhappiness. Thinking that what matters are the things I am curious about.

157
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,210
Everything you said was correct, so I was uneasy all day.

158
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,780
I am sorry.

159
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,260
It was ridiculous.

160
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,320
You asked why I destroyed it.

161
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,810
Just to have their names engraved on that stone,

162
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,620
they croaked here. It seemed like they are asking people to remember such things, so I found it ridiculous.

163
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,890
That's why I destroyed it in a fit of anger.

164
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,540
Good job.

165
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,430
Ahjumma, beer please.

166
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,550
Let me ask you a question too then.

167
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,380
Then why are you curious about that?

168
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,610
Are you the only one who gets to ask questions?

169
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,400
You said it's violence forcing questions on people when they don't want answer

170
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,680
You're so good at using other people's words.

171
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,360
What was Bulldog Mansion?

172
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,860
You said you don't know.

173
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,740
I know now. They are singers.

174
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,290
They are not just any singers.

175
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,460
They are a great band. Yeah.

176
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,480
A funky band that was ahead of its time.

177
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,220
♫ Closer and even closer

178
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,530
♫ Love me

179
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,700
♫ Come closer to me

180
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:55,160
♫ Meeting you wasn't a coincidence.

181
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,460
♫ Closer, even closer

182
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,710
♫ Love me

183
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,920
♫ Come closer to me

184
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,090
♫ Meeting you wasn't for farewell.

185
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,040
Did you look into it?

186
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,850
He came to the site in person after seeing the advertisement from the hiring agency.

187
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,100
He signed a separate contact with Seo Won studio afterwards.

188
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,340
Fire him.

189
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:31,390
- But. 
 - I said fire him.
 - You don't know?

190
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,930
About what?

191
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,990
Lee Gang Doo's father, Lee Chul Ho, is one of the workers who died at the site during the collapse.

192
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,690
Say it again.

193
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:51,110
He was an employee of the subcontractor who was charged with taking out the rebar, so he wasn't compensated for his death.

194
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,610
It was a decision made by the builder's section chief—

195
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,730
I remember it was a decision made by Director Jeong Yoo Taek.

196
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,020
I take back the instruction about firing him for now. Look into him a bit more.

197
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,650


198
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,130
Didn't you go home earlier?

199
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,680
What are you doing here?

200
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,490
- Noona. 
 - Yeah.

201
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,570
Are you close to Jeong Yoo Taek?

202
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,460
What?

203
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,600
Jeong Yoo Taek from Cheongyoo Builders. Do you know him well?

204
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,550
Why are you interested in a jerk like him?

205
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,950
I keep running into him. I need to know what kind of dirty bastard he is so I can decide whether or not to avoid him.

206
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,990
So why do you work there? You're quite something too.

207
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,700
So how is he?

208
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,110
There is a rumor that he's a family member of the Cheongyoo Builders owner.

209
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:03,670
What if he is? From the way  I see it, he's just a pitiful fellow.

210
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,860
Pitiful?

211
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,120
Can't you tell from how he insists on coming to my bar?

212
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,960
Compared to what he has, he has such a cheap taste.

213
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,660
Also whenever he sees me, he says lame things like how I look like his first love.

214
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,230
People like that, they are usually full of a sense of inferiority.

215
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,480
That means I shouldn't discriminate since I run a business.

216
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,990
It won't do you any good to get involved with him.

217
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,620
How can it be worse than how I am now?

218
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,460
What a naive thing to say.

219
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,060
Don't feel easy thinking you're at rock bottom.

220
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,690
You know that I like you, right?

221
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,500
Yeah. Everyone leaves after saying those things.

222
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,670
- Who was that woman earlier? 
 - Who?

223
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,530
Earlier. The woman you were appalled to find here and took out.

224
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,460
Who is she for you to care about her like that?

225
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,160
She's no one.

226
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,260
- You mean she's no one? 
 - No, she's no one.

227
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,350
Why are you smiling? What?

228
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,600
Seeing how you can't explain who she is. You must feel quite conflicted.

229
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,660
What are you talking about? You're overreacting.

230
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,770
We just need to wait and see if I am overreacting or I am good at sensing these things.

231
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,030
Oh, your nonsense. Seriously.

232
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,760
You want to rebuild the memorial.

233
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,520
I could demolish it myself. There is no need to hire anyone.

234
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,360
Since the contractor said it's not their fault and left, there is no one to take responsibility for it.

235
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,460
So, destroying it wasn't enough. You even want to rebuild it?

236
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,990
- If not, are you going to get rid of it?
 - No, I won't do that.

237
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,360
That's what I am saying. The person who caused the problem even wants to solve it.

238
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Please help me a bit.

239
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,300
I am not saying I will do it alone.

240
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,710
- Ha Moon Soo, if you pair her with me.
 - Moon Soo?

241
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,560
You know better than me that I can't handle this alone.

242
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,100
It's not something I could decide on my own.

243
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,140
The budget needs to be approved by headquarters in order to proceed.

244
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,550
Headquarters.

245
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,120
Why Moon Soo of all people?

246
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,590
Just because.

247
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,360
Just because.

248
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,170
Just because. She's the only person I know in this office.

249
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,970
Why are you looking at me with those eyes? It's the truth.

250
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,090
Please give me a call.

251
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,400
Are you looking for Unni?

252
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,300
You scared me!

253
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,460
Unni didn't come in yet.

254
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,770
What are you saying?

255
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,850
Thanks to you, I don't go to the site anymore, Ahjussi. Unni said she will handle it alone.

256
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,810
Ah-Ahjussi?

257
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,470
Why am I Ahjussi and she's Unni? I think we are about the same age.

258
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,310
Even though she may look older than her age, I don't think she's as old as you.

259
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,730
- How old are you, Ahjussi?
 - Ahjussi?

260
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,680
- The steps aren't the only spot you do this.
 - What?

261
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,130
Look ahead.

262
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,580
Why did you come here? Did you come to see me?

263
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,260
No.

264
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,310
We will see each other often from now.

265
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,440
It's freshly brewed.

266
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,660
Thank you.

267
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,870
It must be hard since the first deadline is kind of tight.

268
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,390
It's alright. I can get it done.

269
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,620
Haven't you forgotten anything? Don't you think you're missing something?

270
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,800
You didn't even know you left it behind in the car.

271
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,850
Oh.

272
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,600
Oh, right.

273
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,760
This.

274
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,190
It's your family's bath house, right?

275
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,420
Is the design for a remodel?

276
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,200
Lately, when we have time and money to spare. We are still quite short.

277
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,480
I liked it.

278
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,400
I want to see it. The building designed by you.

279
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,550
I washed your lunchbox.

280
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,020
Anyway, I was planning to submit the budget.

281
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,330
We are going to open the park first and we can't just leave it like that.

282
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,300
We can figure out later who should be held liable for it.

283
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,940
Who?

284
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,990
You know him too. Lee Gang Doo. My firm's site maintenance employee.

285
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,360
He's a security guard, just a mere security guard.

286
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,790
But there must be a reason, seeing at how you even called me.

287
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,900
Convince me why that job should be given to him.

288
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,560
   

289
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,570
What are you scheming? 
 

290
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,830
What is this exactly?
 - Don't you know how to read?
 

291
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,010
It's written he's the person in charge. Sign off on this.

292
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,100
This is at work. Speak properly.

293
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,880
Please approve it, Director (speaking formally).

294
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,040
- I don't want to.
 - What's your reason?

295
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,540
Since I am in a position where I can reject such things.

296
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,360
Get out. Do your work.

297
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,100
- You should do your job properly, Oppa.
 - Hey!

298
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,280
I've heard that 1/5 of the land for the commercial district building site is owned by someone else.

299
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,610
You didn't even properly sign the contract to own that land. Instead, you constructed a road and got the permit first.

300
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,700
That's my work. Don't meddle. Get out.

301
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,100
Don't think about saving pennies over small matters like this.

302
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,880
Please do a good job so I won't have to meddle, Director.

303
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,100
Hey! I said I won't approve it!

304
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,400
Why does it have to be him of all people?

305
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,270
Do you want to have dinner together?

306
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,380
 Seaweed Rolls, Noodles. 

307
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,060
I came to see you to buy something delicious.

308
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,610
This tastes better for me.

309
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,140
You're not asking why I came to see you?

310
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,180
You came to see me. I am sure you'll tell me.

311
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,860
I won't talk about work. It's past my work hours.

312
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:14,050
A mere security guard. There aren't too many people who'd speak to me like this staring straight into my eyes.

313
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,320
I like you.

314
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,630
I don't give counseling regarding dating life either.

315
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,230
Do I seem that low of a person to be talking to you about my dating life?

316
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,550
But I will listen to you. About 5,000 won ($5) worth.

317
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,180
I'd have to pay for my dinner.

318
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,380
Cheap.

319
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,880
But it ruins the mood. Nothing will change even if I talk about it.

320
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,790
Nothing will change.

321
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,390
But you might feel better.

322
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,170
If you had better qualifications, many women would have chased after you.

323
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,290
What the heck? Are you putting me down?

324
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,750
Do you think a man and woman can be friends?

325
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,580
It's something that could drive me crazy.

326
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,160
I'd have to hide my feelings.

327
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,190
If I want to see her close even if it means we remain friends. I can't help it.

328
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:07,650
If you don't like him that much, it's better to end it without a pretense.

329
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:13,150
It may not be a game, but it is true that the person who likes the other person more is at a disadvantage.

330
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,400
You are worth the price of the dinner.

331
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,790
But I didn't come here to kick back and talk about my love life.

332
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,860
Does Joo Won also know also

333
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:30,180
that your father was a construction worker who worked at the site. You have quite a story.

334
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,040
Are you two plotting something together?

335
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,760
Plotting what?

336
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:46,200
The CEO and me. The contracting company. You're a superior and I'm a subordinate. That's all.

337
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,060
Do I have to explain the fact that I'm trying to make a living?

338
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,330
Seeing your face, I guess Joo Won doesn't know it yet.

339
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,520
Let's grab a drink next time.

340
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:21,740


341
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,800
That means he likes you.

342
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,230
Why else would he bring you lunch?

343
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:42,030
On top of that, you said that great CEO shows his weak side to you.

344
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,520
That's the crucial evidence.

345
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,010
Why does our conversation take that direction?

346
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:51,420
Gosh! You're so frustrating. What's the use of him sending you signals? You can't decipher the meaning!

347
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,260
From what I heard from So Mi, the manager hasn't given up on the CEO.

348
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,330
Those two. They totally look great together. You're saying this because you haven't seen them together.

349
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,650
Of course, there's a woman by the side of a great guy.

350
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,160
But who cares? You can take him away from her.

351
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,440
Now, now. The CEO and I aren't meant to be—

352
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,170
Hey, you're always like that.

353
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:19,800
You pick someone to like who is impossible to begin with or you run away when the person starts to like you.

354
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,440
What do you think you're doing?

355
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,060
Drink it.

356
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,200
All right, fine. I'm tired, too.

357
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,610
How about my honey? Do you get to see him?

358
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,900
Who? Lee Gang Doo?

359
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,790
His name is Gang Doo?

360
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,560
That's nice. His name sounds tough. He's doing well, right?

361
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,790
Still the same. He speaks so rudely and does whatever he pleases.

362
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,420
But he's hardworking.

363
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,980
See? I'm good at judging people.

364
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,370
You get close to him first.

365
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,590
It's easy to get involved with a friend's friend.

366
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,300
He does seem a bit rough around the edges, but he seems like a good guy. Better than he looks.

367
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,500
But don't fall for him too deep.

368
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,320
If you fall for him after disliking him first, there's no cure for it.

369
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,330
Do all the way up to 100.

370
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,830
Hello.

371
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,540
- Hello. 
 - Oh, who's this?

372
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,890
I'm going to go in there first today. I can go, right?

373
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,700
Everyone, gather. I'll say one thing.

374
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,070
Twenty-six of all the collapse accidents that happen every year,

375
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,640
happen at construction sites.

376
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,740
Especially in the rain. There's rain in the forecast starting next week.

377
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,510
Before that, check if there are any sediment yield dangers.

378
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,630
Please check thoroughly and also check the drains.

379
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,430
Our lives. We have to take care of our lives ourselves.

380
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,020
Please keep that in mind. Fighting!

381
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,160
 Fighting! 

382
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,070
Aren't you going to eat lunch?

383
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,840
Aren't you eating?

384
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,990
I don't really like this kind of stuff.

385
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,590
Then, you should've said to go somewhere else.

386
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,800
You're the one who just walked in here without asking me.

387
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,770
How can you work at the construction site eating like that?

388
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:51,120
How about you? Why do you eat everything including even the pork slices when you're not doing anything physical?

389
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,300
You're always drawing something, measuring, and taking pictures.

390
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,040
What is it that you do exactly?

391
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,810
Building models.

392
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,150
What?

393
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,400
Building miniature models.

394
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,470
Ah, ones that look like toys.

395
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,550
Toys?

396
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,150
Look.

397
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,770
This is the 2D drawing of the building that the architect designed.

398
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,870
Can you tell?

399
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,920
This is 3D.

400
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,360
You still can't feel it, right?

401
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,560
No matter how you imagine in your head, you won't know until you build it.

402
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,870
There has to be a model like this.

403
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:00,870
You can find any risks while building or figure out any flaws in the structure.

404
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,980
Find out all the problems that can occur beforehand and decrease actual danger.

405
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,020
And you can find out the architect's intention behind the building—

406
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,200
- Is that why you're doing this? 
 - What?

407
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,330
Trying to prevent an accident? Is that why you're making it?

408
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,610
You could say that.

409
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,640
You're doing good work.

410
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,030
You're finished, right?

411
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,600
Since you're the only one who ate everything, I'm sure you'll pay on your own.

412
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,420
Instead...

413
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,890
This is too expensive. What's the difference between the price of a meal and this?

414
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,940
Just say thanks and eat it.

415
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,160
You should be able to taste something sweet like this in life.

416
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,840
Gosh, your taste. Not suitable for me.

417
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,760
I know I'm being rude if I asked you this, but—

418
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,110
If you know you're being rude, don't ask.

419
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,860
You can pass if you don't want to answer me.

420
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,270
There you go again with your questions.

421
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,740
How did you hurt your leg like that?

422
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,220
Last time, when I saw you in the alley when you got beat up, you had a huge surgery scar.

423
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,700
It'll melt. Hurry up and eat it.

424
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,910
- But why do you keep speaking casually to me? 
 - I heard we're the same age.

425
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,550
Who says? We are?

426
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,540
Who told you that?

427
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,090
- Which year were you born? 
 - You seriously ask too many questions.

428
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,150
Are you interested in me?

429
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,120
You always walk away first.

430
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,890
Speaking casually just because we're the same age. I don't think that's right.

431
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,690
Because someone's older, or your superior, or a sunbae...

432
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,220
Because the other person is a woman.

433
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,360
None of that matters.

434
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,000
The two people need to settle the matter. Are you listening to me?

435
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,450
Hey, Gang Doo. The new nightshift staff I hired can't be reached.

436
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,140
Let me ask you for a favor for one night.

437
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,650
If he can't be reached, you're asking me to work a day shift and night shift. A total full time.

438
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,790
Because of all the preparation to excavate.

439
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,030
Aigoo, I'm going crazy, man.

440
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,020
You said we're supposed to switch our shift every week.

441
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,460
It's only been three days since I became a day shift.

442
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,850
Fine, forget it!

443
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,140
Everyone cares about their own situation only. I'm the only one who worries.

444
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,930
Geez. What do I do?

445
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,730
You owe me one.

446
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,220
What?

447
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,940
Next time, take consideration for my situation.

448
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,710
Of course! Of course, of course! Thanks.

449
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:07,490
You picked on me last time saying people only care about their own selves, so why bother to help?

450
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,270
You helped my friend last time and came to my aid first when I was having a hard time.

451
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,190
Your words and actions don't match.

452
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,350
You talk way too much.

453
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,980
Aren't you going?

454
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,950
Over there?

455
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,680
 You must feel good about life. 

456
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,000
 Why? 

457
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,980
Shut up!

458
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,120
 You're going to date her or something? 

459
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,560
What?

460
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:33,650
I got the permit for the land, yet you couldn't find the landowner and couldn't sign a contract?

461
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,530
Mere several thousand pyeong (pyeong3 square meters)?

462
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,110
Well, we're looking for him—

463
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,950
To build residential homes, we changed the purpose of the property and even got rid of the altitude restriction.

464
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,700
Do you know how much money I poured into those jerks at the city planning committee and whatnot?

465
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,800
You think that's all? To make it look good, knowing we'd lose money, we built the road

466
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,180
and various infrastructure!

467
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,580
Who got the bid for all this business, huh?

468
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,790
- Your father, right? 
 - Yes.

469
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,720
My f***ing father-in-law!

470
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,430
I can't raise my head in front of my younger sister out of shame.

471
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:24,430
Hyungnim. It can get resolved.

472
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,070
We eliminated all the borrowed name account holders in line and the actual owner... We just have to confirm the person.

473
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,050
- There won't be any problems with the contract, right? 
 - Of course not.

474
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:38,950
The wasteland without any accessible road... We're willing to pay them way more than the market price. They can't turn it down.

475
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,460
Who's that lucky bastard?

476
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,880
Ten...

477
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,430
Scared me! You dork!

478
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,490
What brings you out here out of the blue? Are you exercising?

479
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:10,540
Good job. It doesn't suit you to be lying around sick, Granny.

480
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:17,490
Since you're out, you should be walking around somewhere pretty and bright. Of all places, here in this dark and gloomy spot?

481
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:22,420
You have no idea. When the snow comes down softly right here,

482
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,400
this is the most beautiful spot in the world.

483
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,490
I wonder if I'll get to see that again in my lifetime.

484
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,280
My knee hurts. My knee hurts. My knee...

485
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,360
What's the use of exercising? Quit smoking already.

486
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,160
Why do you think I'm exercising? So that I can smoke this for a long time.

487
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,180
I can't get a word in. Not a word, geez.

488
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,130
This kid. How rude.

489
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,820
You're trying to jump over a 50-year difference and be friends.

490
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,500
Are you allowed to treat someone who's going to take care of you until you go senile like that?

491
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,230
Is it my fault that I'm old? Why would you take care of me?

492
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:17,360
If you don't like that, exercise. I'll come by every day and check.

493
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,170
- Stop smoking! 
 - Oh, my gosh!

494
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:25,100
You jerk! Why did you throw that away?

495
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,510
What a waste.

496
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,950
I'm going to smoke it later.

497
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,820
- Granny. 
 - Huh?

498
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,180
You know how some say knowledge is power, but others say ignorance is bliss?

499
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,120
What kind of bulls*** is that?

500
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,990
I know.

501
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:55,400
What's right? When someone doesn't seem to know for real, should I let her know or leave her be?

502
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,190
Leave her be. Knowing that ignorance is bliss, there lies the power.

503
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:09,510
But still... Some people seem to live comfortably having forgotten everything. It's not fair.

504
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,460
Hey, how would you know if that person feels at ease?

505
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,210
It doesn't mean someone is in more pain just because he cries louder.

506
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,390
Stand up, stand up. Stop smoking and get up.

507
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,660
- Wait, wait. 
 - Aigoo...

508
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,750
Hurry up and stand up. You need to exercise.

509
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,900
I exercised too much. I can stop now.

510
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,970
Don't make me laugh. You're always sitting around.

511
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,930
Hurry up, move.

512
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,300
- C'mon, c'mon. 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

513
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:48,940


514
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,400
You don't like the girls?

515
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,070
If you keep rejecting them, it'll look bad for our girls.

516
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:07,060
I waited for you. It's no fun with other girls.

517
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,100
I'm expensive.

518
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,160
Expensive my a**.

519
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,910
Bring me a bottle of the drink I like.

520
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,610
Yeah.

521
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,630
Here you go.

522
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,240
What's your relationship with Lee Gang Doo?

523
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,700
Who?

524
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,860
How dare you try to trick me? You sent him to me to rip off money from me.

525
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,580
I didn't rip you off. I only received what I deserved.

526
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,790
Fine, forget about the past. Where has he been, that jerk?

527
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,290
- I don't know. 
 - Hey.

528
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:06,990
Don't hate him too much. Our Gang Doo. He did that because I told him to.

529
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,210
He does everything he can to make money.

530
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:16,100
He does whatever to make money. I like it.

531
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:22,000
He has a lot of debt. Money is something he's never had a chance to spend.

532
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,280
So, ignore him even if he upsets you.

533
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,630
When you mess with people who have nothing to lose, it doesn't end well. They want to fight you to the death.

534
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,590
Yeah, Noona.

535
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,920
Tomorrow?

536
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,340
Why?

537
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,160
   

538
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,870
You were going to demolish it. Why?

539
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,350
I don't know either.

540
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:22,320
Seeing how people are paying attention to you, it's making me pay attention, too.

541
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,360
To test you, I want to order you to do a job.

542
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,140
Go.

543
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,800
Is this the reason why you called me to come all the way here?

544
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,940
Then would I go to you?

545
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:50,740
You think time passes all the same for everyone, right?

546
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,490
Nothing in the world is fair, so don't be delusional.

547
00:45:54,490 --> 00:46:01,890
Your time and my time carry a different value.

548
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,400
Aren't you leaving?

549
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,420
When will the display model be ready? We need it fast so that we can start selling—

550
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,820
It's more important to be accurate than to be fast.

551
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:19,030
Is excavation moving right along as planned?

552
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,930
To protect the incline, we do need some free land. If we're to meet the deadline for the construction—

553
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:29,060
Excuse me. The ground isn't strong enough in that area, the trench cut method—

554
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,560
She's an expert. Right?

555
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,880
She's quite an expert.

556
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:40,470
It's not like there are buildings in the area. The depth of field for excavation is shallow. It should be okay.

557
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,880
But still, we should stabilize the incline first—

558
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:48,420
Look. We didn't select the method just to shorten the time of construction.

559
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:54,760
The area condition, size, conditions of the ground. We did more research and evaluation than anyone else.

560
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,050
Each of us has our professional domain.

561
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:03,530
If problems arise, we'll take care of them. We're the ones who will take responsibility anyhow.

562
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:08,100
I understand that you're working hard, but don't cross the line for that reason.

563
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,480
A smattering of knowledge is the most dangerous thing.

564
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,120
Aren't you leaving?

565
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,220
We're all very busy people. Are you going to waste our meeting time?

566
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,110
I'm sorry.

567
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,600
Over what mistake?

568
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,860
It's my first time working on a project of this magnitude. I could be wrong.

569
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:54,990
It is a huge project, and Director Jeong's criticisms aren't wrong.

570
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:59,260
And you're not wrong either, Moon Soo.

571
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,180
The real mistake is just glossing over something when you have serious doubts.

572
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,800
Accidents. It rarely happens that bad people cause them intentionally.

573
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,260
Accidents happen when hard working people make mistakes.

574
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:20,390
So, you can't do this line of work if you're not confident about your judgment.

575
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:29,870
Ha Moon Soo, you belong to me. Don't be intimidated in front of other people.

576
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,990
What are you doing? We're meeting.

577
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,020
Go home first.

578
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,090
It was real.

579
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:36,070
What was? Me?

580
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,630
I thought I saw wrong.

581
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:41,950
What are you doing here blocking my way?

582
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,770
Just because... I'm going to rest a bit before going.

583
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,120
Go first.

584
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,820
You're down just because you were scolded.

585
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,770
You saw?

586
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,340
So you saw.

587
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,540
I keep on showing you a terrible side of myself.

588
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:13,630
Seeing you act like your life is over because of that type of thing looks even worse.

589
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:18,830
It's not that I look like a fool, I am a fool.

590
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,350
And everyone else is better than me.

591
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:31,890
It does seem like everyone lives well except for you, but if you go ahead, it's all the same.

592
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,940
Even the guys who seem to do well are stressed out behind the scenes.

593
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,830
Are you comforting me right now?

594
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:46,430
What? Are you going to feel touched by these ridiculous words?

595
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:52,150
Don't do that. It's every man for himself in life. Stay alert.

596
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,310
- We saw each other here before, right? 
- I don't know.

597
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,970
- Why aren't you riding the elevator? 
- That's nothing for you to know.

598
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:14,860
Oh right. But why did you come here?

599
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:19,880
Why are there so many things you're curious about? Do you really like me?

600
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,320
Wait a second!

601
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,760
Hey.

602
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,660
Why? What?

603
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,150
You live here?

604
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,450
Isn't your expression too obvious coming to someone else's house?

605
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:52,650
- I asked you to grab a drink and you said let's drink at home. Then, you bring me to a motel. Of course, it's weird.
 - Oh, my goodness.

606
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,000
What did you expect? You're even weirder.

607
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,580
Let's set things straight. I didn't bring you here. You followed me.

608
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:04,140
Since we met each other coincidentally, while we're at it.

609
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:09,520
And my friend said we should try to get close to each other.

610
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,590
It's not cool. I think we have to put it in longer–

611
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,750
It's broken. If you get used to it, it's okay.

612
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,330
So you read these types of books. Are they fun?

613
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,690
I read them because they're fun.

614
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,380
Don't they always say the same thing?

615
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:22,750
That's why it's fun. Even if you get betrayed, there's one friend who trusts you.

616
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,190
Everything your teacher or mentor says is right so you only have to follow what he says.

617
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:35,750
If you work hard, results will follow. The bad guys will get punished.

618
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,270
That's nice.

619
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,580
- That's too obvious though. 
- That's what's good.

620
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,860
The world sucks because you can't do what's obvious and simple.

621
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:10,090
♫  It's not longing, it's not regrets  ♫

622
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:17,850
♫  What could it be? This feeling that's coming on strong  ♫

623
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:24,950
♫  It grows when we’re far apart,  it comes back when we’re apart  ♫

624
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:31,020
♫  This excitement seems to be because of you for some reason  ♫

625
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:37,430
♫  I felt that, I flying on your eyes  ♫

626
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:44,420
♫  The time we were together, that day, I felt  ♫

627
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,280
♫  everything seems so great in this world  ♫

628
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,530
"Choo-goong-gwa-hyeol." What's that?

629
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,940
Through the blood passage, you're transferring energy.

630
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:03,550
If my energy runs out, I receive energy from nature.

631
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:10,270
When a pretty woman gets hurt, you take her clothes off for blood circulation and grope her to heal her and stuff.

632
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,320
It's that type of thing.

633
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:17,020
Hyung. You can't say that about the ultimate healing method.

634
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,710
This is something that's really dangerous for the person performing it too.

635
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:24,320
Because I'm giving you my energy, I have the possibility of receiving bad energy.

636
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,910
Not for the outward physical hurts,

637
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:30,250
but for the people hurt here on the inside, it's really effective.

638
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,740
There are 12 big different types.

639
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,880
Byeok-ta-go-jeung. Gui-geun-ahn-ma. Gwon-jong-ji-sa.

640
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,300
From a long ago, our hands were used very much as a healing tool.

641
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,790
 What's right? 

642
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,350
 When someone doesn't seem to know for real, should I let her know or leave her be? 

643
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:53,500
 Leave her be. Knowing ignorance is bliss, there lies the power. 

644
00:55:53,500 --> 00:56:00,270
 But still... Some people seem to live comfortably having forgotten everything. 

645
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,180
 It's not fair. 

646
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:07,220
So you put your energy in your hand and heal other people with it.

647
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,970


648
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,350
I saw it all. Just drink it.

649
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,170
I drank too.

650
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,780
It's only evening, though.

651
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,030
Friend.

652
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,160
Wan Jin?

653
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,220
No. Just at the place of a friend I work with.

654
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,580
What about Aunt?

655
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:43,620
There aren't any customers, and I heard her husband caused trouble again.

656
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:47,490
She ran out as soon as she received a call.

657
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,430
That man is so consistent.

658
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:56,360
Seeing her hold it in when she calls him her enemy, they must really have a good relationship.

659
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,710
Would they live together just because it's good?

660
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,920
She's probably sticking with him because it's better to have him than not.

661
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,490
But I heard they're sweet on a general basis.

662
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,520
Geez...

663
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,590
There's nothing fun airing.

664
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:22,810
It'd be nice if we could switch channels like this in life whenever things got boring, right?

665
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:27,550
What would you do if you switched channels? You'd end up going to the first channel you were watching in the beginning.

666
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:29,360
Is that right?

667
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,830
You're right.

668
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,840
Was Dad sweet too?

669
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,260
Is that why you're not divorcing him?

670
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,240
That's just because I don't want to.

671
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,900
Why? Whenever you guys meet, you guys are eager to fight.

672
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,040
It feels like a waste.

673
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:01,680
If I didn't have him from the beginning, I don't know. It feels like he's being taken away from me.

674
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,210
Either way, I don't want to. Even if I told you, you wouldn't know.

675
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,770
 They found her? 

676
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:28,120
 Is she okay? Is she seriously injured? 

677
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:33,190
 Honey. Honey, why aren't you saying anything? Honey. Honey! 

678
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,960
 You saw it wrong 

679
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,670
 Ma'am. Ma'am? 

680
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,370
 Ma'am, are you alright? 

681
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:51,270
 Wait, please help here. 

682
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:55,810
 Ma'am, are you okay? Ma'am, please try to get your head together. 

683
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:58,390
 Ma'am, can I eat all of this? Wow! 
   

684
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,050
 This is the best. It tastes so good. 

685
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:07,440
 Even if we're family, we can't feel the same emotions. 

686
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,370
 But I can only imagine that the sadness I felt losing my younger sister 

687
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:19,060
 would be less than the sadness a mother would have felt losing a child. 

688
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,590
 That's why the only thing I can do is... 

689
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,870
Why are you like this?

690
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:34,470
Stay still. I'm giving you my energy.

691
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:38,470
He said it was choo something.

692
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:41,630
Well, either way, it's supposed to be a very good thing.

693
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:43,960
What are you doing? It's hot.

694
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,230
Stay still.

695
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,620
Why are you being gross like this? Go over there!

696
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,760
Stay still.

697
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,330
You really—

698
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:38,960
I'm crazy. I must be crazy.

699
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:57,280
I know it's not your business, but I'll ask you about it.

700
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:05,820
It's the bird's eye view of the memorial park.

701
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,970
I put a list of stone vendors that we deal with.

702
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,710
With this.

703
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,820
This is nice. There's nothing better than this flagstone for a tombstone.

704
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:26,550
The writing will be engraved clearly and it's strong.

705
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:29,480
We haven't decided on the design yet. How long would it take to produce it?

706
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,630
Are you going to make it different from the previous one?

707
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:34,400
That one is not that stylish and it looks too much like a tombstone.

708
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,790
Well, it is basically a tombstone.

709
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:39,520
Exactly. Who would like that?

710
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,300
If you want to change the design, it'll probably cost more.

711
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,690
Will something change just because you change the design?

712
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:48,260
Then what should we do? Give me your opinion then.

713
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,180
You're the one who volunteered for this, not me.

714
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:58,730
I am saying what's the point if you just make it pretty and engrave people's names?

715
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:01,210
Oh, you two don't know what you're talking about.

716
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:04,380
You don't erect this just to remember those who died.

717
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,770
The people who survived after sending their loved ones,

718
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:13,310
those who live on because they are unable to die. The memorial is for them to come and mourn as much as their heart allows them to.

719
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:18,650
We haven't forgotten them either. It's giving comfort to them through this piece of rock.

720
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:22,720
Well, what kind of hardship could you youngsters have suffered?

721
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,450
Please come to an agreement between the two of you first.

722
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:30,990
 Supermarket 

723
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:34,740
Making it so people can mourn as much as their heart allows them to.

724
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,180
I think he's right.

725
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,860
Did you see his hands?

726
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,850
His hands were like a piece of rock.

727
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:54,150
People who focused on one thing all their life, what they say is usually correct.

728
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:00,840
If you hadn't destroyed the memorial—

729
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,430
Don't do it.

730
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,060
What did I do?

731
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:08,800
Don't say "what if." There is no end.

732
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:19,260
What if I didn't go there? What if I hadn't done that? What if? If you start, there is no end.

733
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,100
♫ Closer and even closer

734
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,320
What are you doing?

735
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,050
What?

736
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,730
Why are you singing that song?

737
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:58,700
Can't I?

738
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:03,140
- You said you don't know it. 
 - I know now.

739
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,660
Don't sing it.

740
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,580
What? That's petty.

741
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:15,250
Are you trying to argue that you knew the song first?

742
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:22,910
I don't know. I am leaving.

743
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,660
What was that?

744
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,400
    

745
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,010
   

746
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:58,770
 Now that you order a gangster around, does this place seem like it belongs to you? 

747
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:03,590
 You'll end up like your father if you continue. Be careful, Joo Won. 

748
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:14,390
You're here? What have you decided?

749
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:18,650
Everything is pretty similar so I don't know. It's not like there is an alternative.

750
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:23,750
Don't try to make it different. It's a memorial.

751
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,230
What matters is the intention of those who make it.

752
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:34,230
At a place that won't stand out, classy enough to not draw criticism. That was my intention in the beginning.

753
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:40,900
It's actually better that we get to remake it. You two will be different from me.

754
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:45,020
You've worked hard. Please take some rest.

755
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,530
Yes.

756
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:58,470
CEO. You're a good person indeed.

757
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:04,260
We'll be different. Thank you for believing in us.

758
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:39,370
 Dynamite 

759
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:49,560
Mr. Technician. I almost fainted when I was digging the ground at Cheongjoo last year to build an apartment.

760
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,000
There were so many human remains.

761
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,220
There are rumors that here too, instead of dealing with it properly, they just covered it up instead.

762
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,240
- Really? 
 - Its unlucky. Let's go.

763
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:02,530
Are you done?

764
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:04,380
Yes, we're done.

765
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,260
Hey, since it's all set. Pull out up there.

766
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:09,600
Hurry and pull out. Let's get moving.

767
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:36,340
What are you doing? Hurry and move.

768
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,400
 Are you scared? 

769
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,200
 That's what I am saying. 

770
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:20,260
 It would have been nice if you died back then too. 

771
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:40,380
 It would have been nice if you died back then too. 

772
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:50,190
 Seowon Architecture &amp; Engineers 

773
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,580
Moon Soo. Moon Soo.

774
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:17,830
Get up. It's late.

775
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:22,920
Oh my gosh.

776
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:30,630
Let's go. It's raining so I will give you a ride.

777
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:48,700
 Twenty-six percent of all the collapse accidents that happen every year happen at construction sites. 

778
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,550
 Especially in the rain, check if there are any sediment yield dangers. 

779
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:55,000
He said he will cover the night shift.

780
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:04,600
I am leaving first.

781
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,990
   

782
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,720
   

783
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,310
   

784
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:04,670
   

785
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:13,410
It's not only 48 people died, but as many as 48 people died.

786
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:18,120
Ms. Ha Moon Soo, are you alright?

787
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,190
   

788
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,630
Didn't I tell you?

789
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:11,330
The crappy situation will come back anytime.

790
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:23,820


791
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:30,020
♫  Sunrise in your eyes  ♫

792
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:34,410
♫  Shines on your face  ♫

793
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:40,080
♫  We rise from the low  ♫

794
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,910
 Just Between Lovers 

795
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:46,430
 I didn't even have time to drink water. Please get me one from the vending machine too. 

796
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:51,090
 I don't have any coins. I really don't have any. Hey. 

797
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:54,450
 I guess you had coins today. 

798
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:55,750
♫  Dream in my eyes  ♫

799
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,200
 Where are you now? 

800
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:01,350
 - I am in front now.
 - Are you with Ms. Ha Moon Soo? 

801
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:03,680
 No. 

802
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,810
 How will you compensate for the lives of those who were miserable because they survived? 

803
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:10,810
 He's a thief who wants to take what's ours. 

804
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:13,090
 You need to take my side no matter what from now on. 

805
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:17,030
 Please do a proper job so it won't be embarrassing for me. 

806
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:19,570
 You go out more often lately. 

807
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,900
 I don't go out, I go out to work. 

808
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:26,090
 Be careful, Unni. It's perfect weather to fall in love. 

809
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:29,510
 Since a decent guy says he likes you, you're going to avoid him again? 

810
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,590
 It's not that. 

811
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:34,460
 Then what? You said he's a good person. What's the problem? 

812
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:40,990
 Because he's a good person.
