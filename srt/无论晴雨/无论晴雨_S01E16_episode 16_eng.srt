 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Hyung!

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,500
Hyung! You're awake. Are you alright?

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,400
Oh, I understand. I hear you.

5
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,780
How did I get here?

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,900
I heard that you collapsed in front of Moon Soo's house.

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,500
Imagine how shocked she was.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,000
Moon Soo is here?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,800
She's been sitting outside since last night without even eating anything.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,200
I asked her to eat, but she was just sitting there like a chunk of rock.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,000
Wait, lie down. I will bring her here.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Your sister's chief doctor instructed you to stay in your bed.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,800
Hyung.

14
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,600
 Seeing you act like your life is over because of that type of thing 

15
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,400
  looks even worse. 

16
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,710
 What are you doing here blocking my way? 

17
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,400
At the current state, transplant is your only solution.

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,900
There isn't much that can be done other than (transplant) surgery.

19
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,800
Since you don't have ascites (fluid accumulation) or sepsis yet,

20
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,200
you could receive treatments as an outpatient. If you could be hospitalized, that will be even better.

21
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,000
If there is a sudden onset of hepatic coma, it will be very difficult for you.

22
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,780
What did he say?

23
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,030
What did he say?

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
What

25
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,900
am I going to do?

26
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,300
Were you planning on not telling me this time too?

27
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,900
No,

28
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,980
I said I had something to tell you yesterday.

29
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,000
You were going to leave after saying what you had to say.

30
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,500
You said I shouldn't feel sorry.

31
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,400
But why do you keep making me sorry?

32
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
How can you do this?

33
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,200
I was just going to

34
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,400
leave in a dashing manner.

35
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,700
How can it be dashing when you're leaving?

36
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,380
What exactly have you done in your previous life

37
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,500
for your life to turn out so nasty like this.

38
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
That's not true.

39
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,200
Since I met you

40
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,750
I thought I had saved a country (done a great deed) in my previous life.

41
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,000
♫  It's an old longing to you, but  ♫

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
It hurts.

43
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,090
Stop hitting me.

44
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't die.

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
♫  In such a sad story  ♫

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,400
If you die, I will kill you.

47
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,600
♫  You're beautiful comfort to me  ♫

48
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,400
I won't leave you to die.

49
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,400
I will be by your side till the end this time.

50
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
♫  Inside this cold story  ♫

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,400
♫  You are a warm place  ♫

52
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:12,900
♫  The day my heart melted,  ♫

53
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,100
 Episode 16 

54
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,200
Patient Lee Gang Doo's emergency level, is it still the same?
 Organ Transplant Center 

55
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,600
His rank is still the same?

56
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Yes, he's still number two.

57
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
His condition worsened yesterday and was admitted as an emergency case. Shouldn't his number change?

58
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,500
I don't decide his number on the waiting list.

59
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,700
Some patients are waiting in ICU beds for their turn.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's not something you can give just because you want to.

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,200
Why? Because we're not related?

62
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,800
Then, I can do it if I marry Gang Doo, right? I can marry him right away.

63
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,700
Even if you register your marriage, you could only do it after one year.

64
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,600
Also, you can't give it to him since you're smaller than him.

65
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,400
Because I am smaller than him?

66
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Even if it's a match, the donor has to give 65% of her liver to the recipient.

67
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,200
With your build, it won't work.

68
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,000
Your intention is enough.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,100
I will try to do everything I can.

70
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,300
He's so handsome without any cuts.

71
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,600
He is bigger.

72
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,090
Many customers who are traumatized after a car accident seek this out too.

73
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,400
Is this the best one here?

74
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
There isn't any more impressive a model?

75
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,000
If you want a more stylish vehicle, I will recommend a different model to you.

76
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,300
- Wait a moment.
 - Okay.

77
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,190
You're going to decide on a car by how it looks?

78
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,000
You should compare maintenance cost, fuel efficiency, how it feels when you ride in it.

79
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,300
Hey! What's important for a car is not how it feels when you ride in it but how it feels when you exit it.

80
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,400
When you exit your car, everyone should be wowed by it.

81
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,000
You don't even ride it often.

82
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,400
My mom hates me driving.

83
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,200
She doesn't trust me. But I must drive from now on.

84
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
Why?

85
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't want you giving me ride in your car.

86
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,400
Are you embarrassed? Are you showing off how rich you are?

87
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah. I am gong to show off how rich I am.

88
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Money doesn't make you happy.

89
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,300
However, it is true that much unhappiness can be avoided.

90
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:48,040
You said your car used to belong to your uncle who used to beat you up.

91
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,310
Sell it. Let's drive a new car.

92
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,700
Here.

93
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Wait.

94
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,000
Moon Soo. I bought a car. Do you want to go anywhere?

95
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Hey! What's wrong?

96
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,300
I mean, you two just want to love each other. Why is it so hard for you two?

97
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Unni. I don't understand.

98
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Look at the life he lived.

99
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,190
He survived such hardship,

100
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,900
but he might die due to sickness.

101
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,100
Does that make sense?

102
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,400
So he could die like this, (God) spared his life?

103
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,260
Why is He doing this to Gang Doo?

104
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,400
He has it hard enough as it is.

105
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,800
Why does He make it harder for Gang Doo?

106
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,100
It feels unfair.

107
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,400
It's so unfair to us.

108
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,530
Don't cry.

109
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,800
Rather, cry your eyes out when you're with me.

110
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,700
Don't cry when you're with Gang Doo.

111
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,200
Gang Doo is so pitiful, what am I to do?

112
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I am pitiful too, what am I to do?

113
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,100
You cry for him like this, why is Gang Doo pitiful?

114
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,800
Isn't a two-patient room too expensive?

115
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
I am a doctor.

116
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,900
Then, do you get an employee discount or something?

117
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,600
How is it that we don't even have relatives that we're close to?

118
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,370
Oppa.

119
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,500
When Mom was sick,

120
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,400
do you remember how I begged that I wanted to sleep next to Mom,

121
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,300
that I don't like the cot?

122
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

123
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,800
I decided to become a doctor back then.

124
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,500
If I became a doctor, I thought I would come to a hospital only to cure people.

125
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,600
I didn't know that it would turn out like this again.

126
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,800
I am sorry.

127
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,600
If you're sorry, then don't die.

128
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't leave me behind, by myself.

129
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,580
I can't let Jae Yeong be alone.

130
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,040
I really can't die.

131
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,340
Gran told me to take my time to come see her.

132
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,520
I knew you'd be doing this.

133
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,980
- How did you?
 - I left because I was in a condition to do so.

134
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
Did you stay up and put this together by yourself?

135
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,150
 Mother Im Jin Hae who used to wait for her son, Choi Il Do every day by the front door.
 We're waiting for you, Moon Byeong Ho. 

136
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,890
 Our Captain who stayed behind till the end to do repair work 

137
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,180
 Rebar Manager Mr. Lee Cheol Woo 

138
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,680
In the work log you gave me,

139
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,050
there was contact information for workers who worked with your father. So I contacted them

140
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,600
and they only had praise for your father.

141
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,610
 District A 

142
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,150
You want this to be the memorial?

143
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,940
Yes.

144
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,900
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable to look at this?

145
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,530
I am not saying this on behalf of the company.

146
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,810
Some bereaved family members may think differently.

147
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,420
Because it's uncomfortable.

148
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,450
Because time has passed since we received the compensation fund,

149
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,130
we can't begin to forget like that.

150
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,360
That's why the same things keep on repeating.

151
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,940
The memorial park isn't being built for our comfort.

152
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,840
I vote for those words. Building it so it looks good isn't all there is to it.

153
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,820
Let's keep it this way. Cheongyu needs to do so.

154
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,880
I will try.

155
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,220
By the way, are you sick?

156
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,380
So this discussion is over. Please wrap it up well.

157
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,320
Those two get along well together.

158
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,730
Oh, wait.

159
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,130
Bio Town, many things are different from how they're specified in the business plan.

160
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,530
Use of laborers, materials and the processes too.

161
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,840
It was all approved by Director Jeong Yoo Taek.

162
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,070
Why are you giving this to me?

163
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,590
Even if I were to give it to the Cheongyu auditing department, they might cover it up.

164
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,100
I thought it would be better to trust you.

165
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,770
When they try to find the source, if it gets out that Seowon brought this issue up,

166
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,480
Seowon might not be able to get any work from Cheongyu in the future.

167
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,870
I won't get involved. If it's like this, I shouldn't get involved in the future.

168
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,330
Manager.

169
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,810
This.

170
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,800
What is this?

171
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,500
Mr. Lee Cheol Woo, Gang Doo's father.

172
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,070
I checked the blueprint of the shopping mall.

173
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:36,290
On August 5th, 2005, it says they cut the lower rebar of the elevator in District B.

174
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,580
- The marking person made a mistake so it was put aside.
- So what?

175
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,380
He might have privately dealt the rebar that was cut at that time.

176
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,690
But there is no evidence to be found anywhere that Gang Doo's father smuggled out any rebar.

177
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,860
I guess many people have high expectations of me.

178
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,900
You could set things right.

179
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,460
Please, I ask you.

180
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,270
Mr. Lee Gang Doo must feel secure since someone has his back.

181
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,860
I've heard that Mr. Lee Gang Doo quit his on-site job too. Is there something going on between you two?

182
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,290
No, nothing will happen.

183
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,250
I handed over the blueprint and the model to the design team. Also I've updated So Mi on any future work that needs to be done.

184
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,060
Thank you for your work.

185
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,040
Moon Soo.

186
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,510
Yes.

187
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,730
We will contact the family members of the bereaved.

188
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,850
The remains found at the site weren't a match to the DNA of the victim who was never found.

189
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,250
We have decided to compare it to other victims if the bereaved families want it.

190
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,670
- If you don't want that—
 - No, that might be my younger sister.

191
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,780
Only my dad saw how Yeon Soo was at the end. But her body was so seriously disfigured that he wouldn't even allow my mom to see her.

192
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,740
My dad was really angry then.

193
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:20,430
When I look back on it, I think he coped by getting angry.

194
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,520
Oh, right. You saw my dad in front of the restaurant.

195
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,750
Yes.

196
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,220
The restaurant is closing down. Before that—

197
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,230
No, I don't think I'll be able to go that far yet.

198
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:45,050
However, I understand that he was angry.

199
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,520
Pardon?

200
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,420
I will be able to see you again at the memorial park with Lee Gang Doo.

201
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:02,450
Thank you. Thanks to you and Lee Gang Doo, I was able to keep myself in line.

202
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,750
Isn't the name of this bus stop ridiculous?

203
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,830
Look. It says "Front of S Mall." That's been gone for some time already.

204
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,010
Why do you remember that?

205
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:36,370
I don't forget anything now. Anything that's related to you.

206
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,410
I am proud of you.

207
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,320
I am really proud of ourselves.

208
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,540
Doctor. You haven't come by often lately. Are you really busy?

209
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,500
Yes.

210
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,440
- Then. 
 - This is good. I came to ask a question.

211
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,770
Let me at least get tested. I've heard that the liver grows back.

212
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,440
It's not something you could decide so easily like that—

213
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,480
Who said it's easy? It's not easy.

214
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,230
I looked away when my father died of liver cancer.

215
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,690
Pardon?

216
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,060
But I will give it to Gang Doo.

217
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,710
I could get tested, right?

218
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,710
Thank you.

219
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,800
- What does your older brother do? 
- Pardon?

220
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,820
What kind of life did he live that so many people are willing to donate their livers?

221
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,400
What?

222
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:21,160
It would have been dangerous if it had been any later but it's good that a match has been found in preliminary testing.

223
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,070
What are you doing? Take it.

224
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,970
 Result of the blood test, Ahn Sang Man. Blood type: O 

225
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,760
Usually, unless you're a family member or a relative,

226
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,050
people might get suspicious that you're trying to sell your organ.

227
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,390
However, Hyung's address is here.

228
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,820
In order to prove that we lived together for more than 8 years,

229
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:55,430
I had to even go to city hall. It was very difficult, Mom.

230
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,490
I couldn't even eat for 6 hours.

231
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,220
Also, they poured something cold into my stomach. They drew many vials of blood too.

232
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,290
What are you saying now?

233
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,870
Were you listening when I explained everything?

234
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,830
If I share mine, Hyung could survive.

235
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:15,010
Stop saying useless things. You can't take even one step out from now on, do you understand?

236
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,630
Mom!

237
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,060
Listen to Mom's words.

238
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,120
Mom! I want to be useful too.

239
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:29,540
Oh, this thoughtless rascal. How can you stay that to your mother?

240
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,870
Mom.

241
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,440
Don't regard it as giving but instead gaining.

242
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:45,510
I am not giving a liver to Hyung. Instead, you're gaining another son. Isn't that lucky?

243
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,820
- Be quiet. Throw this out. 
- Oh, Mom.

244
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,310
- No way. 
- No, Mom.

245
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,330
- Mom.
 - You can never go out. This fool.

246
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,110
You could give other things, but how can you give that? This fool.

247
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,560
Mom.

248
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,710
Oppa!

249
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,270
No matter how desperate you are, how can you do that to Sang Man? To Sang Man!

250
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,220
That was Sang Man's decision. Why can't you understand Sang Man?

251
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,960
Still, you should have stopped him!

252
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,000
Why should I stop him? Saving you comes first.

253
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,640
- You're fired.
 - What?

254
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,640
I said you're fired. It's not only doctors who can be selective in taking patients.

255
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,400
Patients should be able to fire their doctors too.

256
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,350
Gang Doo.

257
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:32,380
You don't have anything, but why do you keep this pride? Just throw that stupid thing away, please!

258
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,740
If I throw that away too,

259
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,700
how can I live?

260
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,940
When I know that I will destroy it,

261
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,540
how can I live happily taking away what belongs to Sang Man?

262
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,740
Sang Man, come out. You'll really get in trouble with me if you don't.

263
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,880
Sang Man. Open the door. I said open the door.

264
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,970
- Mom.
 - Open the door.

265
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,910
I can't live if I don't have you or Hyung.

266
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:30,770
So, you need to allow me to live with Hyung.

267
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,410
Aren't you coming home?

268
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,540
Please understand my acting like this. Too bad if I come across as being heartless.

269
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,250
What mother would agree to her kid's body being cut open to share his organ?

270
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,800
I know.

271
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:54,860
Aiyoo, I've known you for ten years, yet I am being like this.

272
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,570
People are petty like this.

273
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,000
I am sorry, Gang Doo.

274
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,170
Stop, Ahjumma.

275
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:12,080
Why would you feel sorry? I am the one who should be sorry.

276
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,410
Don't worry. I won't allow him to go through with it.

277
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,610
Even if Sang Man insists, I won't agree to it.

278
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,520
But what can you do? Sang Man needs to live first.

279
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,230
If I leave him like that, I am afraid he will be the first one to die.

280
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,330
When I already know that no one can change his mind once Sang Man's stubbornness kicks in,

281
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:47,690
I had to try to stop him at least once. I could be more at peace that way.

282
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,090
Why are you being like this too?

283
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:58,830
Since it turned out like this already, I guess you and Sang Man will become real brothers.

284
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:04,710
Since I've gained a troublesome son like you, it seems like I will have to tighten my belt even tighter.

285
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,630
Please live a long long time and carry out your filial duties. You must.

286
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,450
Gang Doo.

287
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:38,020
I understand how you feel and I understand how Sang Man feels too.

288
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,290
Then it was difficult to even think about who's correct.

289
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,360
So how hard it must be for you.

290
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,400
It's hardest for you now.

291
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,680
I won't do it.

292
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,920
You're being like this because you feel bad towards Sang Man, right?

293
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,230
Going through with the surgery, you think you're being greedy, right?

294
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,820
But you're wrong.

295
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,330
You're not the one being greedy, but it's we who are being greedy.

296
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:26,950
No matter how difficult it is for you, it's our greed that wants you alive next to us.

297
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,700
So you don't have a choice in this matter.

298
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:42,930
Even though it may be hard, you just need to live.

I've heard that you're quitting the restaurant.

301
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:13,270
A position opened up in driving tour buses.

302
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,710
Your urge to wander around.

303
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,570
Geez, how did you endure it here for ten years?

304
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,860
Why did you choose here of all the places?

305
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,160
When it's so close by. Why?

306
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,230
Is that your way of coping?

307
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,030
In our relationship, we don't talk anymore.

308
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,120
Divorce... Let's do that.

309
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,990
So that we end up worse than strangers, we fought each other tooth and nail

310
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,780
for more than twenty years

311
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,830
to no end. Like a fool.

Starting with Bio Town, Cheongyu has decided

314
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:45,830
against any outsourcing and multiple levels of subcontracting out, practices widely accepted in the construction industry.

315
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,490
It's also a way to show Cheongyu's intention to not repeat the catastrophe of 13 years ago.

316
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,710
Since the memorial park will be built at the entrance of the town, we emphasize how it harmonizes with its surroundings as our priority.

317
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:03,460
Also, survivors of the catastrophe, Lee Gang Doo and Ha Moon Soo are personally involved in this project.

318
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,790
We paid special care in considering the victim's families as well.

319
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,280
What's going on? Move aside. Don't you know who I am?

320
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,270
Only the board of directors can attend this meeting.

321
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,600
I am a director.

322
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:26,480
Manager Jeong Yoo Jin told me you've been released from your board position.

323
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,030
What?

324
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:42,250
Please take good care of Cheongyu Environmental from now on. That's the place Cheongyu began.

325
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:51,700
Hey, Jeong Yoo Jin. You of all people, you stab me in the back?

326
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,330
Since it's me, I am doing this.

327
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:58,000
Since you're my older brother, I am not giving up.

328
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,600
What?

329
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,160
Believe me. More than anyone, I want you to turn out okay.

330
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,760
Please empty the office as soon as possible.

331
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,920
Hey! Jeong Yoo Jin!

332
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,100
 Did you go to the hospital? 

333
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,070
 Shall we meet in the evening? 

334
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,210
 Is there anything you want to eat? 

335
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,020
 You're not sick? 

336
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,390
 What did your sister say? 

337
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:35,720
- Hyung. 
 - Did you receive all the medicine?

338
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,840
You can leave. You have one more test left, but it should be alright, Sang Man.

339
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,140
You don't have pneumothorax or fatty liver. The size of your liver is good too.

340
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,000
Hyung. Don't look like that.

341
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,310
At times like this, you just need to say thank you.

342
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,750
I am so thankful, I can't bring myself to say those words.

343
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,210
Your paperwork is perfect too, so you'll get approved.

344
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,610
Once it's been approved, I will schedule the surgery right away.

345
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,330
So you must not drink any liquor from now on.

346
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,880
Let's go.

347
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,560
Leave. Make sure to answer when I call.

348
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,330
Work hard.

349
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,950
- Oh, why?
 - Hyung. Smile.

350
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,430
Do you remember what Cho Woo said in Warrior Guard?

351
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,560
I don't.

352
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,420
"A person who needs to protect something (someone) doesn't die easily." Do you remember?

353
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,000
I remember. Right.

354
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,160
That's why you shouldn't worry. We won't die.

355
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,120
See you later, Hyung.

356
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,960
Cheongyu Jeong Yoo Jin.

357
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,860
I was going to buy you something yummy.

358
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,600
This tastes most yummy to me.

359
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,150
Why? Another dating consultation?

360
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,890
I was worried after hearing you're at the hospital. But it seems like you have enough energy to joke.

361
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,210
Ask when I have energy so you won't regret later.

362
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:48,590
Then... With my looks, qualifications, and a good family too,

363
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,290
why do you think I don't have a boyfriend?

364
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,390
You're too outstanding.

365
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:02,970
This stupid group of men have this useless disease in which they get exhausted by outstanding women.

366
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:06,350
So don't worry about those stupid jerks.

367
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:10,590
Then how about Moon Soo? Is Moon Soo popular since she's mediocre?

368
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:15,280
Look here. My Moon Soo is very outstanding and a good person.

369
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,790
It's just that a courageous man like me is hard to find.

370
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,320
She must be happy, Ha Moon Soo.

371
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,350
I'm embarrassed.

372
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,720
Talk about embarrassing and humiliating things too.

373
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,950
Don't just keep them to yourself. It's better for your health to talk about them.

374
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,600
Don't be sick.

375
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,770
You're my only friend with whom I can share embarrassing things.

376
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,840
This is the real reason for my visit.

377
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,250
The unpaid compensation to your father from the collapse.
  Letter of Apology 

378
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:12,070
If it wasn't for Ha Moon Soo, it would have been overlooked.

379
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,640
I am sorry for being late.

380
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:25,100
It was discovered that the rebar your father took was discarded rebar with no monetary value.

381
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:33,860
Even though Mr. Lee Chul Woo, who died in the collapse, cannot be held for liable for the cost, Cheongyu didn't pay the compensation fund.

382
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,410
I apologize again.

383
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,930
Jae Yeong.

384
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,430
Professor. Please. It might be different once you open him up.

385
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,340
Can you please reconsider?

386
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:07,970
Look. The donor has a deformity in his artery and even his biliary tract is a case that's difficult to operate.

387
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:12,560
I will convince him. You could at least try to open him up.

388
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,760
Once you open him up, it might be milder than it looks in the images.

389
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,930
If Mr. Ahn Sang Man agrees to it, we could go through with it.

390
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,770
But if we do so, what if he suffers biliary tract stricture and complications? What will you do then?

391
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,930
You're saying you could do it, right?

392
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:23,700
Hey!

393
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,950
The risk is too high. Let's keep doing maintenance treatment for now—

394
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,570
Hey. Hey!

395
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,000
Where are you going?

396
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,430
Why did you come back?

397
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,500
Are you going to Sang Man?

398
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,610
What are you going to do when you go see him?

399
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,200
What else? I'll tell him to prepare for the surgery.

400
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,330
Stop it.

401
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,540
Stop what?

402
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:12,180
You, Sang Man.

403
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,370
- You've done enough. 
 - Done what?

404
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,690
What did I do?

405
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,340
What did I do for you, Oppa?

406
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,180
You did a lot.

407
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,380
You did a lot, so stop it now.

408
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,950
Oh. Thanks for accepting my employees.

409
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:14,290
There will be a proposal for Moksan City Library design competition next month.
 Moksan City Library Design Competition Proposal 

410
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,210
Why are you giving this to me?

411
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,850
There's no reason Cheongyu and Seowon will work together in the future.

412
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:23,130
I haven't seen another architect who is as capable as you.

413
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:29,530
I told you before. Let's have a working relationship, not a personal relationship.

414
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:33,290
No. I don't think this is a project for me.

415
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:37,670
While I'm downsizing my office, I want to work on a project I really wanted to work on.

416
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,910
Still, this project is—

417
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,750
And our relationship is quite personal in nature.

418
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,510
My mother is also your mother.

419
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,490
You didn't leave yet?

420
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,850
I'm not leaving.

421
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,830
No matter how small an office is, you still need a marketing person.

422
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,760
I'm good at marketing.

423
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,760
Of course, I can design and I'm good at making models now.

424
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,950
- Thanks. 
 - Pardon?

425
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:36,100
I'm grateful for your heart, but you'll be great at Cheongyu, too.

426
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,140
Don't worry.

427
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,720
See you again.

428
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,700
He's so cool to the end.

429
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,640
Are you really going?

430
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,130
Yeah.

431
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,030
Really?

432
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,120
Are you doing this out of anger because you got a divorce?

433
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,340
- Think it over— 
 - Am I going somewhere strange?

434
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:15,070
I can't quit drinking by myself so I'm trying to get some help.

435
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,090
While this place is getting fixed up, let me get fixed up, too.

436
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,520
I have to be healthy in order for you to be comfortable.

437
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,230
You're not running away from me?

438
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,150
I'm trying to stay by your side for a very long time.

439
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,010
Don't you dare say you're sick of me.

440
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:39,770
They say there aren't any fingers that don't hurt if you bite them. But each of them hurt differently.

441
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:47,560
You and Yeon Soo are different. I'm not saying one of you is more valuable than the other.

442
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,260
Do you understand?

443
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:02,570
I can't drink once I go in there. Should I drink one more bottle before I go?

444
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,860
Mom.

445
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,800
Hey, just one bottle.

446
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,630
You can't.

447
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,020
Hey, let me just have one glass.

448
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,060
You can't.

449
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,260
Geez, this girl!

450
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,570
 She says I can play tomorrow. Jae Yeong gave me permission. 

451
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,840
Did you wait long?

452
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,660
No.

453
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,980
Ah. I have lots of money.

454
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,940
Huh?

455
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,470
Thanks to you... I got money all of a sudden.

456
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,060
Huh?

457
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,190
Everything you do is so pretty.

458
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,500
You were born to be loved by me, right?

459
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,150
What the heck.

460
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,110
Stay still.

461
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,730
Why?

462
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,630
I'm thankful.

463
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,070
Is there anywhere you want to go?

464
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,170
I don't know.

465
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,100
I told you I have lots of money.

466
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,320
I can spend all this money today.

467
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,720
Didn't you have things you wanted to do when you got some money?

468
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,530
I wanted to pay off my debt.

469
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,910
Shall we pay off debt then?

470
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,040
I did all that already.

471
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,200
How?

472
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,480
In any case... So, you can do whatever you want to do.

473
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,500
- Over there. 
 - Huh?

474
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,180
That's the place So Mi was talking about.

475
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,740
Where?

476
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,320
 Motel  
- Hey, hey, hey. 
 - You said do whatever I want to do.

477
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,660
Well, that's...

478
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,320
Let's go inside.

479
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,600
Let's go inside.

480
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,210
Hey, you... that place is—

481
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,040
I know what kind of place that is. So, let's go inside.

482
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,810
I think we walked too much. Let's just get some rest.

483
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:28,040
What? I said we'll just get some rest.

484
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,460
Did you have some weird thoughts?

485
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,650
I really won't do anything. I'll be still.

486
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,580
I'll just sleep.

487
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,930
Moon Soo. Moon Soo...

488
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,590
I want to stay with you, too.

489
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:56,230
Do you think it's easy for me hold myself back? I'm going crazy, too.

490
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,510
Why are you holding yourself back?

491
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,850
- Are you asking me that because you don't know? 
 - Forget it.

492
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:08,430
Had I known, I would've asked you to go to an island so that we could miss the last boat.

493
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:16,090
Don't laugh. Even if you beg me to go now, I won't go.

494
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,030
Let's go together.

495
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,220
Should we eat something? Octopus? You like octopus.

496
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,060
Forget it.

497
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,230
Why are you acting this way?

498
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:33,550
Why do you only think of yourself?

499
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:37,820
I'm greedy for the first time in my life. And that's you.

500
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,860
Who cares about a sense of responsibility?

501
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,060
I like you.

502
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,400
I want to have you.

503
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:15,750
I didn't mean that I wanted to come to such a nice place.

504
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,150
It's okay.

505
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,970
But still.

506
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,990
I said it's okay.

507
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,050
Take a look.

508
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:42,230
Gang Doo. Gang Doo, look in here. There's another room.

509
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,140
It's so big.

510
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,270
Gang Doo, the towel here is huge. It's bigger than me.

511
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,620
It covers everything, right?

512
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,820
Do you think I'm wearing my clothes behind this or not?

513
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,230
Hey, you're going to get in trouble.

514
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:29,810
The bed is huge.

515
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:35,080
Gang Doo, lie down. More than ten of me can lie down here.

516
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,470
It's big.

517
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,090
Right?

518
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,320
Come here.

519
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,750
We don't need a big bed like this, right?

520
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:46,690
♫  Somehow we are  ♫

521
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,790
♫  similar to each other, no  ♫

522
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:58,880
♫  Do only my eyes see that?  ♫

523
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:06,280
♫  Our footprints as we walked together  ♫

524
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:16,540
♫  Maybe that's why I kept liking you  ♫

525
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:26,790
♫  It's an old longing to you, but  ♫

526
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:32,770
♫  It makes me want to lean on you  ♫

527
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:42,940
♫  In such a sad story  ♫

528
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:49,690
♫  You're beautiful comfort to me  ♫

532
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:19,640
♫  The day my heart melted,
 You were by my side  ♫

533
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:09,650
Gang Doo!

534
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,750
Lee Gang Doo!

535
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,890
Gang Doo!

536
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:57,620
And how about Gang Doo? Where is Gang Doo right now?

537
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:34,340
If you were coming here, why did you leave me behind?

538
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:40,880
Sorry. I had some things to take care of.

539
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:51,800
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

540
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,790
Why?

541
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,580
What?

542
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,430
You snuck a peak at me a lot sitting here.

543
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,340
I did?

544
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:21,430
 You were smiling by yourself looking at me.  

545
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,510
That's when you started liking me, huh? Right?

546
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,210
It wasn't from then.

547
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:41,130
If you count that... When you drank, got drunk, and you first...

548
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:46,290
I kissed you first.

549
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,100
What the heck?

550
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,650
Do you remember everything?

551
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,350
Yeah.

552
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:59,990
If you remembered, did you pretend as if you didn't?

553
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,560
Yeah.

554
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,570
I did that because I was embarrassed.

555
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,160
It seemed like I was the only one who liked you.

556
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:18,570
Are you dumb? To a woman he didn't even like,

557
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,960
what man would lend his shoulder all night?

558
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,400
You're so pretty.

559
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,430
How could you be prettier as time goes by?

560
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:44,550
I'd become prettier if you kept looking at me.

561
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:56,260
Oh, yeah. I had something I wanted to ask you.

562
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,320
What is it?

563
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,800
Even if I couldn't remember you, you remembered me.

564
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,450
Why didn't you look for me?

565
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:16,530
Then, we wouldn't have had to come full circle and could've been together longer.

566
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:23,710
It was dark in there.

567
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,250
Huh?

568
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:31,900
I had no idea you'd be so pretty like this.

569
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,430
I love you.

570
00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:00,660
There's not enough time left for me to live saying only the things I want to say.

571
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,020
I only realized that.

572
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:15,500
I love you... Moon Soo.

573
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:21,450
I made you struggle so much. You still like me?

574
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,170
Yeah.

575
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,920
Why?

576
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,220
Just because.

577
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,700
Geez.

578
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:40,140
Do you need a reason? For me to love you?

579
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,530
No.

580
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,760
Thanks.

581
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,940
Listen, Gang Doo.

582
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:33,410
I kept thinking about when I started liking you.

583
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:43,400
In the dark... when I heard your voice for the first time.

584
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:53,340
When you first sang that strange song.

585
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,950
♫  I don’t want to say anything  ♫

586
01:01:55,950 --> 01:02:00,820
I think I started liking you from then.

587
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:05,190
♫  I don’t want to forget your face
 Even for a single day  ♫

588
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:08,390
Are you listening to me?

589
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:15,930
♫  So I can remember
 Even if we’re far apart  ♫

592

♫  My eyes that look at you I didn’t know it would be this deep  ♫

593
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,140

♫  My hands that hold you I didn’t know they trembled this much  ♫

♫  This heart, to me  ♫

597
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:53,790
Gang Doo. What do I do? Gang Doo...

598
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,050
What do I do?

599

♫  Please let me be with this person more  ♫

600
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:03,800
 It's been said that life is about getting used to parting.

♫  Please let me laugh with this person for one more day  ♫

602
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:11,120
 No. 

603
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,280
 There is no one who gets used to... 

604
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,700
 parting. 

605
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:25,410
♫  Stay with me for just one more day  ♫

606
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:49,590
 The opening ceremony for the memorial park we've been building since last year... 

607
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:54,230
 will take place on December 11, 2018. 

608
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:01,090
 The memorial has been designed for the people to witness the timeline of the past accident. 

609
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:05,950
 It holds the meaning that history will repeat itself unless you remember it. 

610
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:14,640
 To remember the victims and to comfort the victims' families... 

611
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,420
 We hope that you will be able to attend the ceremony. 

612
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:33,310
Excuse me.

613
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,530
Yes.

614
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:37,330
Kim Seon Woong's Old Home. I heard you're enlarging the house here.

615
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,720
Yes, why?

616
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,590
 Architect Seo Joo Won 

617
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,200
I'd like to work on it together.

618
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,090
- Manager! 
 - Yes?

619
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,810
How old is it?

620
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:03,230
It's about 70 years old, but it's been neglected for the last 10 years.

621
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:09,220
There probably aren't any materials we can restore. What type of wood are you thinking of?

622
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:13,430
I'm learning about that, too. What do you think is a good one?

623
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:16,250
The unit price would be high, but pine from Oaksan would be nice.

624
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:22,970
I worked with douglas fir before, but it twisted. Pine should be harder, right?

625
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:27,750
If that's the case, why not use metal and pour concrete? Why use wood?

626
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:32,750
- Excuse me? 
 - Since it's wood, of course, it cracks and changes.

627
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:36,050
It's our job to build it with all those things in mind.

628
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,570
Um...

629
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:46,860
Would we learn anything by chatting here like this? We have to see it for ourselves to know.

630
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,730
Aren't you going?

631
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,790
Executive Director?

632
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,740
I'm not a director anymore.

633
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:14,120
Hey, you! You said my wife worries about me. You said we'd grow old together.

634
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,460
What about it?

635
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:22,400
Does someone like that hand over the divorce papers as soon as I get demoted?

636
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,450
- I'm not interested in someone else's family affairs. Leave.
 - Hey.

637
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,720
- Take responsibility. 
 - What?

638
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,420
Me.

639
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:35,690
- Give me a freaking break.
 - Hey, hey.

640
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:40,680
I'm still my father's son. You think I'd end this way?

641
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:55,260
Enjoy.

642
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:03,150
It's so comfortable from just placing a ramp by the entrance.

643
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,720
Artist.

644
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,540
What?

645
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:14,830
Oh, my! Already top 10?

646
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:20,100
People are reading such an inconvenient story. 
    

647
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,120
People recognize good work. Don't look down on readers.

648
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,160
Who's looking down on them? They're better than me.

649
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:32,660
But this girl. She's too much.

650
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,570
People would say she looks so different from me.

651
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:39,930
Right? I should've drawn her prettier.

652
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:46,150
If I drew her looking too much like you, I thought people wouldn't believe it. I'm sorry.

653
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:50,770

659

 Thank you to our page designer: jean jean.  

660
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:53,340
 Dongtaetang (frozen pollack soup) at Shintanjin rest area is still delicious. 

661
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,250
 Let's go together next time. 

662
01:08:58,350 --> 01:08:59,040
Let's go.

663
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,630
   

664
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,360
There she is!

665
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,150
Mom!

666
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:10,220
Wait a minute. I'll come after I wrap this up.

667
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:13,160
My daughter is here, so I have to hurry.

668
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:22,120
- Mom, you're going to drink soy milk, right? 
 - Yeah.

669
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,540
- Auntie, you, too?
 - Yeah.

670
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:34,320
You're doing well, right? They're making a separate salon, right?

671
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,650
Yeah. On the second floor. Huge.

672
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:40,700
How about you, Auntie?

673
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,480
I told the spa that I'll work until next month.

674
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,440
You did well.

675
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:52,510
You never used to like sweet things.

676
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:58,310
- How about him? 
 - Huh?

677
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:03,980
What was his name? It sounded like a puppy's name. Gang Do?

678
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,250
Mom, what do you mean Gang Do? Gang Doo.

679
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:13,800
She was all smiles when she saw him. So, his name is Gang Doo?

680
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,960
Yeah. Lee Gang Doo.

681
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,830
Oppa. Oppa. Oppa!

682
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:54,030
 Just as misfortune comes to you unexpectedly... 

683
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:04,230
 Miracles also come out of the blue just as we're about to give up hope. 

684
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:15,940
It's a TA (traffic accident); there's no trauma to the liver. ACC (asystole and cross-clamp) at 22:35 (10:35).

685
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,490
Ischemic time is expected to be 3 hours. Yes.

686
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:21,480
Yes, we can arrive within 20 minutes. 
     

687
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,570
   

688
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:31,680
 But that miracle could come out of someone else's misfortune. 

689
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,860
   
   

690
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:48,190
Miracles.

691
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,870
I don't believe them.

692
01:11:53,080 --> 01:12:04,620
I don't believe them now. But it could at least happen once

693
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,170
for my oppa.

694
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:18,640
   
   

695
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,530
   
   

696
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:31,760
 So, we should be thankful that we are alive. 

697
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:38,380
 We should become happier with more strength. 

698
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:59,850
Remove the A shape ladder...

699
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,910
   

700
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:05,630
    

701
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:08,190
75 cm all around... Geez!

702
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:10,380
Why is it so hard?

703
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:22,340
Hey, Gang Doo! I went patrolling alone so you could study, but you're sleeping.

704
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:28,190
I'm tired these days.

705
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:33,680
Are you okay? Where do you hurt?

706
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:39,470
You're all healed, right? You punk! You say you're sick when you lack the advantage.

707
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:46,590
I hired you because I'm lacking workers. But you're being accepted here because of me. You need to know that.

708
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:49,430
Is this what you're studying these days?

709
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:52,220
- This is too hard. I have no idea what they're saying.
 - Hey.

710
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:56,540
Did you think it was easy to become a design supervisor? Let's see. I'll help you.

711
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,670
You will, Team Leader?

712
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:00,520
You punk! I'm a manager now.

713
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,120
And it may be hard to believe, but I majored in civil engineering.

714
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:09,030
Let's see. Let me see. This is...

715
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:12,250
This has changed quite a bit.

716
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:19,650
I left it out so I could wear that.

717
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:24,730
Take it off. Hurry.

718
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,830
Aren't you going to take it off?

719
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:36,490
Hyung. I'm Ahn Sang Man. Who am I to you?

720
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:41,920
If it's for you, forget liver, even my heart—

721
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,790
Stop. I got it. Wear it then.

722
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,910
Hyung, I love you.

723
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:51,000
Read.

724
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:58,900
Sang Man! Gang Doo! Eat!

725
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,810
Aren't you coming down?

726
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:08,010
   

727
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:13,760
   
   

728
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,620
Hello, please sit there and wait.

729
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:23,300
Thank you. Thank you.

730
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:28,460
And this person. It's not a trauma. Please have him explain his symptoms.

731
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:29,990
Okay.

732
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:34,960
Is it doable?

733
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,530
One year. I'm doing this for exactly a year.

734
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:43,060
- Why are you looking at me like that? 
- What?

735
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:47,170
Don't start off with, "This is the last fortress..." Don't even think about tempting me again.

736
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:51,410
The money Grandma left behind is quite a bit. A year?

737
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:54,450
I can run for the next ten years.

738
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,710
Doctor!

739
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:00,310
Yes.

740
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:06,740
His stomach feels uncomfortable and

741
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,390
he's dizzy.

742
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:10,900
- His head?
 - Yeah.

743
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,610
And?

744
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:36,750
 I can't recklessly get hurt. 

745
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:37,810
Yes, second floor.

746
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:40,370
Please be careful so it won't touch the wall.

747
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:45,560
 If I get hurt, there is someone who will be sad. 

748
01:16:56,140 --> 01:17:01,610
 So at the most, in good health 

749
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:05,710
 without any incidents, I will live a long time. 

750
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:14,460
 That... is the thing that I can do for the person that I love. 

751
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:28,390
I should decorate this place like in the Milky Way Inn.

752
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:32,720
It would be refreshing if you were to come up after a bath, right?

753
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,310
Yeah.

754
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,690
It's nice to come here together.

755
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,250
I love you.

756
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:02,370
I love you, Gang Doo.

757
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:19,460
 Moon Soo loves me.
