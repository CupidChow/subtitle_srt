 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,130
Do you remember what I said tonight?

3
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,640
What?

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,020
I knew you wouldn't remember.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,900
So, I was offended.

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,860
You thinking about someone else in front of me,

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,810
I don't like it. I'm offended.

8
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,280
I know this is sudden.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,490
I felt that I had to tell you now.

10
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,160
I mean,

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,900
- what are you talking about now?
 - Moon Soo.

12
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,370
Dad.

13
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,210
He's my dad.

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,450
I work with him.

15
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,140
Thank you for giving me a ride.

16
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,970
Let's go in.

17
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,750
   

18
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,950
I brought him here before when he was seriously hurt.

19
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,120
The one who was practically dying?

20
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,760
What about him? Wasn't he a stranger?

21
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,870
What are you two?

22
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,580
What do you mean? I just know him.

23
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,970
Don't hang out with him.

24
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,550
Even though he looked shabby and like a slacker, he didn't seem like an easy person.

25
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,370
Why would you insist on meeting someone with issues?

26
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,100
Meet a normal person

27
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,760
and you should live a normal life—
- Mom said the same thing.

28
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,380
You're saying that I am not normal.

29
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,210
What I mean is—

30
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:45,990
You mean that I have to meet someone normal for me to look normal too.

31
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,190
As if nothing happened. Hiding everything.

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,910
You want me to hide behind someone?

33
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,970
That's being fake.

34
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,830
So what if it's fake?

35
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,920
People who lived, they need to live on.

36
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,830
How about you?

37
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,090
You can't even do that.

38
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,850
I am going.

39
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,890
 You thinking about someone else in front of me, 

40
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,110
 I don't like it. I'm offended. 

41
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,100
Mr. Lee Gang Doo. Entry log of the subcontractors—

42
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,370
 It's not my work hours. 

43
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,400
Then shall we talk about something personal?

44
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,640
- We don't have a type of relationship to talk about personal—
 - Are you okay with what happened yesterday?

45
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,730
Did you meet Ms. Ha Moon Soo about it?

46
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,050
Do you remember how I said we should drink together some time.

47
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,300
Let's have that drink today.

48
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,020
Sang Man.

49
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,880
Oh, it's Moon Soo.

50
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,920
Gang Doo, is he home?

51
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,060
He's not home now, he went out earlier.

52
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,590
What's going on? He didn't apologize yet?

53
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,460
Why would Gang Doo apologize?

54
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,810
I should be the one apologizing.

55
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,880
Then whoever it may be, hurry and do it.

56
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,810
Apologies shouldn't be delayed.

57
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,810
You said he's not home.

58
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,210
Where are we going?

59
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,700
Take off your clothes.

60
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,060
Pardon?

61
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,970
Your shirt, take it off.

62
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,900
Isn't it so pretty?

63
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,510
Yes.

64
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,150
Moon Soo.

65
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,080
Look here.

66
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,560
This is 5 kg each.

67
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,320
Ankle and waist altogether adds up to 20 kg.

68
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,080
I always have this on.

69
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
Isn't it heavy?

70
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,460
When I take it off after wearing it around, it feels really light.

71
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,510
I could even do a 540 degrees flying spin kick.

72
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,420
Then just take them off. So you could always feel light.

73
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,920
You don't know what you're talking about.

74
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,210
You are only able to feel lightness more once you've experienced the heaviness.

75
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,810
Just follow me.

76
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,100
I am fine with this.

77
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,900
You should drink good liquor like that with your friend.

78
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,160
I don't have any friends.

79
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,320
Don't I look like it?

80
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,810
You look miserable.

81
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,210
It's obvious.

82
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,660
I guess the things people do when they're dumped are all pretty similar.

83
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,460
I didn't get dumped.

84
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,240
You sure are.

85
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,010
No matter how you try to pretend otherwise, when you like someone, it's always discovered by others.

86
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,290
Why do you like Ms. Ha Moon Soo?

87
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,800
Then how about you? Why do you like CEO Seo?

88
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,080
Can't you tell by looking at him?

89
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,260
He's capable, tall, broad-shouldered too.

90
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,980
He looks so good in suits too.

91
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:08,130
You may find it hard to believe, but Joo Won was always on my side, no matter what.

92
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,580
My closest and only friend.

93
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,330
He will listen to and believe everything I say.

94
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,140
He's worthy to be liked.

95
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,000
So why does he have everything? I feel so lacking in comparison.

96
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,720
Look. Did you see it?

97
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,160
I just know where he might be.

98
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,380
- Hyung.
 - Wait.

99
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,900
Why?

100
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,510
Never mind. He seems busy.

101
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,520
Next time.

102
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,450
Moon Soo.

103
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,230
This won't do. Apologies shouldn't be delayed.

104
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,140
Moon Soo.

105
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,780
It's annoying.

106
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,240
It would be good if my feelings for him would fade a little too.

107
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,780
A person's feelings don't change so easily.

108
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,990
CEO Seo is a decent person too.

109
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:34,400
If that decent man likes Ms. Ha Moon Soo, how would  you feel?

110
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,990
You're scared, right?

111
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,190
I am scared.

112
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:48,360
Still, don't run away. I'll cheer you on, Lee Gang Doo.

113
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,750
I'll run away.

114
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,050
That's better for Moon Soo.

115
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,780
I am angry.

116
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,190
- Unni.
 - Why?

117
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,340
I'm so angry.

118
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,610
It's not like he did anything wrong. Why am I so angry?

119
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,300
Who is he? And why are you angry?

120
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,620
I don't know.

121
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,620
I just keep on getting angry.

122
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,740
If you're angry, just get angry! Why are you holding it in?

123
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,020
I can't express my anger.

124
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,010
Why not?

125
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,410
What if he gets disappointed in me when I get angry with him?

126
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,250
And I can never see him again that way.

127
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,850
That's not being angry.

128
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,340
- That's being disappointed.
 - Disappointed?

129
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:18,090
If he didn't do anything seriously wrong, but you're disappointed enough to be angry at him. You're in trouble.

130
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,610
That's liking someone.

131
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,230
Who is he? Who made you disappointed like this?

132
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:47,480
He drank when he can't even drink that well and is sleeping like this.

133
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,120
Hey. Take this before you sleep.

134
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,690
I feel like dying.

135
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,000
Hurry and take it.

136
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,400
You have to in order to behave as a person should.

137
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,390
Seriously.

138
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:24,740
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

139
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,380
I am going to sleep more.

140
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,040
Dear Gang Doo.

141
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,400
Yes, CEO. We should play a round of golf.

142
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes. Regarding Manager Lee, you didn't have to take it that far.

143
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,250
Well, if you insist. Yes.

144
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,480
What are you doing?

145
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,880
Oh, my head.

146
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,710
What about Manager Lee? Isn't it fine as long the investment has been approved?

147
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,130
He will pick on every little thing. We need to get rid of him before he creates problems.

148
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,250
You take away someone's means of living so easily like that?

149
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,900
Hey, get out.

150
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,910
Why are you doing this here in the morning when you have your own office?

151
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,380
Get out.

152
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,230
Setting Manager Lee aside,

153
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,570
what's going on with Lee Gang Doo?

154
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,770
Firing a mere security guard, is that something you should argue about coming all the way here?

155
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:19,610
Exactly, why did you get involved regarding a mere security guard?

156
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,560
The fact that you were the person in charge who handled non payment of Lee Gang Doo's father's compensation, is that the issue here?

157
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,450
- Hey!
 - If that's not it, what is it? You must have a reason.

158
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,230
When did I ever need a reason?

159
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:38,830
It's a position you could hire someone today and fire the person the next day if the job is no longer necessary. That's what you said.

160
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,110
Why are you being a hypocrite?

161
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,710
Isn't it the case of a guilty conscience needing no accuser?

162
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,600
Because I am at least doing this much,

163
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,930
you're able to do your job in peace.

164
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,600
Stop acting noble by yourself. An apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

165
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,810
Because it doesn't fall far from the tree, I am taking extra caution.

166
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,380
Because in the eyes of others, you and I look the same.

167
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,840
Regarding Lee Gang Doo, I will take care of it from now on. You stay out of it.

168
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,330
What's the reason?

169
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,200
How can I trust you to do the work?

170
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,600
Lately, supplies have been missing too.

171
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,330
The theft your father committed,

172
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,940
there isn't any guarantee that you won't do the same.

173
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,860
Tell me. Who seems like the bad guy now?

174
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,310
Supervisor is always like that.

175
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,970
His anger towards CEO Seo, he's just taking it out on you since you don't have any authority.

176
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,800
We have to do as we're told, right?

177
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,060
Oh, you'll suffer now that I won't be here anymore, Team Leader.

178
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,760
Exactly. No one can work for a long time under that jerk.

179
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,920
I will give you a call when the occasion arises. So don't go elsewhere and wait, okay?

180
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,370
Yes.

181
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,390
Yong Chan!

182
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,120
Oh, sorry. I will give you a call, okay?

♫  It's so gray, it's okay  ♫

♫  Feels like you're the one I know  ♫

♫  You sing my song, we sing along  ♫

194
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:10,020
I agree. It would be nice if anyone remembers her.

195
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,930
I guess you're moving.

196
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,820
It's chaotic, right?

197
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,320
I am quitting.

198
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,420
I have to be hospitalized again.

199
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,110
So...

200
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:59,150
I know this might be asking too much, but I would like to ask you for a favor.

201
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,030
He's Moongchi. Since he's so furry, he was Teolmoonghic (fur ball).

202
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:14,020
I realized having someone by your side can be so encouraging after going through this disease alone.

203
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,730
We couldn't get pregnant, so my wife had a hard time over it.

204
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,890
I brought a puppy so she won't be lonely,

205
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,090
but she loved him so much that we often fought about it.

206
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:40,360
Who comes first, me or Moongchi? I was jealous over a dog, it's pathetic, isn't it?

207
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,010
No.

208
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:52,350
That day too, after having a big fight with me, she went out with Moongchi.

209
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,090
I feel like I am going mad and crazy,

210
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,850
if I remember that Moongchi was with my wife at her last moments, I could endure it.

211
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,650
Moongchi was a victim of that collapse too.

212
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,770
Can you add Moongchi's name next to my wife's name?

213
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,770
Yes, of course.

214
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,110
I am relieved.

215
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,780
They say a person's pet who died earlier is waiting for a person when he dies.

216
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,110
Yes.

217
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:43,560
When I meet him there, I will tell him sorry for hating him before.

218
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,510
I will also thank him for being by my wife's side instead of me.

219
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,060
In that place, Moongchi will understand my words, right?

220
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,750
I used to have a dog too.

221
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,930
Really?

222
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:07,190
He looks like a friendly dog. Do you have any other pictures?

223
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,170
Wait a moment.

224
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,440
Did you get fired?

225
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,760
I was demoted. I guess it's a step towards my termination.

226
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,730
I got fired.

227
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,180
So, are you here to argue about it?

228
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,750
No.

229
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,140
I am here to apologize.

230
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,100
It's true my father did something wrong.

231
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,070
I am sorry too.

232
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,780
I wasn't mad at you but at the situation.

233
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:19,810
Still working under those people, that situation... I just couldn't stand it.

234
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,810
My father was a worker on the site too.

235
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,780
Your friend also came to see me.

236
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,710
Friend?

237
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,150
She came to see me for an opposite reason.

238
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,190
 Apologize to Gang Doo. 

239
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,040
I said to apologize.

240
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,720
You couldn't say a word to people who you should really be angry at. You just took your anger out on Gang Doo—

241
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,660
Yes, taking my anger out.

242
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,850
You're right.

243
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,290
I know there is no use getting angry at such an insignificant person like that too.

244
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,920
Happy now?

245
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,530
Apologize!

246
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,270
Who's insignificant?

247
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,850
Like you've said, instead of just laying the memorial stone,

248
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,840
Gang Doo went around meeting the bereaved families in order to do it properly.

249
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,130
Gang Doo's work, it's not insignificant.

250
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:33,320
Apologize to Gang Doo, tell him he's working hard, and thank him.

251
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:40,430
 I'm jealous that you have such a friend like that. 

252
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,090
 Our Pretty Photo Studio 

253
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:48,160
 Because that means that you, Lee Gang Doo, are a great person. 

254
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,070
 Seaweed Roll, Noodles. 

255
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,870
- Should I get you more kimchi?
- Yes, please.

256
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,710
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

257
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,920
Enjoy.

258
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,720
Hello.

259
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,160
Don't you... remember me?

260
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,490
Oh, you came with Moon Soo yesterday.

261
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,090
Yes.

262
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,880
So you do remember about yesterday.

263
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,400
Sorry?

264
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,550
I stopped by to get lunch on the way.

265
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,960
The site is nearby.

266
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,550
Bio Town will be built on the rear of the stream, did you see it?

267
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,110
Moon Soo works there?

268
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,390
Yes. She comes to the site with me quite frequently.

269
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,230
I will stop by often from now on.

270
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,760
Okay.

271
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,150
Owner, please give us some more soup here.

272
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,860
Sure.

273
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,750
At Cheongyoo, equivalent to the damage you've...

274
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,920
Head home, Father.

275
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,030
Mother's having a hard time lately as well.

276
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,290
Let's go.

277
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,880
You dare to smile?

278
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,540
So many people died,

279
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,400
but you smile?

280
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,080
I think there's a misunderstanding.

281
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,680
Misunderstanding?

282
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,980
You killed people and all you do is say you're sorry and that's it?

283
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,150
Is this such an easy problem to you?

284
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,800
- Sir... 
- Move!

285
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,380
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. It was my mistake.

286
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,900
Why did you make such a mistake?!

287
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,200
Why did it have to be that time?!

288
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,410
Father, sleep at home today...

289
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,860
Father...

290
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,470
Father!

291
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:17,710
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

292
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,990
What is it?

293
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,230
I left something.

294
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,300
What are you doing out here?

295
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,590
Mom. Should we raise a dog?

296
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,350
What for?

297
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:05,080
Just... it's nice having a dog greet you at home with its tail wagging.

298
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,150
You'll bring home a dog only thinking about the perks?

299
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,350
Are you going to have it just for a short while?

300
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,830
Who will clean up after his pee and poop?

301
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,080
Who will walk him? How about giving him a bath?

302
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,320
Why are you being so serious about it?

303
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,990
Don't you remember when you picked up a dog when you were little?

304
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,510
You were crying about wanting to keep it.

305
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,820
But you got lazy after a week.

306
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,710
Who's the person who looked after him?

307
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,200
You were gushing over it

308
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,000
but when it got hard, you complained that it was naughty and wasn't trained.

309
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,880
Aigo, when the problem was with you for being fickle,

310
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,770
but always blaming the dog.

311
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,080
I got it, stop it now. I'm sorry.

312
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,130
Don't bring home one because you're lonely or buy one because it's cute.

313
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,940
Don't do such things.

314
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,530
Just invite your CEO home once more.

315
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,860
Mom!

316
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,080
You're thinking about raising a dog because you're lonely.

317
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,100
He said he wanted to visit again.

318
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,870
I'll treat him to a serious feast this time.

319
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,940
Formally invite him.

320
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:23,390
If you marry someone tall and proper like your CEO, how great would that be?

321
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,310
First, get married happily with him.

322
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:33,070
And then think about raising a dog or a lion or whatever!

323
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,520
Yeah?

324
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,290
What is it?

325
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,530
Nothing.

326
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,470
 Gosh, the moon is so bright. 

327
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,200
Aren't you cold?

328
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,670
I am cold.

329
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,080
Aren't you going in?

330
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,320
 I'll go inside. 

331
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,540
♫  I don't know why I feel  ♫

332
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:12,830
♫  Wish I could tell you why  ♫

333
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:18,850
♫  Maybe we'll be on our way  ♫

334
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:25,570
♫  on some day It’s so gray  ♫

335
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:36,500
♫  I sing you a song, you sing along for once  ♫

336
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:48,250
♫  You sing my song, we sing along  ♫

337
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,820
You thought I didn't see you?

338
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,920
How did you know?

339
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,580
Just... my gut feeling.

340
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,840
Why didn't you come today?

341
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,670
Were you busy?

342
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,690
Regarding the memorial stone project, you'll have to do it with someone else from now.

343
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,280
Why?

344
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,090
You're disappointed in me?

345
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,610
Sorry.

346
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,190
For what?

347
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,520
I knew it wasn't your fault.

348
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:40,820
Even still, I should've taken your side.

349
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,600
You did that for me.

350
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,620
I'm sorry.

351
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,830
What are you sorry about?

352
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,860
- My father did do wrong.
- That's not what I meant—

353
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,050
I shouldn't have let you hear it from someone else.

354
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,840
I should've said it with my own mouth first.

355
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,590
Cowardly.

356
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,250
I guess I just wanted to pass over it.

357
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,930
So you have nothing to be sorry about.

358
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,820
Why did you come all the way here?

359
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,420
Go home.

360
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,900
What?

361
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,280
You're just leaving?

362
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,020
Of course, what else?

363
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,550
You should tell me to get home safe before leaving!

364
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,590
That's the least... you can do.

365
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,560
Go home safe.

366
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,630
Good?

367
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,890
You said I don't have to be sorry.

368
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,730
Yeah.

369
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,340
But why are you acting cold to me?

370
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,010
Take me home.

371
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,120
You always did.

372
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,970
You want me to go home alone?

373
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,280
Don't stay out late.

374
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,130
If something happens, go with CEO Seo.

375
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,550
He's capable, hard-working,

376
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,030
accomplished a lot.

377
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,200
He's a good person.

378
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,000
Why are you bringing him up all of a sudden?

379
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,200
What I'm saying is don't be like this here and go to him. That's better for you—

380
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,100
Who are you to.

381
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,200
It's my wish to go to whomever I please.

382
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,800
Who are you to tell me where to go?

383
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,530
Why are you deciding where my heart should be?

384
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,400
I'll go if I want to.

385
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,600
I won't go because you told me to.

386
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,400
But you know,

387
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,400
I want to go now, because I hate you.

388
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,000
He's coming.

389
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,700
He's coming.

390
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,200
Hey! Lee Gang Doo!

391
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,000
Then why did you hold my hand then?!

392
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Why did you stroke my head?!

393
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,310
Why did you hug me?!

394
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,800
You said I was a nice person.

395
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,500
♫  Somehow we are  ♫

396
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,800
♫  similar to each other, no  ♫

397
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:28,200
♫  Do only my eyes see that?  ♫

398
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,000
♫  Our footprints as we walked together  ♫

399
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:39,800
♫  Maybe that's why I kept liking you  ♫

400
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,300
 I'm not a nice person. 

401
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,960
 But I alone am living a good life perfectly well. 

402
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,900
 I'm bad, huh? 

403
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,800
♫  In such a sad story  ♫

404
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,200
♫  In such a sad story  ♫

405
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,800
♫  You're beautiful comfort to me  ♫

406
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,600
♫  You're beautiful comfort to me  ♫

407
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,000
 No. 

408
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,600
♫  that visited me one day  ♫

409
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,700
♫  Inside this cold story  ♫

410
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,200
♫  Inside this cold story  ♫

411
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,400
♫  You are a warm place  ♫

412
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,600
♫  You are a warm place  ♫

413
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,600
♫  The day my heart melted,  ♫

414
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,000
♫  You were by my side  ♫

415
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,200
Pyeongsin-dong.

416
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,930
It's demolition work at Pyeongsin-dong.

417
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,400
My legs hurt.

418
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,800
Two workers for Pyeongsin-dong.

419
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,300
Me. Me.

420
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,600
That's it for today. Everyone head back.

421
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,180
We have another construction site at Sinsoo-dong.

422
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,800
They are hiring someone for security work there too.

423
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,800
I know that I still owe you money.

424
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,000
Memorial Stone. It costs ₩18 million ($18,000) to just make it.

425
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,900
Even if my daily wage was calculated at the maximum wage, it's nowhere near that.

426
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,400
I don't want to owe you anymore.

427
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,900
Why are you picking over every little thing?

428
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,470
Weren't you there to earn money?

429
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,910
I need to earn money. My way.

430
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,030
Never mind about me.

431
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,000
I would like to ask you a favor.

432
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,800
Memorial stone. Moon Soo.

433
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,200
Please let Ha Moon Soo to finish the job.

434
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Why do I have to do that? It's not like you don't know about it.

435
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,600
Is there a point in bringing up Ha Moon Soo's pain more and let her struggle even more—

436
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Rather than when I got hurt,

437
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,600
it was even worse when it hurt getting treatment.

438
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,200
I told them to just cut it off rather than have it hurt that much.

439
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,600
I said I'd think that I never had one to begin with.

440
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,400
But what if I didn't have it? It would've been terrible.

441
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,800
What is it you want to say?

442
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,400
The doctor told me then.

443
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,000
If I want to heal the broken parts,

444
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,700
a pain that's even bigger than the pain that caused the wound will follow.

445
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,200
That's how the wound will heal.

446
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,740
Even if it's difficult,

447
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,790
let Moon Soo wrap up to the end.

448
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,360
You help her by her side, CEO.

449
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
I got it.

450
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,520
Don't be nice to me.

451
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,830
I'm in the middle of getting used to my misery all over again.

452
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,000
What happened that you're doing this?

453
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,600
The tile will peel!

454
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,400
I'll leave after I do this.

455
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,000
Stop it. I don't know what it is, but don't abuse your body.

456
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,500
Get out. Hurry up and get out.

457
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,000
Did I wake you up? Why are you still in bed so late?

458
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,200
Speak for yourself. What brings you here even before breakfast?

459
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,200
You told me to bring you a hamburger. You called me last night.

460
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,700
I did?

461
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:26,200
Are you not awake yet or are you not feeling well?

462
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,800
You should've let me sleep in more. I dreamt that my hubby had come to get me first time in a long time.

463
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,300
Hey, he held my hand so tightly and

464
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,600
his hand felt so warm as if it was real.

465
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,000
Then, I saved you.

466
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,600
If you held that hand and left, you would've never woken up.

467
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,500
Hey, still you should've left me to sleep more.

468
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,000
He came in my dream for the first time in a long time.

469
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,200
Even after so many years, are you happy to see him in your dream and stuff?

470
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,000
Makes me happy. Makes me feel glad to see him.

471
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,700
Such a pure love.

472
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,130
I'm not envious at all when it's all in your dreams.

473
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:07,600
As for me, I can meet him in heaven. But what do we do with you?

474
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,000
You should meet a new man and live intimately.

475
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,800
Forget it! You know I'm really bad at choosing men.

476
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,900
I'm too old to be meeting a new man.

477
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,500
Give me a freaking break.

478
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,200
You're still very pretty. So young.

479
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,200
My heart is much more wrinkly than you.

480
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,600
I guess, it's not like you don't know the world nor men.

481
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,600
I don't worry about you. You'll take care of yourself all right.

482
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,600
- Did you add bacon? 
 - Yeah.

483
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,600
They live in such a mess.

484
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,400
Kitty.

485
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,200
Kitty, you're hungry, right? Come here. Eat this.

486
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,400
What is she doing over there?

487
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,700
Mama says to give this to you guys.

488
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,400
I'm here in place of Mama today.

489
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,200
Good boy. Come here.

490
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Oh, so yummy.

491
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,700
Director, it's that way.

492
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
Okay.

493
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,400
If you're uncomfortable, should I go?

494
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,100
No, it's okay. You protect the car.

495
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:56,170
It's heavy.

496
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,090
Don't touch! Don't touch!

497
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,970
I'm not from the same type of person as you all.

498
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:19,680
You think I'm a person that has time to waste around like this? Hm?

499
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:19,260
Being able to eat such greasy food at your age

500
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,980
your digestive system must be quite healthy.

501
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:36,420
I had no idea you were struggling so much in a rough neighborhood like this. I should've come to visit you sooner.

502
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,490
You should spend the rest of your life comfortably.

503
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,930
I'll give you a very good price for that land.

504
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:47,420
You said you're President Jung's son?

505
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,540
Yes, Madam.

506
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,890
He said that he was about to go bankrupt from the collapse and

507
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,040
he gave me cheap land instead of money way back when,

508
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,490
yet what brings you here now?

509
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:03,650
My father was always bothered deep in his heart about that.

510
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,770
Madam, to be honest, that land is actually an extremely tricky piece of land.

511
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:12,730
It's an empty lot, so you can't sell it at a good price and people are leery of it because of the accident.

512
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:16,210
- Even so, we're willing to give you more than the market price- 
- More than the market price?

513
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,610
That's a lot of money, you know.

514
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,600
It's my duty.

515
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,200
Even though we're also having a hard time since the construction industry is suffering under one of the worst economies these days.

516
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:37,810
When a businessman wants it at the expense of losing his money, does it mean it's an important piece of land?

517
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,290
Well, I guess at my age...

518
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:49,210
What use would it be for me to hold onto that? It's not like I have any kids to leave it to.

519
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,950
Exactly.

520
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:57,030
If you sign today, you can stop living this way starting today. Should we reserve a ticket to a cruise or something, Madame?

521
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,650
A cruise? Well, doesn't that sound good?

522
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,080
Even just the sound of it is great.

523
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:06,710
Don't just admire the sound of it. We should turn it into a reality.

524
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,180
Now then. Right here, sign please.

525
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,620
   

526
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:19,230
What should I do? All I did was listen to you. That land fell into someone else's hands a long time ago.

527
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,920
You're not eating? You're the one paying though.

528
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,620
So Mi, I'm just about finished with this so take care of the casing for me, please.

529
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,260
I have to leave work first today.

530
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,430
Huh?

531
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,830
I'm sure you had a lot of other things to do. You worked hard trying to meet the deadline.

532
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,140
It's my job after all.

533
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,530
Um, the other day...

534
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:31,330
As for what happened the other day, take your time replying. I can wait as long as you need.

535
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,950
No. It's uncomfortable.

536
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:42,280
It's been uncomfortable for me ever since yesterday.

537
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:50,800
I know well that you're a very charming and great person.

538
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:57,720
That's why I was actually a little happy to hear what you told me.

539
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:04,060
Thanks to you, I feel like I'm a pretty okay person now.

540
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:09,710
Let's leave it at that for today. There's no need to rush your answer.

541
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,820
That's just that though.

542
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,250
My feelings for you are just that.

543
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:28,300
I want to learn from you. You're a senior that I respect and want to work for.

544
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,760
Instead of just a senior that you respect, I want to be a good man to you though.

545
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,560
I'm sorry.

546
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:54,160
If me being here is—

547
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,490
Don't make me out to be a bad person like that. I'm a little disappointed about that.

548
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,670
I'm sorry.

549
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:08,530
I'm the one that should apologize. I know forcing myself like this must be uncomfortable for you.

550
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:15,920
But I'm going to act as if I didn't hear what you've just told me today.

551
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,130
If my feelings for you were that easy to give up, then I never would have confessed them in the first place.

552
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:27,180
Instead I'll just be sure to not make you uncomfortable again.

553
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:30,820
But—

554
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:43,000
- Fired?! 
- Yeah.

555
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,230
When? Why??

556
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:52,990
It's been a few days now. I thought you two were close but I guess your CEO didn't tell you either.

557
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:11,800
  The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. After you're connected...  

558
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,070
Why do you keep coming to me for this kind of thing? I'm on the verge of getting fired myself.

559
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,450
Use your eyes and look around. Does it look like there are any jobs here?

560
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:29,040
It's because you bring in foreigners at a cheap rate.

561
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,230
Storage fee and distribution fee, they're all going up.

562
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:35,500
Honestly, we have to be tight on paying workers. If not, this place would've been bankrupt a long time ago. What the heck are you saying?

563
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:40,680
Anyway, everything is expensive in this country. People are the only cheap commodity. S***.

564
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,710
If you're going to be like this, then what do you think of getting on a boat?

565
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,990
Didn't you say you rode a boat before? You did, didn't you?

566
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:57,900
Crabs. So, I still don't eat shellfish even now.

567
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,980
It's not for crabs. Take it.

568
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,780
What is it?

569
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,920
Cod. The fish with a big head.

570
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,120
For how many days?

571
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:13,850
It's in season right now. I think the ship might go out for about 10 days or so.

572
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:18,660
These days, workers are either foreigners or old men.

573
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:23,430
If you say you want to go, you're strong, young. They'd be so happy.

574
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:30,440
My close friend is a shipowner. Want me to look into it for you?

575
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:42,190
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

576
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,380
What are you up to?

577
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,390
Grandmother

578
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,950
These small things.

579
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:02,630
If it goes inside your body, I heard your brain can't feel the pain.

580
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:06,020
How strong do you think it must be for it to fool your body?

581
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,650
That's medicine that Gang Doo takes?

582
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,320
He doesn't ask for them anymore.

583
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:16,980
Do you know when that started? Ever since he started going around with you.

584
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:24,800
I doubt he's going to be going around with me anymore. He even quit his job.

585
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,990
I think he's disappointed in me.

586
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:32,470
You really don't get Gang Doo, do you?

587
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:38,370
He's not disappointed in you. He's avoiding you because he thinks he's not good enough.

588
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:43,070
That's how he is. He's not good with his feelings.

589
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:49,030
He doesn't know how to care for himself. He's afraid he'll hurt you, so he won't open up.

590
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:54,940
His distancing himself from you is how much he treasures you.

591
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:00,550
How irritating. Who the heck does he think he is?

592
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,120
How is he able to ruin someone else's life? Isn't that right?

593
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:09,910
And let's say he ruins your life. Are you the type who'd be ruined so easily?

594
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,150
No.

595
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:18,240
Right? Hurry up and go. Don't let him hurt all alone.

596
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,590
Okay.

597
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,450
These are for you.

598
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,830
Thank you.

599
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:06,960
Ha Moon Soo? This is Jeong Yoo Jin.

600
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,230
Hello.

601
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:12,020
Do you have some time right now?

602
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,220
Right now isn't really—

603
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,850
I just met up with Lee Gang Doo.

604
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:21,660
Have some tea with me.

605
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,840
- Where are you going? 
 - To work.

606
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,200
But why are you packing luggage?

607
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,610
Because I'll be gone for a few days.

608
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,920
Where?

609
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,150
Fishing.

610
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:45,310
A sailor. Sounds cool, doesn't it?

611
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:48,070
Cool? As if. You're just running away!

612
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:52,650
Running away, my butt. Did I commit some sort of crime?

613
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,240
Then why are you going?

614
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,970
Is someone going to give me money and food for just lying around in here?

615
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:03,560
Then at least see Moon Soo before you go.

616
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,900
She's been looking for you all this time.

617
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:18,020
Even the other day, she saw you drinking with that pretty noona.

618
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:25,750
It made her super sad to see you so friendly with that noona.

619
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,320
Then it worked out for the better.

620
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,110
Hyung!

621
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,790
It worked out for the best.

622
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:42,850
You want to decline the offering money but take the punishment wine instead.

623
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,950
You're going to really regret it.

624
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:19,910
What did you want to tell me?

625
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:25,490
Although he had to leave the site work on poor terms, I asked Gang Doo to continue handling the memorial assignment.

626
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:31,130
But he turned me down. I've got a feeling it was because of you.

627
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,350
You still haven't made up with him?

628
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,540
We aren't fighting though.

629
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,120
Then, please convince him, Moon Soo.

630
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,920
I think this project is perfect for you two. The right people.

631
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,220
The right people?

632
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:52,040
There's nothing more pathetic than seeing people who feel sorry for themselves.

633
01:00:52,040 --> 01:01:00,550
You two are a little different. You two are both family of victims and both survivors.

634
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:06,170
Even then, you two work hard at the construction site without showing any difficult feelings. It's amazing.

635
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,850
Gang Doo is a pretty strong person. Don't you think so?

636
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,650
Or maybe not. He's probably different when he's with you.

637
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:23,500
Did he tell you about the hard time he had after getting injured in the accident?

638
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,990
 You're going to make it collapse! 

639
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:07,680
 - Stop it! 
- Get off! 

640
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,000
 Don't you see that? 

641
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:18,820
 It's a person. There's a person in there. 

642
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,760
   

643
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,410
 That day... 

644
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:51,360
♫  I open my eyes  ♫

645
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,990
 I was supposed to go see a World Cup preliminary game that day with my dad. 

646
01:04:55,990 --> 01:05:01,450
 If I had cheered them on that day, we would've won against Saudi Arabia 5:0. 

647
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:07,070
 And I would've scored a goal so fantastically at the next World Cup. 

648
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,160
 It's too bad. 

649
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,150
♫  even if I do it again  ♫

650
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:14,820
 - Bulldog Mansion 
 - Pardon? 

651
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,460
 You don't know Bulldog Mansion? 

652
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:21,750
 I don't. Don't change the subject and answer seriously. 

653
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,100
 You really don't know? 

654
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:29,150
♫  You were precious to me  ♫

655
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:34,800
 Then at least sing a song. It's scary. 

656
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,330
♫  In all of those moments  ♫

657
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:44,750
♫  In all of those times  ♫

658
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:48,790
♫  You always looked beautiful  ♫

659
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:51,190
 That's a relief. 

660
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,890
 That at least you're okay. 

661
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:01,330
♫  All the memories that pour into me  ♫

662
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:05,960
 That's really a relief. 

663
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:14,030
♫  How can I hold you back? I'll be here. I'll be here.  ♫

664
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:21,900
♫  I held on until it overflowed. I held on until my heart was full  ♫

665
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:31,600
♫  How could I hold you back? I'll be here. I'll be here.  ♫

666
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:43,420
Sang Man. Where's Gang Doo?

667
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:31,120
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Fated Lovers Team @ viki 

668
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:47,420
 Gang Doo! Lee Gang Doo! 

669
01:07:53,380 --> 01:08:00,990
♫  Without saying anything, for just a while, I'll look at you  ♫

670
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:08,490
♫  I don't want to forget your face for even a day  ♫

671
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:16,100
♫  So that I can remember even if we're far away and separated   ♫

672
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:22,130
♫  I'll fill my heart with you a little more  ♫

673
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:31,220
♫  I didn't know my eyes could be this deep from looking at you  ♫

674
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:38,120
♫  I didn't know my hands could tremble so much from holding you  ♫

675
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,160
♫  this love  ♫

676
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,180
 My life that might tangle even more in the future, 

677
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:46,740
 if I'm going to be ruined, it's better to be alone. 

678
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:52,510
 And so 

679
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,240
 I'm running away. 

680
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:02,700
♫  Please let me stay with this person a little longer  ♫

681
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:11,420
♫  Please let me smile with this person for even just one more day  ♫

682
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:19,040
♫  My heart is becoming greedy like this  ♫

683
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:26,690
♫  The wishes inside me keep getting bigger  ♫

684
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:33,140
♫  Please let me breathe with this person  ♫

685
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:41,980
♫  Please let me love this person for just a little longer  ♫

686
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:49,450
♫  Until my sadness subsides  ♫

687
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:53,550
♫  Please be with me, even if just for one more day  ♫

688
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,480
 How do you  know that grandmother? 

689
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,390
 She's a friend of a friend, I guess you could say. 

690
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:00,490
 Is she sick? 

691
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:04,660
 It seems like she's preparing for something. I feel a little sad. 

692
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:08,890
 Things that happen out of the blue unprepared, I'm scared and I hate it. 

693
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:12,360
 I'm the same way so you absolutely must tell Gang Doo. 

694
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,020
 It's the most malignant tumor. The rate of growth is too fast. 

695
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:21,060
 Enough with all the big words. You're saying she's dying? 

696
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:23,120
 Am I nothing to you? 

697
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,020
 I don't have time to spend leisurely talking about the past with you. Go. 

698
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:30,660
 The person who is by your side when you're feeling desperate is the real deal. 

699
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,160
 Why are you avoiding her? 

700
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:35,130
 Just look at me! Do I look like someone anyone would like right now? 

701
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,890
 I'm asking about how you feel! 

702
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:46,730
 Even though I'm worried that you're sick, I'm a crazy bastard that keeps thinking about how if I go I'll get to see Moon Soo. 

703
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:54,110
♫  Until my sadness subsides  ♫
