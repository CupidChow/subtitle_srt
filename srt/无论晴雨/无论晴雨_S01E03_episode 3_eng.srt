1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,440
  
 The person who brought me here. 

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,020
 Who is she? That woman? 

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,980
 I looked at the blueprint. 

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,400
 The things you pointed out were very accurate. 

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,000
 Why did you skip the elevator? 

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,680
 Just because it's a bit stuffy not being able to see outside. 

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,400
 Look in front of you when you walk. Are you going to stay like this? 

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,300
 You know what day tomorrow is, right? 

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,860
 If you can, forget it.  

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,750
 I really can't remember it either. 

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,270
 Mom needs to remember 

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,190
 because this is all my fault. 

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,260
 Not only 48 people, but as many as 48 people 

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,350
 died. 

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,450
 It's 18 million won ($18,000). 

16
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,850
 The memorial that you destroyed. 

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,740
 - I never said I did it.
 - I'll forget about it. 

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,230
 In return, I have a condition. 

19
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,600
 You're not asking me why I destroyed that. 

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,630
 I'm not interested in what already has happened. To me, what you're going to do in the future is more important. 

21
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,010
 Episode 3 

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,140


23
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,750
 I am here. 

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,870
 I am here. 

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,130
 Here. 

26
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,840
 I am here! 

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,720
 Over there. Move. Watch out! 

28
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,900
 No! No! 

29
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,520
 There is a person here. 

30
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,040
 I said there is a person here. 

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,320
 Trust the person next to me in dangerous situations? 

32
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,430
 I don't want to. 

33
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,840
 At the moment of life and death, a person only cares about himself. 

34
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,390
CEO is looking for you.

35
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,360
We will be in charge of the entire building models;

36
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,280
please familiarize yourself with the blueprint. Also, visit the site to cross check if there are any changes.

37
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,070
I will contact our employee at the site.

38
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,930
Oh, right. I meant to introduce you to him today.

39
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,860
I will give him a call this time.

40
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,080
- Don't worry about it.
 - Pardon?

41
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,130
You'll do a good job, Ms. Ha Moon Soo.

42
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,480
I am good at reading people.

43
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,440
What's the name of our employee on site?

44
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,230
Which area are you going to?

45
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,730
 Open it. 

46
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,770
Where?

47
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,460
 I said just open it. 

48
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,800
 Daily Log of Vehicles Entering and Exiting Bio Town. 

49
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,650
Hey, punk!

50
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,850
- What is this? 
 - Lee Gang Doo.

51
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,150
- What? 
 - Hey punk!

52
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,530
My name is not that. It's Lee Gang Doo.

53
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,230
To which area are you headed?

54
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,770
B.

55
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,680
 You just have to make a complete record of what goes on at the site. 

56
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,750
 I'll be the one making the determination. 

57
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,340
 What's the reason you would go to that extent? 

58
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,800
 Twelve years ago when the accident happened, there were a total of 11 workers who died at the site. 

59
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,180
 Of the morons who said everything would be okay, not a single one of them was at the site. 

60
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,860
Hey!

61
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,230
 The people stayed on the site till the end to do the repair work, only those people were harmed. 

62
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,430
 People who would've just wanted to have a glass of soju after work. 

63
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,720
It this a convenience store that's open 24 hours?

64
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,670
Call ahead to let me know if you're coming.

65
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,220
Today, I met a guy who sucks.

66
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,880
That's what we talked about all through the night yesterday while causing damage to our livers.

67
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,520
There is a saying that a guy is either a kid or a dog.

68
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,620
So I want to avoid him but it seems like I have to run into him because of work.

69
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,010
What's wrong with him?

70
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,310
I don't know which came first: that his life didn't turn out the way he wanted or his personality got messed up.

71
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:04,640
He only knows about himself. I get this feeling that if you get tangled up with him, your life will end up in a ditch with his.

72
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,070
- Be careful.
 - About what now?

73
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,590
People are attracted to someone bad rather than someone very proper.

74
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,160
It's something similar to how kids always put something in their mouth first

75
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,320
even though moms always try to stop them saying it's dirty.

76
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,710
You don't make any sense.

77
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,190
People do those things that don't make any sense no matter how others try to stop them.

78
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,710
What is it then?

79
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,720
I should beware of a good person since he's good. I should beware of a bad person since he's bad?

80
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,180
So you don't want me to date anyone?

81
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,360
A wanton hussy.

82
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,010
What?

83
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,460
Your friend is in pain over a broken heart and yet you date this guy and that guy.

84
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,540
I am not dating them. Unni, seriously.

85
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,810
Date them. At least one of us should date around.

86
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,080
I want to be wanton too.

87
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,240
I am going to date around too.

88
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,290
I going to live a wild life.

89
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,750
Okay, a wild cartoonist sounds good.

90
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,410
Then should I start a wild x-rated series?

91
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,450
Unni. Are you alright?

92
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,070
Look at me. Unni!

93
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,690
It seems like a temporary rigidity.

94
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,240
But since her blood pressure is high, autonomic insufficiency is a possibility too.

95
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,140
It's a symptom displayed by paraplegic patients when their stomach is irritated.

96
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,780
She needs to be hospitalized til tomorrow.

97
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,280
Please check her blood pressure every hour and please administer blood pressure medicine if her blood pressure is over 150.

98
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,780
I understand.

99
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,610
It's because you drank alcohol.

100
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,230
Even a healthy person would collapse if he drank that much.

101
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,280
- I must have gone crazy. 
 - Here you go again.

102
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,540
How is this your fault? Did you pour liquor into me? I am the one who drank.

103
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,480
Exactly. I should have stopped you.

104
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,180
I am alright so just leave.

105
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,980
You didn't go home last night either. Your mom must be worried.

106
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,870
How can you stay by yourself? Should I call your parents?

107
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,840
Hey! Then this really will get blown up.

108
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,790
It's not like this is my first time.

109
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,280
Since you act like something serious has happened, I feel like I am really getting sick.

110
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,130
Hurry and leave.

111
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,050
Excuse me.

112
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,240
- Did something happen to Wan Jin? 
 - Oh, it's not that.

113
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,190
Have we ever met before?

114
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,280
I don't know. I don't think so.

115
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,940
I see. I am sorry.

116
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,260
You're all better. It won't leave a scar.

117
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,680
Why are you smiling?

118
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,600
So you won't spit at a smiling face. 
 (Korean proverb saying a person is less inclined to say mean things to you if you're smiling)

119
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,610
Are you even sorry about it?

120
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,310
Of course I am sorry.

121
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,540
You held it in well, my Gang Doo, instead of letting out your temper.

122
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,450
You told me to let my temper out for the right reasons. If I let my temper out then, it would only put her in a tight spot.

123
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,540
Oh, my teaching was worthwhile.

124
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,420
This line of work is like that. If we just let our temper fly as we please, our body takes the toll and we won't be able to make any money either.

125
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,870
It's not easy to take another person's money.

126
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,390
The girls who work here, it may seem like they are smiling without any concern in the world. But all of them take heartburn medicines on a daily basis.

127
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,940
Oh, right. Have you talked to Mama today?

128
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,930
No, I haven't.

129
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,710
I heard that the girls went to Mama to buy medicine earlier but it was in vain.

130
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,160
What's going on? She didn't even open the store today.

131
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,040
Grandma.

132
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,500
Grandma. Grandma!

133
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,940
Why do you break in?

134
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,880
Since it's me, I am able to break in to check if you're still alive.

135
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,820
Are you here because you finished all that already?

136
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,210
That's not it. Everyone was asking me about you since you didn't open the shop today.

137
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,760
It must be nice to have such loyal customers.

138
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,240
I can't rest even a single day in peace because of the druggies.

139
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,860
Why are you like this?

140
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,470
What do you mean why?

141
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:27,290
I've used this body of mine for a long time. It's only natural that it breaks down.

142
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:33,540
Where did you spend all the money that you've earned? Look around. So shabby.

143
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,930
Why should I spend money on useless things? It's not like I could take them to my grave.

144
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,750
Then what? Are you going to carry money to your death?

145
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,550
Be quiet. Stop nagging and leave.

146
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,480
I don't want to. I am going to sleep here today.

147
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,930
I am so tired from running here after working all day.

148
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,110
I am going to sleep. Don't wake me up.

149
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,080
This rascal. It's cramped as it is.

150
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,240
That's why you should lose some weight. Grandma.

151
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,580
Shut up and lie down and sleep.

152
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,460
Do you know they started construction at the shopping mall site?

153
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:30,790
Because they pulled that crap, the property value increased a lot. Of course, I know.

154
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,660
I work there.

155
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,640
Well, it just happened.

156
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,090
Just happened, my butt.

157
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,980
Is that the only place where you could work?

158
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,480
Crazy rascal. Why do you go there of all places?

159
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,410
If not, I guess it's fate.

160
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,610
Why did you come when I said I am fine?

161
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,690
I came because I am not fine with it.

162
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,730
You just started your job; is it alright to take time off like this?

163
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,080
You know our CEO is so nice.

164
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,690
As long as I get the job done properly, he doesn't care about personal time.

165
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,610
You're busy boasting about a man.

166
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,570
Can you park closer to the curb?

167
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,270
What's that?

168
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,940
Here is another one.

169
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,380
Wait.

170
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,530
Is it alright to touch you?

171
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,260
I'm going to touch your body.

172
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,680
What are you doing?

173
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,680
You could get in from the other side.

174
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,780
All you have to say is thank you.

175
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,780
Oppa.

176
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,400
It's not like I did it to receive a thank you.

177
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,870
Are you going?

178
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,090
I am going. Sorry.

179
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:10,520
What was that, unnie? You are more than capable of doing it yourself. You were so eager to be embraced by a stranger.

180
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,610
What do you mean embraced? He offered to help and it's rude to refuse.

181
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,370
Why do I even run into him here?

182
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,970
What is it? Who is he? Do you know him? How?

183
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,550
The person I don't ever want to get involved with.

184
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,880
- The guy you were talking about yesterday?
 - Yeah.

185
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,090
I've known for a long time that you're not a good judge of men.

186
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,940
It's good at times like this. I call dibs on him.

187
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,190
It will be problematic if the doctor is his girlfriend.

188
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,170
- You know her?
 - Yeah.

189
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,410
How?

190
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,810
Just from work. Do you know her too?

191
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,670
No, but what brings you here?

192
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,150
Hey, can you make some time this week?

193
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,570
Why?

194
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:12,240
Someone is sick but she will never come to a hospital. So can you stop by to check on her?

195
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,230
If you come here to ask me this, I guess it's not just an acquaintance. Are you guys close? 
 - Yeah.

196
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,690
- A woman? 
 - Yeah.

197
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,570
Why? I'm not supposed to know any woman?

198
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,370
I will check my schedule and give you a call.

199
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,710
Please do this over the phone. Don't come find me at the hospital.

200
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,660
Why? Are you embarrassed about me?

201
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,480
Don't you know already? Leave.

202
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,160
Ms. So Mi. Are you still mad? That day, I was—

203
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,980
On that day, your face really did look horrible.

204
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,170
Do you know why I pack lunch?

205
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:35,090
It's to save money and time it takes to eat out.

206
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:41,510
Since my make up doesn't blend in well in the afternoon. I redo my make up during that time.

207
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:47,890
I try hard like this. You don't have a right to tell me how my face looks.

208
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,760
I understand. But if you continue being like this, for us to work together—

209
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,030
At least put this on.

210
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,400
Three seconds.  Your face gets dehydrated if it's past three seconds after you wash your face.

211
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,160
- Did you laugh at me now?
 - No.

212
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,400
Those people who don't know how to dress up, but treat women with make-up as bimbos.

213
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,510
I guess that makes them feel as if they are above those with make-up on. That's just being lazy.

214
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,780
Will you use the blast method to excavate the building site?

215
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,850
The ground is firm but underground water level is higher than predicted. So I am debating about it.

216
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,900
How about we drill a hole to check the hollow wall too.

217
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,340
I'm sorry. I stepped over the boundary.

218
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,630
You can keep stepping over your boundary. I thought likewise too.

219
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,860
How is the new blueprint?

220
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:59,700
Not yet. I wasn't able to familiarize myself with the site in that part of the area. I think I need to go in person to check.

221
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,390
I have a meeting with the builders tomorrow. Let me try to shift my schedule around.

222
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,430
There is no need. She could come with me.

223
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,530
I have to go to the site too. Hanyang Tech's inspection is tomorrow. They will be handling the groundwork.

224
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,760
I will see you tomorrow.

225
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,290
Yes.

226
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,350
Didn't you already agree with the site people about the groundwork surveying company? Project manager—

227
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,390
I am sorry. Give me a moment.

228
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,950
Ms. Ha Moon Soo.

229
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,740
Yes, CEO.

230
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,590
The newly constructed model, it was good.

231
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,040
You saw it?

232
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,010
The space I had in mind, it was reflected entirely in the model.

233
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,210
It will help me greatly in the design process.

234
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,600
Oh, that's good to hear.

235
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,280
It would have been more comfortable if you had come with me. You didn't avoid me on purpose, did you?

236
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,170
No, I came straight from home.

237
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,870
You're acting as if you don't know me?

238
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,030
Let's put aside that you did that on a street before; you don't have to act like you don't know me here too, right?

239
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,970
Still, it's not like we should greet each other happily either.

240
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,420
Do you two know each other on a personal level?

241
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,450
- Yes.
 - No.

242
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,070
You're from headquarters?

243
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,250
The CEO of Hanyang Tech is waiting.

244
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,830
Let's keep him waiting a little longer.

245
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's go here first.

246
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,960
Let's do that.

247
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,900
Please wait at the maintenance worker's office. You need a separate pass to enter District B.

248
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,620
Let's go.

249
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,300
The maintenance worker's office is that way.

250
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,890
Let's just stop by quickly since it's on our way.

251
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,150
They did reinforcement work due to the underground water. Let me just go check

252
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,540
Why do we need to check that? The construction company needs to check that.

253
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,540
Whoever it may be, it's good to do it since we're here already.

254
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,870
Aren't you going overboard to gain favors from CEO?

255
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,340
You should have told me in advance if we're coming to the construction site.

256
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,490
My shoes are uncomfortable. I put a low SPF sunscreen too.

257
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,530
I thought CEO already told you.

258
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,990
He did tell me, this morning.

259
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,870
That's why I couldn't be prepared like you are.

260
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,410
Give me the bag. I could go by myself.

261
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,650
What's with her? So full of herself.

262
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,580
 Danger
 Restricted Area, No Entry Other than Staff 

263
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,830
 We remember the souls of victims 

264
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,640
How about the repair work?

265
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,130
The subcontractors made this and they said it's not their responsibility.

266
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,380
Then are they going to just leave it like this?

267
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,260
I don't know. Why don't you ask CEO yourself?

268
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,150
So why would you make this uselessly?

269
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,930
Uselessly?

270
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,410
Don't you know what happened here?

271
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,150
It's not something we could just gloss over as if nothing happened.

272
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,490
I guess it must have been uncomfortable to gloss over as if nothing happened. I know that.

273
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,450
Lee Gang Doo.

274
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,620
Manager. Hanyang's CEO has been waiting for a long time,

275
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,960
If you know so well, you must know what you need to do to be useful.

276
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,060
What does it mean to be useful, exactly?

277
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,440
- Let's get going. 
 - Yes.

278
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,650
   

279
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,480
   

280
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,300
 Danger! Opening 

281
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:36,630


282
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,610
Why are you here alone?

283
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,220
Did she go somewhere?

284
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,170
I don't know.

285
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,200
Please call her.

286
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,430
I don't know her phone number. We're not close enough to share each other's contact information.

287
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,510
Are you proud of not having you'r co-worker's phone number?

288
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,600
Where did you part with her?

289
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,630
Excuse me! Is anyone there?

290
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:29,600
Excuse me! Is anyone there? Excuse—

291
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,010
 I am here 

292
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,620
 I am here 

293
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,050
 Is anyone there? 

294
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,600
 Mom. 

295
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,800
 I am here. 

296
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,150
 Is anyone there? 

297
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,480
Excuse me.

298
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,180
Is anyone there?

299
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,920
Excuse me. Is anyone there?

300
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,420
Excuse me.

301
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,150
Excuse me. Is anyone there?

302
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,670
 Danger
Restricted Area, No Entry Other than Staff 

303
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,780
What are you doing?

304
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,180
Take it.

305
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,510
Not there.

306
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,630
Wait.

307
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,020
Why were you just sitting there?

308
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,010
Pardon?

309
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,960
Over there.

310
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:25,140
You should have screamed for help. Why were you just sitting there as if you were just waiting for your end?

311
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,580
Did I help you in vain when you were planning to die?

312
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,340
- No. 
 - If that's not it,

313
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,190
why do you come here alone leaving behind your co-worker who accompanied you.

314
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,720
So what if she came with me?

315
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,540
You told me to trust no one.

316
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:52,240
You said at the moment of life and death, a person only cares about himself.

317
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,680
I am already wet.

318
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,480
I don't owe anything to you now.

319
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,830
For helping me at the alleyway back then.

320
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,780
You knew?

321
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,860
You can walk, right?

322
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,670
Then you must have known when I got into an accident with the motorcycle at the crosswalk back then.

323
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,070
Then why did you pretend as if you didn't know?

324
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,980
Seeing how you're blabbering, I guess walking isn't too difficult for you.

325
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,090
Let's go together.

326
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,040
Unnie.

327
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,990
Are you alright—

328
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,560
I am alright.

329
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,950
You're leaving looking like that?

330
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,470
You wouldn't have left her even though you knew it was a restricted area, right?

331
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,930
I didn't. It's not like I forced her to go to there. Funny.

332
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,160
Funny?

333
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,660
She insisted on going even though it was only her. How was I to stop her?

334
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,110
Really. I didn't ask her to go there.

335
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:26,090
Don't butt into other people's business either, Ahjussi.

336
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:31,670
Well, it's true that who you hate is none of my business.

337
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:40,570
Still, it's a separate issue if you leave someone in danger just because you dislike that person.

338
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,990
That's shi*. Someone needs to mind about that.

339
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,600
Get in. I am on my way back to the office.

340
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,610
No, I could take the bus.

341
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,530
Are you sure you'll be alright? I won't ask twice.

342
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,150
Go with her. I am sorry for messing up your schedule.

343
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,650
Why?

344
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,840
Take those things with you. You want her to take all that in her state?

345
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,800
Aren't you going?

346
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,970
Pardon?

347
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,990
You said you'll take the bus.

348
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,150
Which bus are you taking? Do you live far?

349
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:37,640
A bit. I live in Seohyeon-dong. Do you know where it is?

350
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,450
I've heard of it.

351
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,700
We run a bathhouse.

352
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,700
It must be nice.

353
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,340
It's called Coral Bath.

354
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Why? You want me to go there to be scrubbed?

355
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,370
No, we don't have a bath for men. It's women only bathhouse.

356
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,380
That's even better.

357
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,600
- Aren't you getting in? 
 - I am heading home.

358
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,950
You live around here?

359
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,870
Last time... Oh!

360
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,170
Oh, you startled me.

361
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,670
You got on the bus earlier.

362
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,980
It's okay. I don't like sweets.

363
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,520
These taste good.

364
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,990
Then, I will just have a taste.

365
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,890
Hyung. Hyung. Yay.

366
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,290
Oh, that. Hyung only buys that for me.

367
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,880
Who is she? Your girlfriend?

368
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,890
No, what are you saying? This is yours. Have it all.

369
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,810
Excuse me.

370
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,510
It's true that I thought it wouldn't be weird even if I died now.

371
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,150
Pardon?

372
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,280
It's not true that I wanted to die.

373
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,560
That's good then.

374
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,170
Thank you.

375
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,550
Thank you for saving me.

376
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,030
I will eat it well.

377
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,390
Hyung, let's go. Green light.

378
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,850
Wasn't our discussion over earlier?

379
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,630
Our discussion about work is over.

380
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,300
If it's not related to work, let's not meet privately. It's uncomfortable.

381
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,820
I am doing this to make you uncomfortable. This is better than if you act like nothing is going on.

382
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,270
- Yoo Jin. 
 - It's nice, you calling my name.

383
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,110
Say my name again.

384
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,870
Don't be like this. You and me—

385
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,860
What is wrong with being like this?

386
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,850
"Date without any significant issues, then get married when the time is right.

387
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:34,290
Grow old like friends who have lost interest in each other." Justifying it like that is fine then?

388
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,920
Most people live like that.

389
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,900
I don't want to. It's boring. Isn't our relationship better? More full of thrills?

390
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,780
Thrills? That's fleeting.

391
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,210
Can you tell your father that you're dating me?

392
00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:01,210
If it's a relationship that needs to be kept a secret even to those close to you, it's better to not start it at all.

393
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:52,380
 It's a separate issue if you leave someone in danger just because you dislike that person. 

394
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,420
That's shi*. Someone needs to mind about that.

395
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:04,410
♫  It's not longing, it's not regrets  ♫

396
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:12,170
♫  What could it be. This feeling that's coming on strong  ♫

397
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:19,230
♫  It grows when we’re far apart, it comes back when we’re apart  ♫

398
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:25,790
♫  This excitement seems to be because of you for some reason  ♫

399
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,030
 Take it 

400
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:32,450
♫  I’m flying on your eyes  ♫

401
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,890
 Why were you just sitting there? 

402
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,580
 You should have screamed for help. 

403
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:44,290
 Why were you just sitting there as if you were just waiting for your end? Did I help you in vain when you were planning to die? 

404
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,620
♫  Days we cried together, Days we laughed together  ♫

405
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,710
♫  I loved all those days.  ♫

406
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,720
- Mom. 
 - Yeah.

407
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,520
- Aren't you tired of it? 
 - About what?

408
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,340
How can you wear that dress for all four seasons?

409
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,800
I always stay in here.

410
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,800
Do you want to go shopping for clothes tomorrow?

411
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,490
Tomorrow is Sunday. It's the day we actually have customers. How can I go?

412
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,320
If you care about every single thing like that, you could never do anything.

413
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,080
- What has gotten into you? Did something happen?
 - Yeah.

414
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,470
What happened?

415
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,010
Anyway, you have to do it right away when you have an inclination for it.

416
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:08,750
Go out. Go out for a while before it gets colder.

417
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,390
How can you manage by yourself?

418
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,720
What do you mean? I will somehow make it happen.

419
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,140
That's right, Auntie.

420
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,370
Of course. When you're faced with it, anything is possible.

421
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,420
No, you can't. I will go out next time.

422
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,480
It's not impossible.

423
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,950
Older Sis. It's dumb to push things back at our age. When will the next time come around?

424
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:34,920
How can you be assured that you'll still be alive then? Go. Go. Go.

425
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,210
Do you like this? It's not bad. Let's try it on.

426
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,240
N-No. Let's just leave.

427
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,180
Hurry up and go. Auntie must be waiting.

428
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,780
We didn't buy any clothes for you. We should at least eat this to make our time out worth it.

429
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,100
But still—

430
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,960
I want to eat. I do. Okay?

431
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,780
Look.

432
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,420
 Aren't you ordering too much? 

433
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,680
Stop looking at your cell phone. You're acting like this when we're out, too?

434
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,000
Forget it. It's not the first time.

435
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,470
Just order anything.

436
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,400
Anything what?

437
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,360
- Now... 
 - Huh?

438
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,640
Nothing. Let's look.

439
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,500
What do you want to eat?

440
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,090
 Now, for us... 

441
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:14,670
 I felt so deeply that an ordinary day like that would never happen for us again. 

442
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,990
The woman my oppa was close to... That was you, Grandma?

443
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:37,370
I'm a woman. Am I a man? Does my gender change when I get older?

444
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,570
How are you sick?

445
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,920
Give me a shot before you go.

446
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,530
Grandma, this is illegal.

447
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:01,290
You came here not knowing what kind of place this is?  Just give me a shot and leave since your brother is watching.

448
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,980
Don't sell medicine to Oppa without a prescription from now on.

449
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:12,170
And if I don't? Where would he get medicine when his credit is terrible?

450
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,420
But still... coming to a place like this? His sister is a doctor. Doesn't he have any shame?

451
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,110
What's there to be shameful about?

452
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:21,680
You think you got to wear a doctor gown just because you're the only one who's smart, huh?

453
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,110
Him supporting you so hard with his body seems like someone else's business, right?

454
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,030
You can't even give a shot properly, yet you're so arrogant.

455
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,780
How many times have you been poking?

456
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,340
I can't see your vein well.

457
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,290
Find it with the tip of your finger and try it again.

458
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,370
Take it out now.

459
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,230
There you go.

460
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,760
You shouldn't be saying anything unnecessary.

461
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,580
How is she?

462
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:31,020
She seems weak, so I just gave her an IV.

463
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:35,160
That's good. I'm sure she can give herself a shot with her eyes closed.

464
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,450
I shouldn't have called you out.

465
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:41,200
She was full of energy when she was after us asking us to pay back our debt. That grandma got quite old.

466
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,310
She still speaks with such a mean spirit.

467
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,430
Let's go. Let's go eat since you're here.

468
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:48,010
You're not going to see her?

469
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,290
It's okay. You said she's fine.

470
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:05,190
Considering the drought last year, it's strange that there's such a high inflow of groundwater.

471
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,650
Considering the slope, the problem is also in that the safety net is weak.

472
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,790
Are you all right?

473
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,240
- Pardon? 
 - I heard from So Mi.

474
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,100
Weren't you going to tell me?

475
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,900
- It's nothing much. 
 - Even so,

476
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:25,940
if something happens in the future, I wish you'll tell me in person.

477
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:33,970
Hearing about you from other people doesn't make me feel good.

478
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:37,110
I felt bad about sending you off by yourself anyhow.

479
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,180
You really didn't get hurt, right?

480
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,800
No.

481
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,310
That's good then.

482
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,650
Groundwater...

483
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:54,530
There weren't too many problems during the ground inspection. Anyway, let's check this out again.

484
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:11,510


485
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:22,410
- I didn't do that on purpose. 
 - I know.

486
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:26,100
It's true. I didn't know things were going to turn out that way.

487
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:32,060
I told you I know. I know you're not the type of person who would've left me alone if you had known things were going to turn out that way.

488
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,020
Here.

489
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:40,740
I saw last time and it looked like you were running out.

490
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,780
I have something to give you, too.

491
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:49,420
All-in-one. This is all you have to put on after washing your face.

492
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,910
Oh, it's perfect for me.

493
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,600
You know there's a company dinner tonight, right?

494
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,710
Having a company dinner on a Monday night out of the blue is too much, don't you think? Don't we have personal lives?

495
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:03,790
Is our situation more important or is the landlord's situation more important?

496
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,040
What's with the company dinner all of a sudden?

497
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,560
Now that Director Jeong is here, let's show our face. That type of a gathering?

498
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,470
Give me a break. Don't we know what we look like? She just wants us to be the extras.

499
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:20,010
She still has lingering feelings toward our CEO. So, she's using a company dinner as an excuse.

500
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:24,740
Why did they break up if she was going to do this? I heard she kicked him to the curb. Kapow!

501
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,590
- I heard you were at the construction site. You came back just in time.
 - Yeah.

502
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,920
We meet again, Lee Gang Doo.

503
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,400
- You know him? 
 - Yes, I do.

504
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,280
I didn't know you two were close though.

505
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,390
You said you want to become familiar with our employees. You'll be seeing him often.

506
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,010
Let's go in.

507
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:05,620
- How do you know Yoo Jin? 
 - There's nothing to it.

508
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,600
I met her for the first time when she stopped by the construction site.

509
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,160
She was asking whether we're going to rebuild the memorial or demolish it.

510
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,670
To you, Lee Gang Doo?

511
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:18,010
I know. Why would she ask me stuff like that?

512
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:19,660
I told her to ask you directly.

513
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:25,770
Do you think she asked you knowing that you're the one who destroyed the memorial?

514
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:29,030
Well? That didn't seem to be the case.

515
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,460
CEO!

516
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,080
Let's go in.

517
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:41,550
♫  When to, where to, why to  ♫

518
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:47,720
♫  It's been gone, it's somewhere  ♫

519
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:57,360
♫  I don't know why I feel, Wish I could tell you why  ♫

520
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:07,370
♫  You sing my song, We sing along At once  ♫

521
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:11,030
♫  we did  ♫

522
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:28,610
Who the heck is he?

523
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,350
Who the hell are you that you're here—

524
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,850
- He works as our office site team member.
 - Hey!

525
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,480
You sit down! Don't stand in front of me!

526
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,680
Everyone, let's sit down.

527
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,310
The Director of Finance who has access to money is here. So, eat to your heart's content.

528
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,980
Moon Soo, the menus.

529
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,480
Okay.

530
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,760
- Water, too. 
 - Okay.

531
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:14,030
There's no money to spend on something like that. Just demolish it.

532
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:18,060
It's already known to the press so we can't just get rid of it. Let's rebuild it with the reserve fund.

533
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,840
Some crazy guy did it. Why should the company take responsibility for it?

534
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:28,330
Your greed led you to erect some memorial. And the person who happily designed that.

535
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:34,220
You. Take responsibility for your own mistakes. Don't whine at the company!

536
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,600
We should catch that crazy guy.

537
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,760
Rather than catching him, the first thing we should do is find out why he did it.

538
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,070
It's obvious. He's trying to make an issue of it now. Don't be shaken, you guys!

539
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:52,150
To the morons who want to rip off more money if we were to apologize...

540
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,760
Don't give them a reason.

541
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,960
Let's stop. We shouldn't have brought up what should be discussed at the office.

542
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,050
Be quiet.

543
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:04,710
It was the same at that time. The company took the entire responsibility for the incident, apologized, and paid the compensation when in actuality the architect had made the mistake.

544
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,680
- Why should we— 
 - Hot!

545
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,570
I'm sorry. I think I put on too much meat.

546
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,590
Geez, just because it's not your money!

547
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:22,030
Take your time. Why are you being so greedy?

548
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:27,560
I wasn't trying to eat it all by myself. You told me to roast them here and send them down because of the smoke.

549
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,190
Unni, is your hand okay?

550
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,880
It should be okay. It's nothing.

551
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,180
Please don't worry. I won't whine at the company asking you to take responsibility for it.

552
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,970
Who'd like to have some 7-Up?

553
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,440
Moon Soo.

554
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,810
Why do you bring me these?

555
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,820
I didn't think you'd come back in. I thought you'd just leave.

556
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:36,250
- I'm sorry. 
 - You don't have to feel sorry towards me.

557
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:40,470
I felt stuffy. It's nice to get some fresh air.

558
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,380
Where is the CEO?

559
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,240
I'm not sure.

560
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:21,840
Thank you for the meal. I don't think this dinner meeting is suitable for a construction worker like me.

561
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,860
All right then.

562
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,980
Did I have too much to drink?

563
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,600
I'm sorry, Director.

564
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:49,240
No, I'm fine. I can take the bus.

565
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,120
I want to take you home. Get in.

566
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,320
I'm sorry I couldn't take care of you.

567
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,420
I didn't invite you to dinner to do busy work.

568
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,300
Excuse me?

569
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,780
No, it's okay.

570
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,930
I don't think it was okay.

571
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,480
I'm really fine.

572
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,460
Moon Soo, you laugh when you feel uneasy or uncomfortable. You know that?

573
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,150
- Do I? 
 - See? You're laughing again.

574
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:40,170
You won't tell me why you do that even if I ask, right?

575
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,940
I knew it.

576
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,480
Thank you.

577
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:48,240
   

578
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,700
   

579
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:59,230
♫  When we, where we, why we  ♫

580
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:04,690
♫  On some day, it's so gray  ♫

581
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,540
♫  When to, where to  ♫

582
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,950
 She was asking whether we're going to rebuild the memorial or demolish it. 

583
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,130
 To you, Lee Gang Doo? 

584
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:20,260
 Do you think she asked you knowing that you're the one who destroyed the memorial? 

585
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:27,170
♫  It's so gray, it's so gray  ♫

586
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,080
♫  I sing your song  ♫

588
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:35,770
♫  You sing along, for once  ♫

589
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,110
Where are you going so early in the morning?

590
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:50,830
I can't sleep.

591
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:55,180
You can't seem to sleep well these days. Eat before you go.

592
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,240
Just do one thing at a time. Sleep more.

593
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,420
Wait, wait, wait.

594
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:08,830
How would you work on an empty stomach?

595
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:10,830
Thanks for the food.

596
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,040
What the heck?

597
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,110
Did I surprise you?

598
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,900
Of course, I'd be surprised. How about you?

599
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,490
You're not surprised even seeing a man naked?

600
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:48,060
I've seen you like that before when you were down and all beat up.

601
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,470
Thanks for the jacket.

602
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:01,330
You didn't have to come on purpose over this.

603
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:04,440
I didn't come here on purpose just because of that.

604
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,340
There's something I'm curious about.

605
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,870
Why did you do it?

606
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:20,390
   

607
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:22,310
   

608
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,590
No way...

609
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:28,180
There are tons of things in the world that don't make sense.

610
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,960
The site manager demolished it when there wasn't even an order to do it?

611
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,350
Because you were mistaken?

612
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,120
Yes.

613
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,930
You're lying.

614
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,970
You did it on purpose, right?

615
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:50,870
What if I did. What does it matter to you?

616
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:58,510
Is there a name you recognize?

617
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:08,070
Or... Were you here?

618
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,940
You were here.

619
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:22,120
 Over here... 

620
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,970
 Is anyone here? 

621
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:27,400
 Over here. 

622
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,970
 Mommy. 

623
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:39,840
 Over here. Is anyone here? 

624
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:45,120
 Is someone here? 

625
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:48,290
 Yes, I'm here. 

626
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:53,470
 You're there? What a relief. 

627
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:57,530
 Where are you? 

628
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,190
 Can you move? 

629
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:05,930
 Just a moment. 

630
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,710
 I can't see anything. 

631
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:24,230
 - Can you hear my voice? 
 - Yes. 

632
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:30,090
 Then, I'll keep talking. Come this way. 

633
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:06,980
 Why don't you say anything? Are you okay? 

634
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:19,940
 I can't think of anything to say. 

635
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:26,540
 Then sing a song. I'm scared. 

636
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,730
 I can't sing. 

637
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:31,980
 It's okay. Just sing. 

638
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:50,990
♫  Nearer, nearer 

639
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:57,530
♫  On the ground, come closer 

640
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:04,310
♫  Meeting you isn't a dream 

641
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,790
 I can see you. 

642
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:12,910
 I can see you. 

643
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:18,930
 Don't come closer! 

644
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,950
 Don't come closer. 

645
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:54,980
 That strange song from earlier. Who sang that song? 

646
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,720
Bulldog Mansion.

647
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,080
What?

648
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,730
Don't you know Bulldog Mansion?

649
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,120
I don't know.

650
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,380
You really don't know?

651
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:23,450
♫  Sunrise in your eyes  ♫

652
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:28,270
♫  Shines on your face  ♫

653
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,670
♫  We rise from the low   ♫

654
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:37,670
♫  Where will we go from here  ♫

655
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,530
♫  Falling apart  ♫

656
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:44,290
   

657
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,140
 Are you looking for Unni? 

658
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,140
 You scared me! 

659
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,310
 Unni didn't come in yet. 

660
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,640
 The steps aren't the only spot you do this. 

661
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,640
 What? 

662
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,330
 Look ahead. 

663
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:58,490
 Did you come to see me? 

664
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:00,570
 No. 

665
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:04,360
 What kind of work did you do with Ha Moon Soo? 

666
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,280
 Something that has nothing to do with you, CEO. 

667
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,020
 Do I have to report to you about my personal life? 

668
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,180
 Ha Moon Soo, you belong to me. 

669
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,830
 Don't be intimidated in front of other people. 

670
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:20,090
 You can date a new woman. However, 

671
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:22,890
 don't let me see you with her. 

672
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:26,280
 Could a man and woman be friends? 

673
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,190
 It's something that could drive me crazy. 

674
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,270
 I'd have to hide my feelings. 

675
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:35,670
 If I want to see her close even if it means we remain friends. I can't help it. 

676
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:48,310
