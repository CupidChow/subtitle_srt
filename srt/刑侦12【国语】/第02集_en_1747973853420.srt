1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You mocked me!

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Arabia\'b0

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't beat you!

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll kill you too!

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I can't beat you!

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,400
I was Release The Mistake

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hello, Mr. Fu.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I am theihi of the Central reflections group,

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm Ding Zer's teammate.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I have some questions to ask you.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Just in time.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So I won't be a general, okay?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then you can tell me.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I know.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You are a representative of the Dongnan-Yat Transmission Group.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But the people we found,

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
you don't want to sell them at all.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You like them.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You even want to put them by your side.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You like to play with them.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You treat them as your enemies.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You train them, listen to me.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You train them to treat you as their master.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right?

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I finally meet someone who is almost as good as me.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Not at all.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Because I've always thought about it.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's like Mr. Fu.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What do you want?

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why do you do such a thing?

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You won't understand my world.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You won't understand their world.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They always complain about others.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
They say that this world is unfair.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But they never thought about it.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The reason they live in this world is to take revenge.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm so noble.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So I want them to see me.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's just trash.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's useless.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm their god.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Because only I'm here.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They can survive.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What about Zeng Jiayi?

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He escaped.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You didn't find anyone to catch him.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You really didn't let him take you out?

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's so weird.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Zeng Jiayi just told us that he was released.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That person was killed by you?

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You really killed him?

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Open the door!

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We'll arrest you if you don't open the door!

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you have evidence?

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We'll keep you for 48 hours.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We've been playing with you for 2 hours.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If you find the victim in the remaining 46 hours,

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you'll be able to find your killer's evidence.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What do you mean?

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You're under the violation of the procedure.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can't be a court witness.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We'll keep you for the rest of the time.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll go and check the surveillance camera.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, you go out.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll go check the camera.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you know that you can't do that?

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Fu Yingming is not a simple person.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There's a whole company supporting him.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you don't do that,

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
do you have a better way?

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The surveillance camera is all turned off.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How do I know?

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, let's start!

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's go!

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm Zhiyuan.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's go back to the hospital.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay!

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wait for me at the elevator.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Are you okay?

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't worry.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What's the matter?

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What's the matter?

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you okay?

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm fine.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, let's go.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What happened?

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm fine.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm fine.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What happened?

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm fine.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What's the matter?

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm fine.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What happened?

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Auntie Jia,

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
do you want to eat

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
your mom's stew?

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Western-style pork bone stew,

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
rice noodles,

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and small-sized bean stew,

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
tomato, potato, and beef stew,

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
are all your favorite dishes, right?

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How do you know?

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Your mom made me stew

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
every day to find you.

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
She gave me soup every day to deliver to the police station.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Every time,

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
she told me a lot about you.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
She said she did this to thank me,

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
but I know

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
she really misses you.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
She misses you so much that you came back

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and cooked her soup.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She said she was always very old

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and didn't know you well.

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Even before she died,

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
she told me

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
she must find you.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay,

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've found you.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But you didn't tell us anything.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How can we help you?

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How can we explain to your mom?

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Auntie Jia,

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I really want you to tell me

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
what happened.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I was in a

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
game room

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and I met Fuyi Ming

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
at the event.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
At first, I knew a new friend.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We were together for a long time.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
She really loved me.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She loved me and took good care of me.

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But she was very bad.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
She was very stubborn.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
She was very stubborn.

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
She didn't allow me to talk to others

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and I didn't allow me to contact other people.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
One day, she told me

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
that if I didn't go back home with her,

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
she would break up with me.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was really scared.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was scared to lose her.

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I followed her

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to the village where she was.

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then she came to you.

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We...

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We had a lot of people.

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
A man who was begging for her

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
was the one who let me go.

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Then I came out.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Auntie Jia, don't be afraid.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We will protect you.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No one will hurt you.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No one will hurt you.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There will be a fire in the middle of the night

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to help you record a confession.

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Just say what you just said to me.

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Just say it once.

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then we can catch her.

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Then we can also teach your mother.

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Auntie Jia.

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
How can you say that to Auntie Zeng?

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You asked me that just now.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Even if you ask me,

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I can't find out the result.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
She is a victim.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And she needs to be gentle.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
How can you be so close to her?

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You don't need to.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because no woman will like me.

203
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Come in.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Wait.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
How did you find out about the case

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
of Fu Yiming's murderer?

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I still need some time.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I know.

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You think this case

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
has something to do with the Xiyue Group.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But your opponent

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is the whole Xiyue Group.

213
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I know.

214
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You should know

215
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Fu Deshan's work.

216
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm afraid you will not succeed

217
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and beat him up.

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Are you afraid that they will be in the 42nd floor?

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But we can't let them

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
do anything to us.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If we miss this chance,

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
we will lose in the future.

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Do you think I don't want to?

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can help you

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
on the last episode.

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But the public opinion

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
of the Xiyue Group

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
is so bad.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If anything happens,

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
we will lose the reputation of the police.

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't worry, Maiden.

232
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I have some evidence.

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Give me some time.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I will find out.

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Most of the victims

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
are missing persons.

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You should start

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
investigating from the missing persons.

239
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't go to the Xiyue Group again.

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I know, Maiden.

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sorry.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
How is it?

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm Xing Kai.

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The increase can be said.

245
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
OK.

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'll be there.

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Bye.

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Kai, it's done.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes.

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Are we really

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
going to be a witness?

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
According to what Zeng Jiayi said,

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
we can replace the victims.

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The Xiyue Group

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
is the only group

256
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that has been involved

257
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
in the Xiyue Group.

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The Xiyue Group

259
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
is the only group

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
that has been involved in the Xiyue Group.

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The Xiyue Group

262
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
is the only group

263
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
that has been involved in the Xiyue Group.

264
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The Xiyue Group

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
is the only group

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that has been involved in the Xiyue Group.

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The Xiyue Group

268
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
is the only group

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that has been involved in the Xiyue Group.

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The Xiyue Group

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is the only group

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that has been involved in the Xiyue Group.

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The Xiyue Group

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
is the only group

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
that has been involved in the Xiyue Group.

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The Xiyue Group

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
is the only group

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
that has been involved in the Xiyue Group.

279
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The Xiyue Group

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
is the only group

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that has been involved in the Xiyue Group.

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Reynard

283
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He stretch

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Activate at a ×

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
L

286
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
crowds

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
increase

288
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I really don't want to betray Fu Yiming.

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Because besides my mother,

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
he is the best person in the world.

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You are so heartless.

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's not like that.

293
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You have to be careful.

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
How do you find out?

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I have no problem.

296
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You want to catch Fu Yiming?

297
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't want to.

298
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't want to.

299
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You want to catch Fu Yiming?

300
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You can do anything.

301
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You can stand behind the news.

302
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Even if I stand behind the news,

303
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I will continue to investigate.

304
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I promised my mother that I will find her daughter.

305
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't do it now.

306
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So I will find that murderer.

307
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Go.

308
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Go.

309
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Go.

310
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Go.

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The police will find some evidence sooner or later.

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Mr. Fu has arranged to let you leave Hong Kong.

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You can leave after 48 hours.

314
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
As long as you leave,

315
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
everything will be on you.

316
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You have no relationship with the Xieye Group.

317
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't come back after you leave.

318
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Are you okay?

319
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm fine.

320
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He didn't have any evidence to sue me.

321
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I mean, he has increased his memory.

322
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We have found him for over a year.

323
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We finally found him.

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I didn't expect him to lose his life in this way.

325
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I know you are sad.

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This is not the first time I am sad.

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No matter what, this is not your fault.

328
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I know.

329
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's Fu Yiming's fault.

330
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Mr. Fu.

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
He is innocent.

332
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He just wants to increase his memory.

333
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I asked the people in the Zhong'an Group.

334
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You didn't cause the death of Zeng Jiayi.

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's okay.

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's great.

337
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I know you are smart.

338
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Of course I know.

339
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I want to investigate the case.

340
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You are lucky.

341
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You didn't record the case.

342
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Otherwise, I would be in trouble.

343
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
By the way, why don't you clear the house?

344
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Put a few stars in the office.

345
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Sir.

346
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's the decision.

347
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I want to put a house.

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Sir.

349
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Sir.

350
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That brat is useless.

351
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I told you to send him to Canada.

352
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He will be killed.

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You didn't listen to me.

354
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Now, you are in such a big trouble.

355
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It won't only affect the company.

356
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You even lost a few big businesses.

357
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Sir.

358
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I beg you.

359
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You only have one grandson.

360
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Can you forgive him again?

361
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No.

362
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I have arranged everything.

363
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He left the police station.

364
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Someone sent him to the port.

365
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Of course, someone took him away.

366
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Is there any other way to get on the ship?

367
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No.

368
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The police will pass the check.

369
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
They will find out about our company.

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I often teach you.

371
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you can't affect our company's image,

372
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and our company's company,

373
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
do you have any brain to remember me?

374
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Sir.

375
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Can I send him to the ship?

376
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No.

377
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If you want him to leave successfully,

378
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
don't contact him.

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Besides the lawyer,

380
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
no one can contact me without my approval.

381
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Sir.

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Sir.

383
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Sir.

384
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I am his father.

385
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Why can't I get on the ship?

386
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If you don't want me to get on the ship,

387
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
at least tell me where you want to send him.

388
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I told you not to bring that brat back.

389
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You didn't listen to me.

390
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I told you not to be with that woman.

391
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You didn't listen to me.

392
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Now, you are in trouble.

393
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What's the use of your temper?

394
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I have a grandson.

395
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He died ten years ago.

396
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Dad.

397
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Dad.

398
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Dad.

399
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Dad.

400
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Dad.

401
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Hello.

402
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Please come in.

403
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Thank you.

404
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Please help me to get a car to the Victoria University.

405
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Okay.

406
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The Dismissed Immigration of the West Group is still under control.

407
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The police has not revealed any case.

408
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But the police said that

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
the police will definitely handle the case.

410
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I am going to put the price down.

411
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Help me to pay the debt.

412
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What's the matter?

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You helped increase the death toll in the first half.

414
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He doesn't have a family in Hong Kong.

415
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
He needs someone to take care of him.

416
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He needs to be taken care of.

417
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Do you know why?

418
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I know I will get a color.

419
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I will still investigate this case with you.

420
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I was a little transparent.

421
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I didn't like my senior brother.

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No one taught me what the police's mission is.

423
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Until you accept the case and increase the death toll.

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
After seeing his mother's reaction,

425
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I knew what my mission is.

426
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I will never forget this life.

427
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You should have quickly forgotten him.

428
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because he is already dead.

429
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We are just a small screw in this system.

430
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We can't control the result, right?

431
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The most important thing is that we have tried.

432
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Don't worry.

433
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I think his mother must be very grateful to you.

434
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Since then,

435
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I have been a police officer.

436
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I should be like you.

437
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Don't be like me.

438
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I will be unlucky.

439
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
How can that be?

440
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I can learn a lot from you.

441
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I have decided.

442
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I will go where you go.

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Anyway,

444
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
don't follow me.

445
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Follow me will kill me.

446
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You are so heartless.

447
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I will like you.

448
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I will not tell you.

449
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
My stomach hurts.

450
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I will come back to give you a new love.

451
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I can't see him off.

452
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I am so happy.

453
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Why are you back?

454
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Where is my Bluetooth headset?

455
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It has been used for a month.

456
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You didn't accept me with your headset?

457
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You are too stupid.

458
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You should be smarter when you come out to steal.

459
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I think he broke up with me.

460
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We have nothing to do with it.

461
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You said we broke up.

462
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You said you have no feelings with him.

463
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I asked you out today

464
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
to tell you clearly.

465
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We are impossible.

466
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Shi Fei.

467
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Enough.

468
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I am not the one who wanted to steal from you.

469
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I just want to prove that

470
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
my heart is right.

471
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You and I are not suitable.

472
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
We are good friends.

473
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We don't have to be so hard to see.

474
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Shi Fei.

475
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Shi Fei, listen to me.

476
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's not my business to be with this woman.

477
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Mr. Chen.

478
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Before the second round,

479
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I have already broken up with you.

480
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I will immediately go to your company

481
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
if you put your things in my house.

482
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What are you talking about?

483
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Let's talk about it when we go home.

484
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Why do you want to talk about it here?

485
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You think you have more things

486
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
than others?

487
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You pretend to be cool in front of the weak.

488
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You become a coward in front of the strong.

489
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You are a weak man.

490
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Enough.

491
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Shut up and learn from your heart.

492
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If you didn't have such temper,

493
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
how could I go to someone else?

494
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I am in love with you.

495
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I seem to face the strong side of me every day.

496
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
No one can go to your side.

497
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Fine.

498
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's break up.

499
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I will not let you go without a man.

500
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because I have been with you for a long time.

501
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Let go of me.

502
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You are wearing my clothes.

503
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let go of me.

504
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Let go of me.

505
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I told you to let go of me.

506
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Police.

507
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You can't hit women here.

508
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Now you are in the public room.

509
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You are disturbing the order.

510
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I want to take you back to the police station.

511
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Sir.

512
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't explain.

513
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Thank you, sir.

514
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Miss.

515
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You too.

516
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Jiang Zilong.

517
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What is it?

518
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The key.

519
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's none of my business.

520
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You should know what it is when you go back.

521
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I need to see your ID.

522
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I will go back to the police station.

523
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Miss.

524
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We have seen the construction of the bar.

525
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It is really none of your business.

526
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Look.

527
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
If there is any problem,

528
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
you can go ahead.

529
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I am sorry.

530
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I have to trouble you.

531
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Thank you, sir.

532
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This is a good cop.

533
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He is a good cop.

534
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Call me if you need anything.

535
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Okay.

536
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Sorry.

537
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Boss.

538
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's done.

539
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Hurry up.

540
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Sir will scold us.

541
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
He is not here.

542
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Miss.

543
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I will send you.

544
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
This way.

545
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Okay.

546
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Are you the cop who responsible for the case?

547
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It is the missing case of Zeng Jiayi.

548
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
The girl who jumped from the hospital?

549
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes.

550
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But the person responsible for the case is this person.

551
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
If you arrange for Zeng Jiayi to see a psychologist early,

552
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
he won't die.

553
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Le.

554
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Can you ask me what does he mean?

555
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Zeng Jiayi was locked up for a year and a half.

556
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
He didn't get hurt or was abused.

557
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That means the suspect took good care of him.

558
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
In this case,

559
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Zeng Jiayi is easily involved in the Sudeger's crime.

560
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Le.

561
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Ask him if he has already intentionally closed the suspect

562
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
when he started.

563
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Obviously,

564
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
the cop who responsible for the case has completely neglected this.

565
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So he is likely to commit suicide.

566
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Miss.

567
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Miss.

568
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You and Zeng Jiayi seem to know each other.

569
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What's your relationship?

570
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I have a channel in X-Stars

571
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
to analyze some strange cases

572
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
with psychology.

573
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I have also studied the case of Fu Yiming.

574
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's you.

575
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I often watch your videos.

576
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Anyway, Zeng Jiayi's death

577
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
was completely caused by the police.

578
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He is right.

579
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
At first, you ignored his feelings.

580
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Maybe I offended two people.

581
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But these are all my professional judgments.

582
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I see.

583
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You are more than willing to act professionally

584
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
on the court.

585
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You also like to share your own opinion.

586
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Have we seen each other before?

587
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Maybe you are professional in theory.

588
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But what we are talking about now

589
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
is a real case.

590
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I will investigate this case

591
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
with my own method.

592
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
According to your investigation,

593
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
you can't catch the Fu Yiming.

594
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,340
Did you ever

595
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,000
read the case of Fu Yiming's crime?

596
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
The simple thing is

597
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
you think I won't commit suicide

598
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,320
Do you think I won't do it?

599
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
What about the people in the family who grew up behind the scenes?

600
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
I didn't do the test.

601
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,720
I don't know what he's thinking.

602
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,920
How do you think he'll do the next step?

603
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,320
If it's not a research, it's a real battle.

604
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,720
I'll definitely catch him.

605
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,120
Fu Yiming is Fu Chengshan's private child.

606
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,320
He's a very strong and traditional Fu De Shan.

607
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,520
He doesn't like this unruly grandson.

608
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,400
Recently, many netizens have been asking about

609
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,160
Fu Yiming's classmates and friends.

610
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,600
They've got a conclusion.

611
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,800
That is, Fu Yiming is not important to the Fu family.

612
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,760
So no matter what Fu Yiming does,

613
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,400
the Fu family should send him away for the first time.

614
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,600
The only chance you can get from him is the spirit.

615
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,840
Stop being affected by emotions.

616
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,520
What he said is really useful.

617
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Hey!

618
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,320
If he really wants to hide his body,

619
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,160
where do you think he'll hide it?

620
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,560
You ask me.

621
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,680
Xing Kai completed his real-time training in 2011.

622
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,520
He went to Hong Kong Island to study in Xi Qu's Central Anzu.

623
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,320
He's been a very high-level student for so many years.

624
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,880
He recommended him to be a high-level student every year.

625
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,040
But he doesn't get a degree every time he's in the exam.

626
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,240
So he's still a student now.

627
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,400
He might not get a degree on purpose.

628
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,680
I know this person always likes to cause trouble everywhere.

629
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,480
It must be hard to work with him.

630
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,880
Let's not talk about it.

631
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,200
How is Fu Yiming doing?

632
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,240
I've already called all the firemen to check on the route that the victim was on.

633
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
Let's see if there's any new clue.

634
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Okay.

635
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,600
Come in.

636
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
You go out first.

637
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,000
Yes, sir.

638
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,000
Hello, Mr. Ding.

639
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,200
Close the door.

640
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,080
Sorry, sir.

641
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,400
Why are you apologizing to me?

642
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,080
Didn't your superior punish you?

643
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
It's because my superior wants me to leave the house.

644
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,840
That's why I came to ask for your help.

645
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,080
I'm going to find Fu Yiming's criminal evidence.

646
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,320
It seems that punishment is useless to you.

647
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,680
Don't interfere with this case.

648
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,000
It's different this time.

649
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,880
Because I'm very confident.

650
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,760
Sit.

651
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,120
The psychological analysis shows that Fu Yiming is a person who is extremely short of consent.

652
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,680
He is also a criminal who is against the society.

653
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,600
He is a person who has never been short of anything since he was a child.

654
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,440
He enjoys the power to decide other people's lives.

655
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,120
If he wants to hide,

656
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,760
he should be put in a place where he can see.

657
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,120
For example, a house.

658
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,320
He should be rewarded as a war criminal.

659
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,600
So I think the victim who was missing is his family.

660
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,960
We shouldn't look for any evidence that betrays the people.

661
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,440
Instead, we should look for evidence that murders him.

662
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,760
If possible, you can apply for a search warrant right now.

663
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,600
Go to his house to search for evidence.

664
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,400
If your reasoning is wrong, you know the consequences and the consequences.

665
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,560
Why should I believe you?

666
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,480
Because if we don't try, we won't know.

667
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,600
If it's wrong, I'll be responsible.

668
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,400
I only know that I must catch Fu Yiming.

669
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,320
But if it's my choice.

670
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,400
I never am so sure.

671
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,800
What kind of operation if the merchant 98 discover them?

672
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,600
If I am exposed, I will be blinded by this human figure.

673
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,960
I will be free if he can catch them.

674
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
I'm Kun Fei.

675
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,960
You can find voters for me,

676
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,680
toigent yourâ14.

677
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
The police are trying to kill someone.

678
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
They are trying to kill someone.

679
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Hey, hey, hey!

680
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Be careful, be careful, be careful!

681
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Hey, there's no movement here!

682
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
The police are trying to kill someone.

683
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
The police are trying to kill someone.

684
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
They are trying to kill someone.

685
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,680
They are trying to kill someone.

686
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
They are trying to kill someone.

687
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
They are trying to kill someone.

688
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,680
They are trying to kill someone.

689
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
They are trying to kill someone.

690
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,680
They are trying to kill someone.

691
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Wait.

692
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
How is it?

693
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Wait, I found it.

694
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Wait, I found it.

695
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
I found it.

696
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
It's right next to your house.

697
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
What?

698
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I'm happy to see it every day.

699
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Zhu Tian Lang, 25 years old.

700
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,680
He disappeared on May 8, 2022.

701
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,680
He is the one who saved Zeng Jiayi.

702
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Then he was killed.

703
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Now we will sue you for shooting Zhu Tian Lang.

704
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Now we will sue you for shooting Zhu Tian Lang.

705
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,680
You suspect me for a few photos?

706
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Where's the evidence?

707
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Our witness has been tested on the human skin tissue

708
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,680
that was killed by the victim's finger.

709
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
It will definitely be the one who will be killed.

710
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Fu Yiming is now in the defense.

711
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
He is in a very bad state.

712
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,680
He is worried that you might find the evidence to kill him.

713
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
He will be punished this time.

714
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
Look carefully.

715
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
How is it? Is there any news from the witness?

716
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
They said there is no result yet.

717
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
But they said it was a warning.

718
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
We must be at 6 o'clock to be punished.

719
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
I'll go after them.

720
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,680
You go out first.

721
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,680
Fix the gun.

722
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,680
Fix the gun.

723
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Fix the gun.

724
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Exactly.

725
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,680
Because the intent of the murder is to impair the DNA,

726
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
after passing on,

727
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
the evidence that he produced

728
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
was put into the norm.

729
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,680
This picture is very strange.

730
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,680
and then he ignored it.

731
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
It was the dead's nails.

732
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
Other than the letters,

733
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
there were also evidence, including the death.

734
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,680
That day, when he was in the pig's shed,

735
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
after killing the pig's father,

736
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
he took the dead body home.

737
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,680
He thought that home was a place

738
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
where no one would be found.

739
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
After the death,

740
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,680
he didn't know that the dead body

741
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
was in the same house.

742
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Because he thought that he was tall and handsome,

743
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
he would never live with such a low-heeled person.

744
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
But he didn't want to give up his own stand.

745
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,680
So he found a place

746
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
where he could see the place

747
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
when he woke up in the morning

748
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
or when he was sleeping at night.

749
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Because you like this feeling.

750
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
This feeling.

751
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
I don't want to control these people.

752
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
If I'm wrong,

753
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
you come and tell me the truth.

754
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
I don't want to do this.

755
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
I don't want to do this.

756
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
I don't want to do this.

757
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Ding Laofeng,

758
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
if you really have enough evidence,

759
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
you can officially sue me.

760
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
The time has come.

761
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Then I'll go with my client.

762
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
Feng Yiming.

763
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,680
I'm warning you.

764
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,680
I will definitely give you back

765
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,680
the money

766
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
that I gave her mother and her two lives.

767
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Bye.

768
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
Hello?

769
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
Okay.

770
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
Thank you.

771
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Ding Zir,

772
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,680
the report is out.

773
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
The DNA and Feng Yiming

774
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
are 99.9% of the total.

775
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,680
The evidence is on her.

776
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
But where will Feng Yiming go now?

777
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
Ask her.

778
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
She sent the security guard out.

779
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
But I lost her.

780
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
Zir.

781
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,680
She threw me out last time.

782
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
We'll split up.

783
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,680
Yes, sir.

784
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,680
Which direction did she go?

785
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,680
She went eastward to the right.

786
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Three-way tunnel.

787
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Sir.

788
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:51,320
medios

789
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,320
That could be the other lane.

790
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,360
He is probably on top of there.

791
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,360
actually.

792
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,400
If it Meat is on top there is probably one for the rest of the lane.

793
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,260
It is still halfway,

794
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:27,960
oh

795
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,860
what

796
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,340
any

797
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,260
the

798
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,840
he is you about to ship

799
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,200
yes

800
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,800
follow me

801
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,260
What do you think?

802
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,260
Where are you going?

803
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,260
Thailand or Vietnam?

804
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,260
Before the ship is ready,

805
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,260
I'll play a game for you.

806
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,260
What game?

807
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
It's you.

808
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,260
Don't move!

809
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,260
Left.

810
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,260
Do you have money?

811
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
I'll give you money.

812
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,260
Do you have enough money?

813
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
Do you want me to give you money?

814
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,260
You want me to leave?

815
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
Do you usually like to be a god?

816
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,260
I'll play a game for you today.

817
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,260
Who will die of the god's game?

818
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,260
I'm not playing.

819
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,260
I'm not a god.

820
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,260
You're not a god.

821
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,260
You must play.

822
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,260
I'm not playing.

823
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,260
I'm not playing.

824
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,260
Let me go.

825
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,260
Okay?

826
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,260
Let me go.

827
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,260
I'm not good.

828
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
How much money do you have?

829
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,260
How much money do I have?

830
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
I'll give you money.

831
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,260
I'll give you money, okay?

832
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,260
Who's going to play first?

833
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,260
I'm not playing.

834
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,260
I'm not playing.

835
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,260
I'm not playing.

836
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,260
I'm not playing.

837
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,260
I'm not playing.

838
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,260
I'm not playing.

839
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,260
I'm not playing.
