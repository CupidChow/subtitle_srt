Episode 1

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,600
American writer, Le Guin,

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,200
wrote a short novel in 1973.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,400
It's called,

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
The One Who Left From Omeras.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The story is that,

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
in a town called Omeras,

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
the residents there were very happy.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,000
There were no wars, no crimes.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,800
But they had a secret.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,200
In a dirty and dirty dungeon,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,800
there was a weak little friend.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,800
The residents knew that,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,800
if the secret was exposed,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,400
they would lose their happiness,

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,400
peace and prosperity.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
So, for the benefit of most people,

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,400
they sacrificed this little friend.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
The middle school student, Qi Ling'an,

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,400
was the leader and the school principal

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,200
because of the student.

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
To make the school's business,

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
they decided to leave.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The school principal,

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,400
Qi Ling'an,

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,800
was the founder of the school's company

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,200
for the benefit of the common people.

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,800
Qi Ling'an,

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,800
was the leader and the school principal.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,400
The next one to confess is Fan.

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
If you want to know how I will punish the poison,

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,200
watch the next video.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
Good childish.

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,200
You think you are the savior?

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,800
In fact, the so-called victims

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,200
are all the victims.

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
They were bullied and transferred to school.

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,200
They were bullied and transferred to another job.

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,200
Lin Xin, come out and eat.

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
Lin Xin, come out and eat.

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,600
Sit down and eat.

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
These dishes are getting cold.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Xin Xin, remember,

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,200
on Saturday,

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
you will be meeting someone in the middle school.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,800
I know.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But I have already met someone.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,600
Didn't I tell you that you must go?

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,600
Why do you go to eat with me?

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
You went to see Uncle Lei at that time.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You only went for a few hours.

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,800
Why do you go to talk business?

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,200
Why do you have to go with me?

54
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,400
You said that

55
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
it was not his son who wanted to see me.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
What are you talking about?

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
I said it many times.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,200
I went to the toilet three years ago.

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
He followed me and touched my chest.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Calm down.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
What are you talking about?

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,600
I am not a person.

63
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Lin Xin.

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,400
I said it was a misunderstanding.

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,800
You should remind me all day.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
Do you want to put her in prison

67
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
and you are satisfied?

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Xin Xin.

69
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
You want to see me?

70
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Yes.

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Have you tried

72
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
to talk to them in a calm way?

73
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
Every time I talk to them,

74
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,400
they are all talking about excuses.

75
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Didn't I teach you last time

76
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
when we were talking?

77
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
You can practice like this.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can't do it.

79
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
I can't do it.

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I can't do it.

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I can't do it.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can practice like this.

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Tell them about your feelings,

84
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
your experience.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
And you need to be patient.

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
The depression is like your heart

87
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,800
and your feelings.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,200
You can't avoid it.

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,600
But they don't care about me at all.

90
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
I don't have any blood pressure.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
They don't care about me.

92
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,200
So, except for your parents,

93
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,800
have you tried to talk to your boyfriend,

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
girlfriend, or classmates?

95
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,600
No.

96
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
I don't have any friends in the blood pressure.

97
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
They don't understand me at all.

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I don't want to talk to them.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
At that time, I was in your class.

100
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
You said you could find you

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
if you had any problems.

102
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,200
That's why I came.

103
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
Thank you for trusting me.

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
I didn't expect you would come to me as a mentor.

105
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,800
You said at the class

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,800
you want to cherish the past and the future.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
You will feel better.

108
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,400
I want to do it, too.

109
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,000
But I can't control myself.

110
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,400
By the way,

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
the school is promoting this plan now.

112
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
I can give you a chance to be a mentor.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Are you interested in joining it?

114
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,800
The End

115
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Episode 1

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Don't stop me.

117
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
We are going to catch the thief.

118
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,800
You are responsible for the mistake.

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,800
Mr. Zhang,

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,600
we have been responsible for this.

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,200
We found the clues.

122
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
We should be the main members.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,400
I'll inform you now.

124
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
This case is under the third team.

125
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,800
All right?

126
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Move aside.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,600
What?

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,600
This is a order.

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
Listen.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The flowers on my shoulder

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
are more than you.

132
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,800
Is it not a command from the superior?

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,600
We only listen to the order of the superior, Ding.

134
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm so generous.

135
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Ding.

136
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Mr. Zhang,

137
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,600
the order has always been issued.

138
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Why do you even follow the work of the superior?

139
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
It's all the case of the central police.

140
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,200
We all have to catch the criminal.

141
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
There are two teams.

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,600
But some people seem to only want to catch them themselves.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
I don't know what the plan is.

144
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
It's your actions.

145
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,400
I didn't inform the commander-in-chief of the group.

146
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,800
I didn't tell the person in charge of the action.

147
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
The commander-in-chief said

148
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,400
he asked you to help me investigate.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,200
You should be the one who took the net.

150
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,800
You're the one who's against the action.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
I received the news.

152
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,000
The three leaders of the south are gathered together tonight.

153
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
This is the best time to catch the criminal.

154
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,200
You don't want to be promoted yourself.

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
Don't do anything else.

156
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
Shouldn't you have told me the news?

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
The commander-in-chief asked me to help you.

158
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
I'm not the one who's going to help you.

159
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,200
Besides, you and I are both in the police.

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,000
I have the right to lead the team.

161
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Where are the three leaders you received the news?

162
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
I've arranged people to guard near them.

164
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
As long as I give the order,

165
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
you can move at any time.

166
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
Zhao Ge,

167
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
you can't be the only one who can handle these goods.

168
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,000
You don't have to be so tough.

169
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
I know what you're thinking.

170
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
You want to take the lead, right?

171
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's make a profit together.

172
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,000
Police, lead the team.

173
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,800
Don't move.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,400
Don't move.

175
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Come on.

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,400
Come on.

177
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,000
Police,

178
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,600
please follow us.

179
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,800
Don't run.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,800
Don't run.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't run.

182
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Don't run.

183
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't let them go.

184
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't run.

185
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't run.

186
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't run.

187
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't run.

188
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,400
The government has taken so much money from the taxis.

189
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,800
It's just that they want you to

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
arrest the people who are in charge of the Feng Palace.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I will definitely send you off.

192
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,800
You, you, and you.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's been so long.

194
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,400
I'm hungry.

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
Let's go to the sales department.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,800
If you don't eat,

197
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
I'll eat, too.

198
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,800
Mr. Fang.

199
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Zhang San,

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
it's been a long time.

201
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
Do you want to see me?

202
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
Go to my office.

203
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
Don't be so formal.

204
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
You're selling drugs now.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,400
So the police brought you back

206
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
to help investigate.

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,800
Where's the evidence?

208
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Where's the search warrant?

209
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,000
These things

210
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
were found on your floor.

211
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Where's the evidence?

212
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Where's the search warrant?

213
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,600
I've told you before.

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,200
My floor must be clean.

215
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
They've done this.

216
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll teach them a lesson.

217
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,600
I'll beat them up.

218
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
I'll arrest the person in charge.

219
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Why should I be here?

220
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,000
I have so many floors.

221
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,400
Can I control them?

222
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Mr. Fang,

223
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
you need to stay here for a while.

224
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
We need to find out

225
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
why this bag of powder

226
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,800
is on your floor.

227
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,800
So that we can't make a mistake.

228
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I have my phone on this card.

229
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Call me anytime.

230
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
I'll help you investigate.

231
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
But I don't have enough money today.

232
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm leaving.

233
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Mr. Fang, don't be so anxious.

234
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
You said

235
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
the search warrant just now, right?

236
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Help me get the search warrant.

237
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,400
I suspect you three

238
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
hide your family's evidence.

239
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,400
Bring all your family's things here

240
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
and check them out.

241
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,400
How about this?

242
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,200
I'll stand with them

243
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,800
outside your police station

244
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,200
and search them out.

245
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,200
How many people?

246
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,800
48 hours per person.

247
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm sure you can make a big sum.

248
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Help me get the search warrant.

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
I want to show you a video.

250
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,400
The next person who will be killed

251
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
is Fan Du.

252
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
You've been in a relationship for so many years.

253
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
What's the point of not seeing me?

254
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,000
You two,

255
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,800
don't worry about me.

256
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,200
Are you crazy?

257
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,200
You can't even hit me?

258
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Are you mad at me?

259
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,400
I'll take care of my own life.

260
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
If you don't

261
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
give me a reason to stay,

262
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,600
please let me go.

263
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Or

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,800
I'll find a lawyer

265
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,800
to sue you for illegal entry and illegal stay.

266
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't understand after seeing you.

267
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
It's obvious

268
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
that you're the killer.

269
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
If you don't want to die,

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,800
just listen to me.

271
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,400
I'll take care of you and

272
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
you all in the recent time.

273
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll clean up the whole Hong Kong.

274
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Ding.

275
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Come out with me.

276
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,400
Ding.

277
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
You're not in the right place.

278
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
We have a complete plan.

279
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,000
You're in trouble.

280
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
Do you know

281
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
what the purpose of this operation is?

282
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
You're the one who killed them.

283
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Will they listen to you

284
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,800
if you ask for poison?

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
They won't.

286
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Although they're poison,

287
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,000
they're also human.

288
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
They'll be afraid of death.

289
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,000
Besides,

290
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,600
they won't fight with you.

291
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll finish it.

292
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
You're happy to receive money

293
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,600
from the crown prince of Jiantong.

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
If you can't hear it,

295
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I'll call you Qing Ling.

296
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll check your territory every day

297
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
to see if you can do anything.

298
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,600
And,

299
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
I even checked your two or three lines'

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
source of income.

301
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,200
You'll pay for it.

302
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
We've made a agreement with the three of us.

303
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Thank you for cooperating with the police.

304
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The other cases' details are not included.

305
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Thank you.

306
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
We've made a agreement with the three of us.

307
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
We can steal the money from the crown prince.

308
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,400
Wait.

309
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,000
We'll take more money.

310
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
We can steal more money from the crown prince.

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,400
Check the three lines' source of income.

312
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,200
Don't worry.

313
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Okay.

314
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,400
We'll take more money from the crown prince.

315
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,600
You're back.

316
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,600
Yes.

317
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm Ren Laji.

318
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
You got the food.

319
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,400
Yes.

320
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I got it wrong.

321
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
Actually,

322
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
I just heard you come back.

323
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
So I came out to see you.

324
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,200
From the day before yesterday,

325
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,800
I haven't had the chance

326
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,800
to say thank you in person.

327
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,800
And I saw the news

328
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
that you were investigating a big case.

329
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I was a little worried.

330
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,200
So I've been waiting for you.

331
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,600
Don't worry about the case.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Even if he let it go,

333
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,600
I have a way

334
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,200
to make him not disturb you again.

335
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm not worried about myself.

336
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm worried about you.

337
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Worry about me?

338
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,600
Worry about you and me.

339
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,600
Oh, right. I've made the meal.

340
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,200
Do you want to come over and eat with me?

341
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you for that.

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,800
You like rice.

343
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,800
How late is the place?

344
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
It's late.

345
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Then you have to stop me.

346
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,400
Don't let me eat.

347
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,600
It's okay.

348
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
I don't have much food.

349
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Rice is the most important thing.

350
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,800
Oh, right.

351
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
I'm going to school at a few o'clock.

352
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,200
Do you want to pick her up?

353
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes.

354
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
There's still half an hour.

355
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,400
Don't worry. Eat slowly.

356
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,400
Okay.

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,200
Did you scare her

358
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,200
about the last thing?

359
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
At least a little.

360
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
She's sleeping now.

361
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,400
She's got a temper.

362
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,600
She's so upset that she doesn't want to sleep.

363
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,200
She even said she missed the wind.

364
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
You mean I'll be here

365
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
to make her feel at ease?

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think so.

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You'll feel safer

368
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,400
when you're here.

369
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,600
How about this?

370
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,400
When I don't need to go to the night class,

371
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,600
I'll come over

372
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,400
and talk about the story while she's sleeping.

373
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Is that okay?

374
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,600
No need.

375
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
You're already very busy with work.

376
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
I don't want to disturb you.

377
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,200
It's too troublesome.

378
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I insist.

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,200
This soup is so good.

380
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,800
Professor Fu.

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,800
When did you start to do the service plan?

382
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We all want to join in

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
to learn more about it.

384
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,800
What service plan?

385
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
The service plan for your new

386
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
Qizong Cui.

387
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,200
As you all know,

388
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,600
recently, there has been a lock-down

389
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,400
in Hong Kong.

390
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
It's not working.

391
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,600
My grandson

392
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
is one of the victims.

393
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
To me,

394
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
I want the police

395
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,800
to catch the murderers

396
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,200
who are so cruel

397
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,400
and kill them.

398
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,800
But this is the only way.

399
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,400
It's not enough to

400
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,600
convince the dead's family.

401
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,600
With this situation,

402
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,200
our Xiyue Group

403
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,400
will invite the Hong Kong University of Virtual History

404
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
to join us

405
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,400
to develop a

406
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,200
well-known city-wide

407
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,400
new service plan.

408
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,000
The plan not only helps the dead's family

409
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
but also any Hong Kong citizen.

410
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
If there is a problem

411
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
with Qizong Cui,

412
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,000
you can find us.

413
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,000
Our group will be useful to you.

414
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,600
I think

415
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,200
the three heads and the police

416
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,400
have worked together.

417
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,600
The whole world knows.

418
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
If the murderer wants to do it,

419
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,200
it's not that easy.

420
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,800
He has to keep an eye on

421
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,200
the assistant around him

422
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,400
and the person who really does it.

423
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,400
Commander.

424
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
Any suggestions?

425
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,800
No problem.

426
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,200
I think it makes sense.

427
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,600
We have to keep an eye on

428
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,000
the three heads and the people around them.

429
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes.

430
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,200
Madam.

431
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Madam.

432
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,400
Ding Cui.

433
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,200
I have something to ask you.

434
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,400
Ding Luo Feng.

435
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Have you seen the case?

436
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,800
The case in the 15th floor.

437
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
The line was buried for a long time.

438
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,200
You were in a mess

439
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
and you got into trouble.

440
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,800
The 15th floor

441
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
is in the head.

442
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Sorry, madam.

443
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,600
I don't want to hear sorry.

444
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,800
I want to hear the explanation.

445
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
You were obviously investigating the serial killer.

446
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Why did you go to the drug store?

447
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,200
Because we discussed

448
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
the next target of the murderer.

449
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,600
It was the three heads.

450
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,000
So we went to investigate.

451
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,200
I never thought

452
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
I would fall in love with other departments.

453
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,600
As a result, the murderer couldn't catch him.

454
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
He was punished for his crime.

455
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
He was in a mess.

456
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
You are not qualified to follow this case.

457
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,800
Madam.

458
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,200
I will take full responsibility for this.

459
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
But you have to know

460
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,400
I am the most familiar with this case.

461
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,600
So I can change the direction.

462
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,400
No need.

463
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
You don't have a chance.

464
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Man Guang.

465
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,400
You are responsible for this case.

466
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,800
Keep an eye on the three heads.

467
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,200
Yes, madam. Thank you, madam.

468
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:30,800
H dedicated to Dr. Fang

469
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,600
Everyone has not been to bed for a long time.

470
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,400
You have all prepared.

471
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,800
You may go back to rest.

472
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,000
I will go back tomorrow, okay?

473
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,100
And

474
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,420
Good.

475
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,060
Let's start again.

476
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,900
The person responsible for this case is Zhang Man Guang.

477
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
Dinner's ready.

478
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,820
I'm sorry.

479
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,980
Do you remember

480
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,780
the Star Academy we saw before?

481
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,820
It says time is not the most important thing.

482
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,100
The ending doesn't mean the end.

483
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,140
It's possible that it's all the beginning.

484
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,340
Here's the thing.

485
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,220
In fact, apart from Fang Jia Shi,

486
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:08,980
Zhou Ge,

487
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,820
and the three-line novel,

488
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,900
there's actually a partner

489
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
named Chen Zuo Yao.

490
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,420
He was the one who was arrested

491
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,820
and was killed by others in the martial arts world.

492
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,140
And his body

493
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,060
was found in the school

494
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,820
of Tian Shui Wei.

495
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,940
His injuries were definitely similar.

496
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,820
He was killed by enemies.

497
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,340
But the biggest problem now

498
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,820
is that no one has been given a reward.

499
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,220
Who was the one who killed him

500
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,220
before he was found?

501
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
That means

502
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,580
Chen Zuo Yao

503
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,780
might be

504
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,020
the first victim of the serial murder case.

505
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,900
There's definitely a possibility.

506
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,060
So I called the doctor

507
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,780
and asked him to report to the lab.

508
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,460
If there's a bug in the painting,

509
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,780
that's right.

510
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,820
Found it.

511
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,780
When I was in the lab,

512
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,100
I found that the dead body

513
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,220
had a bone-in condition.

514
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,060
It was probably when he fell down from the rooftop,

515
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,700
that he was in the prison

516
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,060
to reduce the risk of getting into contact with the ground.

517
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,860
So he was pushed down the building

518
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,580
and fell to death.

519
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,420
No.

520
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,860
The most fatal one

521
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,380
was the heart.

522
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,780
When the victim fell down from the rooftop,

523
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,580
it was not broken.

524
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,420
This was a rear bone.

525
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,580
Then he was taken care of by the body

526
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,140
and torn to pieces.

527
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,060
That's right.

528
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,980
As for the bug you mentioned,

529
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,580
we didn't find it in his body.

530
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,900
I believe it has nothing to do with the criminal.

531
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,980
His death

532
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,900
might be done by another group.

533
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,780
Copy that.

534
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,500
You can'tело start in the formerảo.

535
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,460
Copy that inside.

536
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,660
Copy that inside.

537
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,780
Copy.

538
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,340
Didn't you know

539
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,420
I've put in the code for red light and blue light for white light?

Get out of the gun.

This woman's yellow worm is an officer.

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,420
What?

550
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,340
Please be careful.

Sorry.

558
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,340
Recently, there are robbers saying that

559
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,940
there are often attacks on the street.

560
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,340
It's normal to have attacks here.

561
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,780
It's not like that.

562
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,260
These attacks are rarely seen in Hong Kong.

563
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,260
It's poisonous.

564
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,020
Recently, there are robbers here.

565
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,780
Who knows that

566
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,140
the dog suddenly got bitten by the attacks

567
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,420
and died of poisoning.

568
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,740
Then they attacked us.

569
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,460
So we kill bugs here all day long.

570
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,980
Be careful.

571
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,460
What's the matter?

572
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,620
Zui.

573
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,860
What?

574
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,540
Thank you.

575
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,340
You go do your work.

576
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,020
Okay.

577
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Be careful.

578
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,660
There are bugs.

579
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,620
That's the most important thing to do with the new wife.

580
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,260
But there is a knife in the push-down building.

581
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,380
It's not quite the same as the two before.

582
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,100
The knife was done before.

583
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,980
The doctor said that his fatal injury was the heart.

584
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,260
Is there not only one murderer

585
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,860
in the scene?

586
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,700
Or a new one.

587
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,500
I just started the crime.

588
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,980
I'm not a good person.

589
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,300
No way.

590
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,780
Or a subordinate.

591
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,860
Some supporters.

592
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,180
You know that people inside are crazy.

593
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,700
Look for a expert.

594
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,020
What expert?

595
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,220
A psychological expert.

596
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,060
Yang Zhifei.

597
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,700
Don't be like a cow, okay?

598
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,780
Work.

599
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,260
You can go to the library to find it.

600
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,700
But when can you find it?

601
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,660
Come here.

602
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,420
Go to the library.

603
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,020
What the hell?

604
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,660
What's happening?

605
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,380
We'll go to the library to look for another architect.

606
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,100
Can't you go to the library to find the architect?

607
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,020
Which one is it?

608
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,940
I found one.

609
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,420
then you should prepare your test, right?

610
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,300
Is there a new hospital?

611
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,900
The new factory of SATA 1115.

612
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,380
If you're in the office,

613
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,900
you should send me a message first.

614
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,340
Because it's a bit urgent now.

615
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,660
So I came to see you directly.

616
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,780
But I'm going to the hospital to wash my wound later.

617
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,220
I'll try to speak quickly.

618
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,260
Do you have a common sense?

619
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,260
You see me,

620
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,420
shouldn't I ask

621
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,380
how I've been doing lately?

622
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,100
Am I better?

623
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,540
Even students know about it.

624
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,980
You're stupid.

625
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,940
Don't just look at me in the face of the paper.

626
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,940
You're working.

627
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,020
I'm not your friend.

628
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,820
If you're doing well,

629
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,820
just say it as I say.

630
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,100
How are you?

631
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,020
Are you feeling better?

632
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,460
Say it.

633
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,420
Are you feeling better?

634
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,420
What are you talking about?

635
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,380
You're talking to me.

636
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,340
Be sincere.

637
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,460
Give him more attention.

638
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,940
Are you feeling better?

639
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,460
I'm feeling better.

640
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,620
That's good.

641
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,420
That's good.

642
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,740
Tell him

643
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,140
if you need help,

644
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,780
you can look for me.

645
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,660
If you need help,

646
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,900
just look for me.

647
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,580
I don't need it for now.

648
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,100
Thank you.

649
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,860
Can we start talking about the construction?

650
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,820
Actually, I want you to watch this video.

651
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,380
I found a girl online.

652
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,580
She seems to be the main brain of the world.

653
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,580
We haven't found her yet.

654
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,420
But I want you to help me analyze her mind.

655
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,220
I can't help you.

656
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,980
I think so.

657
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,660
This girl

658
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,420
should be only a dozen years old.

659
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,100
How could she come out and kill people?

660
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,180
She seems to be pretending.

661
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,460
Actually, in this world,

662
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,220
there's nothing impossible.

663
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,940
Plus, she said everything.

664
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
She really regarded herself

665
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
as an old master.

666
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,900
She really wants to change this world.

667
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,260
Shouldn't she be

668
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,100
the first one to be the last one to be the last one?

669
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,620
You said she had a problem

670
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,260
and she was the first one to be the master.

671
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,900
Actually, your logic is the problem.

672
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
Even if you find her,

673
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,780
it's useless.

674
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,980
That's my analysis.

675
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,180
But you didn't analyze her now.

676
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,780
You said it's not her fault.

677
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,940
As far as I know,

678
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,660
she must have been missing.

679
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,180
Why don't you go and check

680
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,620
what happened to her?

681
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,700
You just suspect

682
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,220
she's a suspect.

683
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,620
Why can't you police

684
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,740
do anything

685
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,700
to investigate?

686
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,400
Why were you in a hurry?

687
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,780
You go and find out inside.

688
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,740
First relax.

689
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,420
Then talk slowly.

690
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,300
I think

691
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,060
I seem to be staying in a Scorch.

692
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,300
Those classmates are talking about it.

693
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,300
I always feel like they're mocking me.

694
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,820
I really can't get into it.

695
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,180
That means you're very focused on the feeling of getting along with others.

696
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,340
Actually, this treatment can be done at the same time as the treatment.

697
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,060
If you need it, I can introduce it to you as a doctor.

698
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,860
I'll see if it's better if you take it.

699
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,700
I've seen your medical records.

700
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,380
You haven't gone to the pharmacy for a month.

701
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,580
It's very hard to take medicine.

702
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,660
You want to compromise and turn it down.

703
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,300
It's fine if you take it and just make it.

704
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,540
You'll know when you take the medicine.

705
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,340
Hello? Xin Xin?

706
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,940
You haven't come to the pharmacy for a month.

707
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,300
Is there something wrong?

708
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,340
I'm fine. I'm fine now.

709
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,260
I'll record your main job as a nurse.

710
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,420
You can do whatever you want.

711
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,180
You're not really helping me.

712
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,820
Okay.

713
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,060
You can do whatever you want.

714
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,220
You're not really helping me.

715
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,660
It's like when you were in school,

716
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,740
your classmates were talking about...

717
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,660
I think our investigation is right.

718
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,540
It's just a pure mistake.

719
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,100
Chen Zuyao was the first victim of the new drug.

720
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,820
I've asked the doctor.

721
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,620
He said Chen Zuyao was killed before he was taken to the hospital.

722
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,500
He was killed by someone in the heart.

723
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,700
At the beginning, we thought it was a black-and-black murder.

724
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,740
But he found out that it was possible.

725
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,300
There are three people who are guilty of the new drug.

726
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,060
One is responsible for the operation.

727
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,300
The other is responsible for the cleaning.

728
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,700
The one with the problem is responsible for the operation.

729
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,180
So I think Chen Zuyao's case is definitely not a separate case.

730
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,780
I've been to a abandoned school.

731
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,540
There's a kind of innocent person who rarely appears in Hong Kong.

732
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,540
So it's very likely that it's related to the satan 1115.

733
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,740
It's related to the satan 1115.

734
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,140
But Chen Zuyao's body has been burned half a year ago.

735
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,540
The autopsy report doesn't show that it's related to the bug.

736
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,540
It's hard to get this case back to the satan 1115.

737
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,740
Now, Zhang Ser is in the position of the judge.

738
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,540
If we want to make a case, it's difficult.

739
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,540
The body is gone. The scene is still here.

740
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,540
Xiao An, you can leave now.

741
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,740
Get out of my way.

742
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,740
Stop hitting me.

743
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,740
Why are you still so stubborn?

744
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,740
I saved your life. Why are you still so stubborn?

745
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,740
I didn't let you save me, and you don't need to save me.

746
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,940
You're still so stubborn.

747
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,940
It used to be a case of the past, now it's a case of the present. So don't show up anymore.

748
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,940
I remind you that the soldiers and thieves can never be friends.

749
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,140
If you let me find out the truth again,

750
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,540
I'll consider you a traitor.

751
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,140
Boss,

752
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,740
Boss,

753
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,740
the CNP is the key project for the future of the big science.

754
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,540
It's a kind of medicine that doesn't need to be prescribed by the doctor.

755
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,140
The demand must be very high.

756
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,140
I'll go back and have a meeting with my dad and arrange for an early release.

757
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,740
The drug factory is already opening and producing.

758
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,940
Are you sure you can get through the security?

759
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,540
Yes, it's already done.

760
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,140
Okay.

761
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,340
Yan, I'm back.

762
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,140
Yan.

763
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,340
Be careful.

764
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
Are you okay?

765
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
I'm fine.

766
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
I'll go get you some tea.

767
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,540
Help me get a set of machine and come over.

768
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,340
I'll go have a meeting later.

769
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,740
It's very important.

770
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,340
No need.

771
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,740
Don't let me see him in the company.

772
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
Mr. Fu,

773
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,540
a doctor in the lab has been looking into the drug factory's drug problem lately.

774
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,540
Find that doctor immediately.

775
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,140
It's good to be soft and hard.

776
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,740
We must fix this.

777
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
The service plan we just made

778
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,540
is still in the situation.

779
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,140
We can't just give it up.

780
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,740
But,

781
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,540
Young Master doesn't answer my call.

782
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
So I'm worried that...

783
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,740
What are you worried about?

784
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,140
He's been given so much help.

785
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,740
I've already pushed him out.

786
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,140
The ads are out.

787
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,740
He can't push me out.

788
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,740
Hello?

789
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,740
What's up?

790
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,740
Why did you put my stuff there?

791
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,340
I love clean clothes.

792
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,540
How could you put those trash there?

793
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,740
It's not you, not me.

794
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,540
Is it a matter of time?

795
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,740
Hello?

796
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Ying Kai,

797
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,740
the search team is out.

798
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,140
We can go to the abandoned school to investigate the area.

799
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Okay.

800
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,340
Don't move anymore.

801
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,540
You're crazy.

802
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,340
According to the data,

803
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
there's a surveillance camera outside the school gate.

804
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,540
But there's nothing suspicious about it.

805
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,740
The gatekeeper locked it.

806
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,740
So no one broke it.

807
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,140
The door is locked.

808
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,740
So no one broke it.

809
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,140
There's no trace of the wall.

810
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,940
How did they get in?

811
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,540
There are so many footprints here.

812
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,940
Let's split up.

813
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,540
Yes, sir.

814
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,340
Yes, sir.

815
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,340
Look.

816
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Look.

817
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,540
They obviously came in here.

818
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,740
There are so many weeds and difficult to find footprints.

819
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Let's go.

820
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,580
Despite of the same situation

821
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,180
I had never met a elderly family

822
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,180
Go!

823
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,660
Musical

824
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,100
ご Lena

825
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,320
Author

826
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,980
He Cuz Lay

827
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,540
I want to call

828
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:09,560
sending

829
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,060
delicious

830
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,900
Okay.

831
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,740
Mr. Ding,

832
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,740
are these the special weapons?

833
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,980
The weapons should be on the mud.

834
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,980
How could they be concentrated in the mud?

835
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,980
Did someone put it here on purpose?

836
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,060
Take a look.

837
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,340
Mr. Ding.

838
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,580
Look.

839
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,260
Thank you.

840
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,100
The real killer has returned.

841
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,340
He helped find

842
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,500
the first citizen to say

843
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,180
he had no time to go out.

844
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,620
About half a year ago,

845
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,980
he was with Chen Zuyang.

846
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,980
We were the ones who killed him.

847
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,860
What you mean is

848
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,700
Chen Zuyang is the first victim

849
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,780
who committed the crime.

850
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,340
But normally,

851
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
the serial killer

852
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,300
won't be the one who killed him for so long.

853
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,340
Could it be the killer

854
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,100
deliberately mislead us

855
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,420
when he was trying to mislead us?

856
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,980
The first one is the bulletproof case.

857
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,020
The killer

858
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,420
wants to leave a perfect plan.

859
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,220
So now, the second and third cases

860
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,140
have a clear direction.

861
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,940
The western group.

862
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,620
Find the girl from Sato.

863
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,900
She should be able to handle the case.

864
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,860
Yes, sir.

865
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,940
The first one is the killer.

866
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,140
The second one is the killer.

867
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,340
The third one is the killer.

868
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,540
The fourth one is the killer.

869
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,820
The fourth one is the killer.

870
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,940
The fourth one is the killer.

871
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,100
The fourth one is the killer.

872
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,300
The fourth one is the killer.

873
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,540
The fourth one is the killer.

874
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,780
The fourth one is the killer.

875
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,140
The fourth one is the killer.

876
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,300
The fourth one is the killer.

877
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,500
The fourth one is the killer.

878
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,820
The fourth one is the killer.

879
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,020
The fourth one is the killer.

880
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,100
The fourth one is the killer.

881
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,260
The fourth one is the killer.

882
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,420
The fourth one is the killer.

883
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,660
The fourth one is the killer.

884
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,660
The fourth one is the killer.

885
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,980
The fourth one is the killer.

886
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,380
The fourth one is the killer.

887
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,660
The fourth one is the killer.

888
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,020
The fourth one is the killer.

889
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,700
The fourth one is the killer.

890
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,100
Which one do you think you're headed for?

891
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:21,940
Why do you want to take it?

892
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,260
Because I'm here to give you a 90% partnership.

893
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,660
That's glad to hear that.

894
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,260
Now it's time

895
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,940
for those who do evil things

896
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,860
to be arrive safely.

897
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,860
But the biggest punishment for you

898
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
is not to die.

899
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,860
It's to live or die.

900
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,860
I've never been afraid of death.

901
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,860
I've committed too many crimes.

902
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
I've missed it.

903
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,860
Even if I die ten times,

904
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,860
so please,

905
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,860
if you want to kill me,

906
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,860
kill me ten thousand times.

907
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,860
I'll kill you without a chance.

908
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,860
I'll kill you.

909
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,860
Even if I die ten thousand times,

910
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,860
I'll kill you without a chance.

911
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,860
I'll kill you.

912
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,860
I'll kill you.

913
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,860
The world is crazy.

914
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,860
The world is crazy.

915
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,860
Everything is crazy.

916
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,860
Who can understand

917
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,860
the color of the light?

918
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,860
Your world, my world,

919
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,860
her world,

920
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,860
is not convenient.

921
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,860
Your world, my world,

922
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,860
her world,

923
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,860
is not convenient.
