00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Episode 07

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Zeng Jiayu just told us that

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
he was killed by someone.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You killed that person.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In our world,

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
except for the child,

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
there is a Justice that protects the D.A.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't want to see him.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't want to see him.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't want to see him, either.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Mr. Dian, the report is out.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The D.A. and the Fu Yiming are 99.9 percent in total.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Tell the truth and bring her to court.

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What direction is he on?

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He's going to the beach after the east.

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Three of them are heading towards the beach.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Follow me.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
How is it?

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't tell me where I'm going.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Are you going to take the cargo or the transport?

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's you.

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't move!

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let me go.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay?

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let me go, okay?

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How much money do you want?

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll give you the money.

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll give you the money, okay?

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Who's going to play first?

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not going to play!

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm not going to play!

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's you.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's okay.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let me go, okay?

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll let them go.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll give you all the money, okay?

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll let them go.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll beg you.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Are you going to shoot me?

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm not going to!

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not going to!

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Luo Fu!

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you don't admit that you're Luo Fu,

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
then shoot me!

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Shoot me!

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Luo Fu!

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Luo Fu!

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You little bastard!

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll kill you!

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ren Chou, I'll kill you!

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll kill you!

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll kill you!

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll kill you!

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll kill you!

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll kill you!

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You bastard!

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you dare to kill me?

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're Luo Fu.

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You haven't even been able to shoot me.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You still don't want to admit that you're Luo Fu?

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not Luo Fu!

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not a murderer!

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not a murderer!

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm not a murderer!

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey!

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It hurts!

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What's wrong?

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why did you shoot my son?

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why did you shoot my son?

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why did you come here?

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm not a murderer!

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not a murderer!

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not a murderer!

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm not a murderer!

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm not a murderer!

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not a murderer!

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm not a murderer!

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm not a murderer!

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm not a murderer!

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm not a murderer!

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not a murderer!

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not a murderer!

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not a murderer!

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not a murderer!

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm not a murderer!

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not a murderer!

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not a murderer!

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm not a murderer!

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm not a murderer!

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm not a murderer!

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not a murderer!

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not a murderer!

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm not a murderer!

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm not a murderer!

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not a murderer!

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm not a murderer!

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm not a murderer!

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm not a murderer!

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm not a murderer!

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm not a murderer!

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm not a murderer!

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm not a murderer!

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm not a murderer!

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm not a murderer!

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not a murderer!

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm not a murderer!

I'm not a murderer!

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not a murderer!

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm not a murderer!

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not a murderer!

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm not a murderer!

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm not a murderer!

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not a murderer!

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not a murderer!

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm not a murderer!

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm not a murderer!

152
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm not a murderer!

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm not a murderer!

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Do you hear me?

155
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you hear me?

156
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There's something on my side.

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You come to Bi Feng Hall right away.

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Where's the second room?

159
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Here!

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Here.

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I just found that this boat was a bit frozen.

162
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I came up here.

163
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I didn't find anyone.

164
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I only found here.

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There's a hole with blood.

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I suspect it was found by the knife.

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And there's blood in this hole.

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How is it?

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Did you find anything?

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The fire department is still searching for evidence.

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There's nothing to find.

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Where's the second room?

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Where's the second room?

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I found the DNA of the blood.

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The report is out.

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's a combination of Fu Yiming and Fu.

177
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Where did he go?

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I want to know where he is.

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm monitoring the road around here.

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't take Fu Yiming away.

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I can't see the third person you're talking about.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So you think I'm in trouble?

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm just telling you the truth.

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you're not with me today,

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll suspect you.

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sure there's someone in there.

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know if he was killed or kidnapped.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There's no clue.

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It means he's clean.

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I think the third room is very simple.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You'd better find evidence to prove you're innocent.

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The second room is very simple.

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We haven't found Fu Yiming's missing cause.

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm here to call on you.

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If you see him,

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
please contact us as soon as possible.

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Before Fu Yiming was missing,

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
he had received a search on Fu Yiming.

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He also said that the police had stolen the evidence to kill him.

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Is it possible that he was killed because of this?

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Or is he unable to accept the fact that the police had a negative impact on him?

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If so,

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
is the police in charge of the case a responsibility?

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We suspect that Fu Yiming wasn't just missing.

205
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He was the one who committed the crime.

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The police...

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The police never made any evidence

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to frame a good citizen.

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
As a man in charge of the crime in Southeast Asia,

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can tell you that the police have enough evidence

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
to prove Fu Yiming's relationship with this case.

212
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Although we haven't found the evidence yet,

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
it doesn't mean that he's innocent.

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And the police still need time

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
to find other suspects and search for more evidence.

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Huo Jin.

217
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Sorry, I've told you that

218
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
there's no other person who can go in without his order.

219
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I just want to see Liang Yin.

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Sorry, I'm just being crazy.

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can go. Thank you.

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Sorry.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Please, what's the matter?

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Can you say something?

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What's the matter?

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What's the matter?

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Someone's writing.

228
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Please, say something.

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's not a secret case.

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Right.

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The police are looking for the suspect.

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The suspect is in the car.

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The suspect is in the car.

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The suspect is in the car.

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The suspect is in the car.

236
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The suspect is in the car.

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The suspect is in the car.

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The suspect is in the car.

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The suspect is in the car.

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The suspect is in the car.

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The suspect is in the car.

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The suspect is in the car.

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The suspect is in the car.

244
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The suspect is in the car.

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The suspect is in the car.

246
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The suspect is in the car.

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The suspect is in the car.

248
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The suspect is in the car.

249
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The suspect is in the car.

250
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The suspect is in the car.

251
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The suspect is in the car.

252
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The suspect is in the car.

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The suspect is in the car.

254
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The suspect is in the car.

255
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The suspect is in the car.

256
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If Fu Yiming is the one who committed the crime,

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
he can't hide his crime so perfectly.

258
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If he was killed,

259
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the third person who made the sound of the air

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
was the one who killed the person.

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If there is really a third person,

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
where is his body?

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The suspect is in the car.

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The suspect is in the car.

265
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The suspect is in the car.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The suspect is in the car.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The suspect is in the car.

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The suspect is in the car.

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The suspect is in the car.

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The suspect is in the car.

271
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The suspect is in the car.

272
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The suspect is in the car.

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The suspect is in the car.

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The suspect is in the car.

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The suspect is in the car.

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The suspect is in the car.

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The suspect is in the car.

278
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The suspect is in the car.

279
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The suspect is in the car.

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000

The suspect is in the car.

282
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The suspect is in the car.

283
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The suspect is in the car.

284
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The suspect is in the car.

285
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The suspect is in the car.

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The suspect is in the car.

287
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sh穿夫人,

288
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Isn't he a person who plans with us?

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Look.

290
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Would you like to talk to someone?

291
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Sh穿夫人,

292
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What filled my mind is it?

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Marty Prince?

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you want to talk to him?

295
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Is it there?

296
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Is it readed or detailed?

297
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, it says it.

298
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,800
Just give it to me.

299
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Why is he coming in?

300
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Hey, Xing Kai.

301
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey.

302
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,800
This is a new one.

303
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
What's going on?

304
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
A-Sir.

305
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,500
How did you find out about that body?

306
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes. Where did you find it?

307
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Ask the body's condition.

308
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
A-Sir, you said you forced the victim to commit suicide.

309
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Is there a problem with your investigation?

310
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,000
The case is still in the investigation.

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,500
So, I'm sorry for the miscarriage.

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
A-Sir, please help me.

313
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Fu Yiming is not a suicide.

314
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He was killed by someone.

315
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why did you tell the police that the victim was killed by someone?

316
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
Do you have any news?

317
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Please tell us.

318
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,000
What's the point of your video?

319
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Can you please say a little more?

320
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes, please help me.

321
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm Xing Kai, the new victim of the Xixi case.

322
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I found the body.

323
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
When the case was released,

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
there were three people except the victim.

325
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
A-Sir, what did you say?

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Mr. Fu,

327
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
are you doing this for your son?

328
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm here to find the chief.

329
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I want to know who killed my son.

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I suspect you have the police

331
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
using the wrong method to make my son die.

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I want you to give me a reasonable explanation.

333
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Mr. Fu,

334
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
we have enough evidence

335
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
to prove that your son

336
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
was involved in the murder of

337
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the South Asian population and the murder of the suspect.

338
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why would he die?

339
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We'll find out.

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
In short, the killer is a criminal with high intelligence.

341
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He must have a plan to kill your son.

342
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I can also say that

343
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't care what your motive is.

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Your murder method is so naive.

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If you can't escape,

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'll definitely catch you.

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Sorry.

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Mr. Fu,

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
why are you talking to me?

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why are you talking to me?

351
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Who is the third one?

352
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Why are you talking to me?

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You're so quiet.

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why are you so familiar with those reporters?

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Aren't we going to find the killer now?

356
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If we have to go out and hit him,

357
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
why don't we take the initiative

358
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
to lure the killer to his body?

359
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I think if I say something about his death,

360
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
he won't be able to bear it.

361
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He'll come out to me.

362
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Mr. Ding.

363
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What's wrong?

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Speak.

365
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The submarine is in the opposite of the pier.

366
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's already melted black.

367
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What about the IP?

368
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's not a big deal.

369
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's a big deal.

370
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The submarine is in the opposite of the pier.

371
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What about the IP?

372
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
They can't find the DNA.

373
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But according to the evidence,

374
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
it must have been melted in the blood

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
a few hours ago.

376
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you say that the blood

377
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
is part of the third person,

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
it's a good time, right?

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's right.

380
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No matter what your motive is,

381
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
there are many ways to kill people.

382
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If you can't escape,

383
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll definitely get you.

384
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,280
Who can tell me what's going on with this case?

385
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,480
Ding Luo Feng, do you know that the Fu family

386
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,160
has been looking for Yi Ge since the third day of the night?

387
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,720
How am I going to keep you safe this time?

388
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
And that firecracker. Where did he come from?

389
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,320
Which department?

390
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,320
His IP in the west region is called Xing Kai.

391
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,520
He is investigating the missing person's case.

392
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,400
He found out that there is a connection to Fu Yiming's case.

393
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,880
So, we two cases came together to investigate it.

394
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,480
Why did he come to the investigation?

395
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,520
Why did he tell reporters about it?

396
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,320
What exactly is it?

397
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,240
On the crime scene, there was a third person.

398
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
The third person killed Fu Yiming?

399
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,360
That's possible. But we can't make such a quick conclusion.

400
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,200
You are a police officer. You have to believe in a subordinate's judgment.

401
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,040
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

402
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,960
Because he has been investigating it all along.

403
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,840
There is no mistake.

404
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,600
Okay. When will you be able to make progress?

405
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,960
I will tell the media.

406
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,080
Give me some time, Ma'am.

407
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,560
It should be three days.

408
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,080
Since you say so, I will believe in your judgment.

409
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,360
But I have to remind you.

410
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,920
It's a mess outside. You'd better break the case as soon as possible.

411
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,080
Don't let me down.

412
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,960
Ma'am, Ma'am. I'll go out first.

413
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,920
I've told you many times.

414
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,440
You should think about it before you make a mistake.

415
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,680
What if you break the case?

416
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,920
I only know that I have to catch the murderer.

417
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,240
If you break the case, you can't go to the waterfront.

418
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
Do you like fishing?

419
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,320
I'm not kidding.

420
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,240
Our funeral is not about being impulsive.

421
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,360
We don't want to use our emotions.

422
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
We want to be honest.

423
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,480
We don't want to be a criminal.

424
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,480
We don't want to be impulsive. We don't want to use our emotions.

425
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
If you break the case, you'll break it again?

426
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,720
That's right. Do you know that?

427
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,160
After we have a case, the police can't do it anymore.

428
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,400
How can we catch the murderer?

429
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,520
Qing Kai.

430
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,440
I will take you here.

431
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,800
Until the case is over.

432
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,760
But before you do anything, you must get my approval.

433
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,600
You can't mess it up.

434
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Okay?

435
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,800
That's not good.

436
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,640
Hurry and agree.

437
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,960
Will the police kill him?

438
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,920
Let's go.

439
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,560
Okay.

440
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,080
The third target.

441
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,960
If you're done, you can sign it. See you tomorrow.

442
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,600
Yes, sir.

443
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,640
Say something, I'm so hungry,

444
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,360
it's past 1pm.

445
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,280
Hey, that'szilla?

446
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680
Wait.

447
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,000
Mr. Ding, come buy some lunch.

448
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,240
Yes.

449
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
I came here to buy it when you were at the work.

450
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
I'm planning to buy it and make breakfast.

451
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
If you don't mind,

452
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
try our new one,

453
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
the one with the fish.

454
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
It's delicious.

455
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
I like the fish.

456
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Here.

457
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
I want two.

458
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
Okay.

459
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
How much?

460
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
50 yuan.

461
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
50 yuan.

462
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
50 yuan.

463
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Thank you.

464
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Thank you.

465
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Bye.

466
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Bye, uncle.

467
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Thank you.

468
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Why is your hair so messy?

469
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Why are you so happy?

470
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Let me see.

471
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Mom, mom, mom.

472
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
What's wrong?

473
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm hungry.

474
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I want to eat soup.

475
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Are you hungry?

476
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Didn't you eat the full one just now?

477
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Mom, cook me soup.

478
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
I want to eat soup.

479
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Okay, okay, okay.

480
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
I'll cook it for you.

481
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Go in.

482
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
I'm hungry.

483
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
I'm hungry.

484
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
You stay here.

485
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Wait for me.

486
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
I'll cook it for you.

487
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
Qingzi, Xiao Kang.

488
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
Ke'er.

489
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Liu, come here.

490
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Introduce yourself.

491
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
I'm Xing Kai.

492
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
I'm from the Central Annihilation.

493
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
I'm very capable.

494
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Okay.

495
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Let me introduce myself.

496
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
I'm Jing Zhang, Ke'er.

497
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
I'm Sha Chao.

498
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
I'm Liu Sen, the senior student of the high school.

499
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
You can call me Liu.

500
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm Liu.

501
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
I'm Qing Zi, the senior student of the high school.

502
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
I'm Jing Zhang, Xiao Kang.

503
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm Jing Zhang, Xiao Kang.

504
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
I'm Du Chao, Xing Kai.

505
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Xing, since you joined us,

506
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
you're our own people.

507
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
I hope we can work together

508
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
in the future.

509
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Yes, we're the same team.

510
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
The most important thing is to trust each other.

511
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Don't worry.

512
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
I'm here to catch the murderer

513
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
just like everyone else.

514
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
Okay, no problem.

515
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Sit down.

516
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
You can go.

517
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
What's going on in Mount Fuyang?

518
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
He went to the US for research in the past one year.

519
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
He received the news that he just returned to Hong Kong.

520
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
But he should be staying in the university.

521
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Okay, please come back and meet him.

522
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Yes, sir.

523
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
You can try to imagine

524
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,240
when you were born or a baby,

525
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
what kind of thought did you have?

526
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
If you were hungry,

527
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
your mother would give you milk.

528
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,240
You would feel satisfied and blessed.

529
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
On the contrary,

530
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
when you're hungry,

531
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
your mother would give you milk.

532
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Your instinctive reaction

533
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
would create negative emotions

534
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
and make you angry.

535
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
The psychology professor,

536
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Meilan Nikolaian,

537
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
once had a theory.

538
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
A man who can satisfy

539
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
a baby's breast milk,

540
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
is called a good man.

541
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
And a man who can't satisfy

542
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
a baby's breast milk,

543
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
is called a bad man.

544
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,240
From the perspective of psychology,

545
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
it's called separation.

546
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Does baby have a good and bad relationship?

547
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Baby won't have a good relationship.

548
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
So they separate

549
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
the way they defend him.

550
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
But if we expand this view

551
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,240
to adults,

552
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
there will be a problem.

553
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
If our worldview is like a baby,

554
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,240
only good and bad are left.

555
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,240
How to maintain a normal relationship?

556
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Please think about it.

557
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
We'll continue in the next class.

558
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Dr. Fu, hello.

559
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
We're the headquarters of the case.

560
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
There's a case about kidnapping.

561
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
I'd like you to go back to the police station

562
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
and help investigate.

563
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
The psychological space you mentioned

564
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
is not clear to me.

565
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
I haven't participated in it.

566
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I've been studying

567
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
personality psychology

568
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
for the past year and a half.

569
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
I've never had time

570
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
to go far away from Hong Kong

571
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,240
and make such a plan.

572
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
You mean someone's taking advantage of you?

573
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
No.

574
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm not.

575
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
You mean someone's taking advantage of you?

576
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
I want to be my nephew,

577
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Fu Yiming.

578
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,240
You know why he didn't come out to oppose you.

579
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,240
First, I rarely contact them.

580
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Even if I oppose them,

581
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
they won't listen.

582
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Second,

583
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,240
I think it's also a matter of helping people.

584
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
So I asked my friends in college

585
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
to look after them.

586
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
If they're not too far away,

587
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
they'll do it.

588
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Who knows what will happen?

589
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
I understand.

590
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,240
So this time,

591
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
you chose Hong Kong

592
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
on your own?

593
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
Although I'm close to my family,

594
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
but such a big thing happened,

595
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
I also want to see

596
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
if there's anything I can do for you.

597
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
It's okay.

598
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Thank you for your help.

599
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
You're welcome.

600
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
You're welcome.

601
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
You can leave now.

602
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
This way.

603
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Okay.

604
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Come on, Dongdong.

605
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
Come on, Dad.

606
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Let's go back to your place, okay?

607
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Come on.

608
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
Miao Xu,

609
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
aren't you?

610
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Tong De is still young.

611
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
He doesn't know anything.

612
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I don't blame him.

613
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
How did you become a mother?

614
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Look.

615
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
You're taking your daughter as a son.

616
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
You don't even follow your dad.

617
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
The judge said that

618
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
you can't just see him.

619
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
What do you mean?

620
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Even if you go to court,

621
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
you can't just break the family.

622
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Tongtong is my daughter.

623
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
No one can stop me from seeing him.

624
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Boss, do you have a group of criminals?

625
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
Do you have a group of criminals?

626
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
You're not doing business now.

627
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Let's go.

628
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
I'm sorry.

629
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Dad, let's go play.

630
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Come on.

631
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Please give me two criminals.

632
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Uncle Wei,

633
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
you're not doing business now.

634
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Get out.

635
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Please give me two criminals.

636
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Uncle Wei,

637
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
you're already deaf.

638
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
I told you to get out.

639
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
You're a little bit timid.

640
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
You'll scare the little goose.

641
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,240
I'm not timid when you leave.

642
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Hurry up.

643
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Get out.

644
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Did you hear that?

645
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
You're really stupid.

646
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
What's wrong with you?

647
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Come here.

648
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Sit down.

649
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
What's wrong?

650
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
He's a little bit timid.

651
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Hurry up.

652
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Get the medicine.

653
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Be a little bit timid.

654
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Okay.

655
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Get out of here.

656
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Get out of here.

657
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
Okay.

658
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Breathe in.

659
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
Breathe out.

660
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Breathe out.

661
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
Breathe out.

662
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Breathe out.

663
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Breathe out.

664
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
I think I'm done.

665
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Are you still not done?

666
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Hurry up.

667
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Be quiet.

668
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Did I do something wrong?

669
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
If you have anything,

670
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
I won't let you go.

671
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Follow me.

672
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Follow me.

673
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Okay.

674
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Okay.

675
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Be a little bit better, right?

676
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Okay.

677
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
Okay.

678
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Okay.

679
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Okay.

680
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Get out.

681
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,240
What are you doing?

682
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
You were so loud just now.

683
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
You scared the little goose.

684
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Do you know that?

685
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
You wanted to hit my wife.

686
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Don't be ridiculous.

687
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
What? You said it right.

688
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
You hit me again?

689
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
You're here to find a mess.

690
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
I can catch you.

691
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Okay.

692
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,240
I'll be your winner this time.

693
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
I'll tell you the same woman.

694
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
I'm not afraid to tell you something.

695
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
My wife is so pitiful.

696
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
She's so righteous.

697
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Enough.

698
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
How long have you known my wife?

699
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
You even paid for her.

700
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Silly.

701
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
I'll say so much today.

702
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Tongtong.

703
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Dad, you're leaving first.

704
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
That's all.

705
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
See you next time.

706
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Bye.

707
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
I'm leaving.

708
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Interesting.

709
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,240
The police are calling my wife so loud.

710
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
Are you okay?

711
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
I'm much better now.

712
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Thank you so much.

713
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
You're welcome.

714
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
You're welcome.

715
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Mr. Ding.

716
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Yes?

717
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
The report from the court.

718
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,240
All the victims in the building

719
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,240
were involved in the murder of THC's mother.

720
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
So they all had a word,

721
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
a testimony, and a hallucination.

722
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
It's the mother.

723
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
That's right.

724
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
I think they should have taken

725
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
the drugs in the West Group's

726
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Heart-to-Heart Project.

727
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
They're the drugs.

728
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Help me find out

729
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
where Fuyang Mountain has been

730
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
and what they've done.

731
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
Yes, sir.

732
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
Mr. Ding.

733
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
The firemen have been working

734
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
for several hours.

735
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
Why don't you have a rest?

736
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
Yes, it's very warm.

737
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
Okay, take care.

738
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Thank you, sir.

739
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Everyone.

740
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
Go back and rest.

741
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
We'll sit down tomorrow.

742
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Thank you, sir.

743
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Thank you, sir.

744
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,240
I didn't want to disturb you.

745
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
No.

746
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Come and sit.

747
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
I'll get you some water.

748
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Thank you.

749
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
Have you thought about it?

750
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Even if we catch the third person,

751
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
we can't prove it.

752
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
He killed Fuyi Ming.

753
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
I think even if we can't prove it,

754
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
at least we should tell him

755
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
that his plan is not perfect.

756
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
We know his existence.

757
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
It's not simple.

758
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
He can't even run

759
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
through such a strict security.

760
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
He can still clear all the evidence

761
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
on the scene.

762
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
But he must have planned

763
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
very well.

764
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
So he must be

765
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
a self-reliant person.

766
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Such a high-ranking criminal,

767
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
ordinary people

768
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
can't understand it.

769
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
You should understand it.

770
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
No.

771
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Anyway, we

772
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
really need to find

773
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
someone who is very strict

774
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
about criminal psychology.

775
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
I thought

776
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
I suddenly remembered

777
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
that my friend is a professional.

778
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
He can help us.

779
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
They are your family.

780
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Why do you want to kill them?

781
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
I didn't kill them.

782
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
I just ate them.

783
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Then why do you want to eat them?

784
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Because

785
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
I don't want to

786
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
separate from the people I like.

787
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
You like them,

788
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
but they don't like you, right?

789
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
No.

790
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
No?

791
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Then what do they usually do to you?

792
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
They

793
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
usually

794
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
usually

795
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,240
because some small things hit me,

796
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
sometimes they don't feed me,

797
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
sometimes

798
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
they don't let me go out to meet my friends

799
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
and lock me up in the room.

800
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
That's not what I like about you.

801
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
They don't welcome you,

802
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
so you hate them,

803
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
kill them.

804
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
I don't have any.

805
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
I love them.

806
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
I want to stay with them forever,

807
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
so I can eat them.

808
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Do you see that?

809
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Guys,

810
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
what you just saw

811
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
happened in 97 years.

812
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,240
A famous double-dead murder case in the United States,

813
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
if you can

814
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
make a

815
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
psychological assessment of the criminal,

816
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
what conclusion will you have?

817
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
He tried to beautify his murderous movements,

818
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
but he was too aggressive.

819
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Very good.

820
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Anything else?

821
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
He didn't have any sympathy.

822
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Good point. Anything else?

823
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
He

824
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
seems to have his own logic

825
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
to evaluate this case.

826
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
You're right.

827
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
If you have a chance

828
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,240
to face such a criminal,

829
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,240
of course you'll be in a hurry, right?

830
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
But

831
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
we can deal with it in a more

832
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
aggressive way.

833
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
We can use the thought-provoking game

834
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,240
to quickly break through the psychological line of the criminal,

835
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
and then

836
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,240
find out the real side of him.

837
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,240
You're still drinking coffee and acting like a man.

838
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,240
Life is full of fun.

839
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,240
Long time no see.

840
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
Long time no see.

841
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
How did you know I was here?

842
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
You came back to Hong Kong.

843
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
The whole academic world knows about it.

844
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
It's hard to find you.

845
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,240
Then what's your problem this time?

846
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
There's a case that's more urgent.

847
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
I want to ask you for help.

848
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,240
The case of Fu Yiming?

849
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Is the police

850
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,240
giving me a special clear line?

851
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
That's simple.

852
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
I can give it to you.

853
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
You said it.

854
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Come on, introduce me to the fire department.

855
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
Please open it.

856
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
The criminal who was the suspect of the crime,

857
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Yang Zhifei,

858
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
is the psychologist in the heart of the criminal.

859
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Professor Yang,

860
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
is the name of the victim?

861
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
I'm a man of my word.

862
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
I don't know what's wrong with you.

863
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,240
No, I used to catch the police.

864
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
It's not the first time.

865
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,240
A very popular game recently,

866
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
48 hours of playing,

867
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
has many characters.

868
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Can you explain it with your eyes?

869
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Of course, Zijun.

870
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,240
The character of the character is just a simple name.

871
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,240
It's called a physical identity disorder.

872
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,240
It means that there are many characters in a human body

873
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
to help us endure the pain.

874
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Many times, patients will be lost.

875
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
And it's not possible to share

876
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,240
the characters and characters.

877
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,240
The psychologist said it all.

878
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
It's true.

879
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
She can't share it.

880
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
This beauty is the psychologist

881
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
who will be the expert tomorrow.

882
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Wait.

883
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
I don't know who the lawyer is.

884
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
I'm looking forward to what she will say tomorrow.

885
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I'm also looking forward to

886
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
how she will dress.

887
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
You're so colorful.

888
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
According to my professional analysis,

889
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,240
the defendant is the victim of the criminal.

890
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,240
One of the defendant's characters

891
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,240
is a woman who has been reported for a long time.

892
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,240
So the defendant will have some small actions in the next life.

893
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
For example, holding herself,

894
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,240
holding her finger and avoiding the eyes of others.

895
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
These are all small actions

896
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
that are often under pressure.

897
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
And the defendant has a change of hearing.

898
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Every time he has a change of hearing,

899
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
he needs to take the medicine to recover his calm.

900
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
And I have a tooth mark on my hand.

901
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
It's a P112.

902
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
You can also see that

903
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
the defendant was the victim of the report

904
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
when I was doing the assessment.

905
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,240
According to the expert's statement,

906
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
the defendant, Luo Yong,

907
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
was affected by mental illness

908
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
and was unable to control himself.

909
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Therefore, the jury decided to

910
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
report the defendant's murder and not to be punished.

911
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
The criminal was punished.

912
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
He was under pressure to suppress the mental illness.

913
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Wait for the decision.

914
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Stop.

915
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Do you have any evidence?

916
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
He was pretending.

917
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
It's okay. You can go first.

918
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
What do you mean?

919
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
It was his eyes.

920
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
I think he was very confused.

921
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
But I think you should not have noticed.

922
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
When you were talking,

923
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
he was very focused on looking at you.

924
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Because he heard all the characteristics you said

925
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
and then acted again.

926
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
And your tooth mark.

927
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
He was pretending to be stupid.

928
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
How could he have a lot of personality?

929
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
I can't tell you

930
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
if you think it's true or not.

931
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Right.

932
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
All you said on the court just now

933
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
were just the results of the study

934
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,240
and the report.

935
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
If a real personality

936
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
is sick and stands in front of you,

937
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,240
I don't think you can recognize it.

938
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Sir,

939
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
what do you think about the data

940
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
and the information to support your statement?

941
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
I also want to know

942
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,240
what exactly do you think about it.

943
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
I have been studying

944
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
mental health for a long time.

945
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
Actually, the court is also innocent.

946
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
It is not right to report

947
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
the evidence to support

948
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
your own strength.

949
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
I have some short-term courses in a few days.

950
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
You come to listen to them.

951
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
You will know what I am talking about.

952
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
You will never

953
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
give me the answer I want.

954
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Hello.

955
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
I am Yang Zhi Fei's friend.

956
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Professor Yang asked me to come

957
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
to take care of you.

958
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
It depends on whether you are used to it.

959
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,240
What do you mean?

960
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Well,

961
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,240
although it is better than prison,

962
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
we are still worried

963
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
that you will be reprimanded.

964
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
So,

965
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,240
if you have any questions,

966
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
you can tell me at any time.

967
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Right. And I also want to take care of you.

968
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
Do you have any other

969
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
way to talk to your second brother?

970
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Actually,

971
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
I don't have any other way.

972
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
I have taken a lot of medicines.

973
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
Those are just some hallucinations.

974
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
And I guess

975
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
I will be discharged in a year.

976
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Why?

977
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
Do you know that you will be discharged soon?

978
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,240
The doctor cured me.

979
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
I can't be discharged.

980
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
I am very patient.

981
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,240
I can be cured in a year.

982
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,240
The cure is not a hallucination.

983
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
It is the second self.

984
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Don't pretend to be a murderer.

985
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Professor Yang told me

986
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,240
that my condition is very affected.

987
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
I don't know why I am so worried.

988
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
I am very worried.

989
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,240
I don't know why I am so worried

990
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
when I see you.

991
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Don't kill me!

992
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Don't kill me!

993
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Don't kill me!

994
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Don't kill me!

995
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Don't kill me!

996
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
Don't kill me!

997
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,240
The game of recall that I mentioned earlier.

998
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
This system

999
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,240
helps us to enter the subconscious of the suspect as soon as possible.

1000
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,240
It also helps us to find the crime motive.

1001
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,240
At the same time, it can also help us to enter the crime scene.

1002
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
Do you have any students who want to try?

1003
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
How about this?

1004
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,240
We are lucky to have a detective who is in a deep battle.

1005
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
Why don't you show him to us?

1006
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Please, Mr. Xing.

1007
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Mr. Xing, let's relax a little bit.

1008
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
Put your foot down.

1009
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
We have been friends for a long time.

1010
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
I haven't seen an old friend come to chat.

1011
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
Close your eyes.

1012
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,240
You are sleeping on a endless ocean.

1013
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
The water is very warm.

1014
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,240
The things around you are getting farther and farther away from you.

1015
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
Slowly, slowly,

1016
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
you can only hear your own breathing.

1017
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
I'm sorry.

1018
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
I'm sorry.

1019
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
Mr. Xing.

1020
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
Mr. Xing, I see you.

1021
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,180
Beared all night, longing, over the dead body

1022
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,340
indistinct of the能

1023
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,020
Wacktrucks from nowhere

1024
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,780
From nowhere so cold and naïve

1025
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,860
Undefeated and rent cares

1026
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,600
P cannot stop

1027
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:03,600
If whole Zodiac even signs

1028
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,660
The hambartons can't be stopped

1029
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,640
You're so drunk

1030
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,780
The Robber in Chen brass

1031
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Who can understand the world?

1032
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,780
It turns out to be a color change

1033
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Your world, my world, her world

1034
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,780
There is no difference

1035
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,780
My world, her world

1036
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,780
There is no difference
