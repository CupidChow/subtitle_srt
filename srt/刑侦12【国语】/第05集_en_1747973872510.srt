1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,860
my

17
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:52,960
Very fun story...

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,980
Lord

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,900
is really sick

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,800
please understand

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
a doll's costume.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,800
The victim's body is confirmed to be Chen Yida's assistant,

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Liu Yawei.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Sir!

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Someone made a hand-pick in Liu Yawei's medicine.

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The purpose is to kill him.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
It should be the time of the wine.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
He may still be in the hospital.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
He has to protect all the animals.

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
The others will find him separately.

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Chen Ruo.

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Chen Ruo.

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,800
You know what there is done makes stewed sand.

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:33,960
Let's gain the Snowammad Box and

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
escape.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Give great pleasure.

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Yang Zhi Fei.

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Zhi Fei.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Zhi Fei.

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
The patient is on the way.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
The patient is on the way.

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Qing Kai, what's wrong with you?

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Yang Zhi Fei and I were attacked.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Liu Ai Wei was killed.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm coming over right now.

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Take care of Yang Zhi Fei.

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Please.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Ah Xian, have you been out after I fainted?

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
No.

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
What happened recently?

51
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Zhi Fei.

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Zhi Fei.

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Yang Zhi Fei.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Qing Kai.

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Jin Sa.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
The killer is here.

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
He's got Yang Zhi Fei pregnant.

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
How is it, Qing Kai?

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Hurry up.

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Try to avoid the other patients in the hospital.

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Call the doctor.

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Hurry up.

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Ye Sa.

64
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Zhi Fei.

65
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Zhi Fei.

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Zhi Fei.

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Wake up.

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
The doctor said he's fine.

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
He should be awake in a while.

70
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I want to ask

71
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
if there's any further symptoms.

72
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
No, don't worry.

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Sorry, Ding Sa.

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I was so close to the killer.

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
But I didn't catch him.

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
The IV is already in the sample.

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
There's a search for the killer.

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
But it's not done yet.

79
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
You're familiar with him.

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
I'm not sure.

81
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm not sure.

82
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm not sure.

83
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm not sure.

84
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
I'm not sure.

85
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
I'm not sure.

86
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm not sure.

87
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I've only seen him three years ago.

88
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Come in.

89
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Ding Sa.

90
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Ding Sa.

91
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I found out about Ke'er and me.

92
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Only one person

93
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
was in the room that Liu Ai Wei left.

94
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
That's right.

95
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
But the other two

96
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
were fine.

97
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
The walk was normal.

98
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
The killer's left foot

99
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
was healthy.

100
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
That means

101
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
there's only one person

102
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
from beginning to end.

103
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Or he pretended to be a killer

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
to distract us.

105
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
The strangest thing is

106
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
he only took a photo of the killer

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
and left the room.

108
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Then he left.

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Okay.

110
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Chen Yi and Liu Ai Wei.

111
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Plus the case of Fu Yiming.

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I don't think it's a coincidence.

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
That means

114
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
the case

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
is not just one person.

116
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
It's a group of people.

117
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Have you checked the IV?

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I've checked the hospital.

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
The killer has a chance to contact him.

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I haven't found him yet.

121
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
The CT report is out.

122
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
It's a brain tumor.

123
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
He'll be here soon.

124
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Thank you.

125
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Doctor.

126
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Ding Sa.

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Don't worry.

128
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Every floor, every entrance.

129
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I've arranged the fire station.

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
The surveillance camera is set up.

131
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
There's no one watching.

132
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
If there's anything,

133
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
we'll see it immediately.

134
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Why don't you relax?

135
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
There are so many of us

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
downstairs.

137
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
The killer won't come back.

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
The temperature is good.

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
He might have seen the killer.

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Then he won't come back.

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I've already packed.

142
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
I'll go back and rest.

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Thank you, doctor.

144
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Thank you, sir.

145
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Thank you.

146
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Thank you.

147
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Luckily, you're here.

148
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Otherwise...

149
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Come on!

150
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Come on!

151
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Come on!

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Come on!

153
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Come on!

154
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Come on!

155
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Come on!

156
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
The killer has been here.

157
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
The game is over.

158
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Luo Wei knows you're useless.

159
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
He asked me to help you wipe your ass.

160
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
What's the plan?

161
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I've always been the most cruel

162
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
and the best way to do it.

163
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
It's none of my business.

164
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I'm just looking for someone to help.

165
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Who?

166
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
An old friend.

167
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Headache?

168
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Take this medicine.

169
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Open your mouth.

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
You were fainted before.

171
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
So the emotion and the emotion

172
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
are in a very tense state.

173
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
So the sense of crisis has also increased.

174
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
It's fine after you take the medicine.

175
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Help me analyze it.

176
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Now the killer is a left-footed killer.

177
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
One is normal.

178
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
One is responsible for killing people.

179
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
The other is responsible for cleaning the scene.

180
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
And he has a strong organization.

181
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
How about this?

182
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Why don't you go with me

183
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
to find Liu Yaowei's family

184
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
and see if there's any clue?

185
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
It's only 7 o'clock now.

186
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
You're useless in a hurry.

187
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Listen to me.

188
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Wash your face.

189
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Go to bed.

190
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Go to bed first.

191
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Okay?

192
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
What's the progress?

193
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Sorry, Maide.

194
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
We're working hard.

195
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
We're working overtime

196
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
because of the traffic jam.

197
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
So I let them go home

198
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
and come back to work after the wash.

199
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
You're such a good person.

200
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Which police officer

201
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
is not so stupid?

202
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
In the past,

203
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
when I was in the middle of the case,

204
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
I slept for a few hours

205
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
after the investigation.

206
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
You did everything yourself.

207
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
You didn't let them go.

208
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
How did you grow up?

209
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I don't know.

210
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
The operation this time

211
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
was very important.

212
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
The reporters were also very close.

213
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
So we had to solve it as soon as possible.

214
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
And Yige thought the situation was too serious.

215
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
He decided to establish a special group.

216
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
You lead the investigation

217
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
with Luofeng

218
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
and Zhang Se'er.

219
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
With Zhang Se'er?

220
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
The investigation is different.

221
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
You two are

222
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
the best SP in Hong Kong.

223
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Luofeng,

224
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
we're all doing this

225
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
for the sake of our business.

226
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Madam.

227
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Come in.

228
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Madam,

229
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
do you need anything?

230
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Yes.

231
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm here to teach Man Gong.

232
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
You two can work together.

233
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Yes, madam.

234
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:34,800
The case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case

235
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:44,040
of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the Invest 풀

236
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,760
Adultery

237
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
I'm not even a person who has been abused by his girlfriend.

238
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,400
I didn't expect that so many netizens

239
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,600
would help them talk and sympathize with them.

240
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,900
It's just that some people are still clear.

241
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,100
It won't be because of their money.

242
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,600
Money?

243
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,600
Internet judges.

244
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,600
They all once had a controversial time

245
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,200
and were criticized for being publicized on the Internet.

246
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,600
People's underground.

247
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,600
It seems like it hasn't happened in a long time.

248
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,900
What's the matter?

249
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,300
I'm so scared.

250
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,300
It's all because of the bad guys.

251
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,200
What are you scared of?

252
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,500
How do you know what his next goal is?

253
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,600
No.

254
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,100
The three dead people are all related to Sata.

255
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,200
Don't you know?

256
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,300
An Xiyu Sata, the hero of the Yao Yao Yao.

257
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,300
Sata?

258
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,400
Let's search for it.

259
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,100
What is Sata?

260
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,800
How could it be related to Lian Huan and Xiong Sha?

261
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Newbies?

262
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
You don't even know that.

263
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,000
It's hard to explain.

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,700
I want to know if Sato is a person.

265
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,300
I just want to ask if Sata is a person

266
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,700
or a organization or a user name.

267
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
As long as you think he's a person,

268
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,700
what is he?

269
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,900
Have you ever met him?

270
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
Every day.

271
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Do you want to join?

272
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,500
Pull you into a group.

273
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,800
You're so mean.

274
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,900
Pull?

275
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,300
Sato is done?

276
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,900
Interesting.

277
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,500
Who has ever met him?

278
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't ask so many questions.

279
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,200
Xing Kai, I'm here.

280
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
You're so old-fashioned.

281
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I'm Wang You.

282
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I'm here to see you.

283
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I have time to catch two more criminals.

284
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,100
I'll be here to find them.

285
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,500
I'll also help you find their IP address.

286
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
All of them will be here to investigate.

287
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
You don't have to move.

288
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,100
Just catch them and come back.

289
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Let me try.

290
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Let me do it.

291
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,300
Look at your head.

292
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,700
Why are you using a real person?

293
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,300
You're so shameless.

294
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,100
I don't want to talk to you.

295
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,100
You also have a user name.

296
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,300
You even have a full name.

297
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,900
Help you fix it.

298
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,100
Xing Kai, you're so funny.

299
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,500
If you're a person,

300
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,500
come with me.

301
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Now it's a serial murder case.

302
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,500
It's a very serious case.

303
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
There are three generations of local merchants.

304
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
They are now being killed by the street.

305
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
And the owner of the house is also dead.

306
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I think this case is really very suspicious.

307
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Behind her,

308
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
there might be mysterious power controlling her.

309
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,100
Maybe it's a big accident.

310
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,100
She might be taken to the bottom of the building.

311
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,100
What is it?

312
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,500
I've never heard of it.

313
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,100
Have you ever heard of Saturn?

314
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
I don't know.

315
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
I've never heard of it.

316
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
I've heard of it.

317
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,700
After I heard of the people who met Saturn,

318
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,100
they suddenly died.

319
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Super.

320
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,300
Senior is also a player?

321
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,100
Finally, someone has realized it.

322
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,700
How many parents have you met?

323
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,500
I just started to take off.

324
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,300
What about you?

325
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,500
What is it?

326
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
It's Saturn 1115 game.

327
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
I've played it too.

328
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,900
Anxi and Saturn

329
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,300
1115's reputation.

330
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,500
I'm dead.

331
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm hurt.

332
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,300
I'm cold and weak.

333
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,900
What's the heart of the warm heart of the body?

334
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,100
What does it mean to be so cunning?

335
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,700
It's a duck's nose.

336
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,500
Actually, I've checked online.

337
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,100
It's not a name or a goldfish.

338
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Have you asked the people in the discussion area?

339
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,700
I've asked them.

340
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,100
They said they must go to the world by themselves.

341
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,500
That's why they're so cunning.

342
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,100
Is this a communication software?

343
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,500
I think it's a secret forum.

344
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,300
Seven comments and seven words.

345
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,100
It's not possible to go to different places.

346
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,300
I think it's very possible for the murderer

347
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,900
to use this forum to gather some people

348
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,300
who are like the same.

349
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,900
Since we can't guess the words,

350
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,700
why don't we try the words?

351
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Okay.

352
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,300
Why don't we find the next TCD?

353
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,300
No.

354
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,900
These subtitles are from AI.

355
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,700
They change every two minutes.

356
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,900
So if the user doesn't know this,

357
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,700
it's impossible to guess the word.

358
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,500
Can we find the IP?

359
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,900
It has a TOR at the bottom.

360
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,500
The user data is encrypted.

361
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,700
Then you can find a WAP in the world.

362
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,300
So every time you go to this website,

363
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,700
you don't know the IP address.

364
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,900
So now,

365
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
do you have any other ways to track it?

366
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,100
Not yet.

367
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,900
Actually, it's like a car.

368
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,700
You can get in the car when the car comes.

369
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,900
But when?

370
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
How?

371
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,300
I don't know.

372
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,500
So there's only one step at a time.

373
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,700
Keep an eye on it.

374
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,700
You must be a different person from the murderer.

375
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,100
You must.

376
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,500
One left foot is wrong.

377
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,100
The other is normal.

378
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,700
There's no way you can get in the car.

379
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
But you weren't very clear then.

380
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Did you really get in the wrong car?

381
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,100
No.

382
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,100
So the murderer will use the SETEN 1115?

383
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
There's definitely a possibility.

384
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,700
I remember the last time I went to SETEN,

385
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,500
many people were there.

386
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,700
So the murderer

387
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,900
used the SETEN 1115 to contact me.

388
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Even to find the target.

389
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,900
There's also a possibility that the murderer

390
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,100
met him upstairs.

391
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,700
And the next target

392
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,900
is the SETEN 1515.

393
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,700
This is the target.

394
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,900
Let's see if there's any problem.

395
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Let me see.

396
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,900
The SETEN 1515

397
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,900
SETEN 1515

398
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
SETEN 1515

399
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
S-S-SATAN

400
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
S-SATAN

401
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
S-S-SATAN

402
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Sartre.

403
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Hello, Zijun?

404
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,100
Can you please bring my computer over here?

405
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
I'll be right over.

406
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
Thank you.

407
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Sartre.

408
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Sartre.

409
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
Sartre, I'm Yang Zifei's friend.

410
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Shen Feizhou.

411
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Here.

412
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Zifei.

413
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
You're here.

414
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,300
How are you? Are you okay?

415
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
The weather is so nice today.

416
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Why don't we go for a walk?

417
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
I'm a little tired.

418
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
Where's my computer?

419
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,900
Why don't you wait for me to go to your favorite restaurant

420
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
and have some coffee while I'm at the cafe?

421
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Okay.

422
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
You have to have a good rest.

423
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
I'm going back to work.

424
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Call me if you need anything.

425
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Okay?

426
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Are you sure?

427
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,900
I'm going.

428
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Bye.

429
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Bye.

430
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
Bye.

431
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Sartre.

432
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Hi.

433
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Hi.

434
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
I'm back.

435
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
Where have you been these past few months?

436
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Did you do those three cases?

437
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Why haven't you practiced your piano yet?

438
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
What's wrong?

439
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Do you want to learn?

440
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
No, I just want to listen to your play.

441
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
I'll be faster when I'm at work.

442
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Are you stupid?

443
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
I'm coming.

444
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
I'm here to tell you something.

445
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
I booked my next ticket to America.

446
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,940
or you can just just say it ¿No?

447
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,980
Why so anxious that we came here,

448
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,860
we have to rest to breath Responding...

449
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,180
with the closing steering wheel

450
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,700
moment?

451
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:42,380
We can just go home and get it and fly fishing.

452
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,380
You can't even look at me anymore!

453
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,380
It's not even my fault!

454
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,380
It's my fault!

455
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
I love you!

456
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,380
I love you!

457
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
I love you!

458
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,380
I love you!

459
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,380
I love you!

460
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,380
I love you!

461
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
I love you!

462
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
I love you!

463
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,380
I love you!

464
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,380
That's my girlfriend!

465
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,100
Didn't you hear that? He's so poor!

466
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,820
Say it again!

467
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,220
Enough! Stop being so poor!

468
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
You've been hiding behind your sister since you were little!

469
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,380
How dare you get hit!

470
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,380
Jingluo Hu!

471
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,100
Let's play a game.

472
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
E play A play.

473
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,740
You really didn't get any points.

474
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
Wow!

475
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,380
You have so many emotions.

476
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,580
You're practicing every day.

477
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,140
Is it when you miss your sister so much?

478
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,820
I've been playing a lot recently.

479
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,180
I'm playing a friend's daughter.

480
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Friend?

481
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,100
Introduce yourself to me.

482
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,060
Don't bother me anymore, okay?

483
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,180
I didn't catch you before.

484
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,660
You're a little brat.

485
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,620
You've been through so many years.

486
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,580
Do you still remember?

487
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,380
It's been so many years.

488
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,780
Don't mention it, okay?

489
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,340
I just want to protect you.

490
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,740
You're still young.

491
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,460
I don't want you to be cheated again.

492
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
Protecting me?

493
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,900
Is it because you're satisfied with your strategy?

494
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,420
Why do we have to fight all day?

495
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,220
I'm your sister.

496
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,660
I won't want to hurt you.

497
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,180
It's because you're my sister that I said that.

498
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,260
Okay.

499
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
I won't force you.

500
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,380
But before I leave,

501
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,580
you can go to the hospital with me and see mom.

502
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,500
I won't come back again.

503
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,740
I really want to have a chat with my family.

504
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,100
I want to leave a last memory.

505
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,420
I'll think about it.

506
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
I'm leaving.

507
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,380
I'm leaving.

508
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,940
Think...

509
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,300
Think...

510
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,980
Since the audio is better now...

511
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,300
Cool.

512
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,140
After you take rest,

513
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,540
we can continue with New Year's Eve.

514
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,300
I'll see what's on we all are.

515
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,300
Drowsy...

516
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,700
Take your time.

517
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,980
Like

518
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,080
a sink,

519
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Not only that, those rats also took his place

520
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
and took other organs.

521
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,080
So he suffered a lot of pain before he died.

522
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
Why did the murderer suffer so much?

523
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,080
What's the reason?

524
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Did Fu Yiming and Chen Yiday

525
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
have any secrets on their bodies?

526
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,080
I didn't tell you about this.

527
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,080
But we must keep it a secret.

528
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Fu Yiming is in the funeral today.

529
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
The time is coming.

530
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Hurry up. Thanks.

531
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
What's the matter?

532
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Madam, I'm your search warrant.

533
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,080
I'm a serial killer.

534
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
I'm your special team leader.

535
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
Why didn't I get any notice?

536
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
Fu Yiming's body is about to get burned.

537
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
If it's burned,

538
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
there's no evidence.

539
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
Madam,

540
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
the purpose of the special team

541
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
is to keep the information.

542
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
Not everything is possible.

543
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Only they know...

544
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
I'll report the whole thing in the police station.

545
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
Madam,

546
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
I need to get the search warrant as soon as possible.

547
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Ding Sun,

548
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
I joined the special team

549
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
to see the truth.

550
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
I'm not going to tell you

551
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
that I joined the special team

552
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
to see you.

553
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Please follow the procedure

554
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
of the search warrant.

555
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
Madam.

556
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
One chance.

557
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,080
You know the consequences.

558
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
Madam.

559
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Hold on.

560
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,080
It's serious blood samples.

561
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,080
It's video of the preservation of alcohol.

562
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
This is what the department is going to issue.

563
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Please repeat.

564
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Please record theici-

565
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
decision that

566
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:24,080
the victim's哂

567
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
has poison and bad memory.

568
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,080
Yes.

569
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,520
i

570
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,020
Yes.

571
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,240
The search warrant says

572
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,440
there is important evidence in Mr. Fu's body.

573
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,400
We need to take him away.

574
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,680
You really can't help me find the real murderer.

575
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,200
We will try our best.

576
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,020
Han父 Yang

577
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,280
Han oxidation

578
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,960
You did an爆 news?

579
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,700
Did you find the key to the body?

580
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,980
The body fell to my hand are from an anesthetic page.

581
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,720
The endanger basically tries to find it and put it in there.

582
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,440
K如 char just a breakout.

583
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,140
So, I've found it bothering.

584
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,380
In addition, we have proved that the two dead bodies

585
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,580
have been bitten by insects.

586
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,220
We have also found that insects and bugs

587
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,980
are actually not created by humans in the future.

588
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,820
Ordinary criminals won't leave so many clues

589
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,860
to their confidence.

590
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,140
So they must be a criminal with a high IQ

591
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,820
and have a certain level of control over some kind of consciousness.

592
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,900
These are the marks they left for us.

593
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,540
They are like his signature.

594
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,140
In the position we reached,

595
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,180
we found that they are white ants

596
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,180
and the negative ones are red-haired pigs.

597
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,380
They are white ants and red-haired pigs.

598
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,260
They are all insects.

599
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,620
What are the two of them related to?

600
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:27,860
The power makes people rich.

601
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,140
When you have the absolute power,

602
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,660
what will you use?

603
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,140
Protecting the weak,

604
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,540
or the weak?

605
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,140
I will try.

606
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,540
I will try.

607
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,940
I will try.

608
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,340
I will try.

609
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,540
I will try.

610
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
I will try.

611
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
I will try.

612
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,940
I will try.

613
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
I will try.

614
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,740
I will try.

615
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,940
I will try.

616
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,940
I congratulate you for watching this video.

617
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,540
You are right.

618
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,540
The answer is the seven spirits.

619
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,340
The seven spirits are like red-haired pigs.

620
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,740
The weak will be the food.

621
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,140
Therefore,

622
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,940
the seven spirits must die for their sins.

623
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,540
Anxiyu Sato.

624
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,540
The hero of the 15th century.

625
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,140
Lord!

626
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,540
Lord!

627
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,740
Lord Gengcheng.

628
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,740
Sóngاus,

629
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,740
One day,

630
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,140
I will wait for her to come again.

631
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,860
and put everything in the poison.

632
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,340
The poison is like a white shadow.

633
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,220
It's the agent who caused the damage and went into the house.

634
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,540
It's the place where the environment

635
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,700
is suitable for living.

636
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,140
The two crimes that this woman said

637
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,860
are obviously the three victims.

638
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,180
I think this woman

639
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,860
has a certain relationship with that murderer.

640
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,140
Look at what these shots said.

641
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,460
So many people agree with her.

642
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,940
They think it's a trap.

643
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,900
Maybe someone will affect her and kill her.

644
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,860
The first two crimes have been committed.

645
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,580
The next one is the poison.

646
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,020
What kind of revenge is the next time?

647
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,660
We enjoy the fun of the puzzle

648
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,380
and look forward to the next punishment.

649
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,780
OK, let's not waste time on this.

650
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,580
I don't know if this video was edited by someone.

651
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,580
This woman said that

652
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,700
she is very stable in every case with us.

653
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,540
Look at her image and her promotion.

654
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,980
She should be more than ten years old.

655
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,380
And she is still a student.

656
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,820
We went to the school to investigate.

657
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,100
I think she may not be in school.

658
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,780
Because I remember that she was in the afternoon

659
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,180
when she was on the video.

660
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,180
What about the poison?

661
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,340
It should be the poison.

662
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,860
What's the situation with the poison now?

663
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,740
The poison is mostly from those three lines.

664
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,580
Three lines.

665
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,460
The boss of the company is Fang Jia Shi,

666
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,460
the heir to the family,

667
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,900
and the boss of the night market, Zhou Ge.

668
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,740
The poison is mostly from those three lines.

669
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,500
Let's have a talk with them.

670
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,940
Yes, sir.

671
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,580
Makarot Hairpin

672
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,780
Xiaoting.

673
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,620
Brother Haotang.

674
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,660
How's Feng's side?

675
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,700
Bad-tempered.

676
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,020
Is that not much?

677
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,700
Hurry up.

678
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,060
I want to enjoy it as before.

679
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,420
Are you happy at all?

680
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,620
Sure.

681
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,220
You should be careful.

682
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,580
Don't worry about the всё.

683
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,580
I know.

684
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
A few days ago,

685
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,580
the president of the West Group,

686
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,580
who was killed by Li Qi,

687
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,580
was the only one in Fucheng Mountain,

688
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,580
who was killed today.

689
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,580
The police are now in the police department.

690
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,580
More cases are being reported,

691
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,580
and the police are still in the police department.

692
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
What's going on?

693
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,580
Hey, Yang Shan.

694
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,580
Wen San.

695
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,580
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

696
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Your brother's family has been in a panic,

697
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,580
are you okay?

698
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,580
I'm fine.

699
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
You don't care about your family business, do you?

700
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,180
Why are you here?

701
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,580
I have an appointment with my dad.

702
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,580
You go there.

703
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,580
Yang Shan is here.

704
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
Didn't we just meet?

705
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,580
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

706
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,580
Let's say hello to our uncles first.

707
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,980
Yang Shan, you came back from the US last night to study?

708
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,180
Yes.

709
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,180
I want to talk to you about Cheng Shan.

710
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
You two talk first.

711
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,980
Okay, I'll call the doctor.

712
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
This is your first time here.

713
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
This factory is made by our company.

714
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,980
It's very hard to get a good reputation for the IP.

715
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,980
You can call your friends and bring them here to play.

716
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,980
I know them.

717
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,980
They are the CEO of the Kangli Bao Group, Wang Mingzhi.

718
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,980
They are the director of the WH hospital, Lu Yisheng.

719
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,980
They are the real boss of the hospital.

720
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,980
They are also the famous hotel company's boss, Xi Ming.

721
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
There are also many big lawyers.

722
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,980
Some of them are also in the top of the group.

723
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,980
You are not suitable here.

724
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
It's better for you to know them.

725
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
It's better for you to get along with them.

726
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,980
They are your business friends.

727
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
They are more important to me.

728
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
You will come back to the company sooner or later.

729
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,980
If you don't want to talk about Cheng Shan, I'll leave now.

730
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Why are you leaving?

731
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Wang Na, say hello to your uncles first.

732
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,980
They are leaving.

733
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,980
This is my bad temper.

734
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,980
You are very similar to his mother.

735
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,980
She was so beautiful back then.

736
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,980
She was the daughter of Nado.

737
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,980
She was so strong that she fell for him.

738
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
Sorry, I'm leaving.

739
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
I'll call you later.

740
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,980
Wow, you are so good.

741
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
You are so serious.

742
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
Have a rest.

743
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Sorry, I'm sorry.

744
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

745
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,980
No problem. You don't have to be so polite.

746
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,980
I want to get a prize too.

747
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,980
Oh, these prizes.

748
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,980
These prizes.

749
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,980
I worked hard to win this.

750
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,980
My name is for you.

751
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,980
Thank you, uncle.

752
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
No need.

753
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Tongtong, do you like the kids who play with the stars?

754
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,980
I put them here.

755
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,980
Thank you.

756
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
You are welcome.

757
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
It's too late. Let's go back.

758
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,980
No, I want to practice more.

759
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,980
No, uncle is really tired.

760
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,980
Go back.

761
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,980
Go home.

762
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,980
Have a rest.

763
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,980
You have to rest too.

764
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,980
I'll play again next time.

765
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
Okay.

766
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,980
Let's go.

767
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,980
Bye.

768
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,980
Thank you.

769
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Bye.

770
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
Good night, uncle.

771
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
Good night.

772
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Good night.

773
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,980
Mom, I have to find uncle Feng tomorrow.

774
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
It's so bad.

775
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,980
Don't go to his house every day.

776
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,980
Why? Don't you like uncle Feng?

777
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
No, I don't.

778
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,980
He has to work for so long.

779
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
Go to sleep.

780
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,980
Go to sleep.

781
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,980
What are you doing?

782
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,980
Go home.

783
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,980
This is not your house.

784
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,980
Go.

785
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,980
This is not my house.

786
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,980
Are you my wife?

787
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,980
We are married.

788
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,980
What are you doing?

789
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,980
Go away.

790
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,980
Go away.

791
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,980
What are you afraid of?

792
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,980
We don't love each other.

793
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,980
We don't have any problems.

794
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,980
Go away.

795
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,980
Go away.

796
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,980
Go away.

797
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,980
Go away.

798
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,980
It's okay.

799
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,980
It's okay.

800
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,980
It's okay.

801
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,980
It's okay.

802
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,980
It's okay.

803
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,980
It's okay.

804
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,980
Is there any supplement?

805
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
Hey.

806
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,980
It's 48 hours.

807
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,980
Don't tell him to keep it.

808
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Is there any problem?

809
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,980
No.

810
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,980
Don't tell him to keep it.

811
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,980
Is there any problem?

812
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
He is a good man.

813
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
He is definitely enough.

814
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,980
Yes, sir.

815
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Hello, what's up, Xin Kai?

816
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,980
Yes, sir.

817
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,980
We have an emergency.

818
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,980
The informant Zhang said that we will check the three channels tomorrow.

819
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
He is now with the whole team.

820
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,980
He is going to leave.

821
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,980
He wants to take us home.

822
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,980
Wait for me.

823
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,980
Come.
