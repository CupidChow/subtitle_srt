1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The End

2
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll teach you a lesson, okay?

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I've told you many times.

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you want to catch it, you can catch the criminal who is in the prison.

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you catch the criminal, you'll be able to break the criminal's actions.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll have to arrest him if he's a criminal.

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't care who the criminal is.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And if the criminal is missing, you can find him.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But what about the boss?

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You can't do that.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Then you don't need to record the case immediately.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you want to go to the underground, you can warn him.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You also need to warn him.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I've convinced you.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I know you're very responsible.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But you're a criminal.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're not a social worker.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You don't need to investigate the case yourself.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Then listen to me.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry to trouble you.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm going to the meeting later.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Sit here and write a report.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay?

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay?

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're so stupid.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If you want to let the criminal break the case,

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you can't even see him.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hey, where are you going?

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you serious?

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are we going to fight him every time?

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What if he hits Gao Juzou?

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Since you taught me,

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't do anything alone.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, I didn't mean that.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How about we go eat first?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
After that, think about it.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay?

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Give me the handcuffs.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Sier, believe me.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My daughter won't leave the house.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She'll be in danger.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Every parent comes here.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She'll tell us this.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The missing person will be found out.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't be angry.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Look at her face.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I said my daughter is dead.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Can you find her for me?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We have to do things according to the rules.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You go back and wait for her.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, no.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That man is not a good person.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He must want to hurt my daughter.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can catch him and interrogate him.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Look, you're so innocent.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't talk nonsense.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And you're defending other people.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We can't get out of here.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You go first.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll get the things.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sier, that man really wants to hurt my daughter.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He'll kill my daughter.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
My daughter is called Zeng Jiayi.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Ever since she met that man,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
she's changed.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She doesn't want to tell me anything.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
One day, I saw her on a private car.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And she never came back.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That man must not be a good person.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Before the missing person's investigation group

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
investigated you,

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll check you out.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sier, thank you.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I found out that three months ago,

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
your daughter participated in the West Bank charity fund.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
She participated in the activities of the Lin Chuan psychology school,

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hu Yangshan.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Did she mention this to you?

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Or did she say she's been involved in psychology?

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hello, I want to participate in this activity.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I only signed a contract with the activity.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But I don't know if she has participated in psychology.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think your daughter's missing person and the West Bank

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
are very involved.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll go there and find out.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll inform you.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sure, come and Olina's body.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I accept Werxin's answer.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Then, please let's go and see her.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Director,

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
how can you be so aloof that you can't,

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
if you do something to stop her?

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Nothing makes sense?

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Can you let us out this is all you need?

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, let's do it this way.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
For ringing the bell,

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
you can sing as well as someone,

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I know.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Every year, they donate to the police.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Every time they want to hold a party,

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
they will pay for it.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You know that you went to find them.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are standing in their office.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you sure this case has something to do with them?

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you have any rules to contact them?

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, sir.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So they are voting for you.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You have no evidence.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't go to the company again.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mr. Li, please inform my daughter.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Miss, my daughter is gone.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Please call her.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Miss, my daughter is gone.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Please call her.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Please call her.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Sir, my daughter is gone.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Please call her.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Sir, please call her.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's wrong?

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Nothing.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Did you remember the situation of the car accident?

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Actually, I don't need psychological counseling.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ever since the accident happened,

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you have been in a lot of reactions

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
whether it's psychological or physical.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Your boss mentioned it in your work report.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You were too hard on the investigation.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The accident became a tragedy.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So you came here to do psychological counseling.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't think I have any problem.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If your boss and your partner

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
are involved in the accident,

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you should be able to prove it.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I think we should stop wasting our time.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There should be more accidents.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You need psychological counseling more.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Xing Sun, it's the last psychological counseling.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If you still don't cooperate,

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I can only do my best

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
to send my assessment to your department.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going to eat lunch.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's go to eat.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What do you want?

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I want to listen to you.

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Wait.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What's wrong?

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why are you angry?

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Have you eaten?

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's go together.

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The person who just went to the hospital

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
has no appetite.

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can go out and eat.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can't eat.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You will be hungry.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, okay.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll bring you a meal.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Wait for me.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I want to ask you how long have you been a psychologist?

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Ten years.

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Then let me ask you.

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You've been helping me for months.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What kind of person do you think I am?

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Can you tell me

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
what's the difference between me and others?

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You are a strong person who protects himself.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You have a lot of doubts and distrust about the things around you.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You are always in a high position

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and don't know how to relax at all.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This will cause you and your colleague

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to be very difficult to communicate or to establish trust.

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So my conclusion is

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
that you are a person who is not suitable for police.

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You have been in this room for ten years.

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I have been in the street for ten years

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and I have been caught by the thief.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes, I am not a big thief.

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I am also not a friend.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But at least I saved a lot of people.

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I also caught a lot of criminals to jail.

190
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
How do you want to explain your own matter?

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But am I suitable to be a police?

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You have no right to say.

I'm going to die.

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I said it before.

or soup.

209
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,960
It's all for one.

210
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,960
And some of his ingredients.

211
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,040
I think so.

212
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,720
Eat more of this.

213
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,480
Okay.

214
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,400
Olu asked you if you want to eat lunch.

215
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,880
You're too bad.

216
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,200
You should go.

217
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,840
It's just a simple talk.

218
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,560
He's not my girlfriend.

219
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,080
I don't need to be alive.

220
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
What about Dr. Zhao?

221
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,840
Why do you hope for him?

222
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,560
He's useless.

223
00:10:48,560 --> 00:11:12,540
I'll

224
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,800
do it.

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,560
Treat you as my tea.

226
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,480
I'll kill you with a body.

227
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
You're the one who killed my mom.

228
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
You're the one who got hurt.

229

You want to find your son?

234
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,080
J Yupeng wants to marry you.

235
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,960
Don't go. Don't go.

236
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,460
It's all right.

237
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,460

Details Describe the choice OF noodle

239
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:43,900
The most important thing is you don't get hurt

240
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,420
I've been here since I was a kid.

241
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,620
You didn't get hurt.

242
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,860
I don't want to sell.

243
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,020
No, I found Zeng Jiayi.

244
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,860
Zeng Jiayi was found at 10 a.m.

245
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,340
in the Green Hills Palace in Yuanlang.

246
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,580
He was sent to the hospital.

247
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,260
Suppose he was forgotten.

248
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,500
Do you remember that?

249
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,500
When Zeng Jiayi gave birth,

250
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,380
Zeng Jiayi was sent to

251
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,940
to hell again.

252
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,060
In 2016,

253
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,780
since he gave birth laundry for the Song Dynasty,

254
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,260
he specially issued one of the daredevilts

255
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,380

256
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,860

258
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,780
His name is Zeng Jiayi.

259
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,340
Iv everything half-grown.

260
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,700
Whether Prince Zeng was injured

261
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,940
or the federal blow!

262
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,740
Easy!

263
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,700
He's staying here somehow,

264
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,500
while the昨日

265
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Yes, the patient is in a state of fear for a long time.

266
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
He is completely isolated from his sister and his sister.

267
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
He needs time to recover.

268
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
We also checked his urine and blood sample.

269
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
We didn't find any poison.

270
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
But I checked his pupils just now.

271
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
But there are some white marks.

272
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
It's not because of the poison that he is controlled.

273
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
And he hasn't been in contact with the light for a long time.

274
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
What do you mean?

275
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
In the past year, have you been locked up in a very dark place?

276
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Who locked you up?

277
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Did you meet the man in the school?

278
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Did you meet him in the activity held by the Fuyang Mountain?

279
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I don't know.

280
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
I don't know.

281
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Don't you remember anything?

282
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
What did you do after the activity?

283
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
What happened?

284
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
How did you escape?

285
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
I can't hear you.

286
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I can't hear you.

287
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Say it again.

288
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I can't hear you.

289
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
I don't remember.

290
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I don't remember.

291
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
I don't remember.

292
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Liao Weiss.

293
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
The patient's condition is very unstable.

294
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
He needs time to rest.

295
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I suggest you to come to the entrance a few days later.

296
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
They don't need to come here.

297
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
We will take care of it.

298
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
The fire of the witness will be brought here later.

299
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
The two C teams will be in charge of the headquarters of the Hong Kong district.

300
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Ok.

301
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Isn't this case in charge of the NP?

302
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
The increase in the number of people and the person is related to the group.

303
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Now we have the headquarters of the headquarters.

304
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Here you are.

305
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
You are not listening to me.

306
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
You want to take a picture of me?

307
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Where did you get the name of the person?

308
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
This case is mine.

309
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Don't you want to betray me?

310
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:09,500
So.

311
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:16,500
She seems electrically damaged.

312
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Why do you say the building is strong?

313
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
What should I do?

314
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Different atheist.

315
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
He is the chairman of the Xie Ye Group.

316
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
He is a Hong Kong businessman and a Hong Kong red man.

317
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
He has been working in the street for 90 years.

318
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
He will start to turn around later.

319
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Other than the property,

320
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
he has also invested in the drug industry.

321
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
We found out that

322
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Fu De Shan has become a famous author.

323
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
He must get anything he likes.

324
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
If he can't get it,

325
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
he will be killed by his family sooner or later.

326
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
He has two children.

327
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Fu Yang Shan is a college professor.

328
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Fu Cheng Shan is the chairman of the Xie Ye Group.

329
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Let's talk about Fu Cheng Shan first.

330
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
His style and his daddy have a big difference.

331
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Xie Ye Group's image this year

332
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
mainly depends on him to do many charity activities

333
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
and get a change.

334
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
As for Fu Yang Shan,

335
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
he and his daddy are not compatible.

336
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
So he didn't join the Xie Ye Group.

337
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
He is currently a student of the university

338
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
and is a famous psychologist.

339
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Now Xie Ye Group is equipped

340
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
like a proper institution.

341
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,500
It's all thanks to the White Palace.

342
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
According to the news of the international scene,

343
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Xie Ye Group has recently developed

344
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
a project in Southeast Asia.

345
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
The location includes Thailand, Vietnam,

346
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
and the Pujian.

347
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
What's very strange is that

348
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
we have been investigating for a long time

349
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
the main brain of the Fan Mai People's Group.

350
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Naurang has a secret connection.

351
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
We are OK.

352
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Naurang has contacted the Hong Kong agent.

353
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
And the identity of the suspect has been confirmed.

354
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Fu Yiming is the student of Fu Cheng Shan.

355
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
He is currently studying computer science in the university.

356
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
His grandpa, Ye Fu,

357
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
has been working in the company for two years.

358
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,500
And he is in charge of the Southeast Asian architecture project.

359
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
So we believe that

360
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Naurang's Hong Kong agent

361
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
has a secret connection with Xie Ye Group.

362
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
And this Fu Yiming

363
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
is the target we need to investigate now.

364
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Young Master, Young Master is back.

365
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Let me give you a hand.

366
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
It's clear.

367
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
It's good to have a servant in this kind of physical activity.

368
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
It's not like you're in trouble.

369
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
You say that if you can,

370
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I'll let you do it.

371
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Of course I can.

372
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
What can I do?

373
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Just say it.

374
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
I really don't understand.

375
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Fu Yiming is already rich.

376
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Why do you want to do this?

377
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
The richer the better.

378
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
The richer the better.

379
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I want to give Fu Yiming a name.

380
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
He will post some fake ads on the Internet

381
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
and have fake travel.

382
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
He will want to trick people.

383
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
After he has tricked them,

384
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
he will lock them up.

385
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Then he will send them to Southeast Asia.

386
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
It's been a long time since he has been out of the goods.

387
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
The price is still on the rise.

388
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
So we must keep an eye on him

389
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
in this period of time.

390
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
We hope to find his hidden location.

391
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Open here!

392
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Open your hands!

393
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Master Encue.

394
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
And I help him.

395
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Master Encue,

396
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
while he is here,

397
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Let's go.

398
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Let's go.

399
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Let's go.

400
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I'm on the way to the railway station.

401
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm on the way to the railway station.

402
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Hey, wait a minute.

403
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
What's wrong?

404
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
I'm on the way.

405
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm out of here.

406
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Let's go.

407
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Let's go.

408
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Let's go.

409
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm going to the railway station.

410
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Let's go.

411
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Let's go.

412
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Stop.

413
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Stop.

414
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Stop.

415
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Stop.

416
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
There are many people.

417
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
They can't talk.

418
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Yes, they can.

419
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Don't stop.

420
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Don't stop.

421
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Stop.

422
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Stop.

423
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Stop.

424
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Stop.

425
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,880
Stand by and take off!

426
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,660
Roll over!

427
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,140
The cost is not present here.

428
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,780
Go first!

429
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,440
Depending what the cost is,

430
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,700
we'll stall at the elbow fairs instead of your signature items.

431
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,340
So take off or not carelessly!

432
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,880
Yes.

433
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,160
Major B sent a message,

434
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,900
calling you.

435
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,580
He has absolutely no aim butthlety.

436
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,260
To his opponent's enemies.

437
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,980
Wake up quickly!

438
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,980
Golf Yankee 908, follow me

439
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,980
Hello, my friend just got on the plane

440
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
I don't know

441
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
Okay, thank you

442
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,980
I heard you lost the target again

443
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,980
What a surprise

444
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,980
If you have the ability, you won't be found

445
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,980
If you are not doing well, you can find me

446
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,980
I sent my team members to help you

447
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
Did you hear me, Jie Chen?

448
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
No problem

449
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,980
Zhang Sen, the clues of this case are all found by our team members

450
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,980
So you don't need to help

451
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
Thank you

452
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Ding is a horseman, he is very suspicious

453
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
What horseman?

454
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,980
Ding Sen, I'm worried about you going to the scene

455
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
There is something wrong with the scene

456
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,980
They are being blamed by the team

457
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,980
So I suggest we should find the case

458
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,980
If we are too busy, the team members will be killed

459
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,980
If you need help, you can call me anytime

460
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Okay

461
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Let's continue

462
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,980
Don't waste time for this nonsense

463
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,980
Don't waste time for this nonsense

464
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
I don't know

465
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,980
Do you want to know

466
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,980
What is the best thing I can do?

467
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
Do you want to know?

468
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
I want to know

469
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,980
I really don't understand

470
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Zeng Jiayi, he is a bad guy

471
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,980
But why he is lying?

472
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,980
And what does he mean by animal psychology?

473
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,980
PTSD and feeling of post-traumatic disorder

474
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,980
PTSD is a serious fear of his previous experience

475
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,980
He will avoid thinking about the cause of his memory or accident

476
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,980
So he can't say it

477
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,980
Feeling of post-traumatic disorder is a secret place

478
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:12,980
His sense of feeling and memory are a little bit of sound, smell or touch

479
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
All will cause his cognitive bias

480
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,980
And turn the illusion into reality

481
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,980
As for animals and forest, it should be where he is often locked up

482
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,980
There is a similar sound and smell

483
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Why he was locked up for so long

484
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
And not sold

485
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
He is a slave?

486
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
No

487
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,980
He has been examined by the court

488
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
He didn't have a trace of his life

489
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,980
Maybe

490
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,980
Hello

491
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
Hello, sir

492
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
The report is coming

493
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,980
In the mud on Zeng Jiayi's shoe

494
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,980
He checked the dirt and water in the dirt

495
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,980
And some glass, wood and iron

496
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,980
And a lot of water

497
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,980
Okay

498
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,080
Marc

499
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,980
The place where the man was shot was in the nearby village.

500
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,180
And he was locked up for so long,

501
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,180
but he was not found.

502
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,780
That means the man in the village was very low.

503
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,380
And the place where the man was shot was just a...

504
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Hangzhou.

505
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,780
I finally found you.

506
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
Dmitry, I found you.

507
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,980
When I was looking at the road,

508
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,180
I saw the car of the deputy's name

509
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
driving out of the parking lot.

510
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,580
And then I kept chasing him.

511
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,180
I saw him stop in a village.

512
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,780
But I couldn't see the situation inside.

513
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780
Because there was nothing.

514
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
Hangzhou.

515
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:33,180
Dmitry.

516
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
There is no one in the car.

517
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,380
Search the car.

518
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,180
Yes.

519
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
Check your equipment.

520
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,180
Just like what we said today.

521
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,180
Let's split up.

522
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
Be careful.

523
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Yes, sir.

524
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
Police!

525
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
I am a cop too.

526
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Count down.

527
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,180
One, two, three.

528
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,180
Take out your ID card.

529
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
One, two, three.

530
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
Take it slow.

531
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,180
What are you doing?

532
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,180
Your men are here.

533
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,180
Okay.

534
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
Let's split up.

535
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Okay.

536
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,180
Look for the car.

537
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
Yes, sir.

538
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,180
Hurry up.

539
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Let's split up and make a move.

540
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
Let's split up.

541
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,180
Come on.

542
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Don't move.

543
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,180
Go.

544
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,180
Go.

545
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,180
Don't move.

546
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,180
Go.

547
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,180
Go.

548
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Go.

549
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
Go.

550
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,180
Go.

551
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,180
Go.

552
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,180
Go.

553
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
Go.

554
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,180
Go.

555
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
Go.

556
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:42,680
fuck you

557
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,100
with the film leading to the death.

558
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,300
소 собрать п 53ers

559
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,300
I found it.

560
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,300
I found it.

561
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,300
Zongjia...

562
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
You're the girl you're looking for?

563
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Yes.

564
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,300
It's just a proof that

565
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,300
she's from the same family as you.

566
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
I'm not sure.

567
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,300
I'm sure.

568
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,300
I'm sure.

569
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
I'm sure.

570
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
I'm sure.

571
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
It also means that

572
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
she's been kept here.

573
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Liu,

574
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
come to the yellow house immediately.

575
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
I'll go.

576
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
Zongjia

577
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Zongjia

578
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,300
Zongjia

579
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
Zongjia

580
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Don't be afraid.

581
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,300
We're the police.

582
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Don't be afraid.

583
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Don't be afraid.

584
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
I'm the police.

585
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,300
I'm sorry.

586
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,300
Get lost.

587
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Don't be afraid.

588
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,300
We have evidence in the scene.

589
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Don't be afraid.

590
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,300
Don't be afraid.

591
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Ding Zuo,

592
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
bring the money to the scene.

593
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,300
Yes, sir.

594
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,300
Don't be afraid.

595
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,300
Let's investigate the money.

596
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,300
Please leave here.

597
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,300
His body is gone.

598
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
Maybe he's in danger.

599
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Come on,

600
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,300
get out.

601
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
We can't see him.

602
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,300
We need to find him.

603
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,300
Oh, no.

604
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,300
Save that man.

605
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,300
There's another one!

606
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,300
What are you doing?

607
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Please, give me a hand.

608
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Mr. Gu Yiming,

609
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,300
you are the first one to commit suicide.

610
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,300
You are trying to take the criminal away or to be punished.

611
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Do you understand?

612
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
Do you understand?

613
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Before the lawyer comes, I won't answer any questions.

614
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
Come in.

615
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,300
Hello, I'm the lawyer of the law firm of the West.

616
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
This is my name.

617
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,300
I'm Mr. Gu Yiming's lawyer.

618
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,300
I'm the lawyer of the law firm of the West.

619
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
I'm the lawyer of the law firm of the West.

620
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,300
I'm the lawyer of the law firm of the West.

621
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
I'm the lawyer of the law firm of the West.

622
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,300
You can talk now.

623
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,300
You're asking questions?

624
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,300
These people are the missing persons of the criminal group.

625
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,300
They have been in the group for three years.

626
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
Then why did you arrest them?

627
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
Why did you arrest me?

628
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
You are the Hong Kong representative of the group, right?

629
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Aser, please give the evidence of the crime while you're in the office.

630
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,300
If you don't, you're the person who killed me.

631
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,300
We'll sue you.

632
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,300
If you want to cooperate with us, I can help you to investigate.

633
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Ding Lefeng, I'm warning you.

634
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,300
Please don't use the words of the criminal to mislead the person.

635
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,300
If you don't cooperate with us, I'll investigate all the people of the West.

636
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Bring back all the people.

637
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Including your grandpa, your mom, your dad.

638
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Do you want to take action against them?

639
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,300
First of all, I don't have any property.

640
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
This village is not mine.

641
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,300
I don't understand why you police suspect me.

642
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,300
Do you have any evidence?

643
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,300
Do you think I'm the one who did it?

644
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,300
The evidence is very good.

645
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,300
I'll answer the phone first.

646
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
Before I come back, don't say anything.

647
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
I'll go and do some things.

648
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,300
Do you know the person who hired you?

649
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,300
And what's his identity?

650
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,300
I don't know.

651
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,300
Why did you get locked up there?

652
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,300
I was in a bad mood.

653
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,300
I went to a friend of mine.

654
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,300
We went to the beach together.

655
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,300
I was alone when I heard the song.

656
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:08,300
I was out of the house and was suddenly knocked out.

657
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,300
I was there when I woke up.

658
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,300
What was the internet?

659
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,300
The secret internet of the slave palace.

660
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,300
What's the secret of the slave palace?

661
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Someone saw a group on the Internet.

662
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,300
They asked us to find some work pressure in the group.

663
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,300
We made some money.

664
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,300
We were forced to work overtime because we couldn't afford to pay our relatives.

665
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,300
We were forced to die.

666
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,300
We were treated like dogs.

667
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,300
We had no dignity.

668
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,300
We were forced to leave the city.

669
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,300
These victims are all common people.

670
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,300
They are the weak in the real world.

671
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
They are oppressed.

672
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,300
They can easily destroy themselves.

673
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
They can destroy the city.

674
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
They have no social comfort.

675
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,300
They have no self-awareness.

676
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
They are being bullied.

677
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,300
In the future,

678
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,300
if they give them a little bit of love,

679
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,300
they will be like the enemy.

680
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,300
They will destroy their self-awareness.

681
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,300
They will be like the enemy.

682
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,300
They will think that the only place they can trust is here.

683
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,300
So, Zeng Jiayi is not a real man.

684
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,300
He really thinks that Fu Yiming is good to him.

685
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
He wants to hide it for Fu Yiming.

686
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,300
So, Zeng Jiayi won't run away.

687
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,300
Fu Yiming is not a real man.

688
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,300
Let's go.

689
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
No, he can't see me when he comes back.

690
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,300
Don't bother him.

691
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,300
We have family and friends waiting for us.

692
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Let's go.

693
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
Hurry up.

694
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,300
Let's go.

695
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Hurry up.

696
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Hurry up.

697
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
Be careful.

698
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Hurry up.

699
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Hurry up.

700
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
Hurry up.

701
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,300
Where are the three of them?

702
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,300
The End

703
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,300
The End
