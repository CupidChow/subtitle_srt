1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,160
Murder of his wife

2
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,640
The criminal is all blame

3
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,200
I have sent aİind

4
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
He is guilty

5
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,140
Sanitizing the case

6
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,420
It seems that the murderer

7
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,040
Has committed a passwords

8
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,180
But seem a little differently

9
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,260
It is the victim at different points

10
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,100
He is innocent

11
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,620
Well, it seems that

12
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,700
These criminals

13
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,600
We can easily say that

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,480
I think the killer of this new wife is a underground judge.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,760
I personally don't object to this.

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,080
Because they are making a report for Tian.

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,120
You see?

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
This devil

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,640
openly supports the new wife.

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,800
I don't know if this is a good thing

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,520
to teach her to commit crimes.

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,600
Professor Yang,

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,240
this person is from the security team.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
He is the professor here.

25
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,840
Thank you, director.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,120
Yang Zhifei and his friends

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,360
are just trying to get a hold of her.

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,320
She is not worthy of being a professor.

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,920
I hope

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,160
that the university, except for the one who is going to fire her,

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,840
will take her away from the emotional support plan.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,520
She is not worthy of being a person like us.

33
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,120
What can I do for you, Mr. Yang?

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,120
Professor Yang Zhifei,

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,120
can you explain

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,000
your position of new wife to commit crimes?

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,440
Yes.

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,320
We will talk about it slowly.

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
But first, please take these things away

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,800
and stop your discussion.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,920
What can't you say here?

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,960
Explain to everyone right away.

43
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,600
How will you take responsibility for your discussion?

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,480
First,

45
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,240
I don't support the illegal behavior of killing people.

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,280
You completely covered up my words.

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,920
If you really want to discuss it,

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,920
we can find a more suitable place to discuss it openly.

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,240
Instead, before I explain it,

50
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,800
you should kill me here.

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,280
If you don't cooperate,

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,120
I can only ask Bao An to take you out.

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,200
You are the one who can drive me out of here.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,560
I am here to announce that I will

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
arrest and arrest the new wife

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,760
in the long term.

57
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,120
I hope that everyone can come with me

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,240
and catch the new wife.

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,400
You can't kill her here.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,040
Go.

61
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,600
Professor Yang Zhifei,

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,320
please kill her.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,920
Professor Yang Zhifei,

64
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,720
please kill her.

65
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,040
Professor Yang Zhifei,

66
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
please kill her.

67
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,840
You are so childish.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,360
Why don't you treat me like a man?

69
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,920
Aren't you wearing it?

70
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,520
You are not interested in me either.

71
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
I bought a feast.

72
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,840
And a salted egg. Come here.

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,440
Why?

74
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,400
I know that you met a crazy man today.

75
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
I am so happy to see you.

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,000
What a pity.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
I have been to the principal's place.

78
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,360
But I know that

79
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,360
he might think that I stopped the show for a while.

80
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,240
Actually, that's the way it is.

81
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,840
When the show started,

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,240
many students were attracted to it.

83
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,880
Of course, he supported me.

84
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,760
Now, you are here to find a way to get rid of the bridge.

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,520
It's like your landlord.

86
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,040
I am a little bad at that.

87
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,280
He threw out my stuff.

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,640
The principal didn't drive me out.

89
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,320
So, I can only use you temporarily.

90
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,520
But work...

91
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,720
I was originally going to

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,280
study the new-class punishment

93
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,880
to transfer the position of professor.

94
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,840
It seems that

95
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,800
that person just doesn't like the new-class punishment.

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,960
It's not us.

97
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,520
He is just biting you now.

98
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,200
He said that you didn't object to the new-class punishment.

99
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,560
I think we should stop for a while.

100
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,440
Let's not talk about this topic.

101
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,560
Then,

102
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,760
please take a look.

103
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,360
Actually, the whole idea is not completely wrong.

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,000
And our video has been said.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,960
We don't support killing people.

106
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,000
Did he cut the last part?

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,160
He doesn't know.

108
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,520
How about we take a video to clarify our position?

109
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,080
Don't do that.

110
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,800
Let's close the gap for a while.

111
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,680
Do whatever you want.

112
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,800
It's delicious.

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,280
Eat more.

114
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,480
Ding Luofeng, please eat.

115
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,680
Long time no see.

116
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,640
Ah Sui?

117
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,000
I haven't seen you for many years.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
You didn't tell me after you resigned.

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,120
It's been eight years since I left.

120
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
You did?

121
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm a little selfish. I can't handle it.

122
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,240
So, I can't contact anyone around me.

123
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Are you all right?

124
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,840
Yes. I'm fine.

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll take a chance to take a bath.

126
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Okay.

127
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,160
Why are you here today?

128
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm moving back to the neighborhood.

129
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,280
I came to see you.

130
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,480
I'm relieved that you're safe and sound.

131
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,360
I know you brought me here.

132
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,160
Who dares to bully me?

133
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,080
Ding Luofeng!

134
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,080
Ding Luofeng,

135
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,920
do you want to be seen all your life?

136
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,360
I don't want to either.

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,920
From now on,

138
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll train with you.

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,280
If someone bullies you,

140
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,200
I'll help you.

141
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,560
If you still can't bear it,

142
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,960
I'll resign with you.

143
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,960
Senior Brother.

144
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,480
Senior Brother.

145
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,800
Actually, you don't have to be nice to me.

146
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,280
I don't know why you did this to me.

147
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
I know!

148
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
You can see it.

149
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,720
You'll be a good cop.

150
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,040
I want to tell you

151
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,080
that I'm not a smart person

152
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,400
who can only fight and brush his teeth.

153
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,280
I'm a real cop

154
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,920
who knows what justice is.

155
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,640
Did I look strict at that time?

156
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes, you were strict.

157
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,000
But if you weren't strict,

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,760
I wouldn't be in this position.

159
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,720
Who should I thank?

160
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,320
Of course, you should.

161
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,320
I got the honor of being a cop when I graduated.

162
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,560
You've been very popular recently.

163
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,280
You've been on the news.

164
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,920
What about the news?

165
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,680
Our team has been investigating for a long time.

166
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,960
But they haven't been admitted yet.

167
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,480
Actually, you don't have to be so persistent to investigate.

168
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,240
The faster you go, the more far you'll get away from the truth.

169
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,320
In fact, these cases will naturally be exposed

170
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,360
in a few years.

171
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,400
I think that murderer will continue to come out and investigate.

172
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
I have the responsibility to catch him.

173
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,640
Lu Feng.

174
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,960
I heard that your previous investigation method

175
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,560
is not very appropriate.

176
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,000
You're a cop now.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,680
Sometimes, you don't need to be the first.

178
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,720
Some things are left to the person below.

179
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
Your uncle and aunt are sitting in the office

180
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
and investigating other cases.

181
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,720
You can relax and wait for the results.

182
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,240
Ye Sun.

183
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,360
I won't talk to you anymore. I'm in a hurry.

184
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay, okay, okay.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
I'll call you and talk.

186
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay, okay.

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,640
Okay, bye.

188
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Hello.

189
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
May I ask who is the parent of the student?

190
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Deng Teng Teng.

191
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Okay.

192
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Thank you.

193
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
You're welcome.

194
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Mom, I'm so happy to see you.

195
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Wait.

196
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Shouldn't I show up?

197
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
How come?

198
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I'm afraid that parents will talk nonsense.

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
You don't have to care about what they think.

200
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Tongtong and I both miss you here.

201
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Okay, okay.

202
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Thank you.

203
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Hello, good evening, parents.

204
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,720
First, I hope everyone can give a warm applause.

205
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Thank you for bringing such a wonderful show to Tongtong.

206
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Let's welcome Tongtong.

207
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Tongtong, you're so good at talking.

208
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Who did you learn from?

209
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Uncle Feng taught me.

210
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
He's very good.

211
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
He's not just a cop.

212
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
He's also good at playing piano.

213
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
I like him a lot.

214
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
I saw Uncle Feng coming to the scene.

215
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Why don't you come up and work with him?

216
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Okay.

217
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Okay, let's welcome Uncle Feng.

218
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Come on.

219
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Welcome.

220
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Let's give Uncle Feng and Tongtong the time.

221
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Okay.

222
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
How about we play that song?

223
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Okay.

224
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Ready.

225
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Okay.

226
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Okay.

227
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Okay.

228
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Okay.

229
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
According to the plan,

230
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Xia Yizong should be the most innocent.

231
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Who will we find the guilty?

232
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
So soon?

233
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,720
We've made so many orders these months.

234
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
So many people died.

235
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
The police are getting closer.

236
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Will we be in danger?

237
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
No need.

238
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
We're not caught by the police.

239
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
That's not a fool.

240
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
If we keep doing this,

241
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
he'll find us.

242
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Look at the message.

243
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
The law is not expensive.

244
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
It's good to kill.

245
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Actually, there's something.

246
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
We don't need to do it ourselves.

247
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Is that okay?

248
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Yizong,

249
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
I've found the one who did the sadot.

250
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
I'll go and get him.

251
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Okay.

252
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Okay.

253
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Okay.

254
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Okay.

255
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Okay.

256
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Okay.

257
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Okay.

258
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Okay.

259
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Okay.

260
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Okay.

261
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Okay.

262
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Okay.

263
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
I've found the one who did the sadot.

264
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Xiaoshan,

265
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,720
do you think the person who did the sadot is the murderer?

266
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
He was released about 18 years ago.

267
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,720
The time difference between the first case and the second one is the same.

268
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
That means after the first case happened,

269
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,720
the murderer never went to the sadot again, right?

270
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
I think it's possible.

271
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,720
The easiest way is to find out all the usefulness.

272
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
I've called the technology team to help.

273
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Sorry, I have a call.

274
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
I'll talk to you later.

275
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Okay.

276
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Bye-bye.

277
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Hello?

278
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Hao Tong has helped us to complete our contract for many years.

279
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,720
You still have a chance to get back together.

280
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Are you crazy?

281
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
No one has ever brought us together.

282
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
I'll remember it for the rest of my life.

283
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Even if mom doesn't know how to get back together.

284
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
I'm warning you.

285
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Even if you are the ones,

286
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I'll be honest with you.

287
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Hello?

288
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Hello?

289
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Xiaoshan, Xiaoshan.

290
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
No, no, no.

291
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Xiaoliu,

292
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Yes, yes,

293
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Jiang Shike,

294
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Chen Yun,

295
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Yes,

296
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
as soon as possible.

297
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
It's your fire.

298
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
I don't know.

299
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
But no one can save it.

300
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Is this fire

301
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
similar to the one in the past?

302
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
A fire is a fire.

303
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
It's a fire.

304
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
It's a fire.

305
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
It's a fire.

306
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
It's a fire.

307
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
It's a fire.

308
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
It's a fire.

309
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
It's a fire.

310
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
What fire?

311
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Are you really crazy?

312
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
What?

313
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
What?

314
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Ding Zil.

315
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Yes?

316
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
The fire has been confirmed.

317
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
No one is there.

318
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
So I sent the injured to the hospital.

319
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Do you want to take a break?

320
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
No, no.

321
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
The injured has your family's family.

322
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
I don't need to.

323
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
I'm okay.

324
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I'm fine.

325
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I'm fine.

326
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
I'm fine.

327
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
I'm fine.

328
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
I'm fine.

329
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
I'm fine.

330
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm fine.

331
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
I'm fine.

332
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
I'm fine.

333
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
I'm fine.

334
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm fine.

335
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm fine.

336
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm fine.

337
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
I'm fine.

338
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
I'm fine.

339
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
The injured has your family.

340
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Do you think it's a new killer?

341
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
You want to protect me?

342
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Should I send someone to protect your family?

343
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
No need.

344
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
You two, help me to follow this case.

345
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
If you have any first time, please let me know.

346
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
I'll go to the hospital with my mom.

347
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Okay.

348
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
When will you give me your time?

349
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I'm busy.

350
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
I need to work.

351
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Why?

352
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Why do I always remind you

353
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,720
to ask for your time to help me?

354
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Work is more important.

355
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Besides, I can't die in less than 2 days.

356
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
I'm not going to die in less than 3 days.

357
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
I'm not going to die in 3 days.

358
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
I'm not going to die in 3 days.

359
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
I'm not going to die in 3 days.

360
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
I'm not going to die in less than 2 days.

361
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
You're looking for my help.

362
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Now you're not coming.

363
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
What's the point?

364
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
As a police officer,

365
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
you have the responsibility

366
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
to take care of your health.

367
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Otherwise,

368
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
I'll write a report to you.

369
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Okay.

370
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I'll give you time in 2 days.

371
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
What 2 days?

372
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Tomorrow,

373
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
I'll send you the time and place later.

374
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Bye.

375
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Xing Sao,

376
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
you seem to meet often.

377
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Sometimes.

378
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
You seem to be close.

379
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Are you close?

380
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
Yes.

381
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Tell me if you're done.

382
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
I'll wait for you.

383
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Let's go.

384
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Be careful.

385
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
No problem.

386
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Professor Fu.

387
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Zhifei.

388
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I'm Du Zijun.

389
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Hello, Professor Fu.

390
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Hello.

391
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Okay.

392
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Let's go in.

393
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
The case this time

394
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,720
is on the yacht.

395
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
But the body

396
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,720
is hidden in the refrigerator.

397
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
It's a water-scented corpse.

398
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
But it's been decades.

399
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Why did you choose this case?

400
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
Is it because of the background

401
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
and age?

402
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Do you have any information

403
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
about the killer?

404
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Not really.

405
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
But

406
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
this type of murder

407
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
is usually the first time

408
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
there's a model.

409
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Suppose

410
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
she's experienced this case.

411
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Then it's reasonable

412
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
to hide the corpse in the water.

413
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
The water-scented corpse?

414
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
But I don't think

415
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
the two cases of the hotel

416
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
and the water-scented corpse.

417
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
How about we

418
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
go and have a look?

419
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Remember to take a few more pictures.

420
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Okay.

421
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
The killer is 30 years old.

422
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
She should be choosing Li Jia.

423
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
That's right.

424
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Li Jia was a 08-year-old

425
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
and changed to a blue-green one.

426
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
You're saying it's unreasonable.

427
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
The age of the killer

428
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
is not that big.

429
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
But

430
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
the body is

431
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
the same as the body.

432
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
The body is the same as the body.

433
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
The body is the same as the body.

434
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
The body is the same as the body.

435
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
The body is the same as the body.

436
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
The age of the killer

437
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
should be 80-90.

438
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
The blue-green hotel

439
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
is about 10 years old.

440
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Hong Kongers have an impression.

441
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
If the killer

442
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
wants to imitate the previous case,

443
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
he won't choose a new case.

444
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Can we assume

445
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
he's a criminal?

446
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
The next place to choose

447
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
is the library.

448
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Zhifei,

449
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
I once said

450
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
that it's not that simple

451
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
but it's a good idea.

452
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Even if you choose randomly,

453
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
you can help him

454
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
choose the previous case.

455
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
There must be a reason

456
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
for all the human behavior.

457
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
But we haven't entered

458
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
the killer's body.

459
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
I don't know

460
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
what common point

461
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Zijun,

462
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
help me check

463
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
who built this hotel.

464
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Okay.

465
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
This place?

466
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Isn't it under

467
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Margaret Group?

468
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
I'm not talking about the general office.

469
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
I want to know the business of the construction.

470
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Construction?

471
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Found it.

472
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
It's a new building

473
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
with a limited company.

474
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
The new night is coming.

475
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
This painting

476
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
is similar to the low painting

477
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
of Jack Hsu and the Borlook.

478
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
It's not his skill.

479
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
It's his passion

480
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
when he painted this painting.

481
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
A-Xian,

482
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
look.

483
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
It's all deep.

484
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
It's obvious

485
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
that it's his passion.

486
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
It's dark

487
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
and crazy.

488
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
What's the purpose

489
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
of his painting?

490
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
He doesn't like

491
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
to communicate with me.

492
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
What does he want?

493
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
If this is

494
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
the reason

495
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
I can try to get him out.

496
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
I can't.

497
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
How is it?

498
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Do you feel emotional?

499
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
You think

500
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
he will be angry

501
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
if you think about his painting.

502
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Then he comes out

503
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
and tells you

504
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
what I want.

505
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Then he starts to communicate.

506
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Right?

507
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
It's so simple.

508
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
I'll try to get him out.

509
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
What are you doing?

510
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
You're not helping me.

511
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Think of a way

512
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
to get him out.

513
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Look at you.

514
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
You're so emotional now.

515
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
You're so complicated.

516
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
I feel like

517
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
he's over there.

518
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Hello?

519
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
You've fixed

520
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
the procedure

521
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
we've been dealing with.

522
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
You can find the users.

523
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Okay. I'll be right back.

524
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Go ahead.

525
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Now that they've clicked in,

526
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
the procedure will automatically

527
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
enter their computer

528
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
and transfer their location to me.

529
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
How did you do it?

530
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Is Saturn 1115

531
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
using a TOR?

532
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Actually,

533
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
this is a wooden code procedure.

534
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Although Saturn 1115

535
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
is using a TOR,

536
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
this procedure

537
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
will automatically

538
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
send us information

539
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
and the data.

540
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
So, it's not a problem

541
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
to click on it.

542
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
I've got

543
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
over 20 users here.

544
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
There are two more

545
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
who haven't been online.

546
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Forget it.

547
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Bring those 20 back.

548
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Aslan,

549
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
I'm at school

550
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
when the case is over.

551
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
You can check it

552
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
if you don't believe me.

553
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
There are all the evidence.

554
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
It's almost done.

555
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
You can leave now.

556
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
I'll check

557
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
the evidence of

558
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
the 20 users.

559
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
If it's true,

560
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
it means

561
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
the murderer

562
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
might be

563
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
the one who hasn't been online.

564
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
It looks delicious.

565
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
It's so delicious.

566
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
I saw the news yesterday.

567
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
He's really crazy.

568
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
He killed a person in the hospital.

569
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
He even went to the mental hospital

570
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
to release the fire.

571
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
I don't know

572
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
what those police officers did.

573
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
What?

574
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Didn't the police

575
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
catch up with

576
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
the 20 people

577
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
and go back to ask questions?

578
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Welcome.

579
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Just think it over.

580
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
But there are no

581
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
users

582
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
on the mysterious website.

583
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
I can find

584
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
every single one of them.

585
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
In my opinion,

586
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
who made this website

587
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
is the murderer.

588
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
He even used it to find the tea.

589
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I really don't understand

590
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
why the police

591
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
can't catch the person

592
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
who's online.

593
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Is it because of the technology

594
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
and the development of the internet?

595
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Let me explain to the police.

596
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
It's been so long.

597
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
It seems that

598
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
there hasn't been

599
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
such a big case in the week.

600
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
It takes time.

601
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
But now

602
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
everyone says

603
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
the police are useless.

604
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
They just say they don't know how to do things.

605
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
They just say they don't know how to do things.

606
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
They just say they don't know how to do things.

607
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Let's stop talking about these.

608
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Let's see which one is better.

609
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I want a limited edition.

610
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Thank you.

611
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
I'm sorry.

612
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Those are pre-ordered.

613
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Why don't we try other flavors?

614
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
It's okay.

615
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
We'll come again next time.

616
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Okay.

617
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Thank you.

618
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
No more.

619
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
I'm done.

620
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Stop playing.

621
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
I really don't know

622
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
what you're doing.

623
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
I'm not playing.

624
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
The police set up

625
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
a code program for Satan.

626
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
I'm on the counter.

627
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
What?

628
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
A code program?

629
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Then we won't be poisoned.

630
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
No way.

631
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
I'm not the computer of the black police.

632
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
The people in the Central Security Team want to challenge me.

633
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
I'll check their phones

634
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
and see what secrets

635
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
they have hidden.

636
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Done.

637
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
The police set up a code program for Satan.

638
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Look.

639
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
You're a bastard again.

640
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
You're a devil again.

641
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Next.

642
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Xing Kai.

643
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
A-Xin.

644
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
What's wrong?

645
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm sorry.

646
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
I'm sorry.

647
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
I'm sorry.

648
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
I'm sorry.

649
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
I'm sorry.

650
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
A-Xin.

651
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Look.

652
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
He used all my body colors.

653
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
It's clear

654
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
that he's the main character.

655
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
It's dark.

656
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
It's like a madman.

657
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Xing Kai really has a secret agent.

658
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Okay.

659
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
I'll find it.

660
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Calm down.

661
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Xing Kai's secret agent

662
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
can be our base.

663
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes, brother.

664
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
If someone finds out,

665
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
he'll be in trouble.

666
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
That's good.

667
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
He won't be a spy.

668
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Don't make the decision.

669
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
What?

670
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
I'll tell my brother.

671
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
It's not fair to escape.

672
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Xing is guilty.

673
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Welcome to the real Satan 1115.

674
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
You're your own person?

675
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Not me.

676
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
It's me.

677
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,720
I'm your partner now.

678
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,720
You're already the ninth.

679
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
I'm the ninth.

680
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I'm the ninth.

681
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
I'm the ninth.

682
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
I'm the ninth.

683
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
I'm the ninth.

684
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
I'm the ninth.

685
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
I'm the ninth.

686
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
I'm the ninth.

687
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
What about the others?

688
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
They can't see us.

689
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
You'll see them soon.

690
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
But there's one person.

691
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
I think you'll want to see him.

692
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
He's Xing Kai, the police.

693
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
That's great.

694
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
The real version is missing.

695
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
As long as it's me,

696
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
whether it's the police or the big deal,

697
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
we'll definitely win.

698
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Is it that exaggerated?

699
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,720
How do I know if you're the police's trusted man?

700
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
You can investigate if you don't believe me.

701
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Is Xing Kai really a trusted man?

702
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
What do you mean?

703
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
This is his weakness.

704
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
He has the right to be independent.

705
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,700
Did it go well with you?

706
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Let me see.

707
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,440
You're долaring.

708
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,980
How am I supposed to lie to you?

709
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,580
Why are you pulling a lot at him?

710
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,720
He's a構침.

711
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Thank goodness.

712
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,120
That police of ours is annoying us.

713
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,120
We must look for something to distract him.

714
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,680
So we plan to use Chen Xunhui to kill Xing Kai

715
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,840
to kill the murderer.

716
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,640
Does my brother know about this?

717
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,920
What does he know?

718
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,320
He said it's okay.

719
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,760
Anyway, if anything happens,

720
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,600
I'll take care of it.

721
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,720
Okay?

722
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,320
He has two characters.

723
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,720
One is a cop.

724
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,560
The other is our own person.

725
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,000
But he doesn't know that he's the murderer

726
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
who's guilty of a new crime.

727
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,360
If those people see that he has a personality,

728
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,320
then his identity as a murderer will definitely be removed.

729
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,600
If he's on TV,

730
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,400
then the whole Hong Kong people will see it.

731
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,640
No.

732
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,600
TV will cause a big trouble.

733
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
We have to lower the volume.

734
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,280
We have to lower the volume.

735
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,080
We have to lower the volume.

736
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,680
We have to lower the volume.

737
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,280
We have to lower the volume.

738
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,880
We have to lower the volume.

739
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,480
We have to lower the volume.

740
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,080
We have to lower the volume.

741
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,560
We have to lower the volume.

742
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,280
We have to lower the volume.

743
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,840
We have to lower the volume.

744
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,480
We have to lower the volume.

745
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,080
We have to lower the volume.

746
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,880
We have to lower the volume.

747
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,640
We have to lower the volume.

748
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,520
We have to lower the volume.

749
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,360
We have to lower the volume.

750
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,280
We have to lower the volume.

751
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,760
We have to lower the volume.

752
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,280
We have to lower the volume.

753
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,400
We have to lower the volume.

754
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,520
This kind of trouble could be caused by the events,

755
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,160
if it 한 and less years are left.

756
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,120
And I will fix it and waitending the results.

757
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,840
The whole Hong Kong people will assume

758
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,360
it's the police who have burnt the factory erased big money.

759
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,480
Moral decisions give us health.

760
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,440
Lord Jue,

761
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,600
don't mock us.

762
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,160
Don't believe us.

763
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Hello, Mr.

764
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Sir, would you like to have something to drink?

765
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Okay.

766
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Okay.

767
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Thank you.

768
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,160
Would you like to help me with the house?

769
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Thank you.

770
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
What's wrong?

771
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
How are you?

772
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
How do you feel recently?

773
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Is there anything uncomfortable

774
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
or something strange?

775
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Nothing special.

776
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
It's normal.

777
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
It's normal than normal people.

778
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
It's normal.

779
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
It's normal.

780
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
I asked you out today.

781
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
You're spying on me now.

782
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Then what's the difference between you and the fake sister?

783
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Or do you have any questions that you don't want to talk about?

784
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
I've been sleeping very comfortably lately.

785
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
And I've been sleeping for over ten hours.

786
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
I've asked you so many questions.

787
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
It seems like you have a problem.

788
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
I'm sorry.

789
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
I'm sorry.

790
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
I'm sorry.

791
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
I'm sorry.

792
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Almost all Hong Kongers are discussing their crimes.

793
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
There's a special show next door.

794
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
Guys, I've got a great idea.

795
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
We'll catch this show.

796
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Our show will invite some policemen,

797
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
psychological scholars,

798
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
to come and do a live broadcast.

799
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
During the live broadcast today,

800
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,160
no one has seen such a show.

801
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Yes.

802
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
If we just talk,

803
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
no one will see it.

804
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
But the key point of our show

805
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
is that we can let the audience

806
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
call in and interact.

807
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Then we can deal with those policemen,

808
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
psychological scholars,

809
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
and think about it.

810
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,160
We'll go all out to find the fire department.

811
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
These policemen

812
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
have been investigating for so long.

813
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
They can't find anything.

814
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
The citizens will call them

815
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
and tell them the truth.

816
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
The citizens will be happy

817
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
when they hear that

818
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
the police are asking for nothing.

819
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Let's do it together.

820
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
Thank you, Mr. Li.

821
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
I'll contact them right away.

822
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Actually, the TV station wants to do this show

823
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
to provide more opportunities

824
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
to explain to the public in the police.

825
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
To help them to relieve their anxiety.

826
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,160
The new period is a big suffering for society.

827
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
We do the TV station

828
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
because of the responsibility

829
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
for the public and the problems.

830
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Are you sure?

831
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
I think the audience

832
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
can call you in this show.

833
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Are you sure that

834
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
the citizens won't be anxious?

835
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
We can do that.

836
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,160
We can find people to test the audience

837
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
and make a decision.

838
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
The famous actor

839
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
will know it's fake.

840
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
I think the most important thing

841
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,160
is to pull the whole society's direction back.

842
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
We can't let the citizens

843
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
support the new period.

844
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
We can do this

845
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
in the police.

846
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
Why do you want to

847
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
do it on the TV station?

848
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
The public is good, the image is good,

849
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,160
the police relationship is good.

850
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
Madam, you are a smart person.

851
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
I'm sure this show

852
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,160
will benefit both of us.

853
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Okay.

854
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
What do you think we should do?

855
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
In terms of the public,

856
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
I think it's best to find

857
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
the case of the investigation.

858
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
That's perfect.

859
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Madam.

860
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
What's up?

861
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm having a meeting now.

862
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
I wanted to talk to you about the case.

863
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
But I heard that you want to find someone to do the show.

864
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
I have some little suggestions.

865
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Go ahead.

866
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I also have a part in the investigation

867
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
of the new period.

868
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
The familiar level

869
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
is not worse than Xing Kai and Ding Luo Feng.

870
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
As the police of the Central Police,

871
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
there is enough division.

872
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
It represents the police.

873
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Is there anyone

874
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
who can choose the psychology?

875
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
There are some

876
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
psychology partners

877
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
on the TV station.

878
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
We can provide them.

879
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,160
I suggest we find Yang Zhifei and Fu Yangshan.

880
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Yang Zhifei is the consultant

881
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
of this case.

882
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,160
Fu Yangshan is his teacher.

883
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
He is also a good son.

884
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
From different levels,

885
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,160
their identity is enough division.

886
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Ah-Ci,

887
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
you are a good question.

888
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
Wan Guang,

889
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
you are the representative this time.

890
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Don't be rude.

891
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Thank you, Madam.

892
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
I hope this show

893
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
is a win-win situation.

894
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
Definitely.

895
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
Good cooperation.

896
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Good cooperation.

897
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
Sister,

898
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
I will help you

899
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,160
to get the most treatment today.

900
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Brother,

901
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160
I am here.

902
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
I am here.

903
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
I am here.

904
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
I am here.

905
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
I am here.

906
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
I am here.

907
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
I am here.

908
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
I am here.

909
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
I am here.

910
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
I am here.

911
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
I am here.

912
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
I am here.

913
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
I am here.

914
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
I am here.

915
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
I am here.

916
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
I am here.

917
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
I am here.

918
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
I am here.

919
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,160
I am here.

920
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
I am here.

921
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
I am here.

922
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
I am here.

923
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
I am here.

924
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
I am here.

925
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
I am here.

926
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
I am here.

927
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
I am here.

928
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Don't blame me.

929
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Blame you for being a good friend

930
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
and blaming you for being a guilty person.

931
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
But don't worry.

932
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
I will make you die

933
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
in front of him.

934
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
I will make him die in his own hands.

935
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,960
Xiao Fei.

936
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,920
Xiao Fei, wake up! What did you do?

937
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,920
Don't scare me! Wake up!

938
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,120
You two are band-aid!

939
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,000
Why did you die? The video is more adept than what it was before.

940
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,640
Why are you so guilty?

941
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,000
None of your business!

942
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,720
I'm guilty?

943
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
No, no, no.

944
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Why?

945
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Why did my sister say yes?

946
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
My sister is dead.

947
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Does she know you?

948
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
No, no, no.

949
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Zanzhi!

950
