00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,800
Dear Motherland

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,880
Episode One

3
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Episode 1

4
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
You can't go!

5
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,480
Hey, did you hear that?

6
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,080
You promised me you'd help me out.

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,480
You'll let me and Zhifei go!

8
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Hey!

9
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,080
Hey, did you hear that?

10
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Answer me!

11
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,280
Head, I found it!

12
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,280
Hey, did you hear that?

13
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,680
You'll let me and Zhifei go!

14
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,480
Help!

15
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,880
There are people here!

16
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,280
Help!

17
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
I'm fine.

18
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Liu is being hit by a broken piece of paper.

19
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
How are you?

20
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
I'm fine.

21
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
But the other PDU's fire is still waiting.

22
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Don't go! Come back!

23
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Come back!

24
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Come back!

25
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Come back!

26
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Come back!

27
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Come back!

28
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
Come back!

29
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
I'm fine.

30
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
I'm not going back.

31
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Zijun!

32
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Zijun!

33
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Zijun!

34
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Zijun!

35
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Zijun!

36
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Zijun!

37
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Zijun, hold on!

38
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Zijun!

39
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Zijun!

40
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Zijun!

41
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
I told you before.

42
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Don't touch me.

43
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Don't touch me.

44
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,880
I've sent you some videos.

45
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
I taught you how to make a bomb.

46
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,880
And you should be punished for the next crime.

47
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
I'm your man.

48
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm your man.

49
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
I'm your man.

50
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Why are you killing people here?

51
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Are you killing people or shooting people?

52
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
They are both friends of Luo Feng.

53
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Can they save us?

54
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,880
If they die here slowly,

55
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
why don't you help them?

56
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,880
But you shouldn't kill them.

57
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
You should save them.

58
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
If you want to save them,

59
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
you should come here early to solve Chen Xunhui.

60
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Right?

61
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
You should come here to help them.

62
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Right?

63
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,880
And if they are alive,

64
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,880
we will know everything.

65
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Don't go.

66
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Clean up and leave.

67
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I'm sorry.

68
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,880
I'm not in a good mood.

69
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
You forced me.

70
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
participating in the longtime story

71
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Why didn't Ding Luo Feng know?

72
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
I'm asking you, are you dumb?

73
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Did you kill the people who were guilty of the new Qi?

74
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Do you really believe what Chen Xuehui said?

75
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
He said everything was wrong.

76
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I have a personality, but I'm not a murderer.

77
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,880
A mental patient will not admit that he is sick.

78
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Do you know that you are in the house of the whole Hong Kong Police?

79
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm Xing Kai, I'm the chief of the police.

80
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Since I was a child, I'm the only one in charge of controlling the people.

81
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,880
The police is going to prove it.

82
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
You are a mental patient.

83
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Of course, you can control yourself.

84
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Keep an eye on him.

85
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Luckily, nothing happened just now.

86
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,880
You really can't control yourself.

87
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Will you have a third personality besides me?

88
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
You can't control it.

89
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
I'm sorry.

90
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
I'm sorry.

91
00:14:41,880 --> 00:15:05,880
We are in the TV station, we have to go back to the police station.

92
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Everything is over.

93
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Do you know what day it is today?

94
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Today is the day of the police.

95
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Tomorrow's news will be on the head of the police station.

96
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
We have caught Xing Kai, we have an explanation.

97
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Now we are investigating Chen Xuehui.

98
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
How did you catch him?

99
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
He is a criminal.

100
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
He is a criminal.

101
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
He is a criminal.

102
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
He is a criminal.

103
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
He is a criminal.

104
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
He is a criminal.

105
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
How did you catch him?

106
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Everything is over.

107
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
How did the police see us?

108
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
We are helpless.

109
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Madam, I suspect Xing Kai and this case is related.

110
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
At least we caught him and we know the police.

111
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
A spy.

112
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
You are investigating the first day.

113
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,880
When we were asked, I told him that I'm sorry.

114
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
I don't know if Xing Kai has a personality disorder.

115
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
How about this?

116
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,880
I don't know how much it will affect.

117
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Xing Kai's case will be a big hit on us.

118
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
What will the citizens think of us?

119
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Will they believe us?

120
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
Yes, you caught him.

121
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,880
But the person who is responsible is the whole police.

122
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Sorry, madam.

123
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Forget it. You go out first.

124
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Yes, madam.

125
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Go back to the police station.

126
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Get up.

127
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
It's all a fire.

128
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Security!

129
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Is this bomb complicated?

130
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
It's simple enough.

131
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
We don't need to move the bomb.

132
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
We need to get out of the safe zone.

133
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Zhang Sier and the other team leave first.

134
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Where is Zhezhi?

135
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Hurry up.

136
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
Open the door.

137
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
Sir, Xing Kai is in danger.

138
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Sorry.

139
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Please let him go.

140
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
Hurry up.

141
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Don't let him go.

142
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Thank you.

143
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I've said many times that I was framed.

144
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
I admit that I have a personality disorder.

145
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
But what you want to think now is

146
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
why I want to kill people.

147
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
If I kill people now,

148
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
it's easy for me to find out.

149
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Now you admit that you have a personality disorder.

150
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
How did you pass the examination?

151
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Why is there no medical record?

152
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Because there has never been a doctor who cured me.

153
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
What do you mean?

154
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
For so many years,

155
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,880
those doctors couldn't see that I have a personality disorder.

156
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
They couldn't help me.

157
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
I don't need them to help me.

158
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,880
I've been close to my personality since I was a child.

159
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,880
I can control myself very well.

160
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
Before this case happened,

161
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,880
I didn't meet any suspicious person.

162
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
I'm not a fan of Satan.

163
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Then how do you explain

164
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
why the murderer always takes our side?

165
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Chen Xuhui said that

166
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,880
there was someone helping him in the police team.

167
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
Except you,

168
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
I can't think of anyone else.

169
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
You want to die in the hospital

170
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
or in prison?

171
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
What do you think?

172
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Everyone knows that our police team has a spy.

173
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
No, Xin Kai is definitely not a spy.

174
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
You still want to cover him up.

175
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
You are the one who asked him to come to the headquarters.

176
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Are you sure that you can't kill him?

177
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
I didn't tell you that.

178
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
I told you that Ding Luo Fang is mine.

179
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Don't touch him.

180
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
You are the one who asked him to come to the headquarters.

181
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,880
I always thought that Xin Kai was your son.

182
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
I won't do that.

183
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
I will find out the murderer.

184
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Isn't he Xin Kai?

185
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Since the case started,

186
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Xin Kai has been with me since the beginning.

187
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
So I don't believe that he is the murderer.

188
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Okay.

189
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Even if I believe you,

190
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,880
I will tell the superior that they will believe me.

191
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
I met this person at the scene.

192
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
The third case of the murder.

193
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Except for this person at the scene,

194
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
I also saw other people.

195
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Other people may be his party.

196
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Did he have any evidence?

197
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Not yet.

198
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,880
But I remember that they had a witness at the scene.

199
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Maidai, give me some time.

200
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
I will find out.

201
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
I can't prove that Xin Kai is not the murderer.

202
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
He might be a accomplice.

203
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Plus, he didn't report his mental state to us.

204
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
We can't help him this time.

205
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
You are tired, too.

206
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Go back and rest.

207
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Your case will be in charge of the Zhang Man Guang.

208
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Maidai, I can still hold on.

209
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
This is my order.

210
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Maidai, you need an explanation.

212
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,880
No, I will not.

213
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,300
you won't miss this one,

214
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,980
the one in my side.

215
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,000
For the purpose of sharing the letter or to answer anything

216
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,040
Now it's time to go

217
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,640
free

218
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,200
In the first place

219
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,600
Zhang Zhenyu

220
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,400
Ruoi

221
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:38,800
Wu Tai

222
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,600
ération

223
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,120
Lock the door

224
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
The person who was missing a year ago.

225
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,120
If you have any information, please contact me.

226
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Girl! Girl! I know who you are!

227
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Girl! Girl!

228
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Open the door! I know who you are!

229
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
I am the man who killed my wife.

230
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
I am the man who killed my wife.

231
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
I am the man who killed my wife.

232
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,120
I congratulate you for watching this video.

233
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
The man who killed my wife.

234
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Girl! Girl!

235
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Girl! Girl!

236
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Professor Yang, why don't you go to the hospital?

237
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
I want to see Xing Kai.

238
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
No.

239
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,120
Take Xing Kai to the police station.

240
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Got it.

241
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
I want to see Xing Kai.

242
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,120
If you are fine, why don't you go to the hospital first?

243
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Then I will call the fire department and take you to the hospital for a check-up.

244
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Did you hear what I said?

245
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I want to see Xing Kai.

246
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
I know you want to help Xing Kai.

247
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,120
But do you know he is a criminal?

248
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Are you questioning my profession now?

249
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
That's right.

250
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Then I will ask you as a professional consultant.

251
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,120
As a professional, I will definitely be a part of the company.

252
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
I will not be a pervert.

253
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Okay.

254
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
You said it.

255
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
The company is clear.

256
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,120
After meeting him, his psychological analysis report will be handed over to me at the first time.

257
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
No problem.

258
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Please look after him.

259
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Are you hurt?

260
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Zijun is dead.

261
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Many police officers are dead.

262
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Dingzi is injured.

263
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,120
Compared to them, I can't count them.

264
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
You want to see Xing Kai?

265
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Do you believe me?

266
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Then should I believe you?

267
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Are you leaving?

268
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
You know I have a personal witness.

269
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
I have made a decision.

270
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,120
But I am not sure at that time.

271
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
You can still laugh.

272
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:53,120
I think there is really someone in this world.

273
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
He can see it.

274
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
I don't understand.

275
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
What about your family?

276
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
You don't know your family.

277
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
I don't know.

278
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Did I bring you to see a doctor?

279
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Can't you see it?

280
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Even if I really went to see a doctor,

281
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,120
the doctor would only think I am a mental patient.

282
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Since I was a child,

283
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Xian and I have been very close.

284
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
His name is Xian.

285
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
But you have time.

286
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,120
It's dangerous.

287
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
I want to ask you a question.

288
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Do you think I am suitable to be a police officer?

289
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
From tomorrow on,

290
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,120
I will formally help you to be a full-fledged mental patient.

291
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
I will use my expertise to judge.

292
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Thank you.

293
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
I am sorry.

294
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,120
I am sorry, Professor.

295
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
I am sorry.

296
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I am sorry.

297
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
I am sorry.

298
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,120
Come here.

299
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
No place can be locked.

300
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
Jie Chen,

301
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
I just checked the computer.

302
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
The hard drive is broken.

303
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Inform the team of the technology to repair it.

304
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Roger that.

305
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Chang San,

306
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
the command and control center is looking for you.

307
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
The telephone is coming.

308
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
I am sorry.

309
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
I am sorry.

310
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
I am sorry.

311
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
I am sorry.

312
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
I am sorry.

313
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Help me down.

314
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
I must help myself nearby.

315
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
We were helped by Che andane.

316
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,120
But our security department couldn't find them.

317
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Imagine that iceberg.

318
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,120
Make your 98inge and penetrate them.

319
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,040
After this,

320
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,340
Ctrl, Ch,

321
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Alt and Shift,

322
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,380
Mr. Shan

323
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,760
who built this許 numbers

324
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Mr, your position

325
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,580
President

326
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,940
Unless Mrs

327
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,920
I am

328
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,960
Relationship

329
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,960
I don't remember who I am. Can you help me?

330
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Sure. No problem.

331
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Do you have any other connections besides me?

332
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
No.

333
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,960
X-ray shows that the patient's hematoma is damaged,

334
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
causing a disease.

335
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
It should be a stroke.

336
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,960
The brain is not fast enough to suppress the brain.

337
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Why didn't you call the first time when you found out?

338
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,960
She was injured. I was going to wait until she recovered.

339
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Is it illegal to be so ungrateful?

340
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,960
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

341
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,960
I think she's like my dead daughter.

342
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,960
I'll take care of her. I hope she's fine.

343
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
I don't mean anything else.

344
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Don't catch me.

345
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Does she need a surgery?

346
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,960
I suggest she needs to be absorbed.

347
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,960
After all, there will be risks in surgery.

348
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Yichen, don't let anyone know that we found her.

349
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,960
We'll talk to the doctor when she recovers.

350
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Got it.

351
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Sorry, we...

352
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
I'm sorry to have you here.

353
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
It's so sudden.

354
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,960
No, it's not.

355
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
You're here to eat?

356
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,960
I'm here to say thank you.

357
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,960
I've been waiting for you for a few days.

358
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
You're not so polite.

359
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Do you want something to eat?

360
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
I'm not bothering you.

361
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Sit down. I'll cook it soon.

362
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Wait a minute.

363
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,960
I have a good friend.

364
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,960
He made a serious mistake.

365
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,960
I found that we were apart.

366
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
We were far apart.

367
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,960
If he's your good friend,

368
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,960
should you give him another chance to change?

369
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,960
I gave him a chance, but he didn't change.

370
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,960
If he still has a chance to change,

371
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
I think you should try to help him.

372
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
I want to, too.

373
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,960
But I don't know how to do it.

374
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
He did the illegal thing.

375
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,960
If he did, I'd catch him.

376
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,960
I'm going back to the police station.

377
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Bye-bye.

378
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Doctor, is my brother Wei Ya?

379
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,960
According to X-ray, he has a slight gastrointestinal disease.

380
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,960
He needs to be treated for a long time before he knows whether he's healthy or sick.

381
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,960
But the patient doesn't seem to be like him.

382
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,960
I know. I'll talk to him.

383
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Thank you.

384
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
This is my order. You're welcome.

385
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,960
You're still drinking?

386
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Do you often take these pills?

387
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Don't worry.

388
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
There won't be any side effects.

389
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,960
You know that the drug will die if you drink it?

390
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Hey, is there anyone?

391
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Get this person out of here!

392
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
Daddy asked me to come in.

393
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
No one dares to let me go.

394
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
No wonder.

395
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,960
The eldest son of Fu De Shan, Fu Yang Shan,

396
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,960
they heard your name and were afraid of you.

397
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,960
The doctor told me that you had a shadow in your stomach.

398
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
None of your business.

399
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Can the doctor tell the patient's privacy now?

400
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Is there anyone?

401
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
Hurry up!

402
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
I'm a doctor!

403
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
I'm a doctor!

404
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Do you know whether he's healthy or sick?

405
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,960
He's sick.

406
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
He'll die sooner or later.

407
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,960
You're trying to take revenge on your father.

408
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Can you fight with him?

409
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,960
No one can fight with him.

410
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,960
He knows that you're the only son in his eyes.

411
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
He's the happiest when I die.

412
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
You're right.

413
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
If you hate him,

414
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
you should compare him with a longevity beast.

415
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,960
You should be his eye-catcher.

416
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
He's happier when he's dead.

417
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Are you done?

418
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Please don't make a good brother out of this.

419
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
I'm going to sleep.

420
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
I'll find a doctor to see you tomorrow.

421
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Then I'll help you to take the initiative to take the medicine.

422
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm not sick.

423
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
I don't need to see a doctor.

424
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
I don't need to take the medicine.

425
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,960
The drug will destroy your own body.

426
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
Your depression is serious.

427
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
You can't go on like this.

428
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
I'll help you to take the medicine.

429
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
I don't drink.

430
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
How can I sleep?

431
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
When can you fall asleep?

432
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
After Yiming leaves?

433
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
I miss my son so much.

434
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,960
When I close my eyes,

435
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
I'll remember

436
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,960
everything that happened to me.

437
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
But you won't understand.

438
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Only me and my mother will know that.

439
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
I'm sorry.

440
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
I'm not a bad person.

441
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
I'm sorry.

442
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
I'm not like you.

443
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
I'm sorry.

444
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
I'm sorry.

445
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
I'm not a bad person.

446
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
I'm not a bad person.

447
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
I'm not a bad person.

448
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
You didn't do this before.

449
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
You wanted me to do it.

450
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
You want to be a bastard, jump back.

451
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
You want to be that bastard?

452
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
You want to see?

453
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
I don't have any.

454
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
I'm so sorry.

455
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
What? What?

456
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
I don't care if you're the bastard.

457
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Let the people outside see that you're on his side.

458
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
You're the one who's going to kill everyone.

459
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
My Lumaozi!

460
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
I really don't have any.

461
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
I've been in the streets of the city for five times.

462
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
It's your son.

463
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
I don't have any.

464
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
I don't know how you're going to kill him.

465
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
Why did you let me die?

466
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
Why didn't I let you die?

467
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
You're so mean. Why did you come back?

468
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
This world

469
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
loves to talk about the past.

470
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Our family is very happy.

471
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
Everyone likes to talk to me.

472
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
Your life is mine.

473
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
I let you die.

474
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,960
You can die. Do you know that?

475
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Mom, stop fighting.

476
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
Let go of me!

477
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
Get out of here!

478
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Let go of me!

479
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
No!

480
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Get out of here!

481
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
I don't want to see you.

482
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
No.

483
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
No.

484
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
No.

485
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
No.

486
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Mom's so tight.

487
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Mom!

488
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
Mom!

489
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
Mom!

490
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
Mom!

491
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
視이이!

492
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
Yes!

493
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
What has happened?

494
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
She's fine!

495
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
I already told you,

496
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
your daughter has some problems.

497
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,960
The End

498
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
I'm not the one who wrote it.

499
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
What does he want to do?

500
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,960
Why does he come out every time after we fall asleep?

501
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Looks like he really wants to tell me this time.

502
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,960
If you have something to tell us, just come out and tell us.

503
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Come out!

504
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
The End

505
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:19,960
The End
