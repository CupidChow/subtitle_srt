1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You are now sleeping on a endless ocean.

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The water is very warm.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The things around you are getting more and more dizzy.

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Slowly, slowly, you can only hear your breathing.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What did you see?

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't know if I can say it here.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's okay. We can say anything here.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I saw you doing something here.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What?

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Love action film.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A very happy film.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Love action film.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Please, please, I ask you to pay attention to the scene.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I also pay great attention to it.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you are not satisfied, I can...

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's okay. Let's continue. Close your eyes.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hope the only one во

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't worry.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have gone through some difficulties since you said so earlier.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Those to get your attention maintenant

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
passage through wherever you feel comfortable.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm simply listening patiently to the silence.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I did my best to document their深怎么 it will be sleeps for days.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And also working twice a week altogether.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
God hasiano's a completed outcome.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The破音 can only create a rustic feel,

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What did you find?

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Jinsa.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Jinsa, I saw it.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Jinsa.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Really?

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What did you see?

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I saw the murderer in the shelter.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He was walking around.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He was walking around.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Can you see it clearly?

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We'll go to Liu and Ke'er's house.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We'll go to all the hospitals.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We'll find the records of all the patients who were in the left house.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We'll also find the patient who was in the safe place.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We should find a few people.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,520
The

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:20,000
murderer is in the safe place.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,900
This is the colonial army and they tried to separate the Have been separated

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,500
For these type of people, the world is very separated

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There's even the force of depriving and depriving

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
When people like these kind of peoplephone something you think they are clean

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,500
they think this world is to protect them

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,500
Hello musical guide

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,140
Hello

53
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,140
Hi, I haven't seen you for a long time.

54
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,140
You didn't tell me when you came back.

55
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,140
You didn't tell me when you came to my class.

56
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,140
I was afraid that you might be unhappy and you didn't want to protect you.

57
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,140
You mean I'm the one who killed the case?

58
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,140
Okay. But when you came back, you had to deal with a lot of things.

59
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,140
You didn't have a friend to ask for help.

60
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,140
Then why didn't you take a break and go to class so quickly?

61
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,140
I was originally planning to come back to accompany my brother.

62
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,140
But I haven't seen him yet. I'll find some room first.

63
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Have you handled the things in the U.S. university?

64
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,140
The paper that was just written there just now happened.

65
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,140
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

66
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,140
You look so sad. I'll treat you to a meal in the cafeteria.

67
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,140
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

68
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
You only ask me to have a meal in the cafeteria?

69
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
It's a meal in the cafeteria. Don't you miss it?

70
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Really. I miss it a lot. Let's go.

71
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,140
Uncle, you're here.

72
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,140
Yes, Tongtong.

73
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
Ding Sir, you're here.

74
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,140
I bought some fruits.

75
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
But you bought so many fruits.

76
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,140
You're welcome. You can just come and eat.

77
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,140
By the way, you called me Luo Feng.

78
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,140
You called me Ding Sir. I thought you were at work.

79
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Okay.

80
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,140
Okay. Tongtong, bring Uncle Feng in to wash his hands.

81
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
Then prepare to eat.

82
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,140
Okay.

83
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Come on. Don't be polite. Eat more.

84
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,140
Okay. You can eat it yourself.

85
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,140
Uncle, what do you do when you don't need to catch bad guys?

86
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
When I don't need to catch bad guys,

87
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,140
I usually listen to music at home.

88
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,140
I like listening to black pepper singing.

89
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,140
And I practice piano.

90
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Isn't that a great kind of piano?

91
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
I want to play it too.

92
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
My home is small.

93
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,140
It's a kind of historical piano.

94
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,140
I'll teach you when I have time, okay?

95
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,140
Okay.

96
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Okay.

97
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
Do you have any toothpaste?

98
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
Hurry up.

99
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Or you can't get up tomorrow.

100
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,980
Yeah.

101
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,380
Stop playing with your teeth.

102
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,580
Go to bed now.

103
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,620
Mommy, I think Uncle Feng is a good guy.

104
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,300
I like playing with him.

105
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
Mommy, you think Uncle Feng is a good guy, too?

106
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,020
Okay, okay.

107
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,820
Don't say so much.

108
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,140
Let's go. We can go to bed.

109
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,140
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,140
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,140

I'm sorry.

113
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,140
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,140
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,140
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,140
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,140
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,140
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,140
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,140
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,140
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,140
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,140
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,140
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,140
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,140
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,140
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,140
We used to buy piano when we were kids.

140
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,140
I use piano to play for the house.

141
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,140
We used to play piano when we were kids.

142
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,140
I listened to it all day.

143
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
I was very happy.

144
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,140
I was very tired at that time.

145
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,140
I didn't expect time to pass so quickly.

146
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,140
I didn't expect my brother to play very well.

147
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,140
I went to work and got a gun.

148
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,140
I didn't give up on my job.

149
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,140
How are you doing in the US?

150
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,140
Are you still in the CSI?

151
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,720
Currency check.

152
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,220
For the proofs and evidence.

153
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,220
For dead people and dead objects.

154
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,140
or whatever.

155
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,740
How long do you stay this time?

156
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,520
Actually this time,

157
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,620
I am not alone and I am always here.

158
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,120
还有同他也.

159
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,920
I have stayed with you for a long time.

160
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,940
I didn't pass

161
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,340
I left after the thing was done.

162
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,140
By the way,

163
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,060
the restaurant that you brought me last time

164
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,620
was very delicious.

165
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,340
Is it still there?

166
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,460
It is still there.

167
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,340
But I don't know in a few years.

168
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,540
Recently, a little tiger has been killed.

169
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,780
The reason is that

170
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,020
two local economy

171
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,900
Chen Yida and Liu Yawei

172
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,220
have been constantly

173
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,380
helping the little tiger

174
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,460
to move away from the pressure

175
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,060
of the little tiger.

176
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,740
Zijun.

177
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,540
Come here.

178
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,380
What?

179
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,900
Hurry up.

180
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,380
I am a local in Annan.

181
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,180
I moved to the house.

182
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,100
Chen Yida.

183
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,020
I want to apologize to the whole family.

184
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,700
I did it wrong.

185
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,420
Hey.

186
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,300
The big thing, come and see.

187
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,180
The little tiger killed the innocent man.

188
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,620
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,260
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,740
Chen Yida.

191
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,380
I'll find the technology team to help you.

192
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,180
I'll call Dingzi.

193
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,620
The computer is on.

194
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,900
Fighting.

195
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,820
Hit.

196
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,540
The White Table Blue- %.

197
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,740
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,660
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,180
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,580
I have decided

201
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,180
to join in

202
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,140
the trouble you implemented.

203
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,700
You can't let me go.

204
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,580
I beg you to let me go.

205
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,660
Thank you, Wyoming.

206
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,580
Thank you.

207
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
What are you doing?

208
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
No.

209
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
What are you doing?

210
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
No.

211
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
The phone is not answered.

212
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
Send a message to her.

213
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Let's go.

214
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
The phone is not answered.

215
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Send a message to her.

216
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Let's go.

217
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
The phone is not answered.

218
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Sorry, we have found the number.

219
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Sorry.

220
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Head, go to the bank.

221
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Wait.

222
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Sorry.

223
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Sorry.

224
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Head.

225
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Head.

226
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
The toilet is safe.

227
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Keep an eye on the safe.

228
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
Safe.

229
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Safe.

230
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Take a witness.

231
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Head.

232
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
The victim has found the knife in different places.

233
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
The dead body is not a big deal.

234
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Keep going.

235
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
The knife is not dead.

236
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,100
The first stab she used was too slow.

237
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,100
The murderer didn't want to give her a chance to survive.

238
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,100
He wanted to see her cut her hair.

239
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,100
The victim's wound is more than a few miles deep.

240
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
It's not a medical wound.

241
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
We need to know what the murderer used

242
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
only after we know the X-ray.

243
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
I'm not the only one who broke the murderer.

244
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
One is responsible for the action.

245
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
One is responsible for cleaning the scene.

246
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,100
One of them is even the head.

247
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
He controlled the whole plan.

248
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
The route was planned.

249
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
We couldn't find any evidence.

250
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Dizi, I've checked the surveillance footage of the nearby area.

251
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I found out that three months ago,

252
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
a merchant sent a letter to Chen Yi.

253
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,100
He told us not to force Zuo Dong to go to the security.

254
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
What's the news?

255
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Okay.

256
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
No, Sier.

257
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
I just sent a letter.

258
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
How could he have killed someone?

259
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
And that woman

260
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
was only sent to the court.

261
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
I was kept in custody.

262
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I didn't want to see her again.

263
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Then explain

264
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
why you have to send a letter.

265
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Our shop owners

266
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
have been doing business in the security.

267
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
The longest is 50 years.

268
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
The shortest is 19 years.

269
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
After the announcement,

270
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
if we don't move out,

271
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
we'll have to rent a house.

272
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
From 6,000 to 26,000 yuan.

273
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
We'll have to move out.

274
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Then you'll be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one.

275
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
I've found them who want to negotiate.

276
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
But they don't even see me.

277
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
I just wrote a letter

278
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
and gave that bastard a blow.

279
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Do you know that we can sue you for the crime of being a coward?

280
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
I really don't know.

281
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
My wife has been scolding me for a long time.

282
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Sier,

283
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
but killing people doesn't concern me.

284
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Dinger,

285
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
the key is the footprints.

286
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
The footprints are very far from the scene.

287
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,100
It's also proven that he doesn't have any evidence.

288
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
That means

289
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
his feet are fine.

290
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
There's a move,

291
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
but it's not suspicious.

292
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
This line is broken again.

293
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
The surveillance camera of the hotel

294
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
didn't take it.

295
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,100
This tense area has to be done in this hotel.

296
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,100
This is it,

297
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
are you busy?

298
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,100
No, I'm busy.

299
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
I'm not going to show you how easily you're working.

300
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Just sign this,

301
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,100
we'll wait for you outside.

302
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Yes.

303
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
That's all.

304
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Dad, are you still busy?

305
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Of course.

306
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Like you,

307
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
you've been drinking all day.

308
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
And the night is over.

309
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
It doesn't matter.

310
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Those people never treat me as their boss.

311
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Are you the one responsible for the night?

312
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
You're drunk. Go back to your room.

313
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
What? You're drunk? Let go of me.

314
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
I just died, and my son is dead.

315
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Can't I drink more?

316
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
If you can teach your son,

317
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
he won't do that anymore.

318
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
I know what you're thinking.

319
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Even if my son is still alive,

320
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
you won't give him a chance.

321
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
What's your attitude now?

322
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Are you right?

323
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,100
Even if you get angry,

324
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
you won't let that brat live.

325
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Tell me,

326
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
get rid of that bastard.

327
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Stop talking about my son.

328
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
You've been watching us,

329
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,100
and you're not going to say anything.

330
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
You think the first one is a unlucky ghost?

331
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
So you're thinking about dying soon?

332
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
What are you talking about?

333
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Now the police

334
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,100
haven't found out who is the murderer.

335
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Who can be so powerful

336
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
to do this?

337
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
It's you, daddy.

338
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
People are so helpless.

339
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
I've been a kid.

340
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
I've taught you so much.

341
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
You've learned so much.

342
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
You don't have any skills.

343
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
How could I not remember?

344
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,100
You taught me to be so merciful to others.

345
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
But

346
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,100
that's your grandson.

347
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,100
He's my own son.

348
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
He's been watching you grow up.

349
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
In this family,

350
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
no one cares about him.

351
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Why don't I care about him?

352
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
He's dead, what's the point of me?

353
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
He's left so many bad guys.

354
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Are you helping him?

355
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
Let me tell you.

356
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,100
You're the one who killed your son.

357
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,100
It's not your fault.

358
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
Stop talking nonsense.

359
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
You're so cruel.

360
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I've talked to Qin Tian.

361
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Find a few more shops

362
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,100
to help us get a better life.

363
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,100
You'll be out with Fang Yu tomorrow.

364
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Don't look so dead after you go out.

365
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,100
And your brother is back.

366
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
I'll call the police to go to college.

367
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Yang Shen will come to talk to him tomorrow.

368
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
You'll see him tomorrow.

369
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
You'll see him.

370
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
I've tried many times.

371
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
You're trying to get me involved again.

372
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
You think I'll be in Hong Kong?

373
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,100
These are all charity activities.

374
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
You want to do it, right?

375
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm helping you.

376
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
I don't need your help.

377
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
Don't use my name.

378
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
I'll ask for your name.

379
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
It's been said that

380
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
the activities of the Xie family have nothing to do with me.

381
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
Okay. You don't need my help.

382
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
I don't care.

383
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Then can you help your brother?

384
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
We're happy to invite

385
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,100
Professor Fu from the University of Victoria

386
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,100
to help us with the money-making campaign.

387
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Professor Fu, please share

388
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100
the information about mental health.

389
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Hello, everyone.

390
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
This year, no matter it's society,

391
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
or people around us,

392
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
many unhappy things have happened.

393
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
So today,

394
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
I'm going to talk about

395
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
a theory of psychology.

396
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,100
It's called self-advertising memory.

397
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Self-advertising memory

398
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
is different from ordinary memory.

399
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
It's a memory

400
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
that will make you

401
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
strong and emotional.

402
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,100
In some cases,

403
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
it can form a part of yourself.

404
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Professor Fu, you're here.

405
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,100
In most people's understanding,

406
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
all the memories of life

407
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
are connected by all the pieces.

408
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
It's me.

409
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,100
That is, the life is a loss.

410
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
If you can't face the past

411
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
with a sad mind,

412
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
but have a key memory,

413
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,100
someone will suggest the best way

414
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,100
is to look forward and forget the past.

415
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
But in fact,

416
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
it's a part of the life that is rejected.

417
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,100
The memory of a sad mind

418
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
will make you

419
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
create a pattern with reality.

420
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Sometimes,

421
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,100
it will embrace your pain

422
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,100
to create a complete self.

423
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
What are you doing?

424
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Actually, I've seen Luo Yong before.

425
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Which Luo Yong?

426
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
The expert witness

427
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
who you've been a court witness for three years.

428
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
He helped kill his wife and child's husband

429
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
and won the murder.

430
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
It seems to have a little impression.

431
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Luo Yong didn't have a witness.

432
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
He was pretending.

433
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Why did you suddenly mention him to me?

434
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Because at that time,

435
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
I thought you would blow the cow

436
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,100
if you didn't have anything.

437
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
I think you're different

438
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
when I see you this time.

439
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
So I want to tell you.

440
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Then don't you tell Lawyer

441
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
to call him a high school student?

442
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
You think Luo Yong is guilty?

443
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,100
It's easy to be a rebel.

444
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
Just point at his nose

445
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
and say he's wrong.

446
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
His eyes can't fool me.

447
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Then I want to ask Mr. Xing Kai.

448
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
How did you define

449
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
whether there is a psychological problem

450
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
with a person?

451
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
From my treatment point of view,

452
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
I won't say he's pretending.

453
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Because he's always a little bit of a problem.

454
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,100
For example, his feelings or memories

455
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,100
he can't bear it

456
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
and will deal with it in other ways.

457
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Whether it's a consciousness or a subconscious,

458
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
I think it's all a light.

459
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
From my professional point of view,

460
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,100
he really has a psychological problem.

461
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
I'm done.

462
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I have something to do.

463
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,100
You can go ahead.

464
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
I have something to ask you.

465
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Are you the type of person?

466
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Sorry, I'm not free.

467
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,100
I want to talk to you about

468
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Fu Yiming's case.

469
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
I think you should be interested.

470
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Go to my office.

471
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
The murderer was in the刻意

472
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
the murder case before the刻意

473
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
If you want to kill someone

474
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,100
you don't need to return the details.

475
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
Huang Dao's murderers

476
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
are a bit like this murderer.

477
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
They will deliberately

478
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,100
give some tips to make the scene more realistic.

479
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
The typical crime scene

480
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
of the plot is very serious.

481
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
There are several characteristics of this person.

482
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,100
First, they will overreact.

483
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,100
Second, they rarely interact with people

484
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
and don't even have the heart to act.

485
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Third, they are very angry and innocent.

486
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Fourth, they are used to

487
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
use some physical language to attract people's attention.

488
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
So he...

489
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,100
They just want to attract the attention of the society.

490
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
And they have a certain rule.

491
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
As long as they follow their game rules

492
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
they can find the next target.

493
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Thank you.

494
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Are you sure about what you said about Luo Yong?

495
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
The solution is done.

496
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,100
It's okay. I have something to give him.

497
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,100
I'm still thinking whether to give him a good memory

498
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
or burn him.

499
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
If he is a hidden corpse

500
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
he should be hiding in a place

501
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
he can see.

502
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
For example, in the house.

503
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,100
He was as young as a soldier.

504
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Don't thank me.

505
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Hello.

506
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Stop the car here.

507
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Are you going to the back floor?

508
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,100
He doesn't know.

509
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
Are you going to the security?

510
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
No.

511
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
He is so sad.

512
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,100
If you go there, he will be very embarrassed.

513
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,100
Then can I not go down the car?

514
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
I'm going to the elevator.

515
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
What are you doing?

516
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Aren't you going to the stairs?

517
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Go to the elevator.

518
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,100
There is a big garbage in the back floor.

519
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
Who doesn't have the merit?

520
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Those scumbags.

521
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
They should not be mine.

522
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,100
The End

523
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
You also left a line of Chen Yida.

524
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Chen Yida's height is 1.65 meters.

525
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,100
From his current view of the murderer

526
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
to the perspective of the sight.

527
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
This murderer is about 1.7 meters.

528
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,100
And the deputy doctor

529
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,100
that case is called Shui Ping.

530
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,100
That is to say the murderer and deputy doctor

531
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
are 1.8 meters.

532
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,100
One murderer is 1.7 meters.

533
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,100
Another is 1.8 meters.

534
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
Bye bye, Mr. D.

535
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,100
The End

536
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
You have watched this movie so many times.

537
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Can you still laugh?

538
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
When I saw this movie,

539
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
I remembered when we were young.

540
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
Do you remember?

541
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
At that time,

542
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
you told me,

543
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Sister,

544
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
I grew up to be a detective.

545
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Then you forced me

546
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
to help you do that egg tower.

547
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
And play the lead role.

548
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
I still remember.

549
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,100
At that time,

550
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
we watched this movie together.

551
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Everyone was guessing.

552
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Who is the murderer?

553
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Who is the murderer?

554
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,100
No one guessed.

555
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Only you guessed.

556
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
I'm not that good.

557
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
It's because I've seen it before.

558
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
I know.

559
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Do you know?

560
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
Do you like to watch detective movies?

561
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Have you been there for a week?

562
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
But now,

563
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,100
I really think this movie is out of the blue.

564
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
12 murderers.

565
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,100
The one who killed the murderer.

566
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,100
So many people will leave some evidence.

567
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,100
DNA,

568
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,100
and the suspect.

569
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
You will know who did it.

570
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,100
The investigation team is your strongest.

571
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,100
If you are the murderer,

572
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,100
what will you do?

573
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,100
No matter how many criminals there are,

574
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,100
there is only one person who kills.

575
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
Then you can leave the evidence

576
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
and pick up the least.

577
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,100
If the murderer is the criminal,

578
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
the criminal is the criminal.

579
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,100
If the criminal has cleared all the traces,

580
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,100
that means the murderer is the criminal.

581
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,100
It's not that easy.

582
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
Hey, have a meal.

583
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I want to pick up one person.

584
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,100
You are leaving first.

585
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,100
Brother.

586
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Brother.

587
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
It's said that he is not so easy to be fixed.

588
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
No one can take him.

589
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Ren Yi.

590
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Hey,

591
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
throw the knife.

592
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Throw the knife.

593
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,100
My name is Hao Tong.

594
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
My name is Ding Luo Feng.

595
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
It's all your fault.

596
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
You are almost there.

597
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
Where are you guys?

598
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
What?

599
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
You have been dismantled.

600
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,100
Why did you change everything when I came back?

601
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,100
Okay, okay.

602
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,100
I will find it myself.

603
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
That's all.

604
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
I can just say it here.

605
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
He should be happy.

606
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
Here.

607
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Long time no see.

608
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
It's been more than ten years.

609
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,100
I almost can't recognize you.

610
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Then let me test you first.

611
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Do you remember where we lived before?

612
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,100
We have been dismantled.

613
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
We have changed all the surrounding areas.

614
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
Where can we recognize them?

615
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
What are your plans when you come back?

616
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,100
I came back with Shao Yuan.

617
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
He wants us to be together with Luo Feng.

618
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
We can talk about it.

619
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
It's been so many years.

620
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
You didn't meet him for the first time.

621
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
If he wants to listen to you,

622
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
you will be fine.

623
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
You two are close to him.

624
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,100
So I want you two to help.

625
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Okay.

626
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Yes, sir.

627
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,100
That's good.

628
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,100
He is a good person.

629
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
He is a good person.

630
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Ding.

631
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,100
We are going to the bar.

632
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Let's go together.

633
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
I have to go home.

634
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
You two can go.

635
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100
Ding is still working.

636
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,100
You can do it tomorrow.

637
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,100
Let's go together.

638
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
Yes.

639
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
I said no.

640
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
Brother Yuan.

641
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Brother Yuan.

642
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
Brother Yuan.

643
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,100
You can make a new guest today.

644
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
It's hard to make him move.

645
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,100
You said that the guest is here to buy the bill.

646
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
Brother Yuan.

647
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Brother Yuan.

648
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Brother Yuan.

649
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Brother Yuan.

650
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Brother Yuan.

651
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
You are playing with me.

652
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
You said it so badly last time.

653
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Last time.

654
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
This time.

655
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
I'm afraid you will lose.

656
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
I'm embarrassed.

657
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
You two can do it.

658
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
I'm afraid of you this time.

659
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,100
Who is afraid of who?

660
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Come on.

661
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
You can't throw the bill.

662
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
I'll pay you.

663
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
You don't have to pay.

664
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Go play.

665
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
You relax.

666
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,100
I just want to be alone.

667
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
I don't care about you.

668
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
If you can't do it like this.

669
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,100
Our main singer won't come back.

670
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
It's definitely gone.

671
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,100
Okay.

672
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
I'll think of a way.

673
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
You pay the bill.

674
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
I'll pay the bill.

675
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
I'm sorry.

676
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,100
I told you last time.

677
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
You should take your place.

678
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,100
What happened?

679
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
You can't remember.

680
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
Look over there.

681
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Are you okay?

682
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Brother Yuan.

683
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Brother Yuan.

684
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
Brother Yuan.

685
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
Brother Yuan.

686
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,100
Brother Yuan.

687
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,100
Okay.

688
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,100
Ding.

689
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,100
The report.

690
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
Someone was killed in a doll house

691
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
like Hello Kitty's hideous case.

692
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
The victim's identity is confirmed.

693
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,100
It's Chen Yida's assistant Liu Yawei.

694
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,100
She is sent to the hospital now.

695
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
Liu Yawei is now in the wedding.

696
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
She is the dead person of the previous case.

697
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
Chen Yida's colleague.

698
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
What did the doctor say?

699
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,100
The doctor said she was injured in many places.

700
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
And she was taken to the doll house by the murderer.

701
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
I don't know what to say now.

702
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
Who reported it?

703
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
A member of the water department.

704
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,100
He said he saw Liu Yawei

705
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,100
climbing the waterway to the exit of the bank.

706
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Then,

707
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,100
there was a dead person in the exit of the waterway.

708
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,100
I suspect Liu Yawei was thrown down from there.

709
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
So he was thrown down?

710
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,100
He wanted to kill himself?

711
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,100
What about him?

712
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,100
He is the only survivor of so many cases.

713
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,100
The murderer may come to him again.

714
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
We will start the trial to protect him.

715
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
When we see the suspicious person,

716
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
tell us to search the cell later.

717
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
Okay?

718
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,100
Yes, sir.

719
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
I told Zhifei

720
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,100
that we can do psychological analysis at the first time.

721
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I also hope we can get the information of the murderer.

722
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Mr. Liu Yawei.

723
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
Can you hear me?

724
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
Are you Liu Yawei?

725
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
If you can't speak,

726
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
you can nod your head.

727
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Sorry.

728
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
I'm sorry.

729
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,100
I'm sorry.

730
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100
I'm sorry.

731
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
I'm sorry.

732
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
I'm sorry.

733
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
I'm sorry.

734
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
I'm sorry.

735
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
I'm sorry.

736
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
I'm sorry.

737
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
I'm sorry.

738
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,100
Please.

739
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Please.

740
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
Please.

741
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
Sir.

742
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
Calm down.

743
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,100
You are in the hospital.

744
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
They are the police.

745
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
You are fine.

746
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
Have you seen the person who attacked you?

747
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
I saw it.

748
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
Is there a problem with his left foot?

749
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100

Call the doctor.

00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,100
Doctor Fang, it's TPA.

758
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,100
What's TPA?

759
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,100
It's blood clotting.

760
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
If you use it too much,

761
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
it will cause acute brain damage.

762
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
It will be dangerous at any time.

763
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100

Are you ok?

767
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
You should pay for what you've done to her.

768
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Your Uncle Xiang isn't going to live there forever.

769

With what

779
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,520
talent

780
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:46,900
I'll take Zhejiang

781
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,900
Dr. Wang was playing with them.

782
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,900
Those balloons

783
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,900
should have been thrown by the kids

784
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,900
when they were playing.

785
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,900
Mr. Ding, I can't ask you.

786
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,900
They purposely used balloons

787
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,900
to block the camera.

788
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
It's not that easy to find them.

789
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,900
The camera can't take them to the place

790
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
such as the back door and the back door.

791
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,900
Mr. Ding.

792
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
And he disguised as a nurse.

793
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,900
He was easily provided by the police.

794
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Please be careful.

795
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,900

00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,900
I don't know.

804
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900

But the doctor said he wasn't optimistic.

806
