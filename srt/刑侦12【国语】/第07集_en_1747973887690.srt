00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm not afraid of death.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But I'm afraid of my own freedom.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I can't do anything.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Even if I die, I'll never die.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Do you like to be a god?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll play with you today.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who said you're a god?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm Anan Dichen.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm the head of the war.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I apologize to the whole family.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I used the wrong method to take revenge.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm so sorry.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Cheers.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I told you before.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is my last time.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You can find someone else.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Who?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Ding Luofeng?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is a new sin.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You shouldn't have continued.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ding Luofeng, you're the one who caused the disaster.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hello, are you Li Xin's parents?

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm Jiang Yang, a professor at Li Xin University.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Is there anything?

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I want to know what happened about Li Xin's disappearance.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I want to know what can help you.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's okay.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The police are already here.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Tell us.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm a senior at Li Xin University.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm Li Xin's aunt.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What's it?

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm Li Xin's aunt.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm Li Xin's aunt.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm Li Xin's aunt.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm Li Xin's aunt.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How do you know who Li Xin is?

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What do you know?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
The police are helping us.

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,200
Thank you.

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,800
The police

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,440
may not know your daughter's personality.

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,200
Some clues may be ignored.

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,320
If we talk,

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,840
we've already told the police.

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,440
Wife,

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,640
don't tell Mo Shunren

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,800
so much.

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,920
We don't need other people's help.

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,560
Stop harassing us.

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,120
A'ge.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,920
The 경찰,

55
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
can you blame me?

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,160
X views,

57
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,480
your opium ingress,

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,200
and your severe blunders.

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,200
In 2003,

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
the criminal Arbaugh

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,440
Liao Guowa

62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,440
A single grap assurance

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,360
that his mum

64
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,120
just got研究

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,080
a scar.

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,080
It's called the person who left from the Omeras.

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

68
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,080
The person who left from the Omeras.

69
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

70
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

71
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

72
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

73
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

75
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

76
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

77
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

78
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,080
That's what Guo Shi said.

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

80
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,080
What Guo Shi said was that he was in the Omeras town.

81
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Boss.

82
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Just look at it. Please ask me what you need?

83
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
I want to know is this store exclusively for fresh seafood?

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,400
I rarely see you in Hong Kong.

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,520
I've been to many stores

86
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
and only you have it.

87
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,880
You're so mean.

88
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,880
Boss.

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,720
Boss.

90
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
Can you answer my question first?

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
Okay.

92
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,440
You want to ask

93
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,280
if there's a woman

94
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,560
who bought this poison foot Fairy?

95
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,240
She looks very handsome.

96
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,840
Doesn't she look very good?

97
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,480
She used to buy it.

98
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
She's my classmate.

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,320
But I haven't seen her for a year.

100
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,960
I haven't been here in a while.

101
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,600
Sir.

102
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Why do you know

103
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,480
who I want to ask?

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,040
The lady just now

105
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,840
has asked me the same question.

106
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,520
Yang Zhi Fei.

107
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,120
I want to know

108
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,400
why you went to find that woman.

109
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,120
I don't care who I went to.

110
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680
You're a police officer.

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,680
It doesn't mean

112
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,000
you can interfere with other people's business.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,440
You know that woman?

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,480
If you have the clue,

115
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,680
you'd better cooperate with me.

116
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,640
Because there are many lives in this world.

117
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,440
I've been missing a student for a long time.

118
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,400
She has a habit of raising insects.

119
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,160
So I came to see

120
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,320
if there's any clue.

121
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,920
Good.

122
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,160
Her name is Zhang.

123
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,880
I'll help you find it out.

124
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,360
I don't want you to go to the investigation.

125
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,360
My student

126
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,960
is seriously ill now.

127
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,480
If you guys

128
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,240
go to the investigation

129
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,040
so highly,

130
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,880
you want to tell the whole world

131
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,680
that she's a murderer.

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,960
That will affect her a lot.

133
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,800
What if you're guilty

134
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,680
of being concerned about her?

135
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,640
I'm not going to suspect her.

136
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,400
Or give her a label.

137
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,920
Actually, I just want to find out

138
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,640
about this matter.

139
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,840
I don't want to

140
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,000
kill more people.

141
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
I know you have

142
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,400
a lot of prejudice against me.

143
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,120
But I hope you can

144
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
put down your personal prejudice.

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,960
I think only the truth

146
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,920
can help you.

147
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,080
This is the one from Aser.

148
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
I'll give it back to him.

149
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,920
Here.

150
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,320
Here.

151
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,040
Come in.

152
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,640
Mr. Bai.

153
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,320
We found out that the criminal

154
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,480
Chen Zuyang

155
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,440
is the first victim

156
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,480
of the new crime.

157
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
So we're not sure

158
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,080
if the murderer

159
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,280
will be killed by other criminals.

160
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,240
You haven't accepted the teaching yet.

161
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,400
I'll hand it to NB

162
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,440
for the criminal.

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,320
And I remind you

164
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,800
that the case of Chen Zuyang

165
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
has been solved.

166
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,320
I have the right to investigate it.

167
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,760
I have the right

168
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,000
to order you to investigate it.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,440
Who made the Sarton 1115 out of it?

170
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm investigating it.

171
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
Do you know what happened

172
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,840
when we called Gao Erfu?

173
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,120
I don't know.

174
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,200
Many times,

175
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,360
the ball will be blown away.

176
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,680
If you want to find it,

177
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,440
it's troublesome.

178
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,440
So the easiest way is

179
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,880
to add to these words

180
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,320
the most suspicious slurred

181
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,120
and metaphorically murderous tricks.

182
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,080
This guy

183
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,240
impose moreStrongbright.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,560
Got it.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,540
How could you

186
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,400
do anything

187
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,840
to him?

188
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240
So annoying.

189
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,680
We were tired

190
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,760
when we were young.

191
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
I was going to give you a surprise.

192
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,960
I didn't expect you to be shocked.

193
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
These two are...

194
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,160
You don't recognize them?

195
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,360
They are friends you used to have in the hospital.

196
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,360
Happy birthday to you.

197
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,560
Happy birthday to you.

198
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Happy birthday to you.

199
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Happy birthday to you.

200
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,360
Happy birthday to you.

201
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,360
Bai Zhonghao? Jia Ke?

202
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Why are you two together?

203
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,560
I'm afraid you won't believe me.

204
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,360
I met them once.

205
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,160
And I thought, wow, they are so familiar.

206
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
After a while, I found out that

207
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
they are your childhood friends.

208
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,760
So I decided to teach them to live together.

209
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,160
That's too clever. Go to my house.

210
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,360
Okay.

211
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,760
Hi.

212
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,560
You only have dinner at this late?

213
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,160
No, my friends are here to save me.

214
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I'll go to your room.

215
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,560
This is a neighbor's house.

216
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,760
You don't recognize this?

217
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,360
I didn't say anything.

218
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,160
Come.

219
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,160
I usually call for a white-shrink.

220
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
What is this?

221
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Just a friend's help.

222
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,160
Be careful. Sorry.

223
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
It's all scattered.

224
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,760
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,360
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm sorry.

229
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,760
It's all scattered.

230
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,560
Sorry.

231
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,760
Are you okay?

232
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,560
This is how it looks like.

233
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,360
If you're afraid of water, you'll get infected.

234
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
Do you want to see a doctor?

235
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
No need.

236
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,360
Just wipe your face with a towel.

237
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,960
It's a small matter.

238
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,360
Then take a rest.

239
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,160
Put on a mask.

240
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
Don't you remember?

241
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,160
He's a man of iron. He doesn't have a sense of pain.

242
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360
He doesn't know how to feel pain.

243
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,960
When I was young, my mom beat me to the hospital.

244
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,160
Since then, I've been feeling pain.

245
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I don't feel anything.

246
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,360
I remember.

247
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,960
I remember.

248
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,160
I'm so happy to see you again.

249
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,360
If you need anything in the future,

250
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
tell me.

251
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,160
Yes, sir.

252
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,960
Eat something.

253
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,360
Xing Ke.

254
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,680
It's the first time I've seen you

255
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,560
treat others like girls.

256
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,160
Why do you express your feelings to Zhi Fei?

257
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,760
What do you want to say?

258
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,960
I like Zhi Fei.

259
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
If you like him, then I like him.

260
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Don't be a spy.

261
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,960
What are you looking for?

262
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,160
My notebook.

263
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,760
Is it in Kun Chong Hall?

264
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
Hello?

265
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,960
Did you lose your notebook?

266
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,760
Yes.

267
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,960
I brought it back for you. Don't worry.

268
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
I didn't read the contents.

269
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,360
I'll go to the school tomorrow to get it for you.

270
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,560
No need. I'll send it to the police station.

271
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,160
Okay.

272
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Why did Zhi Fei call you? You didn't let me answer?

273
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,960
I was just talking about the police.

274
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,760
I...

275
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,160
Now, help me call Zhi Fei. I want to hear his voice.

276
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,960
I'm telling you, I want to sleep.

277
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,760
I can't hear his voice. I can't sleep.

278
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,560
You're so naive.

279
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,960
Bye-bye.

280
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,160
Hey.

281
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,560
Did you secretly come out to do something again last night?

282
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,960
You'll know when I come out.

283
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,760
Why would I do that?

284
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
I'm talking about this notebook.

285
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,160
Did you bring it back by yourself?

286
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,960
You're so naive. I like Zhi Fei.

287
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,760
But I have a different type of notebook.

288
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
I'm not a spy.

289
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
I'm not a spy.

290
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm just a spy.

291
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
I'm not a spy.

292
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,160
I like Zhi Fei. But I have a different type of notebook.

293
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,960
Why would I bother him with three and a half pages?

294
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,360
A spy should be a person who's弄壞.

295
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,160
The notebook won't come back by itself.

296
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
It's not you who's not me.

297
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,760
It's just that I have time.

298
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,560
I'm going to work now. I need to go to your place.

299
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,960
I can sleep over there.

300
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,960
Hey, why did you call her? She can't know.

301
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,160
Yang Zhi Fei.

302
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
You have something to ask me?

303
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,560
Last night,

304
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,960
thank you for taking it back for me.

305
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,160
Oh, no need to thank me. I just met her.

306
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,760
I've been thinking about this lately.

307
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Recently, my temperament is not very good because of the case.

308
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,160
Did I offend you last night?

309
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,760
No. You've been avoiding me all the time.

310
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,760
Last night, too?

311
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Last night, you went downstairs to buy some groceries.

312
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
You didn't say anything.

313
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,160
Anything else?

314
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,760
No.

315
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,760
It's you.

316
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,160
It's you.

317
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,560
You went downstairs to buy groceries.

318
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,960
It's you who went to see Zhi Fei and didn't tell me.

319
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,160
When you went out, you knocked the spy down.

320
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
Now you blame me.

321
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,960
You're crazy.

322
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,760
You're crazy.

323
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,160
You're crazy.

324
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,960
It's obvious that she didn't remember what she did last night.

325
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,160
I said I'd buy some groceries.

326
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,960
I really thought I'd buy some groceries.

327
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,360
Xin Kai.

328
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,960
Xin Kai.

329
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,760
You received my message, right?

330
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,360
It's nothing. I just passed by your side tonight.

331
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,360
I'll get it for you.

332
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,760
Xin Kai.

333
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,560
Thank you.

334
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,160
What are you doing?

335
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,960
You're so fragrant.

336
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
I took the notebook first.

337
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,160
Now I need to take a break.

338
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,760
I'll talk to you later.

339
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Yang Zhi.

340
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,160
I believe we'll meet again soon.

341
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
I want to talk to you about my student.

342
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Is there any time for me?

343
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Will you come at anyone's peace?

344
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,760
Come in.

345
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,160
I won't.

346
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,160
But I'll come.

347
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,460
Then come.

348
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,300
all the students are doing it wrong.

349
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,020
Obviously, mental health is a comfortable conversation.

350
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,300
From the client's point of view,

351
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,900
I don't know when Hong Kong will become like a textbook.

352
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,380
One is that we teach him

353
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,340
how to say, how to do, how to say, how to do,

354
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,460
but not to guide them.

355
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,380
It's not their fault.

356
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,660
First, students have little experience in combat.

357
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,060
Second, when many clients

358
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,220
are in the beginning,

359
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,940
they are not willing to communicate with us.

360
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,660
So we have to work harder.

361
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,500
I think Hong Kong

362
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,500
is a Chinese culture society.

363
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,460
Even if you are really emotional,

364
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,340
you won't tell others.

365
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,860
This can be said to be the only psychological disorder

366
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,540
in our Asian people.

367
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,220
It's not a confession,

368
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,300
it's the psychological disorder of Asian people.

369
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,860
I think it's not just a common thing.

370
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,260
Even your psychology professor is like that.

371
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,300
Since you care so much about this matter,

372
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,940
why don't you consider joining this project?

373
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,900
He does so much work,

374
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,660
just wants to return to the company.

375
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,980
Do you think he really wants to support us?

376
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,580
No matter what the starting point of this matter is,

377
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,300
as long as this matter is a good thing,

378
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,540
why reject it?

379
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,660
You don't have to be affected by emotions.

380
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,860
Sorry.

381
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,580
Go to the next trip.

382
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,460
Welcome.

383
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,220
Your faze is ready.

384
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,180
Don't be angry.

385
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,140
Give me a hand.

386
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,700
Hello?

387
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,260
I'm from ours.

388
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,100
I'll see him now.

389
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,180
OK. Thanks.

390
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,020
What's wrong?

391
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,180
My brother's guilty suitта has been sent to jail.

392
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,980
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,860
How are you?

394
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,260
Why are you here?

395
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,660
I've been away from this family for many years.

396
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,700
I don't know anything.

397
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,900
Please go out.

398
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,260
What did the doctor say?

399
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,980
When can you go out?

400
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,900
Go out.

401
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,180
Why are your hands shaking?

402
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,260
Are you nervous or nervous?

403
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,900
I have something to tell you.

404
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,740
It doesn't mean that this matter doesn't exist.

405
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,340
I'm also a person who came here.

406
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,100
I've been away from you for more than 20 years.

407
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,380
But the problem has not been solved for a long time.

408
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,380
I told you to go.

409
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,660
Go. You can't hear me.

410
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,820
Go.

411
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,940
Do you have anyone?

412
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,940
I don't want to hear him talk.

413
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,940
Go.

414
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,660
I know you don't want to hear me talk.

415
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,740
I'll introduce other psychological experts to you.

416
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,100
I don't want to see you.

417
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,740
What are you doing?

418
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,540
I'm sick.

419
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,820
What's wrong with you?

420
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,740
Go.

421
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,420
Calm down.

422
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,860
Sir, you can't disturb the patient.

423
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,740
Who is he?

424
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,380
No.

425
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,540
I'm his brother.

426
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,980
Go.

427
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,180
He's gone.

428
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,260
Don't be afraid.

429
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,620
Hello.

430
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,660
It's me.

431
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,180
I want to join your plan.

432
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,420
Binli.

433
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,940
You're here to help people with the six dogs.

434
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,980
Don't you need to rest?

435
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,620
Someone likes to go on a trip.

436
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,180
I like six dogs.

437
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,340
I can play with them.

438
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,180
One or two.

439
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,340
Didn't you ask me to come out

440
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,860
to talk about your students?

441
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,860
What did you say to them?

442
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,100
You said you'd talk about the case.

443
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I came out with you.

444
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,100
Then what about you?

445
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,020
I don't have time.

446
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,980
Why are you so mean to the dog owner?

447
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,660
I'm going to take them back

448
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,620
about an hour later.

449
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,260
I want to ask you.

450
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,700
Do your dogs eat dry food or wet food?

451
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,700
Yes.

452
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,860
And I want to ask

453
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,060
if they like to listen to music.

454
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,940
And if they bring it out,

455
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,180
do they like grass or stone?

456
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,340
Actually, I just randomly feed them.

457
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,340
I didn't study much.

458
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,020
That's why I think you're not careful enough.

459
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,300
I saw the air conditioner

460
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,420
on the house just now.

461
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,340
It was 16 degrees.

462
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,180
If they stay here for a long time,

463
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,420
they'll feel uncomfortable.

464
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,780
Sir.

465
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,860
I'm here to help the six dogs.

466
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,700
I didn't ask you to teach me.

467
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,740
No matter what,

468
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,900
the air conditioner is at a high level.

469
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,020
I've liked dogs since I was a kid.

470
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,340
They're very similar to me.

471
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,500
Like my good friend.

472
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,780
Why don't you bite your teeth if you like them?

473
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,340
I've been a dog for six or two times a day.

474
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,340
I can't go home for two days.

475
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,060
How about that?

476
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,860
Try it.

477
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,060
Turn it around.

478
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,020
Oh.

479
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,380
Why do you want to be a police officer?

480
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,620
I like it.

481
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Why do you like it?

482
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,420
I like it.

483
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,220
Why don't you have friends in the police force?

484
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,300
I'm done.

485
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,900
Why do you have to go up and down

486
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,220
but never get promoted?

487
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,420
Why do you have so many problems today?

488
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,220
We often cooperate.

489
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,260
It's normal for you to know each other.

490
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,420
I've been a police officer for two years.

491
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,300
I only remember that

492
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,140
I met some bad guys.

493
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,300
I got into this position.

494
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,860
But I knew I wanted to be a good person.

495
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
I wanted to catch a thief.

496
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
So I became a police officer.

497
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,340
Since I was a kid,

498
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,140
I don't like to talk to people.

499
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,540
I don't even like people.

500
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,700
My parents think I'm a bad guy.

501
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,220
They don't want to live with me.

502
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,060
So I'm in the police force.

503
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,220
I don't want to be a bad guy.

504
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,420
I don't want to be a bad guy.

505
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,660
I don't want to be a bad guy.

506
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,940
I don't want to be a bad guy.

507
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,100
I don't want to be a bad guy.

508
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,180
I'm in the police force.

509
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,460
No one likes me.

510
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,020
I don't want to be promoted.

511
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,700
Did I answer your question?

512
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,820
You answered it.

513
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,900
Ding Li.

514
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,660
She went to the toilet many times today.

515
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,940
Thank you.

516
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,020
Take it.

517
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,100
How are you?

518
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,980
Are you all right?

519
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,020
Xing Kai.

520
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,100
How are you?

521
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,980
Are you all right?

522
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,980
Xing Kai.

523
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,140
Xing Kai.

524
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,060
Are you all right?

525
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,340
I'm fine.

526
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,460
I'm sorry.

527
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,860
I didn't see her.

528
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,660
You must sign the dog's name.

529
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,860
Thank you.

530
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,940
I'm fine.

531
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,260
Let's go.

532
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,500
Let's go.

533
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,140
Let's go.

534
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,900
Let's go.

535
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,620
Let's go.

536
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,380
Let's go.

537
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,020
Let's go.

538
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,820
Let's go.

539
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,580
Let's go.

540
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,420
Gosh.

541
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,900
I missed you so much.

542
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,140
I miss you.

543
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,860
I miss you, too.

544
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,300
What's the matter?

545
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,820
I miss Xia Shuo again.

546
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,780
Do you still remember?

547
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,380
It's been years.

548
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,900
It seems nothing has changed.

549
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,460
No matter what,

550
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,220
I will support you

551
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,580
in your decision.

552
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,420
But it's not a way to do it all my life.

553
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,740
No matter what,

554
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,380
I will try it.

555
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,420
Okay.

556
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,580
Open the door!

557
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,900
Open the door!

558
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,460
How did I know what it was?

559
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,660
It was just a garbage.

560
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,820
It's a long story.

561
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,020
You have been to many places.

562
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,860
You don't have to see it again.

563
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,300
Are you okay?

564
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,740
I'm fine.

565
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,500
I promised Tongtong

566
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,340
to attend her school activity.

567
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,740
I'll wait for you.

568
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,620
Don't worry.

569
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,140
Please drink with me.

570
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,500
I'll watch over you.

571
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,100
Thank you.

572
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,140
Go inside.

573
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,460
Aared.

574
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,180
I've said it many times.

575
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,420
I won't do that.

576
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,380
Do you think I'll hide it from you

577
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,900
and kill you tonight?

578
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,940
So quiet.

579
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,260
A Xian.

580
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,860
A Xian.

581
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,380
Sara.

582
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,980
的米西分啊,多是个银子.

583
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,980
Let's go together.

584
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,980
You know I don't want to see my mom.

585
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,980
How can a family have a business?

586
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,980
If you don't go in and see,

587
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,980
how do you know that

588
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,980
maybe she's better?

589
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,980
For 30 years,

590
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,980
time can't change everything.

591
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
Her treatment is impossible.

592
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,980
We're not young anymore.

593
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
Why are you so worried?

594
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,980
I didn't hate her.

595
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,980
I just can't forgive her.

596
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
Promise me.

597
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,980
Try it again.

598
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
Last time, okay?

599
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Okay?

600
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
Let's go.

601
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,980
Why don't you go alone?

602
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,980
You can go.

603
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
Mr. Ding.

604
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,980
Mr. Ding.

605
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
Mrs. Ding is here.

606
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
Okay.

607
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
Mr. Ding.

608
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
Take your time.

609
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
I'll wait for you outside.

610
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
My sister asked me to come.

611
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
She's back to Hong Kong.

612
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Shaoyu.

613
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
Don't pretend to remember me.

614
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Do you remember this?

615
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
You remember?

616
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
You remember to set fire to yourself?

617
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,980
It's not me.

618
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
It's not me.

619
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
It's another person.

620
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
It's not me.

621
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
It's not me.

622
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,980
Why are you so irresponsible?

623
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
You still don't admit it?

624
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
It's really not me.

625
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
It's another person.

626
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
It's another person.

627
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
It's another person.

628
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
It's not me.

629
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
It's another person.

630
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
It's not me.

631
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,980
It's another person.

632
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
It's not me.

633
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
It's another person.

634
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
It's not me.

635
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
It's not me.

636
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Don't do this again.

637
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
He still thinks he's innocent.

638
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
Have you investigated?

639
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,980
Maybe he's innocent.

640
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
You don't need to.

641
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,980
You don't need to.

642
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
I saw it myself.

643
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,980
He's the murderer.

644
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,980
I really don't like

645
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
seeing you so unhappy.

646
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
Since you hate me so much,

647
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
I'll help you.

648
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
What do you mean?

649
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,980
Don't mess it up.

650
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,980
I'll wait for you.

651
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,980
I'll wait for you to turn around.

652
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,980
I'll wait for you.

653
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
A-Xian.

654
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
A-Xian.

655
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,980
A-Xian.

656
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,980
The End

657
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Welcome to the introduction meeting.

658
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980
I'm the person in charge of this project,

659
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,980
Fu Yangshan.

660
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,980
This is my partner,

661
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,980
Yang Zifei's assistant professor.

662
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,980
Professor Yan.

663
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,980
Today, we're going to introduce

664
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,980
our target to you.

665
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,980
Thank you, Zifei.

666
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,980
The Great Xie's order.

667
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,980
Ni Feng,

668
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,280
tell us the list.

669
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,980
Chen Pushan.

670
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,980
What is wrong?

671
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,940
Du Yi sided with Zao Erhao and

672
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,940
turned this subject into a criminal.

673
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,980
Then

674
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,980
Lu Yi defeated head-on.

675
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,980
You think Lu Yi

676
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,900
心 Demon and Ganoblade

677
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,980
wanted to be Pavillion?

678
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,980
That is right.

679
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,980
Did you really think

680
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,980
they'd say that

681
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,980
the world is my学?

682
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,980
But it seems to be a bit...

683
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980
Different points of view of the victim this time

684
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,980
are some people who have committed a serious crime.

685
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,980
It looks like this new victim is a criminal.

686
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,980
I personally don't object to this.

687
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,980
Because they seem to be doing justice for Tianxing.

688
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,980
From now on, I will do a emotional management system for you.

689
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,980
I hope that when you face a serious crisis,

690
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,980
you can handle it well.

691
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
I will do my best to help you.

692
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
I will do my best to help you.

693
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980

00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,980
I will do my best to help you.

00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,980
I will do my best to help you.

00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,980

I will do my best to help you.

713
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,980
I will do my best to help you.

714
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,980
I will do my best to help you.

715
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,980
I will do my best to help you.

716
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,980
I will do my best to help you.

717
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,980
