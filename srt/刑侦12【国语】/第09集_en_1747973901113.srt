1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,640
This painting is similar to the painting of Jekyll and Borlock

2
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
It's not his memory

3
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
But it's his painting

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
He's discovering the truth

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,140
Ah-Xian, look at him

6
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,640
He used a lot of deep colors

7
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,640
It's actually his inner performance

8
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
He has two characters

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,140
One is the police officer

10
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,640
The other is myself

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,140
I especially invited you to come out today

12
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,640
You're spying on me now

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Then what's the difference between you and the fake character of the person who broke the promise?

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,280
If he's on TV

15
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,280
I'll show you all the people in Hong Kong

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
What are you doing?

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
You're playing games with me?

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
No, I'm not

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
I said I wanted to watch TV in Shanghai

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
I think I can try

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Look at this

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
If Xinkai is caught in the show

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Then everyone in Hong Kong can stop us

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
You're right

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,920
I just want to take Chen Xuhui

26
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Call him

27
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Control this show

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Don't you think Chen Xuhui will annoy us?

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Don't worry

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,920
I won't let him know our identity

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
You're so confident

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,920
You're such a fool

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm sure he's not ready

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,560
He'll watch the audience

35
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
If Chen Xuhui calls

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
He'll find out

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Okay

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
If anything happens

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,560
I'll make it up to him

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
How do you know Xinkai is in the mental state?

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
I checked his information

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
He saw the private mentalist when he was 14

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
He was too young to watch the public

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
How did you get the video?

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Don't worry

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
I have my own way

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
If Xinkai is the spy

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
You have to catch us all

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
We'll die together

50
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
You don't believe in your own people

51
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
You believe me?

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
I don't even know who you are

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
We're all so confident

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
We'll open the envelope

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
after the crime is over

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
When is the crime?

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
Two days later

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
There will be a live broadcast

59
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
The police will see it all

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,840
We'll find it after the crime is over

61
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Sorry, sister

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
I'm useless

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
You have to help me for a long time

64
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
The police is here

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm sorry

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
I'm sorry

67
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm sorry

68
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm sorry

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm sorry

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm sorry

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm sorry

72
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm sorry

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I'm sorry

74
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm sorry

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
I'm sorry

76
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
I'm sorry

77
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
I'm sorry

78
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm sorry

79
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Hello

80
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Please put this on

81
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
and check it out

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm reading the news

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Do you have news?

84
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm not sure.

85
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,000
I have a friend.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,400
She asked me something.

87
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I don't know how to answer.

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Ding San, can you help me

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
to solve this problem?

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,400
What?

91
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
I have a friend.

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
He wants to ask a girl to go out for dinner.

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,200
But he doesn't usually ask a girl to go out for dinner.

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
And now this girl hasn't replied to him.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I want to ask you

96
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
if you know what's going on.

97
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
I want to ask you

98
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
if you know what's going on.

99
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Is she out of time?

100
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
I said I have a friend.

101
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Come on.

102
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Be careful.

103
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Don't worry.

104
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Work hard.

105
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Ding San, have you seen Yang Zhi Fei?

106
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
No.

107
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
You have a good relationship with him.

108
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
We can't find him now.

109
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
I have a meeting with him for the show.

110
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
I can't find him in the university either.

111
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm going to the university.

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm going to the university.

113
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
I'm going to the university.

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm going to the university.

115
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm going to the university.

116
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm going to the university.

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
I'm going to the university.

118
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I'm going to the university.

119
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I'm going to the university.

120
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm going to the university.

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm going to the university.

122
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I'm going to the university.

123
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm going to the university.

124
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I'm going to the university.

125
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
I'm going to the university.

126
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Jing!

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Xiao Tao!

128
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Zi Jun!

129
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,000
Zi Jun, can you hear me? Zi Jun!

130
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Help!

131
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
Help! Is there anyone?

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Help!

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Help!

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Zhi Fei!

135
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Zhi Fei!

136
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Zhi Fei, where are you?

137
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Zhi Fei!

138
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Sir, I didn't offend you, did I?

139
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
Why did you come here?

140
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Where is Zhi Fei?

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Where is Zhi Fei?

142
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,400
I said I offended you.

143
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,200
Let us go. We won't say anything.

145
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Or do you want money?

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,400
Tell me. I'll give you all the money, okay?

147
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,400
Finally, Sir, I can double you as a suspect.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,200
I'm afraid you'll have no knowledge of the situation.

149
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Zhi Fei.

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,800
If you like me, you can call me as Buddha.

151
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,400
Great!

152
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,600
And I'll send you back to feature.

153
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
We have a kill test.

154
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
One, two, three.

155
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
We've got it.

156
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Chief.

157
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
You guys take a group and prepare for the main event.

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
The rest, go to the prison.

159
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Yes, sir.

160
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Fei, come with me!

161
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Do you recognize him?

162
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
He's Chen Yida,

163
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
a little sister of mine.

164
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
A victim of the new wife.

165
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Why can't you remember him?

166
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
You're the one who's been making me feel guilty.

167
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,300
You're the one who's been trying to make me pay for my death.

168
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,800
I've already decided.

169
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
You should at least be a half-working person.

170
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,300
You're the one who's been making me feel guilty.

171
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,800
What did my sister do?

172
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
She killed someone and let them go.

173
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Or did she hurt someone?

174
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Was it her who made the dragon-dolls and the sheep-dolls?

175
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Was it her who did it wrong?

176
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Then did my sister really die?

177
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm dead.

178
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
You're filming a passionate man.

179
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,300
You're making this black-hearted man.

180
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
Are you also a human being?

181
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
It's all for Zhenhu.

182
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
It's not me who killed her.

183
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Don't worry.

184
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
I can help my sister soon.

185
00:09:49,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Everyone, get ready.

186
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
The live broadcast will start in one minute.

187
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Everyone, listen.

188
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Live broadcast in one minute.

189
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
You must take good care of your sister.

190
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Hello, everyone.

191
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm the host, Sharon.

192
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I'm very happy to welcome you to my family.

193
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Let's take a short break from the psychological aspect

194
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
and focus on the recent global warming.

195
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
First of all, welcome to the director of the Hong Kong Island

196
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,800
of the Hong Kong Island, Zhang Man Guang and Zhang Sun.

197
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
And the two famous psychological experts,

198
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Dr. Peng De Cheng, a professor of the Fu Yang Mountain.

199
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Dr. Peng, from a psychological aspect,

200
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
why did a serial killer appear in this world?

201
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Basically, this serial killer is a anti-social personality.

202
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Most of it is due to his family background,

203
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
his growth experience and social pressure.

204
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I believe many people want to know

205
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
if the victim's desire is born.

206
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
And what can psychological scholars

207
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
help the police to find this victim?

208
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
This topic is a problem of our academic world.

209
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
There are research reports that

210
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,800
the amount of MLA and CDH13 in the brain

211
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
that causes the victim to have a low brain capacity

212
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
affects the cell cells' metabolism,

213
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
which causes the ability to control the brain.

214
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
This makes it easy to commit crimes.

215
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
So you mean that if someone is born,

216
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,800
it's the victim who will be the one to be the victim?

217
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I don't mean that.

218
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
From the psychological aspect, it's the opposite.

219
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
No one is born to be a serial killer.

220
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Even if they have a lack of the immortal,

221
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
they can't become absolute evidence.

222
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Because people's minds

223
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
will often be affected by the consequences of the day.

224
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Professor Fu, you've tried to

225
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
overcome some of the crimes you've committed.

226
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
I hope they can change their mind.

227
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
But the problem is that

228
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
why do these crimes still repeat the crime?

229
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Does it mean that psychological scholars

230
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
can't help them?

231
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Think about it.

232
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
We don't suspect that they are back to society.

233
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,800
But in the end, they only continue to make mistakes.

234
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Our psychological scholars believe that

235
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,800
the change in the day can overcome the lack of the immortal.

236
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I'm not very agreeable.

237
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
The criminals I've caught

238
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
have all the tricks to trick people to release them.

239
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
I think that the victim who committed the crime

240
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
is just to satisfy his own impulse

241
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
and kill them.

242
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
I want to know how psychological scholars

243
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,800
help us to catch this victim.

244
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
We have to determine

245
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
which kind of serial killer is guilty.

246
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,800
But it's impossible that he's just impulsive.

247
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
All the things he did were planned by the whole board.

248
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
So I believe that he's a

249
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,800
serial killer who's focused on the process.

250
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Professor Fu,

251
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,800
what is a serial killer who's focused on the process?

252
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
There's a special feature about a serial killer.

253
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
They think that

254
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
the person who produced a certain group of people

255
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
is their own mission.

256
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
It's like a new crime.

257
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I want to know how to stop it.

258
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Is serial killer ever going to appear?

259
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
A society with a stable harmony

260
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
and a good family education

261
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,800
can reduce the situation.

262
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Professor Fu,

263
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I believe that many people

264
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
don't have a family as good as you.

265
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Just like your father, Mr. Fu De Shan.

266
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,800
So there must be a reason for it.

267
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
I don't know what the two souls are.

268
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,800
I believe that both of you have a point.

269
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
But we've received a lot of

270
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
audience's hotline calls.

271
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Let's invite the next audience.

272
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Hello, director.

273
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I want to ask you something.

274
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,800
How did the police find the second serial killer?

275
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
And I want to ask Professor Fu.

276
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
There are a lot of people outside

277
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
who are responsible for your voice.

278
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
I want to ask you

279
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
whether he's willing to continue

280
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
to work as a teacher.

281
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
I don't know which one you're referring to.

283
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
So I can't answer your question.

284
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Professor Fu,

285
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
you're so smart.

286
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
You probably don't know the answer.

287
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
You're talking about Yang Zhifei?

288
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
He's missing.

289
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Does it have anything to do with you?

290
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
No.

291
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
I've finished asking.

292
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Please answer my question.

293
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Because this case is still investigating.

294
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
I'm not a very convenient person

295
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
to investigate too many police cases.

296
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
I can tell you that

297
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
the police sent a lot of people

298
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
to find the first serial killer

299
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
after the victim was killed.

300
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
I saw on the Internet

301
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
that Chen Yida's suicide

302
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
and Liu Yawei's kidnapping

303
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
were the same time.

304
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Why did you find one?

305
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
But you found another one.

306
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Did the police show something?

307
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
This audience

308
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
is quite suitable for investigation.

309
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
I don't know where you heard it.

310
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
I just found it.

311
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
By the way,

312
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I saw the first time

313
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
the police arrived at the scene.

314
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Why didn't they show up today?

315
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
He's working outside.

316
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
He's out of time.

317
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
If I'm not mistaken,

318
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
one is called Xing Kai.

319
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
The other is called Ding Luo Feng.

320
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I want to tell you

321
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
that Chen Yida's suicide

322
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
and Liu Yawei's kidnapping

323
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
were the same time.

324
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
That is to say,

325
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
the police may have

326
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
been caught by the killer.

327
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Please, everyone,

328
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
don't say some official speculation.

329
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
How is it, Zhang San'er?

330
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Did you hear that?

331
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
The people in the live broadcast room

332
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
are all calling you out.

333
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Hurry up and call Xing Kai

334
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
and Ding Luo Feng out.

335
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Did you get the message?

336
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
This person is probably a suspect.

337
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Now, start tracking.

338
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
You...

339
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
The case is settled.

340
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
What?

341
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
I... I said it's not bad, San'er.

342
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
I... I...

343
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
I'll help you first.

344
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
I believe everyone is tired.

345
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Let's take a break first.

346
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
We'll talk to you later.

347
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Zhang San'er,

348
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
the fire outside

349
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
doesn't see any suspicious people around.

350
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
We can find the source of the phone

351
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
in five minutes.

352
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
The case is off.

353
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
I suspect that the phone

354
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
might be the killer.

355
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
I don't know why.

356
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
But don't worry.

357
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
The command center

358
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
is tracking their signal.

359
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
The TV station is closed.

360
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
It's very safe here.

361
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Let's go to work.

362
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
We're in the office.

363
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Did you record

364
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
what he said just now?

365
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Yes.

366
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
He's in the analysis.

367
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Did you find anything?

368
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
A little bit.

369
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
We found out that he didn't use

370
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
the fixed phone

371
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
or the network phone.

372
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
But the most troublesome thing is

373
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
he's the same as the satan 1115.

374
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
They're all using the TVR.

375
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
So we can't track his location.

376
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
It's obvious that he's the killer.

377
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Our target now

378
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
is to lock the killer's location.

379
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Don't waste time

380
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
to check his IP.

381
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Now everyone

382
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
is investigating this identity.

383
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Let's see if we can find

384
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
where he came from.

385
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Is that clear?

386
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Yes, sir.

387
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
We found out

388
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
whether it's the TV station

389
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
or the network phone.

390
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
It's been broken

391
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
for so many years.

392
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
The phone outside

393
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
is almost broken.

394
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
After the ad is done,

395
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
the audience just said

396
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
that no matter what happens,

397
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
the show can't be stopped.

398
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
But

399
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
will the police

400
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
and the superior

401
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
do something?

402
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
I'll make the deal.

403
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
The police

404
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
don't need to worry about it.

405
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Okay, the night is over.

406
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Let's continue

407
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
to contact the hotline.

408
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Sir.

409
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
We need to ask Zhang San

410
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
who gave this to you.

411
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Did you open it?

412
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I received it this morning.

413
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
It says

414
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
it's for Zhang San when he's on the live.

415
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Why did it stop?

416
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Did you see Zhang San?

417
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Open it and take a look.

418
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Zhang San.

419
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
The search team hasn't checked it.

420
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
It could be the bomb.

421
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Hong Kong Police.

422
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Are you looking?

423
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Are you looking?

424
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Everyone is looking at you.

425
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
What should we do?

426
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
What should we do?

427
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Why?

428
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Why?

429
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
What is it?

430
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Officer Wang, Yang Jiufei is being kidnapped.

431
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
That suspect is very likely to be the new suspect.

432
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
We're going to the station to meet him right now.

433
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Roger.

434
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Do you know that you're doing this to harm the safety of all Hong Kong people?

435
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
What do you want?

436
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Do you want to know?

437
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Why did you say that I'm with Xing Kai and Ding Luo Feng?

438
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm going to call Xing Kai and Ding Luo Feng over right now.

439
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I haven't finished yet.

440
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Professor Yang and his friends are in different places.

441
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Hurry up and call Xing Kai and Ding Luo Feng over.

442
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Why would I tell them where they are?

443
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Why would I believe you?

444
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Do you think I'm the murderer of the new suspect?

445
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm the one who's going to kill him!

446
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Let's go.

447
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Commander, it's the third time the show's release time.

448
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
We're researching the suspect.

449
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
We're trying to find out where he is.

450
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
What else do you want other than to meet us?

451
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Nothing yet.

452
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
I think that this person's behavior

453
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
and the murderer of the new suspect are very similar.

454
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Even if he's not, I think there must be something to do with him.

455
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Control your pulse.

456
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Please come over and instruct him to take actions.

457
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Yes, sir.

458
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,760
Mr. Ding.

459
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,640
Wei Xinkai, where are you going?

460
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,520
Entering the room.

461
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,800
Who says you're going in?

462
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm telling the truth.

463
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,040
Did you see it?

464
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,880
He's been shot dead.

465
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,080
If I don't show up,

466
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,800
the murderer will be arrested anytime.

467
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,400
Can you carry this?

468
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
So I'm trying to deal with him.

469
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
This way, we can find his location.

470
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,200
Director is in his place.

471
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
He won't care about you.

472
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,480
You lost in the live broadcast.

473
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
How could you talk to him?

474
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
You want to be punished?

475
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Calm down.

476
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Calm down.

477
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Xinkai is not in the mood for a conversation.

478
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,480
But Director is in his place.

479
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,480
Why don't we see what we have?

480
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Mr. Ding.

481
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Our fire chicken is investigating this body.

482
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,480
It's repairing its original sound.

483
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Mr. Zhang, it's repaired.

484
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
I'll let you guys hear it.

485
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Do you think I'm the murderer of Xinkai?

486
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm the one who's been killed.

487
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
I know who this person is.

488
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Come in.

489
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Yes, sir.

490
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
He's Chen Yida's brother, Chen Xuhui.

491
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
He came to our school to make trouble.

492
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
He was taken away for security.

493
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
What's the reason?

494
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Before, Zhifei and Zijun

495
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
filmed a video about Xinkai's crime.

496
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Zijun has a certain sense of murder.

497
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
So he kidnapped them.

498
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
I don't care what the background is.

499
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
He's in danger now.

500
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
I can't be in danger.

501
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
There's one thing that's not reasonable.

502
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
He's the victim's family member.

503
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
He's not a murderer.

504
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Why would he pretend to be a murderer?

505
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
To get that murderer out.

506
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
I don't believe that murderer

507
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
can't stand this situation.

508
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Think about it.

509
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Now Chen Xuhui kidnapped

510
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
the guilty Du Zijun.

511
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
If you're the murderer,

512
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
would you be angry if the supporter is kidnapped?

513
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
You mean

514
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
he deliberately enraged the victim

515
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
who was guilty of the crime?

516
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Then he was killed?

517
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Yes.

518
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
So we have to take a step forward

519
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
to catch that Chen Xuhui.

520
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Try to delay the time.

521
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
I'll go first.

522
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Give me a call.

523
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Liu, Zhe'er is next door.

524
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Listen.

525
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Chen Yida's brother, Chen Xuhui,

526
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
is the suspect.

527
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
You two go to his place

528
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,480
and tell the technology team

529
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
to find his location.

530
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
I'll save the two people as soon as possible.

531
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Be careful.

532
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,480
Remember.

533
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
He has a bomb.

534
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Keep in touch.

535
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Bye.

536
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Yes.

537
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
Okay.

538
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
Okay, I know.

539
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Listen.

540
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Find the entire Hong Kong's spies.

541
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Make sure to find the location of Chen Xuhui.

542
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Yes.

543
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm the chief police officer of the Central District.

544
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Officer Jin Luo Feng.

545
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
He is a suspect.

546
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Tell me.

547
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
What's the story?

548
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
I want to find the police.

549
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Even he wants to tell the whole Hong Kong

550
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,480
about the concept of Saturn 1115.

551
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Okay.

552
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Saturn 1115

553
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
is not just a discussion area

554
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
that can't be followed.

555
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
It's also a common concept

556
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
that the person who joins is to be punished

557
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
by the punishment of

558
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
the crime of being a criminal.

559
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Everyone around us

560
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
is a criminal.

561
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
No matter how warm and beautiful

562
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,480
the crime is.

563
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Continue.

564
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
There are new criminals in modern people.

565
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Including 70s,

566
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Long Duan,

567
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Fan Du.

568
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
A young lady is a criminal.

569
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
But she can't catch up with the people.

570
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Now the criminal is a criminal.

571
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
He is again a new criminal.

572
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,480
There will be four more cases of murder.

573
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,480
I'm not a criminal.

574
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,480
I'm a brother who lost his family.

575
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
My sister is Chen Yida.

576
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
I did so many things for one thing.

577
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
It's revenge.

578
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
She sees why the criminal happens.

579
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,480
If the new innocence seriously hurts others,

580
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
I will have to send off

581
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,480
the criminal who was responsible for them.

582
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,180
And they also have to get

583
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,480
to taste now the pain of the past!

584
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
What's the situation now?

585
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,280
What's going on?

586
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
The suspect is Chen Xuhui,

587
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,880
the most deceased family member of the new family.

588
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,600
He kidnapped Yang Zhifei and his friends.

589
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,280
He tied two bombs on them.

590
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,480
Madam, the situation has changed.

591
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,280
The suspect just said he was here to avenge.

592
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,680
Madam, a call.

593
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,360
Hello?

594
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,840
The whole city is watching.

595
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,280
Why didn't you turn off the live broadcast?

596
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,280
I'm going to take over the scene.

597
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,800
The situation is in control.

598
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't want to be the witness of the incident today.

599
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,080
You must catch him.

600
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,840
Got it?

601
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,680
Yes, sir.

602
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,120
Stop all of them.

603
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,400
The show is about to start.

604
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,880
Wait, wait, wait.

605
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Sorry, madam.

606
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,160
I really can't be the witness.

607
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,640
Why don't I tell them?

608
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,280
I said it again.

609
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
I'm the witness now.

610
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,400
You can't say that.

611
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,440
No, no.

612
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,680
Mr. Li.

613
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,640
Mr. Li.

614
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,760
Are you free now?

615
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,840
Let's go upstairs and have a look.

616
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,280
Is it a bottle of tea or a jar?

617
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,040
I bought it.

618
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,880
You don't have to do these useless things.

619
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,400
You want the truth.

620
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,240
I want the final result.

621
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,080
Mr. Li.

622
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,640
Don't make me feel uncomfortable.

623
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,280
I just want to know

624
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,880
whether it works or not.

625
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
If it really doesn't work,

626
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,040
I only ask for the CCTV to check the scene.

627
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,720
No need.

628
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,080
Since then, we will try to cooperate

629
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,200
with the police

630
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,880
to see if there are any requirements.

631
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,840
I'll go out and do it right away.

632
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,640
Wait a minute.

633
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,440
Okay.

634
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,600
Mr. Li.

635
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,240
The cleaning is going on.

636
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
I don't care what you do.

637
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,880
I'm here to keep you safe.

638
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,760
You must keep this show going.

639
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,480
Got it?

640
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,520
Yes, Mr. Li.

641
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,400
We have your request.

642
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,840
It's your turn.

643
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,560
Tell me quickly.

644
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,800
Where are they?

645
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,680
I...

646
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,080
I've made my way here.

647
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,360
But I've said less.

648
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
I can get the bomb

649
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,600
from them anytime.

650
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,240
So hurry up.

651
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,400
Otherwise,

652
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,760
boom!

653
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,120
You're going to get the bomb?

654
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,680
What are you talking about?

655
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,440
Tell me.

656
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,040
I know you don't need to hide it now.

657
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
I believe that the viewers

658
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,280
watching the live broadcast

659
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,320
on your phone or TV

660
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,880
are even curious

661
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,120
about the citizens of Hong Kong.

662
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,520
Which one is the murderer

663
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,120
who committed the crime?

664
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,960
He's the one who learned my way.

665
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,400
Do you want to know

666
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,160
who I'm learning from?

667
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,760
This man

668
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,640
is sitting in front of you now.

669
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,880
您.

670
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,960
This is

671
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,760
the police who Secure His Highness.

672
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,880
Xing Kai.

673
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,440
Damn it!

674
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,940
This moment

675
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,000
Professor Raj...

676
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,480
Can't you tell everyone

677
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,880
Which kind of personality is Xing Kai?

678
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,040
Xing Kai...

679
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,640
is a little bit of a problem in the real world.

680
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,400
That's personality isolation.

681
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,920
No, he doesn't have personality isolation.

682
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,480
Can you use Du Zijun's life to protect him?

683
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,960
Is Xing Kai really that problem?

684
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,520
No, is this a human form?

685
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,600
No, it's a転直接 labour but a retrial.

686
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,320
Z insulting.

687
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Safe!

688
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
Sorry.

689
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,880
I have an important call to pick up.

690
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,080
I will cut off this call.

691
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,080
Where is the prison?

692
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
I'm still here.

693
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,280
You can continue to accuse me.

694
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,480
Go.

695
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,880
Ding.

696
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
We didn't find it.

697
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,080
Chen Xu Hui is not at home.

698
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
What did you find?

699
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,280
We found a file of a crime scene.

700
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,480
I suspect he's working there.

701
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,080
You suspect the police?

702
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,880
Yes.

703
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Where is the victim?

704
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,680
In the meeting room.

705
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,880
Do you want to stop this scene

706
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,080
with his boss?

707
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Sir, I'm sorry.

708
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,680
We can't go in here.

709
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,480
Sir, I'm sorry.

710
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,280
We can't go in here.

711
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,480
Sir, I'm sorry.

712
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
We can't go in here.

713
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,280
Sorry.

714
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,680
I interrupted you.

715
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Sir, please have a chat.

716
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
We can't go in here.

717
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,080
We have to take over here.

718
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
It's a big deal.

719
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,680
It's not good for us.

720
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,280
It will affect the police.

721
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
It's a matter of saving people.

722
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
If Chen Xu Hui reports that bastard,

723
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,080
we will have no idea.

724
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
What are you going to do?

725
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
I want to ask you something.

726
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,280
Do you really think I won't kill anyone?

727
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,480
You have two choices now.

728
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,280
One, Yang Zhi Fei is a good cop.

729
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
It's a psychological analysis.

730
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,080
Two, I'll report to the police.

731
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,280
I'll do it.

732
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,680
I'll do it.

733
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,680
Wait.

734
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,080
Yang Zhi Fei.

735
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,880
Don't promise him.

736
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,280
Chen Xu Hui.

737
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
If you want to talk, I can talk with you.

738
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
But I can tell you.

739
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,280
I'm not the one

740
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,880
who is the murderer in the new wife.

741
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,480
Zhi Fei, I won't be in trouble.

742
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
You won't be in trouble either.

743
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Why do you want to talk with him?

744
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Professor Yang, if you don't want to die,

745
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,080
you should know how to do it.

746
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,680
But if I be killed,

747
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,080
I will do it.

748
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,080
You dare to let go.

749
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,680
Let go?

750
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,680
Xinkai,

751
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,920
have you ever suffered

752
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,880
any pressure because of your job?

753
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:58,280
I've never been in a state of depression, anxiety, or even wanted to commit suicide.

754
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,880
As a police officer, I will definitely meet the wrong person.

755
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,880
But I've never thought of committing suicide.

756
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,480
Then, do you have any kind of situation?

757
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Suddenly, I found myself in other places.

758
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,480
But I don't remember how I got there.

759
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,480
It's like a dream. It's like you.

760
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,880
Hello?

761
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
I've never been there.

762
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,080
Sorry, the police are here to take care of this.

763
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,480
Please leave, sir.

764
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,080
Please go to the studio. You don't deserve to be in charge of the defense.

765
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Sit down.

766
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,080
There's a video of this.

767
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
I'll post it on the live stream.

768
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
I'm the judge.

769
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,880
Everyone, you can see this girl now.

770
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,080
She's a creative person who's been discussing about the crime.

771
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,080
She's a new victim of the crime.

772
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
She's now in a critical state.

773
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,680
If you have any information, please contact the police immediately.

774
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,280
Thank you.

775
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,480
Since you let me see that thing,

776
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,080
I'll let you see that thing too.

777
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,080
Let's watch it together!

778
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,080
A-Xing, come and see.

779
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Come on.

780
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
I'm asking you, don't make me talk.

781
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,680
You're so useless. Why don't you try to get out of here?

782
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,280
I can't hear you.

783
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
You can't hear me.

784
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
I can't hear you.

785
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
I can't hear you.

786
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
This is serious.

787
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
Go and help the security.

788
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Yes, madam.

789
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Gu Jiazhang, the security.

790
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
I'm going to put the blame on everyone at the scene.

791
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,880
I'll bring the blame back.

792
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,480
I don't want to be a Hong Kong person who sees me and catches people.

793
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
Go ahead.

794
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Put the blame on the live stream.

795
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,480
I'm sorry.

796
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
I forgot my name.

797
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Wang San'er, you found it?

798
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
The informant is so late.

799
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,880
The location Chen Xunhui showed up was the direction of the original.

800
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,680
Police, who's the person in charge?

801
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,680
Inside.

802
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,280
Kunge.

803
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,880
What's up? What's the matter, San'er?

804
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,080
We're looking for Chen Xunhui. Is he working here?

805
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,480
He hasn't been here in days.

806
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,680
Is there anything special that has happened recently?

807
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
He can do whatever he wants.

808
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,280
Oh, there's something.

809
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,680
I heard he showed up in the original.

810
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,880
I found it somewhere.

811
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,080
Chen Xunhui went to the 8-star Zhaowu Village.

812
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,280
Is there a possibility that he's there?

813
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,680
Isn't Zhaowu Village in the original?

814
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,880
I'll go there now.

815
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Take Zonghao back to the village. Bye-bye.

816
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,480
Qinghai, please give us the evidence.

817
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
The gun.

818
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,880
Go back with us to investigate.

819
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,680
Do you think I'm a murderer even if I'm a thief?

820
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,280
Qinghai, let me handle this.

821
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,680
I think I should go and find it myself.

822
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,760
Spread it out.

823
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,520
Hand it over to Pei Qingan right away!

824
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,680
I'll take the gun now.

825
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,680
I'll take the gun now.

826
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,680
I'll take the gun now.

827
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
Princess!

828
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
Princess!

829
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
The bodyguard is in the center.

830
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
Please take a look.

831
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Take him away.

832
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
I'm going to the headquarters.

833
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,680
Do you know where the target is?

834
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
The site is too big.

835
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
The man has to go to the target.

836
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Okay, I got it.

837
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,680
Okay, the area is very big.

838
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
We'll find it ourselves.

839
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
Okay, wait for the group.

840
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,680
Check the equipment first.

841
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
Come.

842
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,680
The third group.

843
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,680
Third group.

844
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
I forgot.

845
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,680
Okay.

846
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Princess, you have to be careful.

847
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,680
Okay, I'll take care of it.

848
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
What are you doing?

849
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,680
Princess!

850
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,680
This bomb is starting to fall.

851
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Don't go!

852
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Don't go!

853
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,680
Don't go!

854
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
Don't go!

855
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
Don't go!

856
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,680
Don't go!

857
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,680
Don't go!

858
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,680
Princess!

859
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,680
His world is not convenient.
