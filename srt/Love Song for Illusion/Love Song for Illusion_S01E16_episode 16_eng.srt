8
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,190
 Would it be okay for me to go out? 

9
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,180
 Whoa, my goodness. 

10
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,740
 It is just— There is something I forgot to take. 

11
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,150
 Really? 

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,090
 Is this what you are looking for? 

13
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,700
 What is this? 

14
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,810
 You knew I was looking for this? 

15
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,470
 You disloyal evil spirit. 

16
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,070
 I took out the blade and saved you. 

17
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,860
 But you intend to get rid of me. 

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,830
 So the thing is... 

19
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,190
 You need to die for me to live. 

20
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,220
 That will not happen. 

21
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,780
 Sorry. 

22
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,980
 Sir Ak Hee! 

23
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,860
 No. 

24
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,550
 No. 

25
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,370
 I am sorry. 

26
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,350
 Do not stab His Majesty. 

27
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,380
 No! 

28
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,360
Sir Ak Hee. Sir Ak Hee, wake up. How can you do this?

29
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,580
You said you would look for a way with me!

30
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,720
Sir Ak Hee, wake up!

31
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,560
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

32
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,760
Ak Hee.

33
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,180
What did you do to His Majesty?

34
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,700
What did you do?

35
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,130
What did you do?

36
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,720
I am sorry,

37
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,600
Kyera.

38
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,550
He is dead.

39
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,380
Sajo Hyeon has died.

40
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,480
My time has finally come now.

41
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,560
   

42
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,650
Your Majesty.

43
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,230
Kyera, long time no see.

44
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,290
Is something wrong?

45
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,420
You already know.

46
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,870
Ak Hee told me about the trade you made with him.

47
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,770
You must resent me.

48
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,850
Even resentment is meaningless.

49
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,750
It is my fault.

50
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,050
I am to blame for developing a wrong relationship.

51
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,150
Ak Hee was filled with joy to leave with you.

52
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,350
Did you two become that close in the meantime...

53
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,550
or was it in defiance of the queen's pregnancy?

54
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,740
I will not leave with Ak Hee.

55
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,630
Since things came down to this,

56
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,760
I will fulfill my duty as the last descendant of the Royal Family of Yeon.

57
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,120
That is what I expected from you, Kyera.

58
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,910
In that case, you will aim your sword at my throat this time if I become the king?

59
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,110
I just might.

60
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,360
Instead of aiming your sword,

61
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,550
can you not hold my hand?

62
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,590
The Wind Knives have turned their back on you, apparently.

63
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,120
I heard even the followers of the Royal Family of Yeon are pointing fingers at you,

64
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,890
saying you are a traitor who went mad for your enemy's son.

65
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,600
It must be shame worse than death for you.

66
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,390
There is a way to quiet them down.

67
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,620
Do you want to know what it is?

68
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,150
The Head Minister has been waiting for you for quite a while now.

69
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,950
What? Head Minister?

70
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,830
Yes.

71
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,170
Are your eyes okay?

72
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,300
 His Majesty has arrived. 

73
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,460
Head Minister.

74
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,700
Your Majesty.

75
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,800
What brings you here at this late hour?

76
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,410
 Was geuminsal a success? 

77
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,060
 Yes. 

78
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,770
 Great job, Cheong Ta. 

79
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,650
 You did well, okay? 

80
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,400
 By the way, Yeon Wol is still inside. 

81
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,780
 Are you going to kill her as well? 

82
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,020
 We will let her be. 

83
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,840
 Poor thing. She must be at a loss since Sajo Hyeon is dead. 

84
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,590
 She might become useful depending on how she behaves. 

85
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,510
 Sajo Hyeon is dead? 

86
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,650
I was going to leave the palace, but I was suddenly worried about you, Your Majesty.

87
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,880
Worried?

88
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,490
Though you fortunately recovered and returned from the sanitorium,

89
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,680
some say your eyesight has become terrible, and

90
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,410
others say you lost a lot of strength.

91
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,520
There is a lot of heinous rumors going around inside the palace.

92
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,050
So, I wanted to meet you in person and ask how you were doing, Your Majesty.

93
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,290
You are the only one who truly cares, Head Minister.

94
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,870
I am doing great, really.

95
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,520
I feel as if I am walking on clouds.

96
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,750
I see. I am so glad.

97
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,080
 You are definitely Ak Hee. 

98
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,960
Then...

99
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,310
are you saying His Majesty has passed away?

100
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,170
Yes, that seems to be the case.

101
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,430
Though it is unfortunate for His Majesty,

102
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,310
it is not a bad turn of events for us.

103
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,370
I did not wish for His Majesty to end up that way.

104
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,050
How could it so suddenly...

105
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,730
Is it Ak Hee's doing?

106
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,910
Or Father, were you the one...

107
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,310
Chae Ryeon,

108
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,930
you must not lose heart.

109
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,130
This is only the beginning.

110
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,000
There will be a huge bloodbath soon.

111
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,300
You must only focus on protecting the baby in your womb.

112
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,550
Father, you are...

113
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,780
such a terrifying man.

114
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,680
Did you realize that only now?

115
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,260
 Did you really die? 

116
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,270
 Really? 

117
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,770
Queen, did you come out for some fresh air?

118
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,000
What brings you all the way here?

119
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,420
You see, my son— I mean, Grand Prince has

120
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,400
taken a woman in as his subordinate.

121
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,970
So, I came out to take a peek.

122
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,160
A woman?

123
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,660
Yes.

124
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,850
Grand Prince has never taken in a woman as his subordinate.

125
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:17,520
So, as his mother, I feel she is not just an ordinary subordinate.

126
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,960
Grand Prince always travels this way.

127
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,980
He is here. He is here!

128
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,010
S-She is Consort Hyo, right?

129
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,500
Wait! Is it Yeon Wol?

130
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,120
She is really something else.

131
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,010
She switched to Yoong right after finding out the queen became pregnant, huh?

132
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,010
That wicked wench, I will go and—

133
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,580
Why did you stop?

134
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,610
I have not seen Yoong with

135
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,050
such a gentle face in a long time.

136
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,230
I saw it last when he was about eight or nine.

137
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,880
I will get going.

138
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,940
Let us go.

139
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,540
Stay here.

140
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,590
Did you crawl back here to become Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's concubine this time?

141
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,540
You also know me quite well now, Your Majesty.

142
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,660
That I am not such a person.

143
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,540
Did His Majesty...

144
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,510
really pass away?

145
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,350
Is that true?

146
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,940
It seems so.

147
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,930
Your Majesty,

148
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,370
once you obtain the greatest power in Asatae,

149
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,550
what will you do after?

150
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,520
Is that...

151
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,780
the happiness you sincerely wish for?

152
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,650
If it is after betraying the person you are truly affectionate for,

153
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,180
what meaning would all that wealth and power have?

154
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,770
Arrogant wench.

155
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,640
How dare you lecture me?

156
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,580
Your Majesty,

157
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,420
I intend to go on the path I sincerely want.

158
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,990
I would like you to do the same.

159
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,250
The baby in your womb would also want you to do the same.

160
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,600
All right.

161
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,600
Bring it on.

162
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,450
I will endure it.

163
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,090
I will bear you down.

164
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,980
What an occasion to have my son ask his mother to make him an item of clothing.

165
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,660
You are so handsome that you would still shine even in rags.

166
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,730
Because it is an important night where Asatae's history will be altered.

167
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,420
An important night?

168
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,400
Mother, you are now the Royal Family's Queen Dowager.

169
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,730
That means,

170
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,920
you finally...

171
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,840
Not so fast.

172
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,840
The bigger the joy, I have to be more careful.

173
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:16,590
Congratulations on becoming the emperor of Asatae, Your Majesty.

174
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,380
I am so proud, Yoong.

175
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,300
Please let go.

176
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,190
Also, I am quite okay with that girl, Yeon Wol.

177
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,540
So what if she was once His Majesty's concubine?

178
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,190
I was once your father's wife as well—

179
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,570
Mother.

180
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,950
Anyhow,

181
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,030
I am happy you are becoming the king.

182
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,130
But I also want to see my son marry a pretty wife

183
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,900
and live happily with his sons and daughters.

184
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,320
I am going.

185
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,430
Always be careful. Okay?

186
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,390
Do not be too greedy—

187
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,640
The king?

188
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,680
Is it such an easy thing to become?

189
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,000
You are dressed up quite well.

190
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,740
It is a joyous day, is it not?

191
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,050
And you skip the honorifics, too.

192
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,420
Well, you are not Sajo Hyeon.

193
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,550
I won't be the king anymore, I guess.

194
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,670
Let us get it over with.

195
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,790
As I thought, you must have no interest in the throne.

196
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:56,490
I mean, everyone has a position and class they belong to and deserve.

197
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,030
That seat must be burdensome for you.

198
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,870
Wait.

199
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,610
By the way,

200
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,260
I do not think Kyera will follow me.

201
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,160
Even yesterday, I almost got stabbed by Kyera at the Hall of Spirits.

202
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:34,140
Ak Hee, our deal was for me to help you get rid of Sajo Hyeon.

203
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,290
Changing Kyera's heart was not a part of it.

204
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,250
That is not up to me.

205
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,780
I know it is not up to you.

206
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,280
But you should not cut in.

207
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,740
I heard Kyera became your subordinate.

208
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,550
It is a waste to let go of a soldier like Kyera.

209
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,150
She will become a great general after much polishing.

210
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,090
Really?

211
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,500
In that case,

212
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,210
I should reconsider this.

213
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,950
No matter how much I think about this, it is a losing deal for me.

214
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,750
 I have a request. 

215
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,590
 Ak Hee will only pass the crown after checking your intention. 

216
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:41,550
 Are you telling me to act as if I will be leaving with Ak Hee as he wants? 

217
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,940
 That is right. 

218
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,720
 It is not difficult to do. 

219
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,600
 I will leave far away with Ak Hee. 

220
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,710
 You said you would not leave with Ak Hee yesterday. 

221
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,920
 I will leave with him and... 

222
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,540
 kill Ak Hee. 

223
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,550
Let her in!

224
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,070
Kyera.

225
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,430
Kyera, did you make up your mind?

226
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,490
I will leave far away with Sir Ak Hee.

227
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,890
Wait, r-really?

228
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,450
But why? I am not Sajo Hyeon, though.

229
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,520
Grand Prince promised to pardon all the people who were locked up.

230
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,790
You are going to leave after confirming their release?

231
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,670
Sir Ak Hee, trust me.

232
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,840
I have nowhere to go anymore.

233
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,630
Kyera.

234
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,620
Does that put you at ease now?

235
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,320
You are going to keep your promise. Right?

236
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,590
This must not be a dream.

237
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,080
This cannot be.

238
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,610
Congratulations on becoming Asatae's emperor, Your Majesty.

239
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,240
Thank you. Thank you, Ak Hee.

240
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Hear ye! Are you there, Ki Chool?

241
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,630
Proceed with the crowning ceremony right away.

242
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,610
Right now!

243
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,380
 Is it not too late of an hour to proceed with the crowning ceremony? 

244
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,360
Head Minister?

245
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:24,150
What despicable plot are you scheming here?

246
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,280
Head Minister, h-how did you know?

247
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,680
You heinous evil spirit.

248
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,720
Sajo Yoong.

249
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:42,170
Do you truly qualify to become the emperor of this country?

250
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,540
You are merely the son of a gambler named Pal Cheon.

251
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,200
Hear ye!

252
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,540
I was wondering where Pal Cheon that man was.

253
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,320
You had him hidden away, Head Minister, huh?

254
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:11,360
Pal Cheon, are you really the biological father of Grand Prince Sajo Yoong?

255
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,020
That is correct.

256
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,100
Grand Prince, is it true?

257
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,200
Even if he is my biological father, what does it matter now?

258
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,040
I am now this country's emperor.

259
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,800
However, if your crime of murdering the late king is revealed,

260
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,640
all of this will go down the drain.

261
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,990
Pal Cheon, on the night before the late king was murdered,

262
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,340
Sajo Yoong stayed at your place. Right?

263
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,010
What?

264
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,320
O-Oh, yes.

265
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,180
S-Since I lived near the palace, he said it was...

266
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,580
easy to sneak into the palace at any time.

267
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,850
Grand Prince,

268
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,760
you were not away on a hunt at the time, huh?

269
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,670
Head Minister,

270
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:22,330
did you torture that man just to fabricate this false testimony?

271
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,000
There is more substantial evidence.

272
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,630
Come in!

273
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,110
Ki Chool.

274
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,910
On the night the late king was murdered,

275
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,520
you said you escorted Grand Prince.

276
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,070
Not from the hunting grounds on Mt. Baekhwa,

277
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:56,080
but from this man's house and to the late king's bed chamber.

278
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,820
You wretch! What nonsense are you trying to claim?

279
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,030
Whoa, Head Minister.

280
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:07,380
Have you been digging into these unbelievable facts?

281
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,010
Answer me.

282
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,200
On the day the late king passed away,

283
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,340
I escorted Grand Prince Sajo Yoong...

284
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,870
and was at the hunting grounds of Mt. Baekhwa.

285
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,410
Ki Chool!

286
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,820
You tried to buy my man

287
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,790
with a meager house deed like this?

288
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,050
You will make him Minister of General Affairs?

289
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,330
By what means, huh?

290
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,400
You are only a rebel, so how will you do that?

291
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,270
Hear ye. Imprison Jin Mu Dal and Pal Cheon, who dared to slander and

292
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,990
plot treason against the emperor right away!

293
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,050
 Yes! 

294
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,230
Y-Yoong, am I going to die?

295
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,110
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

296
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,790
- Your Majesty! 
 - Ki Chool!

297
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,640
How dare you deceive me!

298
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,920
Y-You heinous lot!

299
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,600
Sajo Yoong, you bastard—

300
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,920
You bastard!

301
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,610
Sajo Yoong!

302
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,980
I will not let you be!

303
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,390
Sajo Yoong!

304
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,530
Congratulations on becoming Asatae's emperor, Your Majesty!

305
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,930
 Congratulations, Your Majesty! 

306
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,240
All hail His Majesty Sajo Yoong!

307
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,830
 All hail His Majesty Sajo Yoong! 

308
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,870
All hail His Majesty Sajo Yoong!

309
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,450
 All hail His Majesty Sajo Yoong! 

310
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,450
All hail His Majesty Sajo Yoong!

311
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,980
 All hail His Majesty Sajo Yoong! 

312
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,500
All hail His Majesty Sajo Yoong!

313
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,640
This is treason; a rebellion!

314
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,320
Where did everyone go?

315
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,230
Hear ye!

316
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,590
It is treason!

317
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,900
 No, you cannot! 

318
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,070
How dare you come in here!

319
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,210
Hear ye! Is no one out there?

320
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,120
Jin Chae Ryeon, His Majesty has ordered you to be locked up right away.

321
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,190
How impertinent, you wretch. What royal order?

322
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,570
There is no way.

323
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,310
I will meet His Majesty right now, so get lost.

324
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:53,020
You will meet His Majesty Sajo Yoong at the interrogation grounds.

325
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,140
Sajo Yoong?

326
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,390
Having an affair with a lowly one as the queen and

327
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,760
mocking the Royal Court by acting like you bore the king's child.

328
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
It will be hard to avoid death by poison.

329
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
What are you going on about?

330
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,090
What are you all doing? Hurry up and take this wench away!

331
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,730
Yes!

332
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,880
Let go.

333
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,230
Let go of me!

334
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,280
Do you know who I am?

335
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,410
Let go!

336
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,220
So, this is how it ended up,

337
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,550
just as I expected.

338
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,590
The queen will be locked up by now as well.

339
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,310
Please keep a lookout.

340
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,130
Yes.

341
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,530
Do you think we overdid it?

342
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,900
Perhaps.

343
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,510
However, this was the best way, no matter how many times I thought about it.

344
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,820
Head Minister Jin Mu Dal's approach to Sajo Yoong was wrong.

345
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,930
Because Sajo Yoong would have prepared all the countermeasures already.

346
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,420
We need to use a cunning trap on Sajo Yoong.

347
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,790
So that he will confess the truth on his own accord,

348
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,100
not by someone else's scheme or by force.

349
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,320
I was a bit scared earlier.

350
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,400
Though I was acting like I was Ak Hee,

351
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,840
you were looking at me too coldly.

352
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,450
What about now?

353
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,550
Right now,

354
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,260
you are my Yeon Wol.

355
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,060
 Sorry. 

356
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,050
 Do not stab His Majesty. 

357
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,940
 No! 

358
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,420
 I am sorry. 

359
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,580
 What is this? Why are you not dying? 

360
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,730
 Ak Hee, are you dead? 

361
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,850
 Ak Hee! 

362
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,890
 Ak Hee, please wake up! 

363
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,040
 Wake up! Wake up! 

364
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,810
 What did you do to His Majesty? 

365
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,350
 What did you do? 

366
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,540
 What did you do? 

367
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,580
 I am sorry, 

368
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,320
 Kyera. 

369
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,330
 Are you okay? 

370
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,590
 Your Majesty. 

371
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,570
 Yeon Wol. 

372
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,080
 Your Majesty, it is you. Right? 

373
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,090
 Are you Yeon Wol? 

374
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,320
Ak Hee keeps attacking you?

375
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,960
Yes, I think he is trying to force his way out.

376
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,760
What do we do?

377
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,340
However, he is not as strong as he used to be.

378
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,780
It is endurable.

379
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,730
Ak Hee must really be weakening.

380
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,800
This punk knows he will become weaker, but he keeps trying to break out.

381
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,590
 Hey, Sajo Hyeon. 

382
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,270
Your Majesty.

383
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,020
I am okay.

384
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,710
I can endure it.

385
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,580
I am going to bear him down.

386
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,700
Sajo Hyeon, you bastard.

387
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,570
You read all of my memories and

388
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,460
being stabbed with the blade does not affect you.

389
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,640
Why is he unharmed?

390
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,830
Why? Why?

391
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,990
Why, you ask?

392
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,030
Cheong Ta.

393
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,070
Cheong Ta!

394
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,270
Of course, Sajo Hyeon is unharmed.

395
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:15,300
Because Sajo Hyeon is a living human being.

396
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,680
And you said you were going to do geuminsal on Sajo Hyeon?

397
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,850
What a bastard.

398
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,790
Alas, you are such a fool.

399
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,280
That would work in the outside world.

400
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:36,530
Therefore, stabbing Sajo Hyeon here would not work, even if you stabbed him all day.

401
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,410
It works on me in here and outside,

402
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,320
but not on Sajo Hyeon here?

403
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,050
How could that be?

404
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,670
How could that be?

405
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,690
What do you mean?

406
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,900
It is what it is.

407
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,260
It is because you are a parasitic being. An evil spirit.

408
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,790
Sajo Hyeon is the owner of this body.

409
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,490
And you are fated to disappear.

410
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,920
I do not want to disappear.

411
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,330
I do not want to lose Kyera!

412
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,970
I do not want to be defeated by Sajo Hyeon!

413
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,840
My, what an evil spirit.

414
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,710
Your greed is still the same when you are dying.

415
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,930
Yes, burn them even more.

416
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:25,810
Greed will be your only salvation.

417
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,130
Cheong Ta!

418
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,740
Just kill me.

419
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,730
Strike my neck!

420
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,090
His Majesty ordered not to kill you.

421
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:50,670
He said to keep you alive for a long time and let you experience all kinds of pain this world can offer.

422
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,570
Ki Chool, you bastard.

423
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:59,430
Did my offer not make your heart waver even a bit?

424
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,600
Jin Mu Dal...

425
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,920
You cannot think of us as scum like you.

426
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,450
Our convictions are as hard as a rock.

427
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,870
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is our sky.

428
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,370
His Majesty Sajo Yoong is...

429
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,760
our...

430
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,380
god.

431
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,160
Welcome, Grand Prince.

432
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,500
It would be okay to address you like that for now. Right?

433
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,790
Of course.

434
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,320
The official crowning ceremony is tomorrow.

435
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,380
You are so magnanimous.

436
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,550
I felt bittersweet when I thought about leaving this place.

437
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,700
I wanted to have a farewell drink with you.

438
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,610
Sounds great.

439
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,850
I am also thankful to you

440
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,870
for letting me leave with Kyera.

441
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,420
I wish you a happy life with Kyera and good fortune.

442
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,530
And it will be so.

443
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,520
Boy, this feels like a dream.

444
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,410
 Stupid evil spirit. 

445
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,770
Welcome.

446
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,440
Kyera said she wants to say her farewells to you as well.

447
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,310
Farewells? Is it not too early?

448
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,410
My crowning ceremony is yet to happen.

449
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,390
I will leave at dawn.

450
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,840
If the court officials find out, they will have lots to say about it.

451
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,770
So it would be better to leave early at dawn.

452
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,350
That is true.

453
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,240
Grand Prince.

454
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,170
There is something I could not tell you yet.

455
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,440
What is it?

456
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,380
Thank you for avenging my family in my place.

457
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,560
Avenge your family?

458
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,380
With Sajo Hyeon gone,

459
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,290
there is nothing we cannot talk about by ourselves.

460
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:28,980
You meant you are thankful he got rid of Sajo Seung. Right?

461
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,480
I have no idea what you are talking about.

462
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,300
If you think about it, you and I are so much alike, Grand Prince.

463
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,950
You are an exceptionally talented man,

464
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,700
yet could not be recognized because of Sajo Hyeon. Goodness.

465
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,700
 I will pierce your forehead next time if you mock my son again. 

466
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,910
 You mean, you actually believed that? 

467
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:02,510
 How could you not know I was only trying to provoke my son? 

468
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,510
 You are not even my real son. 

469
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,750
It is too bad I could not kill Sajo Seung with my own hands.

470
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:25,340
But I could never repay you for having done it in my place.

471
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,070
Thank you.

472
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,840
Goodness, Sajo Seung was too much.

473
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,110
He should have made his competent oldest son the crown prince in the first place.

474
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,010
Then, he would not have ended up that way.

475
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,100
He made the Grand Prince do all the dirty work

476
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,520
and kept using him whenever he could.

477
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,580
Yet he considered assassinating the Grand Prince behind his back.

478
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,750
Kill me?

479
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,820
Yes, I heard it in person while treating Sajo Seung

480
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,180
as he asked me to help Crown Prince Sajo Hyeon.

481
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:02,230
I should have shredded that old man to pieces.

482
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,840
I should not have built him a grave.

483
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,280
I should not have paid my respects as the late king.

484
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,280
I was being respectful by killing him instantly without pain with a poison needle,

485
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,090
but I should not have.

486
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:18,870
I should have made him suffer endlessly and tear him apart.

487
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,160
But still,

488
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:30,170
you made a great achievement.

489
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,600
It will remain in Asatae's history for a long time.

490
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,540
Your grace is boundless, Your Majesty.

491
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,340
That is right.

492
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,490
I achieved great success.

493
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:49,330
Because I got rid of that greedy old man with this hand.

494
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,670
Who could dare to do such a thing?

495
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,990
You are right.

496
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,550
Did everyone hear that?

497
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,840
Why is no one answering?

498
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,850
Did everyone hear him clearly?

499
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,780
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

500
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:26,160
We all clearly heard Grand Prince Sajo Yoong

501
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,310
confess that he murdered the late king!

502
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,380
W-What is this?

503
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,790
Kyera.

504
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,600
You evil spirit, you dared to trick me?

505
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,020
No, it is not the truth.

506
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,340
This evil spirit has mocked me.

507
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,550
This evil spirit has mocked me!

508
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,370
Minister of General Affairs,

509
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:56,580
imprison the criminal Sajo Yoong, who murdered the late king right away!

510
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,030
Yes, Your Majesty!

511
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,190
What are you all doing?

512
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,930
Ki Chool!

513
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,420
Where are you, Ki Chool?

514
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,780
All of your subordinates were imprisoned!

515
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,720
You wicked, evil spirit.

516
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,370
I will not let you be!

517
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,730
How impertinent!

518
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,750
How dare you speak that way to His Majesty!

519
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,440
- Hurry up and take him away! 
  - Yes! 

520
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,020
How dare you!

521
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,040
You already allowed the passing of the crown!

522
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,230
What right do you have to imprison me?

523
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,980
Hold on.

524
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,980
Are you talking about this?

525
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,210
What use is a piece of paper like this?

526
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,420
The seal stamped on here is fake and...

527
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,100
you are also a fake.

528
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,630
You evil spirit.

529
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,900
Let go. Let go!

530
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,970
I am the king of Asatae!

531
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,890
I am the sovereign emperor!

532
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,540
The evil spirit is framing me!

533
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:08,320
 Let go! Let go! Let go! 

534
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,000
- Move along! 
  - Your Majesty! Grand Prince! 

535
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,420
Do not worry!

536
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,110
Sajo Yoong's era will soon come.

537
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:25,000
- Trust me! 
 - Get in!

538
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,520
Hear ye. Do you know who is sitting in the Royal Council Hall?

539
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,540
He is the evil spirit, not Sajo Hyeon.

540
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,670
He is the evil spirit, you hear?

541
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,430
You scoundrels! If you do not release me right now,

542
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:47,540
all of you will be executed!

543
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,330
Be quiet.

544
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,410
Head Minister.

545
00:45:58,450 --> 00:45:59,590
Head Minister.

546
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,080
Head Minister. Head Minister.

547
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,640
The one sitting in the Royal Council Hall is not Sajo Hyeon.

548
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,170
He is the evil spirit.

549
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,450
Head Minister, how much of your secret army can you utilize?

550
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,900
We will join forces and—

551
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,250
Your Majesty, I have one more daughter.

552
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:26,160
She is very clever and a beauty.

553
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,240
Forget about the queen who had an affair with a military officer and

554
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,540
take that child in as your new queen.

555
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,950
I, Head Minister Jin Mu Dal, will take charge and

556
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:42,840
make sure everything goes well smoothly.

557
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:48,020
Goodness, you are going to take her in as your queen?

558
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,950
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

559
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:03,770
 Officer Ji, I need you to go quite far this time for an errand. 

560
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,520
When you get there, you will see my acquaintance.

561
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,040
Take that person to a safe place and take good care of her.

562
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,870
Your Majesty.

563
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,820
Officer Ji.

564
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,970
Your Majesty.

565
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,200
How did you know I was here?

566
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,050
His Majesty informed me.

567
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,770
He told me to...

568
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,160
take good care of you.

569
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,500
- Ak Hee did? 
 - That man is...

570
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,890
His Majesty...

571
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,100
Lady Chae Ryeon.

572
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,010
J-Ji Jeon Seo!

573
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,850
It was a long night.

574
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,520
Your Majesty, are you okay?

575
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,000
I-I am okay.

576
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,550
I got tired and let my guard down for a moment.

577
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,960
And Ak Hee attacked.

578
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,050
This keeps happening.

579
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:29,610
You cannot even sleep.

580
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,420
I am fine.

581
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,490
I am going to endure.

582
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,300
I will endure.

583
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,300
Sajo Hyeon.

584
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,340
You are going to endure with your mental power?

585
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,900
Let us see who wins.

586
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,780
I swear I will break through you.

587
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,940
 Now, 

588
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,670
 you only have one choice. 

589
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:22,440
 Wait for Sajo Hyen's mental power to loosen and 

590
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,490
 break out of this place. 

591
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,650
 After breaking out, 

592
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:32,400
 bring Yeon Wol to this place and do not let her go. 

593
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,610
 You will live with her here forever. 

594
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,780
Gosh, what a wretch.

595
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,810
 Those who helped Sajo Yoong and plotted treason 

596
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:56,290
 will be exiled or sentenced to forced labor, depending on their contributions. 

597
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:00,150
 Sajo Yoong, who murdered the late king and led the treason, 

598
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:03,480
 and his 25 closest subordinates 

599
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,720
 will be sentenced to decapitation. 

600
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,560
Yoong! Yoong!

601
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,310
Yoong! Yoong!

602
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,820
You bastards, I will die with him.

603
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,710
Take me with him!

604
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:19,060
Yoong!

605
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,330
Yoong!

606
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:28,280
 - Yoong!  
 - Please bring me Kyera.

607
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,130
I have something to tell her personally.

608
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:35,760
Tell Kyera her mother is alive!

609
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:43,580
I want to...

610
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,600
finally atone for my sins before I die.

611
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:03,500
 Hurry up and go. 

612
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,360
 My daughter. 

613
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,580
 Mother. 

614
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:11,310
 I was devastated I could not even find your corpse. 

615
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,400
 Your Majesty! 

616
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,010
Your Majesty.

617
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,220
Physician Yeon is going to Sajo Yoong?

618
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

619
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,400
Move aside!

620
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,520
Please make way. Move aside now.

621
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:31,970
What do you mean by that? How do you know where my mother is?

622
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,150
Are you saying my mother was alive?

623
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:38,180
Yes, Madam Eun Mi So...

624
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,570
is still alive.

625
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,780
I have been taking care of her all this time.

626
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,940
I had to tell you before I die.

627
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,820
Mother...

628
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,740
Where?

629
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,010
Where is she?

630
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,570
Come closer.

631
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:09,240
- It is dangerous. 
 - Hurry up and say it!

632
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,010
Hurry.

633
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:21,050
If you cannot trust me,

634
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:24,340
I will deliver the message through my mother.

635
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,090
Yoong.

636
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,030
Yoong.

637
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,200
Tell Consort Cheong Myeong right now.

638
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,960
Hurry up and speak!

639
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,990
Yoong.

640
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:50,220
Consort Cheong Myeong, what did Sajo Yoong say?

641
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,530
What did he say?

642
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,420
Where did he say my mother is?

643
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,610
Your mother is...

644
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,690
Physician Yeon, you cannot!

645
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,380
I cannot leave alone.

646
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:30,000
I must take your most precious woman with me.

647
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,290
Your mother is...

648
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,270
 I have a poison needle hidden in my collar. 

649
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:48,590
 Hide it in your mouth and shoot it at Kyera. 

650
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,570
Physician Yeon, step back!

651
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,360
Yeon Wol!

652
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,170
Yeon Wol!

653
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,910
Yeon Wol!

654
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,080
Yeon Wol! Yeon Wol! Yeon Wol!

655
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,340
Yeon Wol! Yeon Wol!

656
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,720
Sajo Hyeon let his guard down.

657
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,780
The time is now.

658
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:08,110
Yoong...

659
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:14,080
I am sorry I could not birth you into...

660
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,880
a more noble bloodline.

661
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,100
I am the king.

662
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,800
The eternal king...

663
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,260
of Asatae.

664
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,830
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

665
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:55,140
Stand around His Majesty!

666
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:57,670
Your Majesty!

667
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,760
Kyera—

668
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,430
Kyera.

669
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,080
Kyera.

670
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,280
Kyera.

671
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,310
Kyera!

672
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,990
Ak Hee!

673
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,660
Yeon Wol. Yeon Wol!

674
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,670
Ak Hee, what are you doing?

675
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,280
Yeon Wol will die at this rate!

676
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,230
Yeon Wol has to be taken outside and treated!

677
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:09,670
Ak Hee!

678
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:13,580
I will not let you take Kyera.

679
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,530
We are going to live here together for eternity.

680
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:22,150
Do you know why it pains you when you embrace Yeon Wol?

681
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,900
It is because you are a monster born from greed.

682
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,620
Let her go, Ak Hee.

683
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,260
That is not love!

684
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,590
I will not do that!

685
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:37,400
I would rather burn to death in pain than lose Kyera.

686
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,630
You poor thing.

687
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,520
How unfortunate.

688
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,860
Sure.

689
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,850
Let us disappear together like this.

690
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,950
If it means His Majesty will be at ease...

691
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,590
after you disappear, Sir Ak Hee...

692
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,960
you can take me with you.

693
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:25,580
I am...

694
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,310
okay.

695
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,660
Yeon Wol. Yeon Wol!

696
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,120
I wanted to be loved by Kyera.

697
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,520
I wanted to prove that I was better than Sajo Hyeon.

698
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,830
I thought I could defeat Sajo Hyeon.

699
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,630
No.

700
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,220
Greed cannot...

701
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:05,790
win against...

702
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,570
goodness.

703
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,620
Kyera.

704
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,640
Kyera!

705
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,910
Kyera? Kyera!

706
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,560
Kyera!

707
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,820
Yeon Wol. Yeon Wol!

708
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:34,690
Ak Hee, take this down!

709
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:37,230
Ak Hee!

710
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,840
Let go of Yeon Wol.

711
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,820
Hand over Yeon Wol!

712
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,100
I have taken over your mind.

713
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,790
You were stronger than I was,

714
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:03,030
but I overcame you.

715
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,480
I can control you now.

716
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,520
Because...

717
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,390
you are...

718
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:16,250
 Die! Just die! 

719
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,740
 You evil spirit! 

720
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,730
 Go away— 

721
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,190
Because you were me.

722
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:25,880
Because you are only an illusion created from my fear.

723
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,500
I do not fear you anymore.

724
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,060
I do not fear anything because

725
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,760
I have...

726
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,990
because I have become as hard as a mountain.

727
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,260
Get lost, Ak Hee.

728
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,320
Be gone.

729
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,910
Be gone!

730
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,360
Yeon Wol!

731
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,220
Yeon Wol.

732
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,520
Yeon Wol.

733
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:35,380
Your Majesty.

734
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,170
Yeon Wol.

735
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:53,890
 All hail His Majesty! 

736
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,840
 All hail Her Majesty! 

737
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:31,580
♫  The feelings seeped through the hidden opening  ♫

738
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:39,370
♫  Closing up and withering away, the sad memory  ♫

739
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:43,470
 Kyera is beautiful. Right? 

740
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:46,030
 She is beautiful. 

741
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,240
 How beautiful? 

742
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:53,060
 Well, as much as a myrtle crepe flower and starlight. 

743
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:55,190
 No, never mind. 

744
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,000
 There is no comparison. 

745
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,070
 I knew it. 

746
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,590
 She is incomparable. 

747
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,900
 Because you must love her more than anything in this world. 

748
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,700
 Be happy with Kyera, Sajo Hyeon. 

749
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,000
 That is all... 

750
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,900
 I really... 

751
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,400
 wish for. 

752
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:35,070
I love you, Yeon Wol...

753
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,290
without a limit...

754
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,510
endlessly.

755
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,510
I love you...

756
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,100
unmeasurably and forever.

757
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,010
 By the way, would there be another person possessed by an evil spirit? 

758
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,820
Of course, there is.

759
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,820
They are everywhere.

760
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:15,270
Because this world is full of people who are hurt.

761
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:21,690
All right, let us go make another big fortune again!

762
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,390
 All right, let us go! 

763
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:24,750
 To find my love! 

764
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,320
My goodness!

765
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,980
 My love, I am here!
