Me?

Oh, I apologize. Are you okay?

12
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,680
Yes.

13
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,680
Are you in pain at all?

14
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,760
Oh, well...

15
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,910
I probably should not say

16
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,450
I do not remember anything.

17
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,860
How can I trust these people?

18
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,530
Oh, right.

19
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,230
Take your leave, everyone.

20
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,410
My goodness.

21
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,680
Are you uncomfortable?

22
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,250
No.

23
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,320
I missed you so much.

24
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,820
I just want to keep looking at you.

25
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,990
Well, so did we know each other from-

26
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,580
Whoa, you do not remember?

27
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,170
You know you will be violated by the king disgracefully tonight and be thrown away.

28
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,580
My comrades are waiting outside.

29
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,670
They will help you.

30
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,750
Hurry up and escape.

31
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,630
When I saw you at the drapery,

32
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,930
you had some kind of an aura.

33
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,080
This thing.

34
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,200
And this thing does not fit.

35
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,490
You seem fake for some reason.

36
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,740
You will realize I am real.

37
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,040
You will end up liking me.

38
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,980
What in the world.

39
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,200
What are you doing right now?

40
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,860
- You did not even come to my birthday banquet. Move aside!
- Your Majesty.

41
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,360
Please allow me a moment.

42
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,510
For what?

43
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,170
I want to take the dancer

44
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,020
you chose tonight, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,040
What did you say?

46
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,940
I know it is not my place, and impolite.

47
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,560
However, my heart moved for that dancer.

48
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,610
This is my first time feeling this,

49
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,000
so I am gathering the courage to ask you.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,600
You are...

51
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,900
You really...

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,870
You finally became a man!

53
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,590
For you to dissuade me like this, unable to hide your lust as a man...

54
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,690
you finally became suitable to be my son.

55
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,650
I apologize.

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,250
Sure thing. I have plenty of women for myself.

57
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,280
You are to take that dancer tonight.

58
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,420
Hyun, I would be so happy if you would always be this manly.

59
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,910
All right. This is...

60
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,920
This is how you should have been from the start!

61
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,990
Sajo Seung, I have been waiting for this day.

62
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,170
I will take your life today according to the heavens' order!

63
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,890
You are...

64
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,170
You are not fit to be an assassin.

65
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,270
Your scent is too strong.

66
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,750
Kyera.

67
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,960
Oh, my name is Kyera-

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,070
Do you actually know?

69
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,900
That I lost my...

70
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,540
How do you know?

71
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,340
You said I was lying unconscious the whole time.

72
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,390
I did not say anything after waking up earlier.

73
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,230
O-Oh, you woke up for a short moment.

74
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,340
When I was tending to you alone,

75
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,250
that is when you told me.

76
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,020
O-Oh, is that so?

77
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,840
Let me ask you frankly, then.

78
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,460
Do we really know each other?

79
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,300
It is more than just knowing each other.

80
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,110
We are very close.

81
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,350
What did I used to do before?

82
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,540
What was my job?

83
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,890
You were a dancer.

84
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,010
A dancer? Like...

85
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,640
Like this...

86
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,720
Did you fall for me after seeing me dance?

87
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,680
We have liked each other for a while now.

88
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,410
Though I made you my concubine after you came to His Majesty's birthday banquet as a dancer.

89
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,070
That must mean I used to live outside the palace.

90
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,000
Where was it? What about my parents?

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,910
Gosh, I have so many questions.

92
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,520
How do I not remember a single thing?

93
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,700
I will tell you the details later.

94
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,090
Why?

95
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,920
I have my reasons. Let us end this talk here for now.

96
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,900
Will you trust me?

97
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,280
Thank you.

98
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,930
I will only let Hong Gun know about your memory loss.

99
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,360
She will be a great help by your side.

100
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,740
Yes.

101
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,860
I am sure of it. That Ak Hee-

102
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,720
Ak Hee must have put Her Highness Consort Hyo using sleeping incense.

103
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,620
If he used sleeping incense,

104
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,540
Ak Hee should have fallen asleep, too.

105
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,520
In my opinion...

106
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,030
Ji Jeon, we were played completely.

107
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,780
We thought he was the Crown Prince at His Majesty's birthday banquet.

108
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,750
We thought he was the Crown Prince on His Majesty's birthday banquet.

109
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,720
Aigoo!

110
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,980
The dancer woke up?

111
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,810
Is the Crown Prince aware as well?

112
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,170
The Crown Prince is with her right now.

113
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,830
Let us go to the dancer.

114
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,500
Your Highness, I heard the Crown Prince ordered absolutely no one

115
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,920
to enter Consort Hyo's pavilion.

116
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,420
Even me?

117
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,470
I apologize.

118
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,520
Crown Princess, Her Highness Consort Cheong Myeong has arrived.

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Crown Princess, I heard that dancer of a wench woke up!

120
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,790
Oh, is that so?

121
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,890
Please take a seat.

122
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,070
Right now, the Crown Prince is said to be

123
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,050
sticking right next to the dancer.

124
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,050
I came here in a hurry to console you since

125
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,920
I assumed you must be devastated.

126
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,220
Just how angry must you feel?

127
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,280
I understand your situation better than anyone.

128
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,880
What a rough first night she must have had with the Crown Prince

129
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,250
that she was lying in bed three days and nights.

130
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,970
The Crown Prince is just like His Majesty, too.

131
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,240
This is probably only the beginning.

132
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,010
They say a fool at 40 is a fool forever.

133
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,820
Just how many more concubines will he have from now on?

134
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,830
You are speaking out of your line.

135
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,730
Who are you calling a fool?

136
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,550
How can you say such disloyal things in front of me?

137
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,180
I mean, I was-

138
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,690
Why would I be devastated because of such a lowly thing?

139
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,590
When I am the Crown Prince's first wife.

140
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,770
First wife-

141
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,790
I am also the one who hosts the concubine installations.

142
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,220
Everything is up to me.

143
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,580
- Installation ceremony?
- Yes.

144
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,650
You have to go through the installation to become an official concubine.

145
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,720
When is the installation?

146
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,470
The Crown Princess will decide the date.

147
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,080
Gosh, the Crown Princess must feel horrible.

148
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,260
Why?

149
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,250
No wife would ever welcome a concubine.

150
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,410
I also do not like this situation.

151
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,510
Hong Gun, did I really willingly accept this situation?

152
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,680
In this situation where I am dressed beautifully

153
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,590
as a concubine and having my hair combed.

154
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,870
Did I really obediently walk into this room when

155
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,750
The Crown Prince told me to become his concubine?

156
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,130
I do not really know.

157
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,730
I was a palace maid in the royal kitchen and moved here only yesterday.

158
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,580
Oh, I see.

159
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,250
What? The concubine installation ceremony is in two days?

160
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,870
I ordered it to be done tomorrow since Consort Hyo woke up.

161
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,080
B-But it is in two days?

162
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,100
I deeply apologize, Crown Prince.

163
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,560
Tell the Crown Princess to have the concubine installation done tomorrow.

164
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,970
Wait, Your Highness, that is...

165
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,150
That is?

166
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:40,010
According to the Royal Customs, concubine installation is the Crown Princess' unique right.

167
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,250
If His Majesty finds out one day,

168
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,090
he might order everything to be canceled.

169
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,950
Right, that is true.

170
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,420
Gosh.

171
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,830
Crown Prince, I think you should sleep tonight.

172
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,910
Even so, we will make sure you can see the concubine installation-

173
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,380
Wake me up in time?

174
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,860
- Yes.
- Why, of course, Your Highness.

175
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,630
You have not slept in three days.

176
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,920
I am deeply worried your health might be harmed.

177
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,810
Aigoo, you are worried?

178
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,000
- Oh, yes, Your Highness.
- That is correct.

179
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,760
You two think I am a joke, right?

180
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,890
Your Highness, how can you say that?

181
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,500
After I fall asleep,

182
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,220
will you two really willingly wake me up?

183
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,500
T-That is a misunderstanding, Your Highness. Of course, we should wake you up.

184
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,770
Do not make me laugh. You two are on Sajo Hyun's side, not this Ak Hee.

185
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,760
You think I would not know?

186
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,950
Aigoo, y-you are not denying it, huh?

187
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,890
Huh?

188
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,940
Gosh.

189
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,560
I absolutely will not sleep.

190
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,680
I will see Consort Hyo's installation ceremony and her getting the official concubine appointment letter!

191
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,240
Then, I will get a good sleep. So, you two...

192
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,150
do not try anything funny, okay?

193
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,940
Your Highness...

194
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,140
The dancer woke up?

195
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,310
Mother, did you happen to see the dancer's face?

196
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,050
They were guarding her so tightly.

197
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,240
I heard no one saw her face except the Crown Prince and her court lady.

198
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,480
Gosh, I am sure the Crown Princess is also curious to death right now.

199
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,520
Yoong, you see, that Crown Princess was being an eyesore

200
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,700
and acting high and mighty in front of me.

201
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,670
She said she was the first wife, and I am not.

202
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,330
What is so great about being the first wife?

203
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,200
The first wife is not even here, so I am the one in power.

204
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,030
Are you saying the dancer chosen by the King became the Crown Prince's concubine?

205
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,200
I think that is what happened.

206
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,450
In that case, what happened to Kyera?

207
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,220
That is my question.

208
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,360
No one reported catching an assassin that night, either.

209
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,410
Grand Prince, I will have Wind Knife find Kyera inside the palace right now.

210
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,070
There is no more time to waste.

211
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,850
We cannot move hastily.

212
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,370
Grand Prince, Kyera might be in danger.

213
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,120
We do not know

214
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,090
if she is in danger or

215
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,710
if the danger is already over.

216
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,120
Are you saying...

217
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,160
Kyera might have lost her life already?

218
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,780
Even if that has happened,

219
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,830
it cannot be helped.

220
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,580
Your Highness, please have a good night!

221
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,210
I am pretty sure this is the palace.

222
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,610
But why do I not remember anything?

223
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,750
W-What in the world?

224
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,740
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

225
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,170
What is this?

226
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,730
Who are you?

227
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,530
Stop there!

228
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,180
Why are they going into the storage shed?

229
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,560
Very good at martial arts?

230
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,030
Was it a man?

231
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,250
It was a man.

232
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,360
Is it Kyera?

233
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,030
Something feels off about that storage shed.

234
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,020
Why am I so good at fighting?

235
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,170
And my hands are so rough, too.

236
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,590
Are dancers good fighters as well?

237
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,120
Once Sajo Hyun finds out,

238
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,670
he will kick out Consort Hyo right away.

239
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,770
No, no, no...

240
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,200
Crown Prince, did you call for me?

241
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,070
Your Highness, you are bleeding!

242
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,180
You were biting your lips this hard to not sleep?

243
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,860
I-I am fine.

244
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,780
Your Highness, please go to bed.

245
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,130
At this rate, if Your Highness' secret gets exposed-

246
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,420
Shut your mouth!

247
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,850
What if someone hears you?

248
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,340
I am sorry, Your Highness.

249
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,350
You came just in time.

250
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:35,810
Do not use sleeping incense and stuff to put me to sleep.

251
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,410
If I catch you doing that,

252
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,780
I will strike you right there and then.

253
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,620
Eunuch Neung, prepare the bath right now.

254
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,470
Make it extremely cold so my body will freeze!

255
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,620
So cold!

256
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,540
Your Highness, are you okay?

257
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,090
I am fine.

258
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,460
Put more ice in! More!

259
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,330
Y-Yes.

260
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,160
Eunuch Neung, did you call for me?

261
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,130
Yes, Ji Jeon.

262
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,820
You need to come with me

263
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,960
to Chung Ta.

264
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,990
Only Ak Hee is allowed to see Shaman Chung Ta alone.

265
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,220
What if he finds out?

266
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,560
That is not the problem right now.

267
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,240
That Ak Hee-

268
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,750
I mean, if Ak Hee keeps staying up like that,

269
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,770
our real Crown Prince's body will be in shambles.

270
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,390
On top of that,

271
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,820
what if the Crown Prince's dual personality gets exposed?

272
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,510
Will His Majesty let the Crown Prince be?

273
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,810
You said the Crown Prince grew another personality

274
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,250
right after His Majesty took the throne, right?

275
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:01,010
Aigoo, I was frightened out of my wits that day.

276
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,550
Crown Prince!

277
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,590
Aigoo, he is taking a nap, huh?

278
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,990
Eunuch Neung?

279
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,490
Crown Prince!

280
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,990
Guess what I brought.

281
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,820
Ta-da!

282
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,700
They are beautiful textiles.

283
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,510
You like them, right?

284
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,830
Stop bringing these things!

285
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,850
I throw them out, and there comes more.

286
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,950
I throw them out, and there comes more again!

287
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,290
I have endured more than I should.

288
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,670
But these things are really not for me.

289
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,490
Your Highness, what is the matter?

290
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,030
Your Highness, my foot.

291
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,310
My name is Ak Hee.

292
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:10,910
My name is not Sajo Hyun. It is Ak Hee!

293
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,140
So, because the Crown Prince took a nap that day...

294
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,710
Yes! No wonder. The young Crown Prince

295
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,020
never took naps, and that was why.

296
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,020
Because his personality changes when he sleeps.

297
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,980
He just happened to take a strong cold medicine that day.

298
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,570
Does that mean Ak Hee hid his presence from you until that day?

299
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,110
That is what I am saying! Ak Hee, that brat is

300
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,700
just so darn good at acting.

301
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,530
He fooled me, pretending to be the Crown Prince,

302
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,780
hiding his wicked temper as much as he can!

303
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,410
Gosh, how poor is our real Crown Prince?

304
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,130
He could not even tell me about it because he was too kind.

305
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,240
Looks like that is the place.

306
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,910
Oh, you are right. Let us go.

307
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,540
Ak Hee has not slept for four days?

308
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,710
Yes.

309
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,740
You should have put him to sleep. What were you two doing?

310
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,050
You should have used sleeping incense behind the folding screen or something.

311
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,660
He would fall asleep, then.

312
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,290
Well, the thing is, after he found out last time,

313
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,080
Ak Hee hid away all the sleeping incense.

314
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,670
You two are such hopeless people.

315
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,670
I cannot help.

316
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,660
Two personalities sharing one body is

317
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,190
a curse from the heavens above and

318
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,320
a judgment by the universe.

319
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,330
I cannot meddle with it.

320
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,510
Chung Ta, could you share some sleeping incense if you have some?

321
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,230
I do not have any. He took them all.

322
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,770
Is there no other way?

323
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,520
Well...

324
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,640
Take your leave now.

325
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,450
Chung Ta.

326
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,820
Please help us.

327
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,240
We cannot let the Crown Prince's health deteriorate like that.

328
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,460
I said for you to leave.

329
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,280
Chung Ta.

330
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,200
I beg of you.

331
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,020
Will you trust me?

332
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,780
She said she trusts me.

333
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,170
She said she will.

334
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,100
A fake is fake forever.

335
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,600
I am real now.

336
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,670
I am the real one you trust.

337
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,350
Ak Hee, hang in there.

338
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,060
Just for a bit.

339
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,470
This is too small of an amount.

340
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,770
I am not sure if it will work.

341
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,110
That cheap Chung Ta. He could have given more.

342
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,350
Please fall asleep.

343
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,620
Please fall asleep.

344
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,950
I cannot fall asleep.

345
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,570
I cannot.

346
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,910
Crown Prince, are you awake?

347
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,160
I am entering now.

348
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,310
Did I sleep in?

349
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,490
Yes, you were very tired.

350
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,720
It does not feel like I slept.

351
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,480
What did you do to me last night?

352
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,830
It does not feel like...

353
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,420
I-I...

354
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,270
I did not...

355
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,810
do anything.

356
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,250
Your Highness!

357
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,370
It was here, huh.

358
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,770
Eunuch Neung, prepare to leave.

359
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,110
Sorry?

360
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,770
To where?

361
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,390
The drapery.

362
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,150
I need to go and work.

363
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,740
Your Highness, you are back!

364
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,360
It is great to have you back, Your Highness!

365
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,280
Your Highness!

366
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,800
Eunuch Neung!

367
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,640
You wretched old fart.

368
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,090
You dare put me to sleep?

369
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,560
You!

370
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,660
Ak Hee did this so he would not fall asleep?

371
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,850
What were you two doing when he was doing this?

372
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,720
I deeply apologize, Your Highness.

373
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,280
I deeply apologize.

374
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,650
Wait.

375
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,930
Ak Hee lasted four days when he usually sleeps a lot?

376
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,370
What happened while I was gone?

377
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,110
Go on and tell me, Eunuch Neung and Ji Jeon Seo.

378
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,050
The thing is...

379
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,210
What did Ak Hee do this time?

380
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,190
W-Whoa.

381
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,220
Your Highness!

382
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,030
Is this why you told me to bring you my clothes?

383
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,360
So, you can wear a disguise and leave?

384
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,670
Hong Gun, please!

385
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,580
Please let me leave.

386
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,990
I cannot stay here as things are.

387
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,290
I must go outside and find out who I am.

388
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,930
Who could you ever be? You are Your Highness Consort Hyo!

389
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,950
Tomorrow is the installation ceremony. If you leave like this,

390
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,580
I will get at least 100 beatings, Your Highness.

391
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,740
- 100 beatings?
- Yes.

392
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,500
So please calm down for my sake, if anything, Your Higness, and-

393
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,780
In that case, come with me.

394
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,020
- Sorry?
- Come with me.

395
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,000
From what I saw, you only do hard work here, which is no good.

396
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,710
Come outside the palace with me.

397
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,760
Okay? Let us go.

398
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,320
Wait, n-no!

399
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,480
- Let us go.
- Your Highness, please do not do this!

400
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,640
Come on, come with me!

401
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,990
You are so strong!

402
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,490
My goodness, she is supposed to be the Crown Prince's concubine.

403
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,300
But with a lowly one...

404
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,370
Gosh, they are having a ball.

405
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,050
It is not her.

406
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,280
She is not the dancer from the birthday banquet.

407
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,600
That is not her.

408
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,000
- It is not...
- Crown Prince has arrived!

409
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,740
The Crown Prince has arrived!

410
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,050
- Hurry up, hurry up, and go inside.
- No!

411
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,940
This is for the better. I am going to tell him honestly and leave.

412
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,590
P-Please, you have to get changed-

413
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,360
Crown Prince, have you come?

414
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,500
- Are you the one?
- Sorry?

415
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,860
Yes, I am...

416
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,080
Did you dare to-

417
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,940
Come inside.

418
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,150
Everyone else, stay here.

419
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,950
Oh, this is...

420
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,780
I will explain.

421
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,210
What a taste.

422
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,480
Sorry?

423
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,140
Ak Hee has no eyes for women, as expected.

424
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,460
Oh, the reason why I dressed up like this is...

425
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,000
Crown Prince, I would like to leave-

426
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,440
- Who are you?
- Sorry?

427
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,620
What is your identity?

428
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,540
You already know-

429
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,920
That is what I want to know, too!

430
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,400
You did not tell me when I asked you all this time.

431
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,300
- You are a dancer?
- You said I am a dancer.

432
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,640
Why did you come in all the way here?

433
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,620
How did you seduce the Crown Prince and come inside the palace?

434
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,580
That is what I want to know, too.

435
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,430
You are married. Why on Earth would I-

436
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,140
Do you also not remember-

437
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,540
Are you mocking me right now?

438
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,210
Did you think I would be fooled if you acted ignorant like this?

439
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,300
What is the matter with you?

440
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,200
Looks like you will need to be locked up and tortured to open your mouth.

441
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,940
Eunuch Neung, are you there?

442
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,550
Fine, lock me up and give me beatings!

443
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:04,370
If it means my memories will be back, I would do anything, too!

444
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,490
Memories?

445
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,200
You know my memories were gone when I woke up after four days, but you do this to me?

446
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,130
You said it would be a secret among you, Hong Gun, and me.

447
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,900
So why are you doing this?

448
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,260
Is it Ak Hee's trickery?

449
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,350
By the way, Your Highness, let us say you lock me up in prison.

450
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,770
But what about your reputation?

451
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,080
What?

452
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,100
I heard there is a lot of controversy about me inside the palace.

453
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,340
Because you ignored the regulations of the Inner Court and

454
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,070
brought me to the concubine's pavilion here by force.

455
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:40,310
However, what will people say if you change your mind like this?

456
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:46,600
Would they not say it looks like the behavior of a madman?

457
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,320
A madman?

458
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,800
Did you also hear the rumors about me?

459
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,640
Rumors?

460
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,410
I never heard such things.

461
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,640
I was just taking your actions as an example-

462
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,110
Do you truly dare to mock me?

463
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,040
You even mentioned the madness to belittle me!

464
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,780
Eunuch Neung and Ji Jeon Seo, take this woman right now and-

465
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,230
Your Highness, this is bad!

466
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,510
H-His Majesty has called for you.

467
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,130
I heard he is extremely angry.

468
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,600
What is the reason?

469
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,120
I do not know, either.

470
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,690
Let us go.

471
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,620
He told you to come with Her Highness Consort Hyo.

472
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:41,760
So, you are saying that Ak Hee took the dancer His Majesty chose first?

473
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,050
Yes, Your Highness.

474
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,160
What a wretched evil spirit.

475
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,420
Your Highness.

476
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,160
One moment.

477
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,590
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,430
Mark my words.

479
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,020
Do not say a single thing in front of His Majesty.

480
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,730
What if His Majesty asks a question?

481
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,770
I will answer instead,

482
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,670
so do not even breathe and stay put as if you are dead.

483
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,080
Understood?

484
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,050
How can a alive person pretend to be dead?

485
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,000
His Majesty must have called for me because he is curious.

486
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,460
Why are you so talkative?

487
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,730
Do not be worried.

488
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,440
I will do well.

489
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,080
Ow, over there!

490
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,030
It hurts over here.

491
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,470
Your Majesty, are you in too much pain?

492
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,500
I will summon the physician right away-

493
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,130
It is fine! Even the physician cannot fix this.

494
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,800
This is why you should drink in moderation-

495
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,540
Crown Prince has arrived.

496
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,720
Tell him to come in!

497
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,370
Your Majesty, did you want to see me?

498
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,850
Sit down.

499
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,850
Crown Prince, what is the meaning of this?

500
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,860
Why did your concubine change?

501
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,790
Why did you take a different woman, not the one I chose?

502
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,750
I am asking why you did such a thing, fooling me and the Inner Court.

503
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,610
Have you lost your voice-

504
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,290
Your Majesty...

505
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,030
Hurry up and speak.

506
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,620
This woman is...

507
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,430
The thing is...

508
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,010
this woman is...

509
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,740
I deemed your actions were manly the last few days.

510
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,430
Have you returned to being a cowardly nerd?

511
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,940
Were you looking manly only because of your madness?

512
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,150
However, if you change your mind like this, what will people say?

513
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,400
Would they not say it looks like the behavior of a madman?

514
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,760
She was not my type.

515
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,920
What did you say?

516
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,780
The dancer you chose.

517
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,530
She was not my type.

518
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,710
Therefore, I took another dancer.

519
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,370
I spent a night with this woman and

520
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,640
I liked her, so I took her in as my concubine.

521
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,660
You liked her?

522
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,700
I wanted to have a picky acumen regarding women, just like you.

523
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,220
I reckoned you would generously

524
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,380
allow it even if you found out.

525
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,410
Because that is what a real man does.

526
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,130
Lift your head, Dancer.

527
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,480
Lift your head!

528
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,310
- Your Majesty-
- Yes.

529
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,920
Kyera!

530
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,820
Are you the woman who captivated the Crown Prince's heart?

531
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,410
Are your lips sealed?

532
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,530
- Your Majesty-
- I also...

533
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,780
was captivated by the Crown Prince.

534
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,510
What did you say?

535
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,810
You were captivated?

536
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,330
Yes.

537
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,850
Did the Crown Prince...

538
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,560
Did the Crown Prince really...

539
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,120
Did you really captivate that woman?

540
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,300
So, this means you captivated the woman you chose, huh?

541
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,030
That is right. That is what a future king should be like.

542
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:22,220
Including women, you need to know how to captivate all things in this world.

543
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,380
You need to know how to have things your way!

544
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,400
That is my son.

545
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,850
That is my heir.

546
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,360
Crown Princess, I will announce your arrival.

547
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,370
It is fine. I forgot something.

548
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,460
I told you to stay quiet.

549
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,130
What made you think it is safe to run your mouth?

550
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,110
He laughed.

551
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,200
It is fine since His Majesty laughed, right?

552
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,550
Laugh-

553
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,570
You were only lucky.

554
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,820
You almost lost your life back there.

555
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,190
I might have lost it even if I stayed silent

556
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,100
if I trusted my luck only.

557
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,870
I needed to do whatever I could in that situation instead of just trembling.

558
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,180
H-How dare you make an improper remark!

559
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,230
Aigoo...

560
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,140
I will find a way for you to leave the palace.

561
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,340
Keep that in mind and wait.

562
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,810
His Majesty let out a laugh?

563
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:06,400
Yes, it looks like he is quite happy with the dancer wench.

564
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,920
Is that so?

565
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,140
At this point, there would be no way to stop the concubine installation ceremony.

566
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,920
This is why you should have set the date far away. Why did you-

567
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,230
So that I look bold and confident.

568
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,470
The crown princess who has not an ounce of envy.

569
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,830
That is who I am, Geum Hwa.

570
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,410
Just wait and see.

571
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:33,690
The dancer wench will never make it to the concubine installation ceremony.

572
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,390
Chae Ryeon, could it be-

573
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,250
Do not worry, Father.

574
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:43,020
I will never get blood on my own hands.

575
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,320
He was crying and saying he missed me yesterday,

576
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,000
but today, he...

577
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,460
A change of heart already?

578
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,040
Oh, he has a want for nothing, huh?

579
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,330
You are the king's son, huh?

580
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,820
What did I even see in him to like him?

581
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,680
I think I saw him somewhere.

582
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:34,270
I deemed your actions were manly the last few days.

583
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,870
Have you returned to being a cowardly nerd?

584
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,870
Were you looking manly only because of your madness?

585
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,080
Ak Hee is a man and

586
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,150
I am a coward?

587
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,570
Correct. You are a coward, and I am a man.

588
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,150
Agree?

589
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,610
All right, do it by tomorrow, then. Take care.

590
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,850
No way.

591
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,000
This is a great idea, Your Highness.

592
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,810
When your mind is cluttered, there is nothing better than doing what you love.

593
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,580
I will be back soon. Make sure Consort Hyo-

594
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,480
Make sure the woman who is residing over there does not cause any trouble.

595
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,420
Yes, Your Highness.

596
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,530
Where is he going?

597
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,320
Have you all been doing well?

598
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,520
Is he that happy?

599
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,470
I got you, I got you!

600
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,250
You finally showed up.

601
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,900
Who are you?

602
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,610
Who am I?

603
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,400
Do you know me?

604
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,720
What now? Of course I do!

605
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,800
The woman who ran away after making a big hole here.

606
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,500
- I did?
- Forget it.

607
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,580
Do you know how much money I used to fill up this hole?

608
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,990
Give it.

609
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,880
Give me the repair cost!

610
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,390
The thing is, I do not have...

611
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:27,880
Owner, are you here?

612
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,200
Yes, Young- W-Wait here.

613
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,970
Young Master-

614
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,050
Hey, Young Lady! Hey!

615
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,340
My goodness.

616
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,790
Aigoo, aigoo.

617
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,510
- Have you come, Young Master?
- What is the matter?

618
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:46,440
The young lady who made the hole there was here.

619
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,490
- That woman did?
- Yes.

620
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,040
Where is she?

621
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,420
Sorry?

622
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,040
My money!

623
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,670
Gosh, my money.

624
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,170
What a shameless young lady.

625
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,920
She ran off not to pay the repair cost. My money...

626
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,320
- Ahjussi, Ahjussi!
- Geez!

627
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,540
Young Lady!

628
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,600
Oh, w-wait a moment.

629
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,710
Young Lady.

630
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:18,830
Give me my repair cost for the roof!

631
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,540
Ahjussi, you know who I am, right?

632
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,980
Who am I? I really have no memory.

633
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,910
Oh, you have no memory, huh?

634
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:33,240
In that case, you are saying you will not pay, right?

635
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,420
Follow me.

636
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,540
No, no, it is fine!

637
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,010
Your memories will be brought back if you spend a few days in prison.

638
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,080
Come here!

639
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,170
I swear it is true!

640
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,000
It is true. Please trust me!

641
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,340
- Owner!
- Young Master!

642
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,480
- I am not lying!
- Huh? My goodness!

643
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,960
I-I am sorry. I-

644
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,550
Consort Hyo-

645
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,060
What brings you here?

646
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,540
Thank you for paying the roof repair cost.

647
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,750
How did Ak Hee acquaint this dancer?

648
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,780
Right, so, Crown Prince, you-

649
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,080
You and I met at the drapery, huh?

650
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,830
You fell for me while making my clothes, right?

651
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:35,790
But that does not mean I would have fallen for you.

652
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:38,970
Since you came out on your own, you can return on your own, right?

653
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,960
Return? To the palace? Again?

654
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,040
Do you not want to go back?

655
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,370
Of course! The concubine's pavilion is so stifling!

656
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,610
I do not even know who I am.

657
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:52,170
And it looks like you do not know that much about me, either.

658
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:59,340
I would find out who I am if I just kept roaming around here, do you not think?

659
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,390
Ak Hee, it is your turn to be tricked.

660
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,860
Do as you please.

661
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,620
Really? I really do not have to go back-

662
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,820
So, you are saying you will abandon me here and go.

663
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,160
You were so happy I became your concubine.

664
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,570
Was he really that happy?

665
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,250
"Was he"?

666
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,060
Do you have another personality, Your Highness?

667
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,130
That would not be possible.

668
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,760
That is right. You lack nothing since you are the Crown Prince.

669
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,780
Okay, I will do that.

670
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,720
Since I already left the palace, I will remain here.

671
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,780
Goodbye now.

672
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,340
Hey...

673
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,530
This might be for the better.

674
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,290
How can he change like that overnight?

675
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,880
The dancer chosen by His Majesty did not come back?

676
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,450
Are you sure?

677
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:20,480
Yes, she is getting concubine classes right now since she was chosen by His Majesty, no?

678
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,700
Tell me everything you know about this person.

679
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:32,590
Oh, she was the only one from another dancing troupe, so we do not really know her.

680
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,080
The chosen dancer disappeared and

681
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,110
an unknown child became the concubine?

682
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,930
Excuse me, do you know me?

683
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,540
I do not know you.

684
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,480
Do you know me by any chance?

685
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,630
No, I am too busy for this. Go away.

686
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:56,120
D-Do you know me, by any chance?

687
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,450
No, no, I do not.

688
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,890
How is it that there is no one who knows me?

689
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,290
If I frequented the drapery,

690
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:09,400
I must have roamed around here, too.

691
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,690
Aigoo, my daughter!

692
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,150
Aigoo, how pretty.

693
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,710
My daughter, what do you want?

694
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,940
Father!

695
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,840
Aigoo, my daughter!

696
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,110
- Mother!
- Wol!

697
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:35,560
- Huh?
- What about this one?

698
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,490
You like this one more?

699
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,830
Why am I so sad?

700
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,500
I said I am not going!

701
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,930
Please help me-

702
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,410
You wench, stand up!

703
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:53,300
- I said I am not going.
- Shut up-

704
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,460
Run away right now!

705
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,620
Get her!

706
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,460
Who are you? You have a pretty enough face for replacement.

707
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,170
Let us go!

708
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,890
Your Highness.

709
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,280
Get her!

710
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,520
Those soldiers are probably everywhere by now.

711
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,600
I will be careful.

712
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,970
Crown Prince, you might get in trouble because of me,

713
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,970
so just tell His Majesty I ran away.

714
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,160
How thoughtful of you.

715
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:51,930
All right, then.

716
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:57,950
Where can you go when you are limping like that?

717
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:01,720
Well, there has to be a place where I can be.

718
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,800
Your court lady is unfortunate.

719
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,200
How will she endure 100 beatings?

720
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,370
Oh, is Hong Gun really getting 100 beatings?

721
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,980
She will also be exiled

722
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,250
to this place called Beolseob Island.

723
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,550
Your Highness!

724
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,830
The soldiers are everywhere in the market-

725
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,660
Your Highness Consort Hyo.

726
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,140
I will make way.

727
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:10,580
♫ The life hidden ♫

728
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,180
I will use you and get the better of Ak Hee.

729
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:20,030
I will have Hong Gun escape first and run away.

730
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:23,970
I cannot have her beaten and exiled because of me.

731
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:36,250
♫ The feelings seeped through the fallen leaves ♫

732
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,260
I am sorry.

733
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,610
My goodness.

734
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:55,110
♫ Fall more on this lotus tonight and shine on this night more ♫

735
00:57:55,110 --> 00:58:04,920
♫ The dawn is lingering around my ears quietly, making me sad ♫

736
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:14,120
♫ I set afloat my deep feelings onto the moon, folded neatly ♫

737
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:21,160
♫ The tears I swallowed will disappear when I die ♫

738
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,040
Why did I bother making this?

739
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:28,830
I know, right?

740
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,120
Hey, Sajo Hyun.

741
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,290
Are you pulling a trick on me?

742
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:05,780
Huh? Why bother bringing back my woman?

743
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,910
Because you like that woman. So, I need to pay her my respects, too.

744
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,400
How funny.

745
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:23,000
You are trying to get me in the end, using my woman.

746
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,080
You thought I would not know?

747
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:29,030
Be honest with me here.

748
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,370
You are sleepy, right?

749
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,070
I am not sleepy at all.

750
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,270
Gosh, you lie every time you speak.

751
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:40,510
You are the one who lies every time you speak, not me.

752
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,350
Hong Gun, are you still mad at me?

753
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,070
Whatever.

754
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:17,470
I was so scared after you disappeared.

755
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:20,370
I am sorry.

756
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,440
That is why I came back.

757
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,100
That is why the concubine installation is...

758
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:31,130
Do you feel that burdened about getting installed as a concubine?

759
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,650
Yes, I feel so much pressure.

760
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:36,410
What do I do?

761
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,470
Your Highness.

762
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,000
What is the matter?

763
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,720
The criminal, come and receive the rope.

764
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,200
Sorry?

765
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,700
Hong Gun! Oh, my.

766
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,060
Your Highness, the Crown Prince!

767
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,920
Your Highness, the Crown Prince!

768
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,840
Crown Prince, I am coming in!

769
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,740
Eunuch Neung, what is the matter?

770
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:13,440
Crown Prince, H-Her Highness Consort Hyo was taken

771
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,760
to the i-interrogation grounds just now!

772
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,140
For what reason?

773
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:25,030
They found what is thought to be an assassin's bandana under the fences of Consort Hyo's pavilion,

774
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:28,680
along with Her Highness Consort Hyo's dancing attire!

775
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,210
What?

776
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,780
Kyera, did you get caught?

777
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:50,230
Consort Hyo, you remember those clothes, right?

778
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:55,420
They are the dancing clothes you wore on His Majesty's birthday banquet.

779
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,910
He said they cannot know I lost my memories.

780
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,550
Yes.

781
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:12,450
In that case, you must remember this as well.

782
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:18,720
This is...

783
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,470
Looks like you remember

784
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:25,380
that it is the mask you wore at my birthday banquet.

785
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:31,210
You shall answer in all honesty from now on, Consort Hyo. Do you understand?

786
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,470
Yes.

787
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,580
Are you the assassin who infiltrated my birthday banquet?

788
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,350
Sorry?

789
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:46,370
I am asking if you are the assassin who infiltrated to harm me.

790
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:50,050
No, there is no way. How could I?

791
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:52,050
There is no way?

792
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,130
There is no way.

793
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,250
That is an odd answer.

794
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,500
Answer honestly, Consort Hyo.

795
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,300
You are the assassin who infiltrated His Majesty's birthday banquet disguised as a dancer!

796
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,130
I am not!

797
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,720
Head Minister, bring that child.

798
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

799
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:22,080
Consort Hyo, you remember this girl, right?

800
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,180
How could I remember her when I do not even know who I am?

801
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,850
Answer me, Consort Hyo.

802
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,870
I do not really know.

803
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:43,290
This girl is a dancer who danced with you at His Majesty's birthday banquet.

804
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,960
She was also the girl His Majesty had chosen.

805
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,080
I do not think it was her.

806
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:54,980
She is not the dancer His Majesty chose.

807
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,230
This is Jin Mu Dal's trick.

808
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,570
The prodigal king would not even remember a dancer's face.

809
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:07,400
I will ask you one more time. Do you remember her?

810
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:15,310
All right, you look at this woman's face clearly.

811
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,710
Is it a face you know?

812
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,330
Yes.

813
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:28,390
She is a dancer who danced with us at His Majesty's birthday banquet.

814
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:30,210
And?

815
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,560
It is okay.

816
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,390
You are not guilty, so you will be sent back home

817
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:40,530
as long as you speak the truth.

818
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,520
She is an assassin.

819
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:48,500
What?

820
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,860
I saw her entering His Majesty's bath, dressed as an assassin.

821
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:57,540
And I was too scared and ran away.

822
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,850
I will have you ripped apart to death!

823
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:04,140
Who is behind you? What is your identity?

824
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,980
Your Majesty, it was not me.

825
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,830
Right, you would not confess that easily.

826
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:15,090
What are you all doing? Get that wench tied down for punishment right now!

827
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,870
Pardon me for a moment, please, Your Majesty!

828
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:38,000
Did your ears go deaf? Tie her down right now!

829
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,070
Your Majesty, I will confess the truth.

830
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,550
That woman is...

831
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,090
indeed an assassin.

832
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,930
Crown Prince!

833
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:08,210
Still, the Crown Prince spoke the truth, huh?

834
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:10,810
What are you all doing? Tie her down!

835
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,530
Crown Prince, why did you not tell me?

836
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,130
You did not tell me, although I asked you so many times, but why-

837
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,600
Wait!

838
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:21,710
Please hear me out. I will tell you my current condition, Your Majesty!

839
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:26,170
Hey, hey, Sajo Hyun, what are you doing right now?

840
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:29,670
This was your intention? Trampling down my woman?

841
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,970
Hey, Sajo Hyun! Hey, you punk!

842
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:34,180
Hey!

843
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:49,000
♫ Never lost, I will never lose you ♫

844
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,920
♫ Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self ♫

845
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,670
♫ Never lost, when this darkness ends ♫

846
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:08,580
[Love Song for Illusion]

847
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:12,550
From the first moment, why do you make me feel...

848
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:15,580
- Get lost.
- Stop, Sajo Hyun!

849
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,740
How dare you force your way out of my body?

850
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,430
His eyes look different.

851
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:24,800
This will not do. Since things ended up this way...

852
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,410
We will have to cut the tail.

853
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:29,270
There is an evil spirit inside my body.

854
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:32,630
Let us lock up Sajo Hyun.

855
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:35,220
Do you really believe that?

856
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:40,810
Because I feel like I will face the truth I cannot handle if my memories come back one day.
