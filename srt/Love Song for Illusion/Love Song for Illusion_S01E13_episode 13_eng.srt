 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Troubled HeartsTeam @ Viki.com 

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,640
By the way,

9
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,970
who might you be?

10
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,570
Your Majesty.

11
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,420
So silly.

12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,220
Do you not know who I am?

13
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,190
Really?

14
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,940
Did you know that?

15
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,830
Know what?

16
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,420
Whenever you smile,

17
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,330
I cannot breathe.

18
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,190
Are you unwell?

19
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,390
You are so sweet I cannot breathe.

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,410
Thank you.

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,840
By the way,

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,400
who are you, really?

23
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,790
I am a heavenly maiden

24
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,140
who came afar from there.

25
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,270
I am joking.

26
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,870
I am actually the only daughter of

27
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,870
the sea king who swam from over there, probably.

28
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,050
B-But the currents are so strong.

29
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,640
Please stop it now.

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,550
I have a lot to tell you.

31
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,560
Go ahead.

32
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,340
Let us go to the shade.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,710
I heard from Master Yang.

34
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,660
You came here for rehabilitation. Right?

35
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,620
Gosh, my goodness.

36
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,460
How could they make you live in a place like this?

37
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,680
Still, it looks like the antidote worked fine.

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,690
I was worried Prince Ga Ron might have lied.

39
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,130
Right! What happened to Sir Ak Hee?

40
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,590
Did the blade come out?

41
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,050
I mean, you must be awake like this since it came out.

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,880
Are you sharing your body with Sir Ak Hee again, then?

43
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,310
My body?

44
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,670
I must wait and meet Sir Ak Hee as well.

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,810
H-Hey, who is this one called Ak Hee now?

46
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,410
Please cut it out.

47
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,280
A joke is not funny if you drag it out.

48
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,710
Your Majesty!

49
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,820
Yeon Wol?

50
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,420
Yeon Wol!

51
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,650
Eunuch Neung!

52
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,900
Eunuch Neung, you know this lady, too?

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,110
Seriously!

54
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,350
Your Majesty.

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,060
Huh?

56
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,370
Your Majesty, do you remember Yeon Wol?

57
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,030
Goodness, how fortunate!

58
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,630
Looks like you are coming back now.

59
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,910
I do not know this lady.

60
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,730
Sorry?

61
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,150
But you are holding hands so affectionately.

62
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,430
Oh, this lady held my hand so gladly.

63
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,380
So I assumed we knew each other, and

64
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,220
she might be hurt if I refused.

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,270
C-Can I let go now?

66
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,380
Your Majesty, do you really not remember who I am?

67
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,150
I asked you many times.

68
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,410
Who are you, young lady?

69
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,940
Eunuch Neung.

70
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,750
I knew this would happen.

71
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,350
I am sorry I do not recognize you.

72
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,080
I am not in good health, and even my memories waned.

73
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,900
However, I am doing my best to recover, so they will come back.

74
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,400
Eunuch Neung, who is this young lady?

75
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,320
W-Well, the thing is...

76
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,220
- Your Majesty, I am— 
 - I have the queen as my spouse,

77
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,920
so she cannot be my lover.

78
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,660
I am joking.

79
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,310
No way would I have a lover besides the queen.

80
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,400
Your Majesty, in fact,

81
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,550
there is something I did not tell you.

82
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,130
Well, so the thing is—

83
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,160
I met you at the drapery for the first time.

84
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,650
I had come to buy clothes.

85
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,960
I knew it.

86
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,710
Eunuch Neung, what you said was correct.

87
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,710
That I had enjoyed making clothes before as well.

88
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,640
Yes.

89
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,020
Nonetheless, why are you dressed up so weirdly?

90
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,180
Oh, yes.

91
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,890
I was rushing to come here, so...

92
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,940
I will not accept this.

93
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,990
Follow me.

94
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,740
Eunuch Neung, what happened?

95
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,880
Oh, the thing is...

96
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,060
he had this part erased out completely.

97
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,070
Did he lose his memories?

98
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,890
Yes.

99
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,600
Yes, Your Majesty!

100
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,580
Come with us for now.

101
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,900
   

102
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,260
There. We have arrived.

103
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,250
It is pathetic compared to the palace.

104
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,640
We did not have time to build a royal villa.

105
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,970
This is my chamber and my workshop.

106
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,590
How is it?

107
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,230
It is lovely.

108
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,750
Eunuch Neung brought it because it is something I cherish, apparently.

109
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,930
He said someone gifted it to me.

110
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,490
It is a pretty color.

111
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,150
Now, then. Please excuse me for a moment.

112
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,550
I brought you here so I can do this.

113
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:28,280
I just cannot watch an acquaintance of mine going around in such a weird fashion.

114
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,580
This one is...

115
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,150
to measure the length around here.

116
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,900
S-So will you allow me?

117
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,300
Yes.

118
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,330
Raise your arms.

119
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,180
Above your head.

120
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,850
Excuse me, please.

121
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,550
What is the matter?

122
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,790
I think I smell crepe myrtle flowers.

123
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,600
Your Majesty, have you really no—

124
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,370
"No"?

125
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,180
Will you make me stunningly beautiful clothes?

126
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,870
Since we used to know each other, you know.

127
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,380
Stunningly beautiful clothes, huh...

128
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,830
From what I can tell, you roam the fields and the mountains freely.

129
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,390
So, practical clothes would be better than a pretty one. Right?

130
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,800
Y-Yes, that is true.

131
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,420
Are you upset?

132
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,350
No, I—

133
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,220
A little bit.

134
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,980
What is wrong?

135
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,070
They said I came here for rehabilitation because I was in bad health.

136
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,280
But they did not tell me what my condition is in detail.

137
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,190
However, I think I know now.

138
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,070
Are you in pain? Where?

139
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,190
It is racing ever so fast here,

140
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,390
suddenly and unreasonably.

141
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,860
Does it feel like it is thumping by any chance?

142
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,470
Thud, thud.

143
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,370
Thump, thump.

144
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,250
♫  I will come and meet you  ♫

145
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:36,370
♫  I will come to you where you are breathing  ♫

146
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,070
♫  Close your eyes for a moment  ♫

147
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:48,180
♫  When I am reminded of you in my white dream  ♫

148
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,540
♫  Please embrace me in your arms  ♫

149
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,060
♫  I will reach for you  ♫

150
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,950
Could you go back for now?

151
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,500
I am tired.

152
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
I must rest.

153
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,770
Excuse me.

154
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,120
Your Majesty, please eat this for now and

155
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,990
there is something I must tell you.

156
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,400
Yes.

157
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,220
I will take my leave. Please rest comfortably.

158
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,310
H-Hold on!

159
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,580
Do you live in this village, young lady?

160
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,710
I came from a different village, far away from here.

161
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,330
I stopped by briefly to say hi to Eunuch Neung while I was at it.

162
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,710
Is that so?

163
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:48,030
In that case, will you be staying for a while?

164
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,890
I mean, I do not mean anything else.

165
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,690
But for me to make your clothing, I will need to see you a few more times.

166
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,630
I need to make the measurements again and

167
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,190
it needs to be fitted on your body as well and—

168
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,650
I was planning to stay for a few more days.

169
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,490
Because it will be too tiring of a trip to go back.

170
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,520
Is that so?

171
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,960
Well, stay as long as you want.

172
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,780
Eunuch Neung, is there a room for this young lady?

173
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,940
Yes, of course.

174
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,400
I will have the room across cleaned up spotless.

175
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,790
Now, then, see you later.

176
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,780
Yeon Wol.

177
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,930
You are okay. Right?

178
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,050
Eunuch Neung.

179
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,600
His Majesty took the antidote that day. Right?

180
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,960
The thing is...

181
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,960
 Yeon Wol! 

182
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,960
 Please wake up, Yeon Wol. 

183
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,390
 Eunuch Neung. 

184
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,340
 Her Majesty has arrived. 

185
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,600
 Please escape right away. 

186
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,030
 Please make sure His Majesty eats this. 

187
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,690
 Sorry? 

188
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,690
 Y-Yes. 

189
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,300
 Your Majesty, I will be back. 

190
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,720
 Please recover by then. 

191
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,610
 Yeon Wol, you have to escape right now. 

192
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,620
His Majesty left to convalesce the very next day.

193
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,360
My goodness.

194
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,360
I heard Her Majesty and Grand Prince Sajo Yoong decided so.

195
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,750
Her Majesty, too?

196
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,930
Yes.

197
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,390
 Go take your breaks! 

198
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,290
 Good job. 

199
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,410
Even during the entire trip, His Majesty only kept looking outside.

200
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,720
Worried about what happened to you and

201
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,270
thinking you might be watching from somewhere.

202
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,480
He had such a sorrowful look in his eyes.

203
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:18,110
I was able to give His Majesty the antidote only after night came that day.

204
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,390
Because Her Majesty stayed by His Majesty's side all the time until he left the palace.

205
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,220
He took the antidote and slept without waking up.

206
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,770
So I was worried if it had failed to work.

207
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,440
 Excuse me. 

208
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,750
 Excuse me. 

209
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,430
 Your Majesty? 

210
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,680
 Your Majesty! 

211
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,100
 Have you come to your senses? 

212
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,560
 Your Majesty, are you able to move? 

213
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,330
 Good heavens! 

214
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,490
 The antidote did its job right! 

215
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,180
 Goodness, Your Majesty! 

216
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,980
 - Your Majesty? 
 - Yes, Your Majesty. 

217
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,930
 Sorry? 

218
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,420
 I am Your Majesty? 

219
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,660
 Yes. 

220
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,820
 In that case, 

221
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,210
 who are you, Mister? 

222
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,970
 Sorry? 

223
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,130
 Y-Your Majesty... 

224
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,960
He must have lost his memories due to the side effects of the tranquilizing dart.

225
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,110
Much like the way it happened to me before.

226
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,130
It does seem so.

227
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,410
But he is able to move, so I guess we should be glad.

228
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,100
From what I saw earlier, he seemed to remember you, Eunuch Neung.

229
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:39,210
That is all because I kept telling him starting from the dawn that day.

230
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,850
I thought it might help His Majesty regain his memories,

231
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,940
so I am wearing my attire all the time, too.

232
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,040
I see.

233
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,950
 Please listen carefully to what I am about to tell you, okay? 

234
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,700
But His Majesty is so smart and keen.

235
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,900
The entire process of how he was the king

236
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,840
but had to come here for recovery because of his poor health,

237
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,670
the basic etiquette as the king,

238
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:09,530
and all these things, I told him all day until my throat was about to give.

239
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:16,290
He understood everything just as I told him, like how a rainstorm soaks up your clothes.

240
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,550
So he mastered all the basics in just one day.

241
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,350
He is so lovely.

242
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,330
Did you also tell him all about Sir Ak Hee and Grand Prince Sajo Yoong?

243
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,010
The thing is...

244
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:38,310
Goodness, about that...

245
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,710
 It will be very good for you if you make a brew. 

246
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,640
 Whoa, you are so great. 

247
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,080
 Oh, Eunuch Neung, where have you been? 

248
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,860
 Eunuch Neung, thank you for your work. 

249
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,790
 Oh, yes, Your Majesty and Grand Prince. 

250
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:10,810
 Eunuch Neung, Brother brought all of these medicinal herbs and ginseng. 

251
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,020
 Also, the queen brought good textiles and dyes, 

252
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,840
 and loads of tools for making clothes. 

253
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,380
 I did not leave anything out because you are fond of this work, Your Majesty. 

254
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,550
 You have to make me lots of clothes like you used to, okay? 

255
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,480
 Did I used to do that? 

256
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,270
 Of course. 

257
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,600
 You made these clothes for me as well. 

258
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,370
 The two of you had such a great relationship that 

259
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,630
 people said even the lovebirds would be jealous. 

260
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,560
 Grand Prince, please. You are making me blush. 

261
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,440
 Anyhow, I hope Your Majesty's memories come back soon. 

262
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,290
 It looks like your illness worsened and even blurred your memories. 

263
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,530
 Your Majesty, are you crying again? 

264
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,650
 Please get better soon, Your Majesty. 

265
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,040
 Thank you, Grand Prince. 

266
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,630
Her Majesty and Grand Prince Sajo Yoong realized His Majesty lost his memories.

267
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:26,120
And they blatantly lied about how good of a wife and a brother they used to be.

268
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,270
His Majesty naturally believed them because of his good nature.

269
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,880
 Why did you not report promptly about His Majesty's paralysis having been cured 

270
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,570
 and memories having been lost? 

271
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,910
 Well, he recovered suddenly last night, so I did not... 

272
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,590
 It must have been thanks to Kyera for getting him the antidote. 

273
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,190
 Foolish brat. 

274
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,570
 What she did to save His Majesty actually ended up harming him. 

275
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,870
 Did you tell His Majesty about Yeon Wol? 

276
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,050
 I did not tell him! 

277
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,470
 Well done. 

278
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,290
 You must not tell him about Yeon Wol in the future as well. 

279
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,830
 Yes! 

280
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,450
 You must say the people His Majesty trusted the most and 

281
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,300
 kept close were only the queen and me. 

282
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,500
 Do you understand? 

283
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,910
 Y-Yes! 

284
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,370
 The moment you spout nonsense, 

285
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,080
 your old mother, your brother couple, and your young nieces and nephews 

286
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,470
 will all be torn apart limb from limb. 

287
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,180
 P-Please do not. 

288
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,090
 Please do not, Your Majesty! 

289
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,140
 I will do as you ordered! 

290
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,620
 Oh, this man is taking care of your old mother, so know that. 

291
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,330
 What? 

292
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,320
 Goodness, Mother. Goodness, Mother! 

293
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,480
 Goodness, Mother! 

294
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,820
So they must also be watching me as I stay here.

295
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,470
Probably.

296
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,170
I was going to tell His Majesty

297
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,410
you are only a woman who used to be a palace lady, even if you came here.

298
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,370
You were going to tell him honestly about me earlier, though.

299
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,790
Seeing the two of you together, I was just too saddened.

300
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,600
So, I was just going to tell him the truth.

301
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,180
Do not do that.

302
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,200
You have to think about your family.

303
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,560
Has Sir Ak Hee not woken up all this time?

304
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,430
That is the weird thing.

305
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,780
He has not. Not even once.

306
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,590
Where is Officer Ji?

307
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,850
They put me by His Majesty's side because I am easy to them.

308
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,600
And they locked up Ji Jeon behind bars.

309
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,150
Everything changed in just a few days.

310
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,950
Y-Yeon Wol.

311
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,810
What if we told His Majesty now quietly?

312
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,180
We just need to get our story straight with His Majesty, do you not think?

313
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,740
 Make sure to... 

314
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,870
 keep your promise. 

315
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,950
 I will keep it... 

316
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,180
 as long as His Majesty wakes up. 

317
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,420
 I have to leave His Majesty anyway. 

318
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,850
 It is better for him not to know who I am. 

319
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,020
Do not even worry about me.

320
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,580
No, it is dangerous.

321
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,760
Please do not do that.

322
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,350
 Whenever you smile, 

323
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,030
 I cannot breathe. 

324
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,410
 You are so sweet I cannot breathe. 

325
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,770
 I think I saw her somewhere. 

326
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,310
I am sure...

327
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,380
I made this clothing.

328
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,220
Wait! How can the measurements be exactly the same?

329
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,840
That raggedy lady cannot be the owner of this clothing.

330
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,760
My goodness.

331
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:36,210
I already have the queen, so how could I have...?

332
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,550
You fool, come to your senses.

333
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,410
I did not even ask her name.

334
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,650
A talisman!

335
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,000
My goodness!

336
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,840
What is this?

337
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,280
You are telling me to eat yeot? 
  (This phrase means "f*** you") 

338
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,950
Your loyalty is smaller than an ant's eyeball.

339
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,520
What is this?

340
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,380
I told you to take out the blade.

341
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,130
For me, I was doing a huge favor!

342
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,020
You said Sajo Hyeon's paralysis was cured.

343
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,000
Instead, he lost his memories.

344
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,280
Well, that much is fine.

345
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,870
But why is Sir Ak Hee not coming out?

346
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,920
He did not come out?

347
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,990
Did he die?

348
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:38,760
He could have died even if you took out the blade.

349
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,590
Oh, no...

350
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,650
- Cheong Ta— 
 - Whoa, quit it!

351
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,320
Do not say it.

352
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,540
Do not say anything.

353
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,380
"Make Sajo Hyeon's memories come back."

354
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,960
"Find out if Sir Ak Hee is dead or alive."

355
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,570
Do not ask me for those things.

356
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,740
I cannot do them, even if I wanted to.

357
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,470
Please tell Grand Prince Sajo Yoong this.

358
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,560
I will be leaving this place soon,

359
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,170
so do not disturb us for the few days I will be staying.

360
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,430
Where are you going?

361
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,390
You are the one who told me this, Cheong Ta.

362
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,010
Go find another man and live happily.

363
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,440
You are already dating someone else?

364
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,240
My goodness, you are really talented.

365
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,000
You do not even take a break, girl.

366
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,490
Please make sure to tell him.

367
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,450
Right, congrats on becoming the High Priest.

368
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,570
Hey!

369
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,940
That lovebird.

370
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,870
That would make me a lone bird.

371
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,300
Your Majesty.

372
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,740
What are you doing?

373
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,570
This is the blanket you will be using.

374
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:11,420
It needs to be dried in the sun like this for it to be fluffy.

375
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,850
Where have you been all this time?

376
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,890
In the mountains to pick greens.

377
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,440
The greens you love were everywhere.

378
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,790
Smells nice, right?

379
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,390
You know what kind of greens I like?

380
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,480
Were you a palace maid in the royal kitchen?

381
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,950
Do you want some yeot? 
  (Traditional Korean confectionery) 

382
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,660
A neighborhood woman gave them to me.

383
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,570
♫  Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment  ♫

384
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,350
It is big.

385
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:09,790
♫  Your warmth remains in my heart  ♫

386
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,790
♫  Even if you become wind and cannot hold you  ♫

387
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,130
You are so strong.

388
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,600
You need to be strong to work in the royal kitchen.

389
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,530
Take a bite.

390
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,400
♫  So that you will not get far, so that we will not be apart even for a moment  ♫

391
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,340
♫  Even if I grasp, you become blurry  ♫

392
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,310
Delicious, right?

393
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:46,960
♫  I'll stay here and wait for you  ♫

394
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,940
Oh, right.

395
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,760
What is your name, young lady?

396
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,700
 You forgot my name as well. 

397
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,950
It is Yeon Wol.

398
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,180
Yeon Wol.

399
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,370
That is a pretty name. Yeon Wol.

400
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,430
 Kyera said she will be leaving soon? 

401
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,110
 Yes. 

402
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,920
 She did not seem to be lying. 

403
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,010
 I mean, it was clear His Majesty would be in more danger because of her. 

404
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,640
 So I can understand her. 

405
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,510
 Is there any chance of Sajo Hyeon's memories returning? 

406
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,150
 It will probably be difficult. 

407
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,440
 I have been expelled from the heavens' shaman association just now, 

408
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,240
 so there is no way for me to help him. 

409
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,330
 On top of that, Ak Hee disappeared, too. 

410
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,480
 Ak Hee disappeared? 

411
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,870
 Are you saying he died? 

412
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,030
 He must have perished. 

413
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,680
 Since he was stabbed with a blade. 

414
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,940
 Sajo Hyeon lost his memories 

415
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,430
 and Ak Hee is dead. 

416
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,380
 I, Sajo Yoong, have finally taken over this world. 

417
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,960
I am glad to hear the plague is coming under control.

418
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,140
They said the medicine High Priest Cheong Ta gave out was effective.

419
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,670
The problem up north has been stabilized, so the people are relieved.

420
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,540
 That is enough. 

421
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,000
 Pal Cheon, are you going to do as I say? 

422
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,690
 Are you? 

423
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,910
 But still, 

424
00:33:53,910 --> 00:34:00,890
 if that happens, because of me, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong will... 

425
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:04,590
 You are still so gravely mistaken. 

426
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,790
 Do you think Sajo Yoong considers you his father? 

427
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:13,740
 Sajo Yoong is as eager as ever to find you. 

428
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:19,210
 You will be killed like a dog the moment you get caught. 

429
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:26,670
I believe all of this is thanks to your wise measures, Grand Prince.

430
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,220
Minister of Justice.

431
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,240
- Yes. 
 - You are speaking inappropriately.

432
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,110
It is not that you "believe" it.

433
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,630
It is clearly the Grand Prince's achievement.

434
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:48,950
Thanks to the Grand Prince, Asatae is now entering a time of unprecedented peace.

435
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,660
Head Minister,

436
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,680
you are always so delightful.

437
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,590
He sure is the elder of Asatae.

438
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,380
Your grace knows no bounds, Grand Prince.

439
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,830
Listen carefully.

440
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,780
There is no way for me to help you.

441
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,880
However, find a way to live one way or another.

442
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,480
I have...

443
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,530
become pregnant.

444
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,420
So survive.

445
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:03,390
Survive and protect this child for me.

446
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,130
Your Majesty.

447
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,890
Could it be—

448
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,580
Make sure to survive.

449
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,120
Ki Chool.

450
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,380
Yes, Grand Prince.

451
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,430
I must let Ji Jeon Seo go.

452
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,310
He will be put to good use.

453
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,210
 His Majesty told me to use this for your bedding. 

454
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,670
 This bedding was made with sheets His Majesty dyed a long time ago. 

455
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,940
 Are you going to make me stunningly beautiful clothing? 

456
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,330
 Since we used to know each other, you know. 

457
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:03,170
 From what I can tell, you roam the fields and the mountains freely. 

458
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,720
 So a practical clothing would be better than a pretty one. Right? 

459
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,960
 Y-Yes, that is true. 

460
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,440
She must have been sad I was not making her pretty clothing. Right?

461
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,260
You are in for a big surprise.

462
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,650
 Was she looking into my room? 

463
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,120
 Your Majesty, I will be back. 

464
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,330
 You have to get better, Your Majesty. 

465
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,390
 What is this? 

466
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,630
Your Majesty.

467
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,050
Who are you?

468
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,490
Pardon?

469
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,980
You were not just an ordinary palace lady.

470
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,040
Right?

471
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,770
Could it be...

472
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,930
you used to be my lover?

473
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,240
Answer me.

474
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,440
Why did you think such a thing?

475
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,770
Because my heart was saddened.

476
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,600
Because my chest keeps hurting.

477
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,190
What happened to us?

478
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,890
Answer me right now.

479
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,640
There was nothing between us.

480
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,930
You lie.

481
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,810
I am sure we liked each other.

482
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:01,250
However, I must have felt too bad for the queen, who is so kind,

483
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,230
which must be why I broke up with you.

484
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:10,830
Still, you missed me and were worried about me,

485
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,310
so you came here.

486
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,280
It is not true that there was nothing between us.

487
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,880
Am I wrong?

488
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,580
Answer me now!

489
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,700
If you want to find out if it is true or not, work hard to regain your memories.

490
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,660
With Grand Prince Sajo Yoong running the reins, you cannot live here like this.

491
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,170
How impertinent!

492
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,020
Do you find my brother untrustworthy?

493
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,860
He is wise to no end.

494
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,400
I am sorry, but please leave once dawn breaks.

495
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,710
I do not wish to be charmed by you

496
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,610
and become even more disturbed.

497
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,820
♫  Because I was always you  ♫

498
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,600
♫  And you were always me  ♫

499
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,010
♫  I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere  ♫

500
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:16,090
♫  The place where you are, even if it'll only be a moment  ♫

501
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,600
Why did I say that?

502
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,620
♫  Please take me anywhere, a place, go away  ♫

503
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:37,950
♫  Please hold me so I do not waver, I am tired  ♫

504
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,130
This is so delicious.

505
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,250
 Grand Prince Sajo Yoong has arrived! 

506
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,480
Oh, my, the Grand Prince has come to his mother's chamber!

507
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,260
Come sit here. Okay? Hurry, hurry.

508
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,140
Where is that man, Pal Cheon?

509
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,820
I do not really—

510
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,490
I swear it is true.

511
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:20,350
I told him to stop ruining your future and leave far away to a place like Jinhoi.

512
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,080
He even bit his finger and signed a bloody vow.

513
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,540
Make sure Pal Cheon does not come near here again.

514
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:28,820
Do not worry, your father—

515
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,590
Even that moron knows to care for his son—

516
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,610
Who are you calling a father and a son?

517
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,650
If you say such a thing one more time,

518
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,880
- I will have you die by poison— 
 - Gosh, okay, okay!

519
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,470
Here, have a peach. It is as sweet as honey.

520
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,360
No thanks.

521
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,400
I bought a bunch to get on the queen's good side.

522
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,900
She pretended to eat them in front of me, only to throw them all away after.

523
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,570
She ate peaches every day last year.

524
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,780
What a fickle woman.

525
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,360
Why are you telling me this only now?

526
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,990
What?

527
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:09,970
I know you are a busy man, so how can I tell you to come—

528
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,130
Grand Prince!

529
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,370
Geum Hwa, you sly little thing.

530
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,800
Hey.

531
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,460
Ha Rang, you came, too?

532
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,830
Because I missed you.

533
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,600
We have patrolled the east and the north.

534
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,920
As expected, there were some traps.

535
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,030
There are some assassins hiding, too.

536
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,530
But it is still fortunate the mountain is not too rough.

537
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,980
A map of the village. I marked spots you have to watch out for.

538
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,590
With my own hands.

539
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,360
Thank you.

540
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,900
Thank you, Master Yang.

541
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,240
I am helping you because you requested.

542
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,980
But we cannot stay here forever.

543
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:21,590
I am sorry. I wanted to help His Majesty this way.

544
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,060
Your Majesty, I heard you were reading books.

545
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,600
Oh, I wanted to make some condensed milk.

546
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,860
How pretty.

547
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,730
Aster?

548
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,360
Did you go to the western valley, too?

549
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,150
Wait! You surveyed this entire mountain already?

550
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:56,590
Oh, well, I was picking some greens.

551
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:13,910
I was too harsh on you yesterday. I am sorry.

552
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,390
I thought you left because your room was empty.

553
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,450
Because I told you to leave.

554
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:24,100
You even made me an outfit like this. How can I leave?

555
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,260
I need to pay you back for the clothing at least.

556
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,390
It seems to suit you well.

557
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,510
Do you like it?

558
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:37,350
Yes, as you said, you made me a very active clothing.

559
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,650
It is so easy to move around this part, too.

560
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,890
 It rips and tears every time I move. 

561
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,500
 Make the inner skirt's width as wide as you can. 

562
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,370
Do not worry.

563
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,400
I will not leave even if you shove me away.

564
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,210
Thank you.

565
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,220
 Hurry up and come over! Lunch is ready to be served. 

566
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,880
 Yes, Eunuch Neung, I will do the dishes! 

567
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:36,160
 This one lacks activity, but it is quite the beauty. 

568
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,660
 If you forgive me, please wear it. 

569
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,980
 I came to the royal villa at Mt. Seowang to pick you up. 

570
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,400
 You did not forget your promise. Right? 

571
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,430
 I will be waiting. 

572
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,220
Prince Ga Ron came back to the royal villa at Mt. Seowang.

573
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,920
Hwang Ga Ron did?

574
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,320
Why did he come?

575
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,880
I heard he came to pick up Kyera

576
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,510
to marry her.

577
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:33,700
Marry? Tan Ya, that son of a—

578
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,360
Tan Ya?

579
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,760
You mean Shaman Tan Ya of Jinhoi?

580
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,040
What do you mean by that?

581
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,880
What do you mean?

582
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,740
Yes, Tan Ya is Prince Ga Ron.

583
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,330
Jinhoi's king adopted him as his son.

584
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:57,670
Even that punk fell for Yeon Wol?

585
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:01,570
Tan Ya, that punk made a fool out of me, huh?

586
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,620
He got Kyera to marry him in return for the antidote.

587
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:12,210
In that case, Tan Ya can also make Sajo Hyeon's memories come back. Right?

588
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,510
Tan Ya cannot do that.

589
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,680
He only specializes in talismans.

590
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:24,010
You placed the talisman you bought from him on my forehead, too.

591
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,400
Kyera will make her move soon.

592
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,480
Then, we will be able to find out.

593
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,410
If Sajo Hyeon's memories really came back and

594
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,580
if Ak Hee really disappeared.

595
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:43,380
 Could I come in for a moment, Your Majesty? 

596
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,260
Come in.

597
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,990
How is it?

598
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,620
Does this mean you forgive me?

599
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,950
I never even resented you.

600
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,670
Rather, there is nothing to forgive you for.

601
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,350
I...

602
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,700
have a request to make.

603
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,840
What is it?

604
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:55,290
Can I hug you once, Your Majesty?

605
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,210
I know you feel bad toward Her Majesty.

606
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:05,600
But can I still just hug you, just once—

607
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,110
More tightly.

608
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,450
 Sir Ak Hee, it is me. 

609
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:38,520
 Summon me to the mind's space again like last time. 

610
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,680
 Sir Ak Hee. 

611
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,810
 Sir Ak Hee! 

612
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,910
 Sir Ak Hee, where are you? 

613
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,580
 Sir Ak Hee, please summon me. 

614
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,110
Your Majesty.

615
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,770
You are so strong.

616
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,790
I thought you were going to crush me.

617
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:52,570
♫  Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment  ♫

618
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:58,940
♫  Your warmth remains in my heart  ♫

619
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,150
♫  I'll stay here and wait for you  ♫

620
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:13,700
♫  Even if you disappear again tomorrow, I will wait  ♫

621
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,640
 I am sorry, Your Majesty. 

622
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,220
 I wanted to get your memories back. 

623
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,070
♫  ...sound of you breathing  ♫

624
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,230
Goodness, what is this?

625
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,400
Why? What is the matter?

626
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,380
This...

627
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:05,290
 Your Majesty, I could not say farewell before leaving. 

628
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:07,440
 I am leaving this pretty clothing behind. 

629
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,790
 I do not have the right to wear this clothing. 

630
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,990
 Also, 

631
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:18,960
 I marked spots you have to watch out for in the mountains and the village. 

632
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,850
 Be careful and be on your guard wherever you are. 

633
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,070
 I hope you will always have Eunuch Neung accompany you. 

634
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,950
She said she was going around picking greens.

635
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:33,410
It was to draw this. Goodness.

636
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:34,670
Eunuch Neung.

637
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

638
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,280
Am I in danger right now?

639
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,870
Are there people who are after my life?

640
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,810
Eunuch Neung!

641
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:56,870
Please have this humble one killed, Your Majesty!

642
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,930
Do you know why Yeon Wol left?

643
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,690
I do not really know, either.

644
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:07,020
She did not tell me she was leaving.

645
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,040
It must be...

646
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,630
because of this thing.

647
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,830
What is this thing?

648
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,250
Is there anyone here who knows Yeon Wol?

649
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,580
If you do, show yourself! I have to say something.

650
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,010
I saw you meet Yeon Wol!

651
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,470
 We have patrolled the east and the north. 

652
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,170
 As expected, there were some traps. 

653
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:47,680
 That woman. Is she someone I can trust? 

654
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:52,060
 I cannot tell, however, 

655
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,950
 I want to trust her. 

656
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,190
 I will trust her. 

657
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,020
Show yourself.

658
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,980
Your Highness.

659
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:37,620
You really came.

660
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,520
Did I not promise to come?

661
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,970
You are amazing, just as I expected.

662
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,300
Shall we set the mood first?

663
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,120
Hear ye! Bring us some drinks and food here.

664
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,770
Hold on.

665
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:54,090
My promise was to marry you if His Majesty recovers perfectly.

666
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:59,640
However, His Majesty did not recover perfectly, so our terms must be discussed again.

667
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,410
He did not recover perfectly?

668
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:04,060
His paralysis is gone,

669
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,610
but he is unwell elsewhere.

670
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,830
I cannot...

671
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,350
marry you, Prince Ga Ron.

672
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,370
Will I let you be?

673
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,060
Do as you please.

674
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,060
I came prepared.

675
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,830
In that case,

676
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,050
can I kill you with this thing...

677
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:33,360
that you gave me?

678
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,280
Kill me.

679
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,970
You would rather die than marry me?

680
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,540
How unpleasant.

681
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,680
I do not want blood on my hands.

682
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,460
I will take you to Jinhoi and give you eternal pain.

683
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:54,910
Hear ye! Lock up this woman in the warehouse.

684
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,850
Your Majesty.

685
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,770
Long time no see, Prince Ga Ron.

686
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,890
Yes.

687
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:13,610
You are looking better, so the plague must have been cured.

688
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:18,210
I am glad it was worth my physicians to take care of you devotedly.

689
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,570
Your Majesty's grace is boundless.

690
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,640
You are trying to marry this woman, I hear?

691
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:33,740
In return for giving her this medicine.

692
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:38,040
However, I did not benefit from this medicine's effects.

693
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,590
Your paralysis was cured.

694
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:45,200
Could you be insisting that it went away on its own?

695
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,510
The blade was removed.

696
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,000
You are Shaman Tan Ya, are you not?

697
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,120
So you must know well about the blade.

698
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,740
Cheong Ta, that idiot.

699
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,270
Let us go.

700
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:03,300
Leave that woman behind.

701
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,900
Whether you benefited from the medicine or not,

702
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,970
there is a promise we made.

703
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:16,150
Prince Ga Ron, you are fully aware that promise was never established in the first place.

704
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:21,550
How dare Jinhoi's prince covet my woman?

705
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:28,200
Your Majesty. Look here!

706
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:36,840
Your Majesty, are your memories back?

707
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,990
Have you really recovered?

708
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,140
Why did you make such a reckless promise?

709
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,740
How can you come here so fearlessly?

710
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,510
Why did you leave me without a word?

711
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:50,220
What is the use of getting my memories back when I do not have you?

712
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:55,160
What is the point of conquering the world and becoming a king

713
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,940
when I do not have you?

714
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:06,270
I only wanted to save you, Your Majesty.

715
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,770
Because nothing else matters to me.

716
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,380
I only wanted to—

717
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,190
How foolish.

718
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,550
How are you so foolish?

719
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,620
Still, I am glad your memories came back.

720
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,040
My memories...

721
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,590
did not come back.

722
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:52,100
However, I can sense it.

723
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,270
Just how much I was in love with you and

724
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:58,160
just how precious you were to me.

725
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,480
Your Majesty.

726
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:06,530
That is why I agreed to grant this request...

727
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:10,590
for coming to save you in person.

728
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,380
What...

729
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:23,290
I heard you saw this before, too.

730
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,040
So...

731
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,890
do not be scared.

732
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,740
I am ready.

733
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,560
Could it be...

734
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,330
Your Majesty.

735
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,220
Your Majesty!

736
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,380
Kyera.

737
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,580
I missed you, Kyera.

738
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,150
Sir Ak Hee?

739
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:16,300
♫  The feelings seeped through the hidden opening  ♫

740
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:25,670
♫  Closing up and withering away, the sad memory  ♫

741
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:35,400
♫  The feelings seeped through the fallen leaves  ♫

742
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:41,730
   

743
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:45,730
 I realized it clearly after nearly perishing for good. 

744
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,910
 I do not want to let you go. 

745
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,570
 Kyera! 

746
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:52,210
 - You can have her.  
  - The day you allow passing of the crown, 

747
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:54,900
 Cheong Ta will perform geuminsal on Sajo Hyeon. 

748
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,810
 Did you really bear His Majesty's child? 

749
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:00,160
 You wicked wench! 

750
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:04,250
 I am sorry for liking you this much when I have the queen. 

751
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,660
 You only loved Lady Yeon Wol, Your Majesty. 

752
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,440
 Do not let the queen and Sajo Yoong deceive you. 

753
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,800
 Master Yang!
