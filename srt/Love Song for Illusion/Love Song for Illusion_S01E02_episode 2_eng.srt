1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,430
   

2
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,260
   

3
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,750
   

4
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,120
   

5
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,120
   

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,790
   

7
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,310
Who are you?

8
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,040
Me?

9
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,910
I am your man.

10
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:11,990


11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,790
 Who is this person? 

12
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,650
    
 Oh, I apologize. Are you okay?

13
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,280
Yes.

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,580
Are you in pain at all?

15
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,960
Oh, well...

16
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,810
 I probably should not say 

17
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,350
 I do not remember anything. 

18
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,760
 How can I trust these people? 

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,830
Oh, right.

20
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,230
Take your leave, everyone.

21
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,780
Are you uncomfortable?

22
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,050
No.

23
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,220
I missed you so much.

24
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,820
I just want to keep looking at you.

25
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,890
Well, so did we know each other from—

26
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,680
Whoa, you do not remember?

27
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,070
You know you will be violated by the king disgracefully tonight and be thrown away.

28
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,480
My comrades are waiting outside.

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,570
They will help you.

30
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,650
Hurry up and escape.

31
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,530
 When I saw you at the drapery, 

32
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,830
 you had some kind of an aura. 

33
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,980
 This thing. 

34
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,100
 And this thing does not fit. 

35
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,690
 You seem fake for some reason. 

36
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,640
 You will realize I am real. 

37
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,040
 You will end up liking me. 

38
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,880
What in the world?

39
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,000
What are you doing right now?

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,760
- You did not even come to my birthday banquet. Move aside! 
 - Your Majesty.

41
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,260
Please allow me a moment.

42
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,410
For what?

43
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,070
I want to take the dancer

44
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,920
you chose tonight, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,940
What did you say?

46
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,840
I know it is not my place, and impolite.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,460
However, my heart moved for that dancer.

48
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,510
This is my first time feeling this,

49
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,900
so I am gathering the courage to ask you.

50
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,800
You are...

51
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,000
You really...

52
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,970
You finally became a man!

53
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,490
For you to dissuade me like this, unable to hide your lust as a man...

54
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,590
you finally became suitable to be my son.

55
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,550
I apologize.

56
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,150
Sure thing. I have plenty of women for myself.

57
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,380
You are to take that dancer tonight.

58
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,320
Hyeon, I would be so happy if you would always be this manly.

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,910
All right. This is...

60
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,120
 This is how you should have been from the start! 

61
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,890
Sajo Seung, I have been waiting for this day.

62
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,070
I will take your life today according to the heavens' order!

63
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,990
You are...

64
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,270
You are not fit to be an assassin.

65
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,170
Your scent is too strong.

66
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,650
Kyera.

67
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,060
Oh, my name is Kyera—

68
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,970
Do you actually know?

69
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,000
That I lost my...

70
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,440
How do you know?

71
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,240
You said I was lying unconscious the whole time.

72
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,290
I did not say anything after waking up earlier.

73
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,130
O-Oh, you woke up for a short moment.

74
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,240
When I was tending to you alone,

75
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,150
that is when you told me.

76
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,920
O-Oh, is that so?

77
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,740
Let me ask you frankly, then.

78
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,560
Do we really know each other?

79
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,300
It is more than just knowing each other.

80
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,210
We are very close.

81
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,250
What did I used to do before?

82
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,440
What was my job?

83
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,790
You were a dancer.

84
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,710
A dancer? Like...

85
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,840
Like this...

86
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,620
Did you fall for me after seeing me dance?

87
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,580
We have liked each other for a while now.

88
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,610
Though I made you my concubine after you came to His Majesty's birthday banquet as a dancer.

89
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,970
That must mean I used to live outside the palace.

90
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,900
Where was it? What about my parents?

91
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,810
Gosh, I have so many questions.

92
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,420
How do I not remember a single thing?

93
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,700
I will tell you the details later.

94
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,990
Why?

95
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,820
I have my reasons. Let us end this talk here for now.

96
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,900
Will you trust me?

97
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,380
Thank you.

98
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,830
I will only let Hong Goon know about your memory loss.

99
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,460
She will be a great help by your side.

100
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,840
Yes.

101
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,760
I am sure of it. That Ak Hee—

102
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,720
Ak Hee must have put Her Highness Consort Hyo to sleep using sleeping incense.

103
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,520
If he used sleeping incense,

104
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,440
Ak Hee should have fallen asleep, too.

105
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,420
In my opinion...

106
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,930
Ji Jeon, we were played completely.

107
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,780
We thought he was the crown prince at His Majesty's birthday banquet—

108
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,950
We thought he was the crown prince at His Majesty's birthday banquet.

109
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,880
The dancer woke up?

110
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,710
Is the crown prince aware as well?

111
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,070
Crown Prince is with her right now.

112
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,730
Let us go to the dancer.

113
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,400
Your Highness, I heard Crown Prince ordered that absolutely no one

114
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,820
was to enter Consort Hyo's pavilion.

115
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,420
Even me?

116
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,570
I apologize.

117
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,620
 Crown Princess, Her Highness Consort Cheong Myeong has arrived. 

118
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,500
Crown Princess, I heard that dancer of a wench woke up!

119
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,690
Oh, is that so?

120
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,890
Please take a seat.

121
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,970
Right now, Crown Prince is said to be

122
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,950
sticking right next to the dancer.

123
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,950
I came here in a hurry to console you since

124
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,720
I assumed you would be devastated.

125
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,120
Just how angry you must feel?

126
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,180
I understand your situation better than anyone.

127
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,780
What a rough first night she must have had with the crown prince

128
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,150
that she was lying in bed three days and nights.

129
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,870
Crown Prince is just like His Majesty, too.

130
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,140
This is probably only the beginning.

131
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,910
They say a fool at 40 is a fool forever.

132
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,720
Just how many more concubines will he have from now on?

133
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,730
You are speaking out of line.

134
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,630
Who are you calling a fool?

135
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,450
How can you say such disloyal things in front of me?

136
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,180
I mean, I was—

137
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,590
Why would I be devastated because of such a lowly thing?

138
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:03,290
When I am the crown prince's first wife.

139
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,670
First wife—

140
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,690
I am also the one who hosts the concubine installations.

141
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,320
Everything... is up to me.

142
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,480
- Installation ceremony?
- Yes.

143
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,650
You have to go through the installation to become an official concubine.

144
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,520
When is the installation?

145
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,170
Crown Princess will decide the date.

146
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,980
Gosh, Crown Princess must feel horrible.

147
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,160
Why?

148
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,150
No wife would ever welcome a concubine.

149
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,310
I also do not like this situation.

150
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,410
Hong Goon, did I really willingly accept this situation?

151
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,580
In this situation, where I am dressed beautifully

152
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,790
as a concubine and having my hair combed.

153
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,770
Did I really obediently walk into this room when

154
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,650
Crown Prince told me to become his concubine?

155
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,030
I do not really know.

156
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,630
I was a palace maid in the royal kitchen and moved here only yesterday.

157
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,680
Oh, I see.

158
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,150
What? The concubine installation ceremony is in two days?

159
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,770
I ordered it to be done tomorrow since Consort Hyo woke up.

160
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,980
B-But it is in two days?

161
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,000
I deeply apologize, Crown Prince.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,560
Tell Crown Princess to have the concubine installation done tomorrow.

163
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,870
Wait, Your Highness, that is...

164
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,050
That is?

165
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,910
According to the Royal Customs, concubine installation is the crown princess' unique right.

166
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,150
If His Majesty finds out one day,

167
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,390
he might order everything to be canceled.

168
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,950
Right, that is true.

169
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,730
Crown Prince, I think you should sleep tonight.

170
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,110
Even so, we will make sure you can see the concubine installation—

171
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,280
Wake me up in time?

172
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,760
- Yes. 
 - Why, of course, Your Highness.

173
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,530
You have not slept in three days.

174
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,820
I am deeply worried your health might be harmed.

175
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,710
Goodness, you are worried?

176
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,100
- Oh, yes, Your Highness. 
 - That is correct.

177
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,660
You two think I am a joke. Right?

178
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,790
Your Highness, how can you say that?

179
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,400
After I fall asleep,

180
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,120
will you two really willingly wake me up?

181
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,500
T-That is a misunderstanding, Your Highness. Of course, we should wake you up.

182
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,670
Do not make me laugh. You two are on Sajo Hyeon's side, not this Ak Hee.

183
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,660
You think I would not know?

184
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,950
Goodness, y-you are not denying it, huh?

185
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,390
Huh?

186
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,460
I absolutely will not sleep.

187
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,580
I will see Consort Hyo's installation ceremony and her getting the official concubine appointment letter!

188
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,140
Then, I will get a good sleep. So, you two...

189
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,050
do not try anything funny. Okay?

190
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,940
Your Highness...

191
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,240
The dancer woke up?

192
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,410
Mother, did you happen to see the dancer's face?

193
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,950
They were guarding her so tightly.

194
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,140
I heard no one saw her face except the crown prince and her court lady.

195
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,380
Gosh, I am sure the crown princess is also curious to death right now.

196
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,420
Yoong, you see, that Crown Princess was being an eyesore

197
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,600
and acting high and mighty in front of me.

198
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,570
She said she was the first wife, and I am not.

199
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,230
What is so great about being the first wife?

200
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,300
The first wife is not even here, so I am the one in power.

201
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,930
Are you saying the dancer chosen by the king became the crown prince's concubine?

202
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,100
I think that is what happened.

203
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,350
In that case, what happened to Kyera?

204
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,120
That is my question.

205
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,260
No one reported catching an assassin that night, either.

206
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,310
Grand Prince, I will have Wind Knives find Kyera inside the palace right now.

207
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,970
There is no more time to waste.

208
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,750
We cannot move hastily.

209
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,270
Grand Prince, Kyera might be in danger.

210
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,020
We do not know

211
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,990
if she is in danger or

212
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,610
if the danger is already over.

213
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,320
Are you saying...

214
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,060
Kyera might have lost her life already?

215
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,980
Even if that has happened,

216
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,930
it cannot be helped.

217
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,580
 Your Highness, please have a good night! 

218
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,110
I am pretty sure this is the palace.

219
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,710
But why do I not remember anything?

220
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,850
W-What in the world?

221
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,940
- Who is it? 
 - Who is it?

222
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,270
What is this?

223
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,930
 Who are you? 

224
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,630
 Stop there! 

225
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,380
Why are they going into the storage shed?

226
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,760
Very good at martial arts?

227
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,130
Was it a man?

228
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,150
It was a man.

229
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
 Is it Kyera? 

230
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,030
Something feels off about that storage shed.

231
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,920
Why am I so good at fighting?

232
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,070
And my hands are so rough, too.

233
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,590
Are dancers good fighters as well?

234
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,650
No.

235
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,020
Once Sajo Hyeon finds out,

236
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,770
he will kick out Consort Hyo right away.

237
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,970
No, no, no...

238
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,500
Crown Prince, did you call for me?

239
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,970
Your Highness, you are bleeding!

240
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,080
You were biting your lips this hard to not sleep?

241
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,760
I-I am fine.

242
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,680
Your Highness, please go to bed.

243
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,130
At this rate, if Your Highness' secret gets exposed—

244
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,320
Shut your mouth!

245
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,750
What if someone hears you?

246
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,240
I am sorry, Your Highness.

247
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,250
You came just in time.

248
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:35,710
Do not use sleeping incense and stuff to put me to sleep.

249
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,310
If I catch you doing that,

250
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,680
I will strike you right there and then.

251
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,520
Eunuch Neung, prepare the bath right now.

252
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,570
Make it extremely cold so my body will freeze!

253
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,520
So cold!

254
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,440
Your Highness, are you okay?

255
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,990
I am fine.

256
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,360
Put more ice in! More!

257
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,530
Y-Yes.

258
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,060
Eunuch Neung, did you call for me?

259
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,030
Yes, Ji Jeon.

260
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,720
You need to come with me

261
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,860
to Cheong Ta.

262
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,890
Only Ak Hee is allowed to see Shaman Cheong Ta alone.

263
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,120
What if he finds out?

264
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,460
That is not the problem right now.

265
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,440
That Ak Hee—

266
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,650
I mean, if Ak Hee keeps staying up like that,

267
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,670
our real crown prince's body will be in shambles.

268
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,390
On top of that,

269
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,720
what if the Crown Prince's dual personality gets exposed?

270
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,410
Will His Majesty let Crown Prince be?

271
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,710
You said the crown prince grew another personality

272
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,150
right after His Majesty took the throne. Right?

273
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,910
Gosh, I was frightened out of my wits that day.

274
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,950
 Crown Prince! 

275
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,790
 Gosh, he is taking a nap, huh? 

276
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,590
 Eunuch Neung? 

277
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,590
 Crown Prince! 

278
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,790
 Guess what I brought. 

279
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,720
 Ta-da! 

280
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,600
 They are beautiful textiles. 

281
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,610
 You like them, right? 

282
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,730
 Stop bringing these things! 

283
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,750
 I throw them out, and there comes more. 

284
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,850
 I throw them out, and there comes more again! 

285
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,090
 I have endured more than I should. 

286
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,570
 But these things are really not for me. 

287
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,590
 Your Highness, what is the matter? 

288
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,930
 Your Highness, my foot. 

289
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,210
 My name is Ak Hee. 

290
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:10,810
 My name is not Sajo Hyeon. It is Ak Hee! 

291
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,040
So, because the crown prince took a nap that day...

292
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,610
Yes! No wonder. The young crown prince

293
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,920
never took naps, and that was why.

294
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Because his personality changes when he sleeps.

295
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,880
He just happened to take a strong cold medicine that day.

296
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,470
Does that mean Ak Hee hid his presence from you until that day?

297
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,010
That is what I am saying! Ak Hee, that brat is

298
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,600
just so darn good at acting.

299
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,430
He fooled me, pretending to be the crown prince,

300
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,680
hiding his wicked temper as much as he could!

301
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,310
Gosh, how poor is our real crown prince?

302
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,130
He could not even tell me about it because he was too kind.

303
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,740
Looks like this is the place.

304
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,910
Oh, you are right. Let us go.

305
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,440
Ak Hee has not slept for four days?

306
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,610
Yes.

307
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,640
You should have put him to sleep. What were you two doing?

308
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,950
You should have used sleeping incense behind the folding screen or something.

309
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,560
He would fall asleep, then.

310
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,190
Well, the thing is, after he found out last time,

311
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,980
Ak Hee hid away all the sleeping incense.

312
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,570
You two are such hopeless people.

313
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,570
I cannot help.

314
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,560
Two personalities sharing one body is

315
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,090
a curse from the heavens above and

316
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,220
a judgment by the universe.

317
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,230
I cannot meddle with it.

318
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,410
Cheong Ta, could you share some sleeping incense if you have some?

319
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,130
I do not have any. He took them all.

320
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,670
Is there no other way?

321
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,620
Well...

322
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,540
Take your leave now.

323
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,260
Cheong Ta.

324
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,720
Please help us.

325
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,140
We cannot let the crown prince's health deteriorate like that.

326
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,360
I said for you to leave.

327
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,380
Cheong Ta.

328
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,550
I beg of you.

329
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,120
 Will you trust me? 

330
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,680
She said she trusts me.

331
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,870
She said she will.

332
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,100
 A fake is a fake forever. 

333
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,500
I am real now.

334
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,870
I am the real one you trust.

335
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,250
Ak Hee, hang in there.

336
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,060
Just for a bit.

337
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,370
This is too small of an amount.

338
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,670
I am not sure if it will work.

339
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,110
That cheap Cheong Ta. He could have given more.

340
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,250
Please fall asleep.

341
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,720
Please fall asleep.

342
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,850
I cannot fall asleep.

343
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,770
I cannot.

344
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,910
Crown Prince, are you awake?

345
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,160
I am entering now.

346
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,210
Did I sleep in?

347
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,390
Yes, you were very tired.

348
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,620
It does not feel like I slept.

349
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,380
What did you do to me last night?

350
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,830
It does not feel like...

351
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,320
I-I...

352
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,370
I did not...

353
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,910
do anything.

354
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,350
Your Highness!

355
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,270
It was here, huh.

356
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,670
Eunuch Neung, prepare to leave.

357
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,110
Sorry?

358
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,670
To where?

359
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,290
The drapery.

360
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,750
I need to go and work.

361
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,240
Your Highness, you are back!

362
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,160
It is great to have you back, Your Highness!

363
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,280
 Your Highness! 

364
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,600
Eunuch Neung!

365
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,540
You wretched old fart.

366
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,090
You dare put me to sleep?

367
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,160
You!

368
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,560
Ak Hee did this so he would not fall asleep?

369
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,750
What were you two doing when he was doing this?

370
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,620
I deeply apologize, Your Highness.

371
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,180
I deeply apologize.

372
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,250
Wait.

373
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,030
Ak Hee lasted four days when he usually sleeps a lot?

374
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,270
What happened while I was gone?

375
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,210
Go on and tell me, Eunuch Neung and Ji Jeon Seo.

376
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,250
The thing is...

377
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:37,310
What did Ak Hee do this time?

378
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,120
Your Highness!

379
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,930
Is this why you told me to bring you my clothes?

380
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,260
So, you can wear a disguise and leave?

381
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,570
Hong Goon, please!

382
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,480
Please let me leave.

383
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,890
I cannot stay here as things are.

384
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,190
I must go outside and find out who I am.

385
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,830
Who could you ever be? You are Your Highness Consort Hyo!

386
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,850
Tomorrow is the installation ceremony. If you leave like this,

387
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,480
I will get at least 100 beatings, Your Highness.

388
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,640
- 100 beatings? 
 - Yes.

389
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,400
So please calm down for my sake, if anything, Your Higness, and—

390
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,680
In that case, come with me.

391
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,920
- Sorry? 
 - Come with me.

392
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,900
From what I saw, you only do hard work here, which is no good.

393
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,610
Come outside the palace with me.

394
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,660
Okay? Let us go.

395
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,220
Wait, n-no!

396
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,580
- Let us go. 
 - Your Highness, please do not do this!

397
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,640
Come on, come with me!

398
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,890
You are so strong!

399
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,390
My goodness, she is supposed to be the crown prince's concubine.

400
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,200
But with a lowly one...

401
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,570
Gosh, they are having a ball.

402
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,050
It is not her.

403
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,380
She is not the dancer from the birthday banquet.

404
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,600
That is not her.

405
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,900
- It is not... 
  - Crown Prince has arrived! 

406
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,740
 The crown prince has arrived! 

407
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,950
- Hurry up, hurry up, and go inside. 
 - No!

408
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,840
This is for the better. I am going to tell him honestly and leave.

409
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,790
P-Please, you have to get changed—

410
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,560
Crown Prince, have you come?

411
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,700
- Are you the one? 
 - Sorry?

412
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,160
Yes, I am...

413
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,080
Did you dare to—

414
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,140
Come inside.

415
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,150
Everyone else, stay here.

416
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,850
Oh, this is...

417
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,380
I will explain.

418
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,110
Such a keen eye...

419
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,380
Sorry?

420
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,040
 Ak Hee has no eyes for women, as expected. 

421
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,360
Oh, the reason why I dressed up like this is...

422
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,900
Crown Prince, I would like to leave—

423
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,340
- Who are you? 
 - Sorry?

424
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,720
What is your identity?

425
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,440
You already know—

426
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,920
That is what I want to know, too!

427
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,300
You did not tell me when I asked you all this time.

428
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,200
- You are a dancer? 
 - You said I am a dancer.

429
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,540
Why did you come in all the way here?

430
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,620
How did you seduce the crown prince and come inside the palace?

431
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,480
That is what I want to know, too.

432
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,330
You are married. Why on Earth would I—

433
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,040
Do you also not remember—

434
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,440
Are you mocking me right now?

435
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,210
Did you think I would be fooled if you acted ignorant like this?

436
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,200
What is the matter with you?

437
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,100
Looks like you will need to be locked up and tortured to open your mouth.

438
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,840
Eunuch Neung, are you there?

439
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,450
Fine, lock me up and give me beatings!

440
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,270
If it means my memories will come back, I would do anything, too!

441
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,390
Memories?

442
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,100
You know my memories were gone when I woke up after four days, but you do this to me?

443
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,030
You said it would be a secret among you, Hong Goon, and me.

444
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,800
So why are you doing this?

445
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,160
 Is it Ak Hee's trickery? 

446
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,250
By the way, Your Highness, let us say you lock me up in prison.

447
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,670
But what about your reputation?

448
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,180
What?

449
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,000
I heard there is a lot of controversy about me inside the palace.

450
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,340
Because you ignored the regulations of the Inner Court and

451
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,970
brought me to the concubine's pavilion here by force.

452
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:40,310
However, what will people say if you change your mind like this?

453
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:46,500
Would they not say it looks like the behavior of a madman?

454
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,420
A madman?

455
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,800
Did you also hear the rumors about me?

456
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,840
Rumors?

457
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,310
I never heard such things.

458
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,540
I was just taking your actions as an example—

459
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,010
Do you truly dare to mock me?

460
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,940
You even mentioned the madness to belittle me!

461
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,780
Eunuch Neung and Ji Jeon Seo, take this woman right now and—

462
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,130
Your Highness, this is bad!

463
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,510
H-His Majesty has called for you.

464
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,130
I heard he is extremely angry.

465
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,500
What is the reason?

466
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,020
I do not know, either.

467
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,590
Let us go.

468
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,420
He told you to come with Her Highness Consort Hyo.

469
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:41,760
So, you are saying that Ak Hee took the dancer His Majesty chose first?

470
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,950
Yes, Your Highness.

471
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,860
What a wretched evil spirit.

472
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,420
Your Highness.

473
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,860
One moment.

474
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,690
Yes, Your Highness.

475
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,330
Mark my words.

476
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,920
Do not say a single thing in front of His Majesty.

477
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,630
What if His Majesty asks a question?

478
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,670
I will answer instead,

479
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,570
so do not even breathe and stay put as if you are dead.

480
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,680
Understood?

481
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,950
How can an alive person pretend to be dead?

482
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,900
His Majesty must have called for me because he is curious.

483
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,260
Why are you so talkative?

484
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,630
Do not be worried.

485
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,540
I will do well.

486
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,080
Ow, over there!

487
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,930
It hurts over here.

488
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,370
Your Majesty, are you in too much pain?

489
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,500
I will summon the physician right away—

490
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,130
It is fine! Even the physician cannot fix this.

491
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,700
This is why you should drink in moderation—

492
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,440
 Crown Prince has arrived. 

493
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,720
Tell him to come in!

494
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,000
Your Majesty, did you want to see me?

495
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,050
Sit down.

496
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,850
Crown Prince, what is the meaning of this?

497
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,860
Why did your concubine change?

498
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,690
Why did you take a different woman, not the one I chose?

499
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,650
I am asking why you did such a thing, fooling me and the Inner Court.

500
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,500
Have you lost your voice—

501
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,990
Your Majesty...

502
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,730
Hurry up and speak.

503
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,620
This woman is...

504
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,130
The thing is...

505
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,010
this woman is...

506
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,640
I deemed your actions were manly the last few days.

507
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,330
Have you returned to being a cowardly nerd?

508
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,840
Were you looking manly only because of your madness?

509
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:08,150
 However, if you change your mind like this, what will people say? 

510
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,300
 Would they not say it looks like the behavior of a madman? 

511
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,560
She was not my type.

512
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,820
What did you say?

513
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,780
The dancer you chose.

514
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,430
She was not my type.

515
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,710
Therefore, I took another dancer.

516
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,370
I spent a night with this woman and

517
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,740
I liked her, so I took her in as my concubine.

518
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,660
You liked her?

519
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,600
I wanted to have a picky acumen regarding women, just like you.

520
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,020
I reckoned you would generously

521
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,280
allow it even if you found out.

522
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,310
Because that is what a real man does.

523
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,130
Lift your head, Dancer.

524
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,180
Lift your head!

525
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,310
- Your Majesty— 
 - Yes.

526
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,920
 Kyera! 

527
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,720
Are you the woman who captivated the crown prince's heart?

528
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,010
Are your lips sealed?

529
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,630
- Your Majesty— 
 - I also...

530
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,680
was captivated by the crown prince.

531
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,510
What did you say?

532
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,810
You were captivated?

533
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,330
Yes.

534
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,050
Did the crown prince...

535
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,660
Did the crown prince really...

536
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,120
Did you really captivate that woman?

537
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,200
So, this means you captivated the woman you chose, huh?

538
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,030
That is right. That is what a future king should be like.

539
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:22,220
Including women, you need to know how to captivate all things in this world.

540
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,380
You need to know how to have things your way!

541
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,400
That is my son.

542
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,850
That is my heir.

543
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,360
Crown Princess, I will announce your arrival.

544
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,370
It is fine. I forgot something.

545
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,460
I told you to stay quiet.

546
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,130
What made you think it is safe to run your mouth?

547
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,110
He laughed.

548
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,200
It is fine since His Majesty laughed, right?

549
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,550
Laugh—

550
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,570
You were only lucky.

551
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,820
You almost lost your life back there.

552
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,190
I might have lost it even if I stayed silent

553
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,100
if I trusted my luck only.

554
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,870
I needed to do whatever I could in that situation instead of just trembling.

555
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,780
H-How dare you make an improper remark!

556
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:44,040
I will find a way for you to leave the palace.

557
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,340
Keep that in mind and wait.

558
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,710
His Majesty let out a laugh?

559
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,300
Yes, it looks like he is quite happy with the dancer wench.

560
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,720
Is that so?

561
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,940
At this point, there will be no way to stop the concubine installation ceremony.

562
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,920
This is why you should have set the date far away. Why did you—

563
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,130
So that I look bold and confident.

564
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,270
The crown princess who has not an ounce of envy.

565
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,730
That is who I am, Geum Hwa.

566
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,310
Just wait and see.

567
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:33,590
The dancer wench will never make it to the concubine installation ceremony.

568
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,290
Chae Ryeon, could it be—

569
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,150
Do not worry, Father.

570
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:43,120
I will never get blood on my own hands.

571
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,220
He was crying and saying he missed me yesterday,

572
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,100
but today, he...

573
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,360
A change of heart already?

574
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,940
Oh, he has a want for nothing, huh?

575
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,230
You are the king's son, huh?

576
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:05,620
What did I even see in him to like him?

577
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,580
I think I saw him somewhere.

578
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:34,170
 I deemed your actions were manly the last few days. 

579
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,970
 Have you returned to being a cowardly nerd? 

580
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,770
 Were you looking manly only because of your madness? 

581
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,980
Ak Hee is a man and

582
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,050
I am a coward?

583
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,470
Correct. You are a coward, and I am a man.

584
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,250
Agree?

585
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,810
 All right, do it by tomorrow, then. Take care. 

586
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,050
No way.

587
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,900
This is a great idea, Your Highness.

588
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,910
When your mind is cluttered, there is nothing better than doing what you love.

589
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,780
I will be back soon. Make sure Consort Hyo—

590
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,380
Make sure the woman who is residing over there does not cause any trouble.

591
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,520
Yes, Your Highness.

592
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,430
Where is he going?

593
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:46,320
Have you all been doing well?

594
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,620
Is he that happy?

595
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,570
I got you, I got you!

596
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,150
You finally showed up.

597
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,000
Who are you?

598
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,510
Who am I?

599
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,300
Do you know me?

600
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,620
What now? Of course I do!

601
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:12,700
The woman who ran away after making a big hole here.

602
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,500
- I did? 
 - Forget it.

603
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,480
Do you know how much money I used to fill up this hole?

604
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,590
Give it.

605
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,880
Give me the repair cost!

606
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,390
The thing is, I do not have...

607
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:27,780
 Owner, are you here? 

608
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,100
Yes, Young— W-Wait here.

609
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,870
Young Master—

610
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:34,050
Hey, Young Lady! Hey!

611
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,410
- Have you come, Young Master? 
 - What is the matter?

612
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:46,340
The young lady who made the hole there was here.

613
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,390
- That woman did? 
 - Yes.

614
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,940
Where is she?

615
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,520
Sorry?

616
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,340
My money!

617
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,570
Gosh, my money.

618
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,070
What a shameless young lady.

619
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,820
She ran off not to pay the repair cost. My money...

620
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,420
- Mister! Mister! 
 - Geez!

621
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,440
Young Lady!

622
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,600
Oh, w-wait a moment.

623
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,610
Young Lady.

624
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,730
Give me my repair cost for the roof!

625
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,440
Mister, you know who I am. Right?

626
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,880
Who am I? I really have no memory.

627
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,010
Oh, you have no memory, huh?

628
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:33,140
In that case, you are saying you will not pay. Right?

629
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,320
Follow me.

630
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,440
No, no, it is fine!

631
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,910
Your memories will be brought back if you spend a few days in prison.

632
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:40,980
Come here!

633
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,070
I swear it is true!

634
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,900
It is true. Please trust me!

635
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,240
- Owner! 
 - Young Master!

636
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,780
- I am not lying! 
 - Huh? My goodness!

637
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:55,760
I-I am sorry. I—

638
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,650
Consort Hyo—

639
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,960
What brings you here?

640
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,640
Thank you for paying the roof repair cost.

641
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,750
 How did Ak Hee acquaint this dancer? 

642
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,980
Right, so, Crown Prince, you—

643
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,080
You and I met at the drapery, huh?

644
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,630
You fell for me while making my clothes. Right?

645
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:35,690
But that does not mean I would have fallen for you.

646
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,870
Since you came out on your own, you can return on your own. Right?

647
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,860
Return? To the palace? Again?

648
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,940
Do you not want to go back?

649
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,270
Of course! The concubine's pavilion is so stifling!

650
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,510
I do not even know who I am.

651
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,370
And it looks like you do not know that much about me, either.

652
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:59,240
I'll find out who I am if I keep roaming around here, do you not think?

653
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,290
 Ak Hee, it is your turn to be tricked. 

654
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,760
Do as you please.

655
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,720
Really? I really do not have to go back—

656
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:15,720
So, you are saying you will abandon me here and go.

657
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,060
You were so happy I became your concubine.

658
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,470
Was he really that happy?

659
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:24,350
"Was he"?

660
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,060
Do you have another personality, Your Highness?

661
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,330
That would not be possible.

662
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,660
That is right. You lack nothing since you are the crown prince.

663
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,380
Okay, I will do that.

664
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,820
Since I already left the palace, I will remain here.

665
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,980
Goodbye now.

666
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,540
Hey...

667
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:56,530
This might be for the better.

668
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:05,390
How can he change like that overnight?

669
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:12,780
The dancer chosen by His Majesty did not come back?

670
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,350
Are you sure?

671
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:20,580
Yes, she is getting concubine classes right now since she was chosen by His Majesty, no?

672
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:26,600
Tell me everything you know about this person.

673
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:32,690
Oh, she was the only one from another dancing troupe, so we do not really know her.

674
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,980
The chosen dancer disappeared and

675
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,010
an unknown child became the concubine?

676
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,530
Excuse me. Do you know me?

677
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,540
I do not know you.

678
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,380
Do you know me by any chance?

679
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,530
No, I am too busy for this. Go away.

680
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:56,020
D-Do you know me, by any chance?

681
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,550
No, no, I do not.

682
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,790
How is it that there is no one who knows me?

683
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,190
If I frequented the drapery,

684
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,300
I must have roamed around here, too.

685
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,590
Goodness, my daughter!

686
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,050
Goodness, how pretty you are.

687
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,010
My daughter, what do you want?

688
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,840
 Father! 

689
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840
 Goodness, my daughter! 

690
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,810
 - Mother!  
  - Wol! 

691
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,460
- Huh? 
 - What about this one?

692
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,590
You like this one more?

693
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,830
Why am I so sad?

694
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,300
I said I am not going!

695
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,030
Please help me—

696
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,410
You wench, stand up!

697
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:53,400
- I said I am not going. 
 - Shut up—

698
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,160
Run away right now!

699
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,920
 Get her! 

700
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,360
Who are you? You have a pretty enough face for replacement.

701
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,070
Let us go!

702
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:44,090
Your Highness.

703
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,280
Get her!

704
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,420
Those soldiers are probably everywhere by now.

705
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,700
I will be careful.

706
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:42,870
Crown Prince, you might get in trouble because of me,

707
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,070
so just tell His Majesty I ran away.

708
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,260
How thoughtful of you.

709
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,030
All right, then.

710
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,850
Where can you go when you are limping like that?

711
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:01,820
Well, there has to be a place where I can be.

712
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,700
Your court lady is unfortunate.

713
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,100
How will she endure 100 beatings?

714
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,470
Oh, is Hong Goon really getting 100 beatings?

715
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,880
She will also be exiled

716
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,050
to this place called Beolseob Island.

717
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,150
Your Highness!

718
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,830
The soldiers are everywhere in the market—

719
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,760
Your Highness Consort Hyo.

720
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,540
I will make way.

721
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:10,480
♫  The life hidden  ♫

722
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,880
 I will use you and get the better of Ak Hee. 

723
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,930
 I will have Hong Goon escape first and run away. 

724
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,610
 I cannot have her beaten and exiled because of me. 

725
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:36,190
♫  The feelings seeped through the fallen leaves  ♫

726
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,700
I am sorry.

727
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,000
My goodness.

728
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:55,110
♫  Fall more on this lotus tonight and shine on this night more  ♫

729
00:57:55,110 --> 00:58:04,820
♫  The dawn is lingering around my ears quietly, making me sad  ♫

730
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:14,020
♫  I set afloat my deep feelings onto the moon, folded neatly  ♫

731
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:21,060
♫  The tears I swallowed will disappear when I die  ♫

732
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,940
Why did I bother making this?

733
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:28,830
 I know, right? 

734
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,120
Hey, Sajo Hyeon.

735
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:59,390
Are you pulling a trick on me?

736
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:05,780
Huh? Why bother bringing back my woman?

737
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,810
Because you like that woman. So, I need to pay her my respects, too.

738
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,300
How funny.

739
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:22,900
You are trying to get me in the end, using my woman.

740
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,080
You thought I would not know?

741
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,930
Be honest with me here.

742
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,270
You are sleepy, right?

743
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:32,970
I am not sleepy at all.

744
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:36,170
Gosh, you lie every time you speak.

745
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:40,310
You are the one who lies every time you speak, not me.

746
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:10,550
Hong Goon, are you still mad at me?

747
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,370
Whatever.

748
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:17,270
I was so scared after you disappeared.

749
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:20,470
I am sorry.

750
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,340
That is why I came back.

751
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,400
That is why the concubine installation is...

752
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:31,030
Do you feel that burdened about getting installed as a concubine?

753
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:34,550
Yes, I feel so much pressure.

754
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,310
What do I do?

755
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:38,370
Your Highness.

756
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,900
What is the matter?

757
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,620
The criminal, come and receive the rope.

758
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,200
Sorry?

759
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,800
Hong Goon! Oh, my.

760
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:55,960
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

761
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,320
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

762
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:03,640
Crown Prince, I am coming in!

763
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,740
Eunuch Neung, what is the matter?

764
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:13,340
Crown Prince, H-Her Highness Consort Hyo was taken

765
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:18,660
to the i-interrogation grounds just now!

766
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,040
For what reason?

767
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,930
They found what is thought to be an assassin's bandana under the fences of Consort Hyo's pavilion,

768
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:28,580
along with Her Highness Consort Hyo's dancing attire!

769
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,210
What?

770
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,780
 Kyera, did you get caught? 

771
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:50,130
Consort Hyo, you remember those clothes. Right?

772
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:55,320
They are the dancing clothes you wore on His Majesty's birthday banquet.

773
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,810
 He said they cannot know I lost my memories. 

774
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,550
Yes.

775
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:12,250
In that case, you must remember this as well.

776
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:18,620
This is...

777
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,370
Looks like you remember

778
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:25,380
that it is the mask you wore at my birthday banquet.

779
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:31,910
You shall answer in all honesty from now on, Consort Hyo. Do you understand?

780
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:33,570
Yes.

781
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:39,380
Are you the assassin who infiltrated my birthday banquet?

782
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,250
Sorry?

783
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:46,370
I am asking if you are the assassin who infiltrated to harm me.

784
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,950
No, there is no way. How could I?

785
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:51,950
There is no way?

786
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:55,030
There is no way.

787
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:57,150
That is an odd answer.

788
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,400
Answer honestly, Consort Hyo.

789
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,200
You are the assassin who infiltrated His Majesty's birthday banquet disguised as a dancer!

790
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,030
I am not!

791
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,620
Head Minister, bring that child.

792
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

793
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:22,080
Consort Hyo, you remember this girl. Right?

794
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,080
 How could I remember her when I do not even know who I am? 

795
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,750
Answer me, Consort Hyo.

796
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:35,770
I do not really know.

797
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:43,190
This girl is a dancer who danced with you at His Majesty's birthday banquet.

798
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:46,860
She was also the girl His Majesty had chosen.

799
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,980
 I do not think it was her. 

800
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,880
 She is not the dancer His Majesty chose. 

801
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,330
 This is Jin Moo Dal's trick. 

802
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:03,470
 The prodigal king would not even remember a dancer's face. 

803
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:07,300
I will ask you one more time. Do you remember her?

804
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:15,210
All right, you look at this woman's face clearly.

805
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:17,610
Is it a face you know?

806
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,530
Yes.

807
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:28,290
She is a dancer who danced with us at His Majesty's birthday banquet.

808
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:30,410
And?

809
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,460
It is okay.

810
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:37,290
You are not guilty, so you will be sent back home

811
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,630
as long as you speak the truth.

812
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,520
She is an assassin.

813
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:48,400
What?

814
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,860
I saw her entering His Majesty's bath, dressed as an assassin.

815
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:57,440
And I was too scared and ran away.

816
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,750
I will have you ripped apart to death!

817
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:04,040
Who is behind you? What is your identity?

818
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,880
Your Majesty, it was not me.

819
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,730
Right, you would not confess that easily.

820
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:14,990
What are you all doing? Get that wench tied down for punishment right now!

821
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,770
Pardon me for a moment, please, Your Majesty!

822
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:37,900
Did your ears go deaf? Tie her down right now!

823
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,170
Your Majesty, I will confess the truth.

824
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,550
That woman is...

825
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,990
indeed an assassin.

826
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:01,030
Crown Prince!

827
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:08,110
Still, the crown prince spoke the truth, huh?

828
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:11,410
What are you all doing? Tie her down!

829
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,430
Crown Prince, why did you not tell me?

830
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:16,030
You did not tell me, although I asked you so many times, but why—

831
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,500
 Wait! 

832
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,610
 Please hear me out. I will tell you my current condition, Your Majesty! 

833
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:26,070
 Hey, hey, Sajo Hyeon! What are you doing right now? 

834
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:29,570
 This was your intention? Trampling down my woman? 

835
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:31,870
 Hey, Sajo Hyeon! Hey, you punk! 

836
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,980
 Hey! 

837
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:42,020


838
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:49,000
♫  Never lost, I will never lose you  ♫

839
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,820
♫  Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self  ♫

840
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:02,580
♫  Never lost, when this darkness ends  ♫

841
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:09,080
   

842
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,450
 From the first moment, why do you make me feel... 

843
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:15,480
 - Get lost.  
  - Stop, Sajo Hyeon! 

844
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,640
 How dare you force your way out of my body? 

845
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,530
 His eyes look different. 

846
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:24,700
 This will not do. Since things ended up this way... 

847
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,310
 We will have to cut the tail. 

848
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:29,170
 There is an evil spirit inside my body. 

849
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:32,530
 Let us lock up Sajo Hyeon. 

850
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:35,120
 Do you really believe that? 

851
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:40,340
 Because I feel like I will face the truth I cannot handle if my memories come back one day.
