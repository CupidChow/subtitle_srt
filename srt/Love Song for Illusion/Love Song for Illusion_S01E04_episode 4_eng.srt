8
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,670
 I am sorry. 

9
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,280
Consort Hyo.

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,120
 Did you make me lose my memories? 

11
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,830
 Why? 

12
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,180
 Was it revenge for trying to kill your father? 

13
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,790
 Is that why you still took me in, knowing I am an assassin? 

14
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,630
 That man is not the crown prince! 

15
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,430
 He is an evil spirit! 

16
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,490
 Or did you do it because you are an evil spirit? 

17
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,560
Is something wrong?

18
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,820
You look sad.

19
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,150
It is fine if nothing is wrong.

20
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,700
Your Highness.

21
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,650
I will do as you said.

22
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,690
I will stay here longer until my memories come back.

23
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,560
 A crown prince possessed by an evil spirit. 

24
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,000
 Are you being punished? 

25
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,420
 Were you the one who was punished by the heavens 

26
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,930
 for the massacre of my family? 

27
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,410
 Father! 

28
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,960
 You are now this country's only royal descendant. 

29
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,050
 Please survive and plan for the future. 

30
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,780
 Father. 

31
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,760
 Mother. 

32
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,370
   

33
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,750
Why do I feel so uneasy?

34
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,650
I have a terrible feeling.

35
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,060
I am sure bonghamsal worked successfully.

36
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,530
 Dear heavens, hear my prayer. 

37
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,680
 Hear my prayer. 

38
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,350
   

39
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,540
 Is it still not over? 

40
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,530
 - B-Be— 
 - What? 

41
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,600
 Be respectful! 

42
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,370
   

43
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,260
Gosh, no way. I am sure it worked.

44
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,070
Yes.

45
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,920
What the heck? Is it Eunuch Neung?

46
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,840
Cheong Ta?

47
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,150
 If bonghamsal worked successfully, 

48
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,340
 he should have turned back into Crown Prince Sajo Hyeon. 

49
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,530
- Eunuch Neung. 
 - Your Highness?

50
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,350
You have come back, Your Highness!

51
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,350
How dare you come in here when you should be at the laundry!

52
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,310
T-This humble one only...

53
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,820
c-came to get my stuff.

54
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,770
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

55
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,610
Kyera, pull yourself together.

56
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,900
Get your revenge, no matter what.

57
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,810
 Bring more alcohol. 

58
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,650
 I told you to bring more— 

59
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,240
 You are... 

60
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,100
 Yeon Poong Hak's wife. 

61
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,180
 Are you happy? 

62
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,810
 You massacred your best friend's family and 

63
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,060
 live a life of debauchery in the people's blood. 

64
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,800
 Are you happy now? 

65
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,360
 Unable to see an inch into the future, 

66
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,460
 do you feel you own the world? 

67
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,450
H-Hear ye, is anyone there?

68
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
 You are worse than a beast. 

69
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,110
 All the resentful spirits who died will take your life tonight. 

70
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,790
 Fall into hell, Sajo Seung! 

71
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,560
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

72
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,260
Your Majesty!

73
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,020
 Your Majesty. Your Majesty! 

74
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,300
Your Majesty!

75
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,410
You wretched wench!

76
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,150
W-Why do you keep harassing me?

77
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,630
Why are you still roaming this world?

78
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,450
Your Majesty, did you have another nightmare?

79
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,080
It is me, Consort Cheong Myeong, Your—

80
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,280
Your Majesty!

81
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,290
Your Majesty!

82
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,160
Get the physician here right now!

83
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,770
It was a dream, Your Majesty.

84
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,710
It was all but a dream, Your Majesty.

85
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,050
Alcohol.

86
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,430
Bring me alcohol.

87
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,780
Your Majesty, it is already deep into the night.

88
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,050
Your Majesty, I will give you needle treatment, so rest—

89
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,710
Bring me alcohol! Alcohol!

90
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,570
Bring me alcohol! Bring me alcohol.

91
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,980
Your Majesty!

92
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,560
Bring me alcohol!

93
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,360
Your Majesty!

94
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,930
Set up the table and alcohol! What are you all doing?

95
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,560
Your Majesty.

96
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,840
I am in so much pain!

97
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,500
Your Majesty, I told them to set up the table and alcohol, so please wait a moment.

98
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,220
You will be at ease soon.

99
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,810
Hurry up and get to it, all of you!

100
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,200
You are the only one who cares about me, Yoong.

101
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,080
Right, Your Majesty? Grand Prince Yoong is the only one who cares.

102
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,310
Grand Prince Yoong is standing guard in the room next to us every night.

103
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,420
He is worried something will happen to you, Your Majesty...

104
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,470
Grand Prince, what is the matter?

105
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,700
It is nothing.

106
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,560
Ha Rang.

107
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,720
Master Yang.

108
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,320
 You forgot this. 

109
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,530
I failed my mission and even lost my memories.

110
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,980
I am too ashamed to face them.

111
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,750
I will succeed no matter what.

112
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,170
Even if it means I will be back as a corpse,

113
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,160
I will kill Sajo Seung this time, for sure.

114
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,990
Consort Hyo, you are prettier than you were at the installation ceremony.

115
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,510
Crown Prince must be treating you so well.

116
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,700
Yes, Consort Hyo's face is pretty like crepe myrtle flowers.

117
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,080
I am eternally thankful.

118
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,180
 I cannot believe he was the son of a concubine. 

119
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,370
 Why did he sponsor a group of assassins when he is the king's son? 

120
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,790
 Is it his resentment as a bastard child? 

121
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,430
You did not even show your face last night.

122
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,020
It must not matter to you whether your father dies or lives.

123
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,400
- I am sorry— 
 - Your Majesty,

124
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,170
Crown Prince had fallen weak last night—

125
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,990
Forget it!

126
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,610
What use are you as a man when you are so fragile?

127
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,110
You can all leave now since you greeted me.

128
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,500
Your Majesty, are you feeling the pain here by chance?

130
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,420
From here to all the way here,

131
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,140
it feels like I am being stabbed by a knife.

132
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,240
If so, you should try pressing those spots in pain like this.

133
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,490
Consort Hyo, you are being rude.

134
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,130
How dare you speak up.

135
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,430
Your Highness Consort Cheong Myeong, will you help?

136
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,270
Consort Hyo, do it yourself.

137
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,240
Do you not hear me?

138
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,380
Consort Hyo, come over here and do it yourself.

139
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,530
See? It must be giving him more pain.

140
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,590
Come out here, Consort Hyo.

141
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,760
Consort Hyo!

142
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,140
Just endure it a bit longer, Your Majesty.

143
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,990
How do you feel, Your Majesty?

144
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,260
My goodness. Bring the physician right now—

145
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,250
How odd.

146
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,930
The pain is gone as if it was washed away.

147
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,190
Consort Hyo, did you study medicine?

148
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,970
I heard Consort Hyo has been studying medicine in her spare time

149
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,050
due to her vast interest since she was young.

150
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,030
Really? My goodness.

151
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,360
The skills you have studied in your spare time are better than those of the royal physician.

152
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,250
Our Royal Family gained a great physician, huh?

153
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,960
How amazing.

154
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,850
Crown Prince, have I had a vast interest in medicine when I was young?

155
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,060
I would not know that.

156
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,790
Since you do not remember,

157
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,430
I had no choice but to concoct a story.

158
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,820
I see.

159
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,390
- Thank you. 
 - I am the thankful one.

160
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,470
I scored some points from His Majesty, thanks to you.

161
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,930
Well, I guess the crown princess was displeased.

162
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,240
 Is he the evil spirit or the crown prince? 

163
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,700
By the way, what have you been pondering about since last night?

164
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,700
Wondering if I am the evil spirit or not?

165
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,290
Yes, Eunuch Neung told me that your personality changes whenever you sleep.

166
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,130
Well, then.

167
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,620
Who do you think is standing in front of you, Consort Hyo?

168
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,710
Not sure.

169
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,050
I do not know which one is the evil spirit,

170
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,460
but I noticed your temperatures are different.

171
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,670
Temperatures, huh?

172
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,110
One day, you are as cold as ice, and

173
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,240
another day, extremely hot.

174
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,960
In that case,

175
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,520
what about now?

176
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,720
Right now,

177
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,250
you are neither hot nor cold.

178
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,010
Really?

179
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,790
Interesting.

180
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,150
 Whomever you may be, I will not forgive you. 

181
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,990
 If you are the evil spirit, I cannot forgive you for erasing my memories. 

182
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,950
 If you are the crown prince, 

183
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,000
 I cannot forgive you since you are my enemy's son. 

184
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,610
Hong Gun, are you okay?

185
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,680
Goodness! Goodness, stand up.

186
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,390
Do you think you can get up?

187
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,910
I am deeply sorry, Your Highness Consort Hyo.

188
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,800
I was rushing because of an urgent matter.

189
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,170
Not at all. It is okay.

190
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,790
- Grand Prince. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

191
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,860
Never mind.

192
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,720
 Kyera, do you have something to tell me? 

193
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,630
All right, then.

194
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,100
Your Highness?

195
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,170
 Sajo Yoong, you tried to kill me. 

196
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,440
Why did he try to kill me?

197
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,740
Because I might cause harm to Wind Knives?

198
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,510
 Be careful. Someone will come to kill you. 

199
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,570
Did Master Yang agree to this?

200
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,110
Or did he do it without Master Yang knowing?

201
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,940
Or...

202
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,090
did Master Yang have a change of heart?

203
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,660
 Young Lady Wol! 

204
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,510
Who am I supposed to trust here?

205
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,770
Who is it?

206
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,820
Why did you come so late? I told you to tell me quickly!

207
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,830
So, how did bonghamsal turn out?

208
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,440
D-Did it succeed? It worked. Right?

209
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,200
It did not work?

210
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,270
D-Damn it!

211
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,490
I need to run away! I need to run!

212
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,490
Do not tell him you saw me.

213
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,950
G-Goodness, Sir Ak Hee!

214
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,900
Congratulations!

215
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:20,260
Congratulations on the success of bonghamsal!

216
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,440
Why are you shaking so much when you are happy for me?

217
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,500
W-Well, I was too happy to see you in good health.

218
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:35,500
I am shaking from the joy, and it is making me dance.

219
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,030
By the way, you are not Ak Hee. Right?

220
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,130
You know you are not.

221
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,950
You are not him! Hurray, it worked!

222
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,640
It worked!

223
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,890
Hurray!

224
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,040
How dare you lie to me!

225
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,890
You dared to lock me up by plotting with Ak Hee?

226
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,590
N-No, Ak Hee—

227
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,350
That is absolutely not the case!

228
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,550
Can you not see how you came back?

229
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,290
I did everything in my power to bring you back!

230
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,620
Come on, talk. You should have let me know sooner!

231
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,940
I did not even know and was worried about bonghamsal.

232
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,600
I could not even sleep a bite or eat a wink!

233
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,140
All I could do was think about you, Your Highness.

234
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,350
Gosh, I freaked out at first, too.

235
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,100
Your Highness? You are the real crown prince. Right?

236
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,500
Your Highness, why must you trick me like this?

237
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,100
Hate you...

238
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,370
I told him not to tell you.

239
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,610
Since you released me, I reckoned you can lock me up again at will.

240
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,580
So I have been watching you quietly.

241
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,310
O-Oh, I see. Lock you up again?

242
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,210
I can never do that.

243
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,110
No one can escape bonghamsal once they are locked up.

244
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,900
- Cheong Ta. 
 - Yes.

245
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,480
Why did Ak Hee erase Consort Hyo's memories?

246
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,710
The thing is, I-I do not really know—

247
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,920
He erased Consort Hyo's memories with the sleeping incense you provided!

248
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,010
O-Oh, probably...

249
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,340
From what I assume,

250
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,460
Ak Hee had a crush on Consort Hyo.

251
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,980
So he erased her memories and made it look like they were in a passionate relationship.

252
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,940
There is something more than that. Spill it.

253
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,450
I do not really know more than that, either.

254
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,950
 Even so, you erased that woman's memories. 

255
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,500
 Why on Earth did you do that, Ak Hee? 

256
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,100
 What can I do, then? 

257
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,240
 If I left her memories intact, she would never be together with me. 

258
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,480
 Just think about it! How can you love your sworn enemy's son? 

259
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,080
 But still! How can you defy fate like that! 

260
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,800
 Whatever. It could not be helped. 

261
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,830
 Anyhow, this is a secret only between you and me. 

262
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,600
 So, just try talking about it somewhere. Your life as a shaman will be over. 

263
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,040
 Mark my words. 

264
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,220
I cannot tell you.

265
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,320
- You know what it is. Speak! 
 - I cannot tell you.

266
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,530
What did you say? Tell me.

267
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,970
- Spill it! 
 - I cannot tell you!

268
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,450
Huh?

269
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,700
What is this?

270
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,800
Cheong Ta is using a cheap trick.

271
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,330
Hey, you!

272
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,670
Are you showing off just because you are a famous shaman?

273
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,720
W-Whoa—

274
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,040
Cheong Ta?

275
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,740
 Crown Prince, stay away from Her Highness Consort Hyo. 

276
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,510
 Let her leave. 

277
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:20,110
 Otherwise, your life will be in peril. 

278
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,540
 Please remember my words. 

279
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,110
What on Earth...

280
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,380
Do you think this is true, Your Highness?

281
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,180
M-My goodness.

282
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:42,160
Your Highness, why would Cheong Ta tell you to make Her Highness leave you?

283
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,910
Right, could it be because she has become close to Ak Hee already?

284
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,760
Was Consort Hyo that close to Ak Hee?

285
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,250
Well, Ak Hee was really quite good to Consort Hyo.

286
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,380
He had honey falling out of his eyes when he looked at her.

287
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,110
Well, then.

288
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,050
Did Consort Hyo like him, too?

289
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,600
Probably so?

290
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,290
I am sure Ak Hee was pretending to be you, wandering everywhere,

291
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,160
and fell in love at first sight when he saw Her Highness!

292
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,790
With your good looks as a weapon,

293
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,540
I am sure he made all the moves he could.

294
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,050
Gosh, that wicked Ak Hee!

295
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,300
- Eunuch Neung! 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

296
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,440
Even though Ak Hee is an evil spirit,

297
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,630
he had once resided in my body.

298
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,250
It bothers me to hear you badmouth him every time.

299
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,890
Gosh, Your Highness, I apologize.

300
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,050
Let us go.

301
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,950
My big mouth. My big mouth. My big mouth.

302
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,000
I need to pick my words carefully!

303
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,540
Your Highness!

304
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,330
Ji Jeon!

305
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,420
Ji Jeon!

306
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,750
You know I cannot get on by myself!

307
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,400
 Consort Hyo, were you really Ak Hee's woman? 

308
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,820
 Have you returned to being a cowardly nerd? 

309
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,150
 Were you looking manly only because of your madness? 

310
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,880
 I will change. 

311
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,010
 I am going to be better than Ak Hee. 

312
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,160
Your Majesty, though we fortified our guard,

313
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,100
the theft and arson by the poor are endless.

314
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,430
Strengthening the border is only a makeshift solution.

315
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:30,880
I reckon the wise solution is to provide additional rice for free to the poor who are causing trouble.

316
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,690
That is also only a makeshift solution!

317
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,820
Your Majesty, you cannot console your people who turned into rioters due to poverty

318
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,630
merely by providing free rice.

319
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,260
I think teaching how to make a bowl of rice is wiser than giving a bowl of rice.

320
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,940
Therefore, please punish the criminals by sentencing them

321
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,810
to working the barren lands instead of beatings.

322
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,180
If allowed to take 80% of whatever they make

323
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,670
on those barren lands, they will not commit

324
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:29,280
anymore theft or arson, even if someone were to beg them to do so.

325
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,060
Your Majesty, working the barren lands—

326
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,920
Head Minister!

327
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

328
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,230
Do as Crown Prince said.

329
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,150
Today's assembly is over now.

330
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,540
Crown Prince.

331
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,420
What is the occasion?

332
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:15,570
Is it wrong for the crown prince to attend the assembly?

333
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,260
It is because you have not attended so far.

334
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,940
In that case, do you plan to keep attending the assembly?

335
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,620
If you do, I will have your spot prepared from now on—

336
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,270
Your question itself is wrong, Grand Prince.

337
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:36,420
An assembly is supposed to be led by His Majesty and myself, the crown prince.

338
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,290
Am I supposed to get permission from you?

339
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,090
Sajo Hyeon!

340
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:06,060
How dare you, you half-witted nerd!

341
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,050
No way!

342
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,660
No way.

343
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,370
There must be a way.

344
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,500
A way.

345
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,980
The path to this location is in bad condition.

346
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,490
- Therefore... 
 - Yes.

347
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:57,400
 Sajo Yoong, a secret army, too? 

348
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,350
 Stay away from Her Highness Consort Hyo. 

349
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,160
 Let her leave. 

350
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,390
 Otherwise, your life will be in peril. 

351
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,980
Did you go for a walk?

352
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,690
Yes, I felt a bit stuffy in here.

353
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,980
You must be.

354
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,750
Since you are confined in the palace all day.

355
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,940
There is no need to feel confined anymore.

356
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,060
Leave the palace.

357
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,940
I told you I will not leave.

358
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,020
Why?

359
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,030
I want to stay by your side.

360
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,110
I might be the evil spirit.

361
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,160
If you are, you would try to make me stay.

362
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,300
- How come? 
 - Because the evil spirit is the fake one.

363
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,260
His greed would best his morals.

364
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,480
His greed, huh?

365
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,130
Are you talking about his greed for wanting to have you by his side?

366
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:13,260
I would say it is closer to lust than greed.

367
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,070
Are you also being shaken by the evil spirit's lust?

368
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,900
- Are you that starved for affection? 
 - Your words are too much, Your Highness.

369
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,190
Leave at once. I do not wish to see you anymore.

370
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,380
I cannot do so.

371
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,170
I am a concubine who has been officially installed.

372
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,770
If you really want me to leave,

373
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,420
please kick me out harshly yourself.

374
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,830
 I will keep an eye on you. 

375
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:47,570
 I will make sure to watch with my own eyes how you realize 

376
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:52,310
 what a trivial creature the evil spirit you have feelings for is. 

377
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,410
In the mountains?

378
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,920
Yes.

379
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,040
I heard Consort Hyo spends all day in the mountains.

380
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,390
And she comes back around sunset with dirt all over her.

381
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,160
Why is she doing that?

382
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,260
Who knows?

383
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,810
They said Crown Prince does not even head toward Consort Hyo's pavilion.

384
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,700
So she must be mad about that. Right?

385
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,260
It must be to discipline her mind.

386
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,400
I am back, Your Highness—

387
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,490
Gosh, I said I will do it!

388
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,010
I am almost done.

389
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,950
Why did the crown princess want to see you?

390
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,700
Oh, well.

391
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:58,220
Crown Princess told you not to go outside starting tomorrow.

392
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,980
She is worried something might happen to you.

393
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,670
Really?

394
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,780
- Are you going to boil this? 
 - Yes.

395
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,670
N-No, I will do it.

396
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,760
- What do you mean? 
 - Gosh, it is okay. I can do it—

397
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,230
You have dirt all over your hands, Your Highness!

398
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,310
Do I have to keep fanning?

399
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,470
Consort Hyo's pavilion reeked of medicinal herbs.

400
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,240
It must be a concoction for the crown prince.

401
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,010
That was why she was wandering in the mountains.

402
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,240
W-Whoa, what do I do?

403
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,770
Gosh, what is this?

404
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,990
W-What happened?

405
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,430
Y-Your Highness, this is bad!

406
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,860
The concoction was...

407
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,600
What about the concoction? Did it topple or something?

408
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,760
How did you know?

409
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,760
It cannot be helped.

410
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,540
It cannot be helped?

411
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,300
You went through so much to get those medicinal herbs!

412
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,630
These are what you are talking about.

413
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,400
Gosh, I spent all night preparing them.

414
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:29,650
Your Highness, did you expect something like this to happen?

415
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,740
Hong Gun, can you deliver this to the crown prince?

416
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,320
- Consort Hyo did? 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

417
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,820
 Crown Prince, I will be waiting for you in front of His Majesty's chamber. 

418
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,790
You came for me.

419
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,410
When will you be leaving?

420
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,400
When will you kick me out?

421
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,310
I prepared a concoction for His Majesty.

422
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,420
I asked to see you to present it to him together.

423
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,570
You will help me gain His Majesty's favor with a mere medicine?

424
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,890
You are doing anything to catch my attention.

425
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,540
Did I really catch your attention at all?

426
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,760
I am glad, then.

427
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,310
 I-I am sorry. 

428
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,470
 You were that child, huh? 

429
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,490
Your Majesty, your body and mind will be at ease if you take this medicine.

430
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,870
Who knows if they will be at ease or

431
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,880
rest in peace forever inside the coffin?

432
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,340
Forgive me, but I will consume it first—

433
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,180
Consort Hyo obtained those herbs from wandering the rough mountains.

434
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,520
If you will not take it, I will take it instead.

435
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:53,040
You are a fool who is head over heels for Consort Hyo, huh?

436
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:58,690
I will soon be meeting my grandson.

437
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,250
Are you happy now?

438
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,870
He will soon be meeting his grandson?

439
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,420
Your Majesty, it is a bit uncomfortable. Right?

440
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,730
I am at ease.

441
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,360
My headache is also gone, perhaps because of the medicine I just took.

442
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,650
I am glad.

443
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,540
Crown Prince.

444
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

445
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,680
Would it be okay if I call over Consort Hyo like this from time to time?

446
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,410
Just as my physician, that is.

447
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,990
Will you be okay?

448
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,160
How could I answer, otherwise? Please call for me whenever, Your Majesty.

449
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,690
Consort Hyo is the boss of our Royal Family.

450
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,940
I make a request to the Crown Prince and

451
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,490
the Crown Prince makes a request to Consort Hyo.

452
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,160
So, that would make you the true boss, would it not?

453
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,790
I do not deserve your graceful compliment, Your Majesty.

454
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:13,440
By the way, Consort Hyo, you look familiar for some reason.

455
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,810
Is that so?

456
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,250
You seem to take after someone a lot.

457
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,200
Someone I know quite well.

458
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,950
Right.

459
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,590
It is that person.

460
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,750
That person I know very well.

461
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,410
My son!

462
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,890
They say a married couple resembles each other.

463
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,250
 Your Majesty, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is here. 

464
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,230
Come in!

465
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,630
Your Majesty.

466
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,120
I must have interrupted a lovely time you were having.

467
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,700
I will come back later.

468
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,460
No need to come back. Just cut to the chase and leave.

469
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,970
The Minister of Hunting just notified me

470
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,270
that the northern borders' boars and wolves are headed to the capital.

471
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,940
But it is not time yet.

472
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,390
He said it happened due to a fire at Mt. Baekhwa on the northern border.

473
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:38,200
I am reporting because they will pass our capital's mountains by dawn tomorrow.

474
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,790
Really?

475
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,530
We need to go out to hunt, then!

476
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,500
Yes, I will make the preparations, Your Majesty.

477
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,880
You should also join us, Crown Prince.

478
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,750
You showed a great performance at the last hunt, too.

479
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,540
The crown prince can stay.

480
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,510
He does not even seem to be in his mad state.

481
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:02,540
- Yes, that will be for the better— 
 - I will be attending as well.

482
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,120
Crown Prince, please do not overexert yourself.

483
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:12,210
I am so thankful you care for me so dearly, Brother.

484
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:17,160
I will try overexerting my half-witted self at the hunt again this time.

485
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,180
So please give me a hand.

486
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,660
W-Wait, that one stung a bit.

487
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,120
Gosh, I am sorry.

488
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,000
No, no, it is okay.

489
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,130
I told them not to let anyone in.

490
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,080
Why do you only practice indoors?

491
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,760
Now that you got complimented by His Majesty,

492
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,020
do my words sound like a joke to you?

493
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,870
I apologize.

494
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,750
I do not like hearing the slashing sound of the winds.

495
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,690
When I am outside, that sound is too clear.

496
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,720
The sound of the arrow ripping the wind apart.

497
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,850
What are you going to do about tomorrow's hunt, then?

498
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:03,360
Not sure. Perhaps the evil spirit will help me.

499
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:10,210
The wind is just the wind.

500
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,780
Wherever you are, try lingering around yourself and yourself only.

501
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,930
Do not avert and look straight on.

502
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:21,580
The sound of the wind ripping apart will disappear.

503
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,050
Is your mind a bit more at ease now?

504
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,690
When will you leave?

505
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,490
As long as you are here, my mind will always be disturbed.

506
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:24,170
I feel like I could fly since I am on the hunt with my son after such a long time.

507
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,640
I feel the same way, Your Majesty.

508
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,210
There is a red boar coming from the west!

509
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,840
All right, let us go!

510
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,140
 The wind is... 

511
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:10,150
 just a wind. 

512
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,560
 Wherever you are, try lingering around yourself and yourself only. 

513
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,050
 Do not avert and look straight on. 

514
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,230
 The sound of the wind ripping apart will disappear. 

515
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,620
Stop! Stop!

516
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,570
He is down.

517
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:21,050
Crown Prince has hunted down the boar!

518
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:27,300
Do not do this, Grand Prince. Grand Prince!

519
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,140
Crown Prince has finally succeeded, huh?

520
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,110
Where is it?

521
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,400
Your Majesty, it seems Crown Prince was too startled.

522
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,940
Grand Prince Yoong hunted the boar. It was not me.

523
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,290
Your Majesty!

524
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:53,500
I only helped a little bit because Crown Prince almost had it.

525
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,160
Your Majesty.

526
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,540
I will pierce your forehead next time

527
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,840
if you mock my son again.

528
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,420
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

529
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,130
Half-wit...

530
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:35,690
Just like you,

531
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,990
I am also ashamed of you.

532
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,060
 You will have to lead Asatae after me. 

533
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,120
 But what the hell is all this? 

534
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,930
 You cannot. This one is for Mother. 

535
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,210
 I am going to give it to Mother! 

536
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,670
 More than three months have passed since your mother died. 

537
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:07,420
 Yet you have not come to your senses! 

538
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,940
 It was supposed to be for Mother. 

539
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,200
 I was going to give it to her on her birthday. 

540
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,530
 Get off me! 

541
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,040
 I know why you ordered Mother to die by poison. 

542
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,920
 It is not because Mother envied Brother Yoong's mother. 

543
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,810
 What did you say? 

544
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,360
 It is because she always said the right things to you. 

545
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,750
 You could not endure Mother's honest opinions. 

546
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,370
 So you... 

547
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,570
 What about me? 

548
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,540
 Go on. 

549
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,630
 What about your father? 

550
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,200
 Go on and say it. 

551
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,590
 What about me? Huh? 

552
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,700
 Go on and say it before I rip your mouth apart. 

553
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,940
 - Say it! 
 - I am ashamed... 

554
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,020
 of you, Father. 

555
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,690
All right, let us take a shot.

556
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,030
 Gosh! Come on now! 

557
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,480
 Gosh, seriously! 

558
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,920
What are you doing here?

559
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,810
I was passing by, and the crepe myrtle flowers were too beautiful.

560
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:26,400
I did not know there were crepe myrtle trees here, too.

561
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,130
All right, then.

562
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,850
You can stay...

563
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:50,110
for a moment if you want.

564
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:12,330
Today is the date my mother passed away.

565
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,170
I did not know.

566
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:24,060
No one knows.

567
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,870
No one is supposed to remember.

568
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,390
 You should not... 

569
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:44,100
 have done it. 

570
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,180
 You massacred General Yeon Poong Hak, 

571
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,960
 your best friend and his family. 

572
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,250
 Including his young daughter, too. 

573
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,090
 Shut your mouth! 

574
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,210
 You wicked wench. 

575
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:04,580
 What are you all doing? Make her drink more of the poison! 

576
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,630
 M-Mother! 

577
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,680
 Mother! 

578
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:21,590
 Mother! Mother! 

579
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:27,350
 Mother! Mother! 

580
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,200
 Mother! 

581
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,770
How was the hunt today?

582
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,270
Square one.

583
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,560
Everything is completely back to square one.

584
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,410
I guess the evil spirit did not help you.

585
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,160
The evil spirit is no more.

586
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,620
A shaman called Cheong Ta sealed him away.

587
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,590
You do not have to believe me.

588
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,740
You can resent me.

589
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:48,790
Technically, it is my fault you ended up here.

590
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:52,010
The evil spirit inside my body had feelings for you

591
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,060
and made you live at the palace.

592
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,790
If what you said is true,

593
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,700
how could it be your fault?

594
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,510
Because the evil spirit possessed me due to my fault in the first place.

595
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,870
Because I am a half-wit.

596
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:14,750
I told you I only use the indoor archery field

597
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:18,560
because I hate to hear the sound of the wind slashing. Right?

598
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:24,510
Whenever I hear that sound, I am reminded of that day.

599
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,460
That house I saw when I was young.

600
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,460
The site of the massacre.

601
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,740
The swords ripping through the air,

602
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,720
the screams,

603
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,740
and the dead bodies.

604
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,880
The young girl who was there.

605
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,380
I am sure she died.

606
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,680
I could not save her.

607
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:59,390
Just like how I could not save my mother.

608
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,990
Her eyes are still vivid in my mind.

609
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:10,700
Even more so when I hear the slashing of the wind.

610
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,960
That is why I was punished by the heavens.

611
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,800
That is why.

612
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:23,950
That is why an evil spirit possessed me.

613
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:30,390
 This man remembers that day. 

614
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:34,140
 That day has become a deep wound for him, just like me. 

615
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:43,870
♫  Because I was always here, and you were always there  ♫

616
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:52,330
♫  Please take me anywhere, a place, go away  ♫

617
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:06,100
♫  Please hold me so I do not waver, I am tired  ♫

618
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:18,860
♫  Please hug me so I can relax  ♫

619
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,800
♫  Because I was here  ♫

620
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,130
Be careful, Your Majesty.

621
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,670
I will call over a court lady.

622
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,860
Forget it!

623
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,190
My Yoong is taking care of me so well,

624
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,780
so who else would I need?

625
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,050
I do not know what to say, Your Majesty.

626
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:39,500
Now, then. This humble one will do it for you.

627
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,290
Yoong!

628
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

629
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:47,360
You are a really reliable fellow.

630
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,680
I am thankful.

631
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,450
Be satisfied with what you have now.

632
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,830
Pardon?

633
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,680
I am telling you not to overtake my son.

634
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,790
Your Majesty...

635
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:09,260
You know very well that my bastard children are all over this country.

636
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,450
A bastard child is only a bastard child.

637
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,570
Sajo Hyeon, the heir, is my only real son.

638
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,450
You said we should have...

639
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,200
been switched, did you not?

640
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,140
You said I should have been the heir.

641
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,630
That I should have been the crown prince. Did you not say so?

642
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,250
You mean, you actually believed that?

643
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:45,670
How could you not know I was only trying to provoke my son?

644
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:48,860
That is so unfair, Father.

645
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:53,460
How much more effort and hard work

646
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:59,350
must I display for you to consider me your son?

647
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:04,760
Poor thing.

648
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,440
Why do you keep pretending to forget the fact you and I both know?

649
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,380
You are not even my real son.

650
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,190
Did you think I did not know?

651
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:24,500
I took you in and made you a grand prince when you were not even my blood.

652
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,960
I believe I have done enough as well.

653
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,360
Do you not think so?

654
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,750
I must sleep now!

655
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,320
Consort Hyo takes such a good care of me,

656
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,900
so I get good sleep, and my mind is at ease.

657
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,350
 I told His Majesty that Yoong is his son. 

658
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:01,840
 He took me while knowing you are my husband, 

659
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,140
 so he just went along with it. 

660
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:07,580
 Good job. That way, it is beneficial for all of us. 

661
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,320
 You became prettier since becoming a concubine. 

662
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:15,970
 Gosh, what is with you? 

663
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:17,750
 What if Yoong sees us? 

664
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,710
 You said Yoong went to play by the stream. 

665
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:22,270
 Do not be like that and come over here. 

666
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,680
 Grow more mustache. You look just like Yoong. 

667
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,050
 Okay, I will. 

668
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,830
Hold on a moment.

669
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,850
How could this be...

670
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,750
She is Ak Hee's woman.

671
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:47,240
But Ak Hee is gone now.

672
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,030
Consort Hyo, I gave it a lot of thought.

673
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:54,060
No matter what I think, kicking you out harshly is against the rules of the Inner Court.

674
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,080
If you wish, you may stay here.

675
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,300
Stay by my side, Consort Hyo.

676
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:06,390
- Stay by— 
  - Your Highness! 

677
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,940
 Her Highness the Crown Princess is here— 

678
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:11,750
What is the matter, Crown Princess?

679
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,330
Your Highness, do you know Consort Hyo's true identity?

680
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:16,640
What identity?

681
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,410
I heard Consort Hyo is the only daughter of General Yeon Poong Hak, who was executed 10 years ago

682
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:24,250
for plotting a rebellion, Yeon Wol.

683
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:28,120
Wait! Where did you hear such nonsense?

684
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:32,160
Consort Hyo is sure to possess this dagger.

685
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,890
Search Consort Hyo's pavilion right this moment

686
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:38,660
and interrogate her strictly.

687
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,630
Calm down first, Crown Princess.

688
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,370
I will take care of this matter.

689
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:44,590
So, keep quiet about it for now. I ask of you.

690
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:48,850
However, she might harm His Majesty in the meantime.

691
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:51,460
Where is Consort Hyo right now?

692
01:03:55,990 --> 01:04:00,440
Thanks to you, I sleep very well these days.

693
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,710
I do not even have nightmares.

694
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:05,050
I am glad, Your Majesty.

695
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:13,000
I do not even let the Royal Physician take care of me this comfortably.

696
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:21,700
 Ak Hee is the only one who knows whether Consort Hyo is an assassin. 

697
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:27,460
 Ak Hee is the only one who knows what happened that day in His Majesty's bathroom. 

698
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:33,870
Ak Hee, is that why you erased Consort Hyo's memories?

699
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,360
Did he know everything all along, then?

700
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,590
 I am sorry. 

701
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,120
I am sorry.

702
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:45,140
Your Highness, there is something I must tell you.

703
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:49,690
I will do as you said.

704
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,910
I will leave.

705
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,120
Leave?

706
01:05:54,820 --> 01:06:00,130
You said you will stay in the palace until I kick you out.

707
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:02,300
I did.

708
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:07,090
However, there is something I told you way before that.

709
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:10,150
That I will leave once my memories come back.

710
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,740
My memories...

711
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:19,150
came back.

712
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:25,730
When did your memories come back?

713
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,530
Not too long ago.

714
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:32,360
You hid it even after your memories came back?

715
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,830
You knew who you are,

716
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:38,690
but you kept it hidden from me?

717
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,450
In that case,

718
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,840
were you not sincere that day?

719
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,110
That day was...

720
01:06:57,110 --> 01:07:01,240
Is your name Yeon Wol?

721
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,200
Will you say you do not know that name?

722
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,850
Even after your memories came back?

723
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:12,310
Did you already know who I was?

724
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:14,380
Are you really...

725
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:19,140
an assassin who came in to kill His Majesty?

726
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,170
Tell me.

727
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,900
Right now.

728
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,720
Yes.

729
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:34,660
Did you also keep quiet about getting your memories back

730
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:38,000
for the purpose of killing His Majesty?

731
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,960
 Tell me it is not true. 

732
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,130
 Say it is not true. 

733
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,640
You deceived me.

734
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,220
But I showed my sincerity.

735
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,690
Why?

736
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,830
Why?

737
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:13,700
Your Highness!

738
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,980
Your Highness, there is a terrible incident.

739
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,440
His Majesty has...

740
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,550
His Majesty...

741
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,960
Your Majesty.

742
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,840
Father.

743
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,870
Father!

744
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,660
Father! Father!

745
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,780
Father! Father...

746
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,230
Father...

747
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,420
Father!

748
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:01,020

How...

750
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,850
How could you...

751
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,020
How could you!

752
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:22,430
I did not do it.

753
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:30,010
   

754
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:36,930
♫  Never lost, I will never lose you  ♫

755
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:43,740
♫  Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self  ♫

756
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:50,860
♫  Never lost, when this darkness ends  ♫

757
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,290
 I cannot... 

758
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:54,280
 I cannot ever forgive you. 

759
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,660
 Who could have killed the king? 

760
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,080
 - I do not fear dying. 
 - Your Majesty! 

761
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,950
 I am only sad you are mistaken about me. 

762
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:07,130
 Sajo Hyeon, you will take your own life tonight. 

763
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:09,990
 Crown Prince hung himself out of severe sadness. 

764
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:12,080
 Sajo Hyeon! 

765
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,280
 Crown Prince has ordered the execution of the guilty. 

766
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,570
 Father. Mother. 

767
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,260
 Your daughter is coming to meet you soon.
