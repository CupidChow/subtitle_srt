Sir Ak Hee.

13
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,600
Yeon Wol.

14
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,780
Your Majesty?

15
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,600
Yeon Wol!

16
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,750
♫  When the deep darkness consumes me  ♫

17
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,580
♫  My eyes soak up the sadness  ♫

18
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,400
♫  My heart is scarred deeply  ♫

19
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,310
♫  Please fill it up with your warmth  ♫

20
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,870
♫  Because I was always you  ♫

21
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,530
♫  And you were always me  ♫

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,940
♫  I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere  ♫

23
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,360
♫  The place where you are  ♫

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,400
♫  Even if it'll only be a moment  ♫

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,580
♫  Please take me anywhere, a place, go away  ♫

26
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,490
Are you...

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,430
Are you really His Majesty?

28
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,510
Yes, it is really me.

29
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,600
♫  So I do not waver  ♫

30
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,350
Y-You are hurt again.

31
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,930
I am okay.

32
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,250
I missed you.

33
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,700
I really missed you, Yeon Wol.

34
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,860
♫  Doing my best to hide my tears  ♫

35
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,820
♫  Though I try my best to smile brightly  ♫

36
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,430
 I know you help me and treat me well, 

37
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,560
 for which I am thankful. However... 

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,670
 But the thing is... 

39
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,520
 You never had feelings for me 

40
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,360
 as your lover? 

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,100
 Right? 

42
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,800
 I am sorry. 

43
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,970
Leaving?

44
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,110
Ak Hee told you to leave. Right?

45
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,640
Because he cannot stand us loving each other.

46
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,630
It was my decision.

47
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,910
With Grand Prince Sajo Yoong being so reckless like that,

48
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,870
I must leave for your sake, at least.

49
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,000
I will not let you.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,530
There must be a way.

51
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,650
I will take care of this, so please—

52
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,140
It is only for a while.

53
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,440
Wherever I am, I will only think of Your Majesty.

54
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,360
I will only look for a way to help and protect you, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,710
I must get going now.

56
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,010
Yeon Wol.

57
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,230
I will set everything right without fail.

58
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,350
After that,

59
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,440
let us be together for sure.

60
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,540
Yes, for sure.

61
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,490
My feelings were right.

62
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,430
His Majesty was not insane.

63
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,350
Your Majesty.

64
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,800
Are you leaving?

65
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,280
Yes.

66
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,210
Great choice.

67
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,860
Do not ever come back.

68
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Tell me about the evil spirit.

69
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,900
I mean the evil spirit haunting His Majesty.

70
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,980
Did you think I did not know?

71
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,850
You seized His Majesty's feelings and

72
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,490
controlled even the lust of the evil spirit inside His Majesty's body!

73
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,670
Your Majesty, His Majesty is in a very difficult situation right now.

74
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,230
Please be of assistance to His Majesty.

75
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,680
Arrogant wench.

76
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,380
How dare you!

77
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,350
You wench!

78
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,600
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is only looking for a way to harm His Majesty.

79
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,240
Ward off the Grand Prince and help His Majesty.

80
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,100
Even if you didn't lecture me, I would have done just fine on my own.

81
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,420
So, just leave the palace and never come back.

82
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,810
That is how you can help His Majesty. Do you understand?

83
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,010
 He will not seek me out for a while... 

84
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,660
 since he will want to find out where I am going and what I am doing. 

85
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,290
How far did Kyera go?

86
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,440
I hear she entered Chuyoung Valley.

87
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,060
I am sure she noticed we were following her.

88
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,810
Keep following her, nonetheless.

89
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,290
Quietly watch where she goes.

90
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,740
Yes, Grand Prince.

91
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,700
By the way, what is the reason you are keeping Kyera alive?

92
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,570
Since she left the palace now, it is easier—

93
00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:00,010
It is easier to kill her now, so why do I keep her alive?

94
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,160
Kyera will be...

95
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,600
used in a very handy way to cut off Sajo Hyeon's ankle.

96
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,980
 After Your Majesty disbanded the amusement troupe allowed them to return, 

97
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,240
 a part of the amusement troupe's women left the palace, but... 

98
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,240
They said she should have been back five days ago, but she is still not here!

99
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,260
 ...none of the women have returned. 

100
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,790
Goodness!  Your daughter is not home yet, either?

101
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,540
Wait! They never came home?

102
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,850
 Also, another part of the amusement troupe still remains in the palace. 

103
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,130
 Hurry up and come! 

104
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,810
 - Bye! 
 - In the dark of the night, 

105
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,850
 they are sending them out in small numbers. 

106
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,750
 Master Yang is secretly tracking them. 

107
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,970
Eunuch Neung.

108
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

109
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,400
We have nowhere to return to.

110
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,840
So, they let us stay here for a while.

111
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,480
We have nowhere to go, and they feed and shelter us here in the palace.

112
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,340
We are thankful.

113
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,020
That is true.

114
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,690
Did the ladies who left the palace first all go back home, then?

115
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,780
Probably?

116
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,550
Did they write letters saying they got home safely?

117
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,850
Oh, we do not really know how to read and write.

118
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,810
That is what our eunuch in charge told us.

119
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,840
They do not seem anxious.

120
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,130
Rather, they are thankful.

121
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,990
They were probably assured to keep them at ease.

122
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,970
They must be happy enough to stop being a part of the amusement troupe, thanks to His Majesty.

123
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,460
By the way, did Yeon Wol really leave?

124
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,300
Without even telling me anything?

125
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,240
She must have thought it was not a farewell for life.

126
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,060
You will be able to meet her again.

127
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,350
Father!

128
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
- Father! 
 - Nu Ru!

129
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,810
Hi, Unni. Father.

130
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,950
Who?

131
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,310
Me?

132
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,130
N-Nu Ru is your daughter?

133
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,740
No, she is not!

134
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,110
My, now. Who are you calling your father?

135
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,580
You will get me in trouble.

136
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,770
I am sorry, Eunuch Neung.

137
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,890
How can you look just like my father?

138
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,760
Whoa, how amazing.

139
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,910
Nu Ru, you do not look like your father, huh?

140
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,760
Since you are this pretty.

141
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,140
Hey!

142
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,300
Sweetie, even if your father looks a lot like me,

143
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,000
your father at home will be sad to know you call just anyone your father.

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,420
My father is not home.

145
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,320
- What? 
 - Three years ago,

146
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,880
he went there.

147
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,160
Really?

148
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,620
You remind me of my father.

149
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,620
I am going to get a good look at your face.

150
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,050
M-Me? M-My goodness.

151
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,260
Whoa, Eunuch Neung, you are blushing!

152
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,940
N-No, I am not!

153
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,100
You can have this, Father.

154
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,010
What is this?

155
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,180
It is a donut, huh? I love these.

156
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,810
Really?

157
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,240
My father loved these, too!

158
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,560
I can call you my father. Right?

159
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,070
H-Hey— You said her name is Nu Ru. Right?

160
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,660
Hey, Nu Ru, I am a eunuch, you see.

161
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,280
So, a eunuch cannot really have a daughter—

162
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,070
Court Lady must be looking for me!

163
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,330
Bye, Father! Bye, Unni!

164
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,020
H-Hey, you will trip and fall! Be careful!

165
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,520
Nu Ru is cute. Right?

166
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,350
She is a new palace maid who works in the kitchen.

167
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,920
Really?

168
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,100
She is cute.

169
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,790
Are you going to eat it alone?

170
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,430
I met the amusement troupe's women in person.

171
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,530
They seemed to be eating and doing well, at least on the surface.

172
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,510
It did not seem like they were lying, either.

173
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,840
Even those women must be unaware of the details of what is going on.

174
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,260
What happened?

175
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,120
 It is also suspicious many villages' women are disappearing. 

176
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,120
 The amusement troupe was disbanded, but why are women still being kidnapped? 

177
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,370
Women are still being kidnapped?

178
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,550
 Did Kyera return safely? 

179
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,820
Did you tell Yeon Wol to leave?

180
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,080
I did.

181
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,550
But she did not leave because I told her to.

182
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,990
You know it, too.

183
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:01,070
Kyera is not a woman who would obey what I say.

184
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,030
Well, I guess she listens to you.

185
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,440
We cannot say it was not because of you.

186
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,190
You threatened Yeon Wol to leave, and it bothered you,

187
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,770
which is why you called me over!

188
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,890
She could not help but leave in that situation!

189
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,350
Do you know how close it was for Kyera at the Hall of Spirits yesterday?

190
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,790
Sajo Yoong was as vicious as ever.

191
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,720
Hey, you should be thankful I was there, because if you were there

192
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,710
Kyera would not be alive right now.

193
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,450
As for that, I am thankful.

194
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,450
Gosh, you two are just as polite as the other!

195
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,740
Gosh! I can't stand the sight of you!

196
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:48,050
I heard Cheong Ta said that you and I have no choice but to share this body like we used to.

197
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,990
 Try to hang in there as long as you can 

198
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,790
 until the full moon rises again. 

199
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,450
I will go to sleep from now on and not fight it.

200
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,180
So, what do you say we share the body like before?

201
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,840
No, thank you.

202
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,400
I am going to rest here for good.

203
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,510
You can take it all.

204
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,420
- Ak Hee. 
 - The talk is over.

205
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,610
Oh, right.

206
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,950
What is it?

207
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,000
What are you going to do now?

208
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,180
Sajo Yoong caught on

209
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,660
about you and I switching in between.

210
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,410
- What? 
 - Do you know what Sajo Yoong said?

211
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,000
 I can tell clearly now. 

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,890
 You are not Sajo Hyeon. 

213
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,580
 You are an evil spirit. 

214
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,890
 The parasitic evil spirit in Sajo Hyeon's body. 

215
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,460
Wait! How did he...

216
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,850
Sajo Yoong must have bought out Cheong Ta.

217
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,540
Cheong Ta would never do that.

218
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,760
She knows I know her weakness.

219
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,740
What I mean is he has caught on now.

220
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,970
Gosh! Sajo Yoong must have lived cautiously all his life. He can read people like an open book!

221
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,730
This is all because you acted thoughtlessly.

222
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,520
I told you to be careful so many times!

223
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,700
Oh, my. Why are you yelling at right now?

224
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,610
I told you because I was worried and—

225
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,360
Whatever, then! Leave.

226
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,050
Get out!

227
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,410
Master Yang. Ha Rang.

228
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,230
Kyera, you finally escaped the palace.

229
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,150
Did you turn against Sajo Hyeon?

230
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,990
That is not the case.

231
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,900
Sajo Yoong's killers are following me.

232
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,180
We are aware.

233
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,630
There is a place we must go together.

234
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,270
 Which one are you right now? 

235
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,020
 Are you the evil spirit or Sajo Hyeon? 

236
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,810
Grand Prince Yoong, are you feeling all right?

237
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,160
You got so beat up last night.

238
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,850
I apologize for what happened last night.

239
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,670
Kyera's actions were becoming more cheeky by the day.

240
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,090
So, I meant to lecture her as her elder, but—

241
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,740
You do have the right to lecture her.

242
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,790
I heard you have sponsored Kyera for a long time now.

243
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,410
Rather than having sponsored—

244
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,310
Hence, I kicked her out of the palace.

245
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,330
From now on, she will not cause cheeky problems.

246
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,900
All hail His Majesty!

247
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,570
 Whenever I enter the Royal Council Hall, I feel suffocated. 

248
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:27,010
 It feels like the late king, who called me Half-Wit, is glaring at me. 

249
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,740
 It also feels like the ministers are laughing at me. 

250
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,640
 Will Half-Wit do his job well? 

251
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,930
 I am sure he will mention the tax again. 

252
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,330
 They are all imaginations. 

253
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,740
The more you fear and run away, the bigger those imaginations will grow.

254
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,170
Whenever fear grows, open your mind's eyes widely.

255
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,170
 And look at the ministers clearly in their eyes. 

256
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,380
 "I am not afraid of you all." 

257
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,260
 I am not afraid of you all. 

258
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,480
"I will not run away. I will not back down."

259
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,200
 I will not run away. 

260
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,230
 I will not back down. 

261
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,560
 - I am  
  - "I am... 

262
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,590
Sajo Hyeon."

263
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,990
 I am Sajo Hyeon. 

264
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,930
I seek to come to a conclusion about the issue of increasing taxes we discussed last time.

265
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:39,800
Your Majesty, increasing taxes was found problematic in many practical ways.

266
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,530
It is problematic because the ruling class, including you people,

267
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,780
only seek their own interest.

268
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,250
Your Majesty, I am burdened to tell you this,

269
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:56,730
but I do not think being in a ruling class mandates one to take care of poor people's livelihoods.

270
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,550
Well, then.

271
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,690
What do you think about the Royal Family always having prioritized the nobles' concessions so far?

272
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,380
Sorry?

273
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,050
Your two sons were appointed royal public offices last year

274
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,110
and the year before that, without any conditions, Justice Minister.

275
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,130
Y-Your Majesty, that is—

276
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:25,660
I am clearly watching which position and department your children and kin have been appointed to!

277
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,710
Also, I know you ministers have more than 2,000 seoks of surplus rice

278
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,950
you collected from sharecroppers every year.

279
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,890
I cannot help but think about your selfishness of denying to share

280
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,050
not even a single grain of rice with the starving people!

281
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,740
Finance Minister, what is your thought on this?

282
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,050
Your Majesty, that is—

283
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,640
Stop giving flimsy excuses.

284
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:59,910
Your Majesty, I reckon the decision you made is absolutely correct.

285
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,880
I also agree...

286
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,530
with the Head Minister's opinion.

287
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,200
We will establish a Tax Adjusting Agency today right away, and

288
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,830
thoroughly review Your Majesty's orders to execute them without any flaws.

289
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,930
That is great to hear.

290
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,340
I am more than happy to have you all follow my opinion.

291
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,400
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

292
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,420
 Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty. 

293
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,440
 It is truly a monstrous thing. 

294
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,930
His Majesty is sometimes a bum who is stubborn to no end

295
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,980
and is astute at other times, like today!

296
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,340
My, that is exactly so!

297
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,520
He does not look like a half-wit at all anymore.

298
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,450
I also have gotten odd feelings from His Majesty many times.

299
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,550
It is as if there are two personalities in one body.

300
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,220
Yes, that is why there are those rumors in the capital.

301
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,300
That His Majesty is possessed by an evil spirit!

302
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,040
There would be no smoke without fire.

303
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,760
I am sincerely worried.

304
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,600
Master Yang, why did we come here?

305
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,420
Can you recognize it?

306
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,460
Father?

307
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:12,340
Ten years ago, we buried General Yeon Poong Hak here after Sajo Seung took his life.

308
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,580
Father.

309
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,960
I thought we could not even find his corpse.

310
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,150
Father.

311
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,740
Father.

312
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,320
Kyera, did you forget Sajo Seung massacred General Yeon Poong Hak

313
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,530
and the entire family of Yeon?

314
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,560
Did you forget?

315
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,870
How could I forget?

316
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,920
How could I forget my resentment I cannot forget even after death?

317
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,740
But why are you not turning your back on Sajo Hyeon, your sworn enemy's son?

318
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,340
His Majesty is indeed my sworn enemy's son.

319
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,090
However, his hands are clean.

320
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,570
 I was able to survive 10 years ago, thanks to His Majesty. 

321
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,210
 I am sorry. 

322
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,310
That memory became a traumatic scar for His Majesty as well,

323
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,840
making him suffer even to this day.

324
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,160
That is a just consequence as a descendant of Sajo Seung, the traitor.

325
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,720
I risked my life to bring General Yeon Poong Hak here

326
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,390
to prepare for when your will for revenge might weaken.

327
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,380
I thought such a day would never come.

328
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,080
What would you like to do with me, Master Yang?

329
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:20,590
I cannot serve you anymore, My Lady, for you have abandoned all your duties and...

330
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,230
grew feelings for your sworn enemy's son.

331
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,370
Master Yang.

332
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,800
If you cannot tolerate me, I have no other option, either.

333
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,180
I will cut ties with you.

334
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,950
In that case, since it is a relationship that will end anyway,

335
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,530
it will be beneficial for both of us to

336
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,000
let those bystanders know clearly.

337
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,650
Try to beat me.

338
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,910
If you beat me, I will let you cut ties.

339
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,620
Master Yang, why are you doing this?

340
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,510
Sure, Yang Jae Yi, I will beat you.

341
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,830
Thank you for interring my father.

342
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,130
Please be careful, My Lady.

343
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,920
I will not forget what you did for me.

344
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,300
I won, Yang Jae Yi.

345
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,320
Go back now.

346
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,510
She built a tent in front of Yeon Poong Hak's grave?

347
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,630
Is she trying to mourn for him at this point?

348
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,040
Seeing how Yang Jae Yi left after the duel,

349
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,380
it looks like her ties with the Wind Knives are severed.

350
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,660
You must not look away from the tent even for a moment.

351
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,210
Yes, Grand Prince.

352
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,630
When will the ship to Jinhoi depart?

353
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,380
The night after tomorrow.

354
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,560
The night after tomorrow?

355
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,730
 Please keep walking and listen. 

356
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,870
 The amusement troupe's women and even the villages' women are getting sent to Jinhoi. 

357
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,680
 Jinhoi, you say? 

358
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,460
 Where is the location of the send-off? 

359
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,260
 Port Mihwari. 

360
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,130
 It is a settlement taken over by Jinhoi. 

361
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,300
This is the only time we are helping Kyera.

362
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,850
I am sorry, Master Yang.

363
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,990
This is a letter from the Wind Knives.

364
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:20,600
 The amusement troupe's women and even the villages' women are getting sold to Jinhoi. 

365
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,740
The ship will depart at Port Mihwari the day after tomorrow?

366
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,180
Port Mihwari is Jinhoi's settlement. Right?

367
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,620
They are intentionally using an enemy settlement.

368
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,160
It must be to prevent our military involvement.

369
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,660
Summon the Defense Minister right away.

370
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,130
We must move on the sly.

371
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,360
Your Majesty.

372
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,570
Defense Minister, who does your loyalty belong to?

373
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,750
Of course, it belongs to Your Majesty—

374
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,210
Do not lie.

375
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,630
You swore your loyalty to Sajo Yoong, blinded by your greed.

376
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,400
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

377
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,680
Due to inevitable circumstances, I let Grand Prince Sajo Yoong get the better of me.

378
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,500
Will you work for me from now on?

379
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,360
Yes, of course, Your Majesty!

380
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,340
I swear my loyalty and my life—

381
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,350
It is not just your life.

382
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,910
If you betray me one more time, you and all the members

383
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,740
of your household will be killed as well.

384
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,180
I will make sure to bear that in mind, Your Majesty!

385
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,640
Defense Minister, how many soldiers can we utilize right now?

386
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,250
We can utilize all soldiers,

387
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,590
but Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's henchmen are present everywhere.

388
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,220
It is hard to utilize the soldiers without Grand Prince Yoong knowing?

389
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

390
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,360
In that case, can we utilize the Royal Guards who guard the palace?

391
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,910
The Royal Guards are under the control of Head Minister Jin Moo Dal.

392
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,780
So, it is out of my authority.

393
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,700
I will persuade the Head Minister,

394
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,060
so prepare an elite force with the Royal Guards, Defense Minister.

395
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,090
Be quick.

396
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,110
Yes, Your Majesty!

397
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,330
In the end, you found out as well, Your Majesty.

398
00:30:52,330 --> 00:31:00,530
Are you saying you knew about the women being sold to Jinhoi like animals, Head Minister?

399
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:06,030
Your Majesty, that is what diplomacy is like.

400
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,020
Please do not look at one single thing.

401
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:15,240
Become a wise king who looks at more than three or four things.

402
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,970
That is not what a wise king is!

403
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,300
That is only a half-witted king who is played by a great power.

404
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,700
Since I found out the truth, I will not look the other way.

405
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,300
I will save my people and

406
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,390
punish the wicked who sold them off.

407
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,990
Head Minister, give me a hand.

408
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,270
Mobilize the Royal Guards under your command,

409
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,960
so I can save my poor people.

410
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,700
Sure.

411
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,670
I will happily let you use my Royal Guards.

412
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,340
Thank you, Head Minister.

413
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,490
In that case,

414
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:06,630
what will you give this humble one, Your Majesty?

415
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,490
Head Minister,

416
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,810
I am not haggling for prices with you right now.

417
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,530
I am issuing a royal decree as the emperor.

418
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,450
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.

419
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,320
You said His Majesty's personality changes when he sleeps. Right?

420
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,570
Yes.

421
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:45,460
Is there really no way for His Majesty to not come back even after sleeping?

422
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,470
I already told you.

423
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,250
There is none.

424
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,020
It seems like there is one.

425
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,190
I just said there is none.

426
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,540
The reason I came here today is

427
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,830
to give this back.

428
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,080
I must have lost it for a moment.

429
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,810
It came back just now.

430
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,200
What is the matter, Madam Cheong Ta?

431
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,070
You are my strategist.

432
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,900
I do not want to be your strategist or anything else for that matter!

433
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,040
Looks like you still do not know me that well.

434
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,980
No one is allowed to recklessly dare

435
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,200
say no or refuse to anything I say.

436
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,510
You are not an exception, either, Madam Cheong Ta.

437
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,320
Grand Prince, are you threatening me right now?

438
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,080
What is wrong with me? What is this?

439
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,380
It is a talisman from Tan Ya, a shaman of Jinhoi.

440
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,610
I hear you are not on good terms with Tan Ya.

441
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,380
Madam Cheong Ta.

442
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,880
Help Ak Hee take over Sajo Hyeon's body

443
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,310
and put Sajo Hyeon to eternal sleep.

444
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:10,820
Of course, it would be best to put both to sleep.

445
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,040
I cannot, I will not!

446
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,130
The wind is cold.

447
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,350
Is it going to rain?

448
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,990
You are worried Yeon Wol might be cold. Right?

449
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:38,450
It does not look like it will rain since I see a lot of stars.

450
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,400
You said Yeon Wol has been an assassin for more than a decade.

451
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,000
I am sure she is a veteran when it comes to a tough life.

452
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,930
She must be tougher than what you think—

453
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,950
Eunuch Neung!

454
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,700
How can you say that?

455
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,690
Would you still speak so lightly even when your lover is

456
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,280
sleeping alone in a forest somewhere?

457
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,700
Your Majesty, this humble one cannot have and

458
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,230
is not allowed to have a lover.

459
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,000
I must sleep now.

460
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,130
Are you really going to sleep?

461
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:24,790
Then, tomorrow morning, Ak— That guy will be the one...

462
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,310
She said we are back to the old rules.

463
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,910
So it cannot be helped.

464
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,350
I have to share this body with Ak Hee.

465
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,070
Since he was considerate enough to let me send off Yeon Wol,

466
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,330
I should repay him.

467
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,020
Even if you repay him, he will not be the least bit thankful.

468
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,550
Already?

469
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,730
What do I do?

470
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,450
It is your turn, Ak Hee.

471
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:14,530
Sajo Hyeon, did you really go to sleep?

472
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,050
I told you I am not going out!

473
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,260
We do not know when the ship with the kidnapped women will sail to Jinhoi.

474
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,850
When that time comes, make sure to wake me up.

475
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,520
W-Wait, Sajo Hyeon, why are you doing this?

476
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,590
You think you look cool doing this. Right?

477
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,740
Not at all!

478
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,500
Sajo Hyeon, you punk.

479
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,840
I said I was fine.

480
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,520
Go to sleep. Go back to sleep.

481
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,570
I am sleepy, I am sleepy, I am sleepy—

482
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,670
Why is the moon so bright? I cannot sleep.

483
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,860
I miss Kyera.

484
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,850
Your Majesty.

485
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,920
I wonder if he fell asleep.

486
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,970
 You never had feelings for me 

487
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,840
 as your lover? 

488
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,980
 Right? 

489
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,160
Sir Ak Hee must have been hurt.

490
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,480
♫  Through the fallen leaves  ♫

491
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:10,870
♫  That is how my night deepens, more and more  ♫

492
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:20,320
♫  Fall more on this lotus tonight and shine on this night more  ♫

493
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,190
♫  The dawn is lingering around  ♫

494
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:29,900
Is this the one Sajo Hyeon made?

495
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,300
He sure is skilled.

496
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,360
I cannot believe I am jealous of Sajo Hyeon today.

497
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:47,350
♫  When the tears I swallowed disappear, please forget me  ♫

498
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,100
Kyera,

499
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,630
I miss you.

500
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:08,340
♫  I will cherish it deep in my heart  ♫

501
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,180
What is this?

502
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:28,150
 Your Majesty, have you awakened? 

503
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,150
Come in.

504
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,600
Why are you staring at me like that?

505
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,330
You are His Majesty. Right?

506
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,470
- I am not. 
 - Come on.

507
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,100
This humble one can tell at a glance now.

508
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,060
You are His Majesty, for sure!

509
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,760
But this is weird.

510
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,530
Why is Sir Ak Hee not coming out?

511
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,470
That is my question.

512
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,270
 Hey, look at her clothes there. 

513
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:18,470
 How many sacks of rice is she wearing? 

514
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,970
 Even her looks are— Whoa! 

515
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,920
Why are they staring at me so much?

516
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,740
I am so dully dressed, but my looks still shine.

517
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,080
What should I do?

518
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,050
Over there. Okay?

519
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,170
Get in quietly and see if there is a man called Pal Cheon.

520
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,930
Pal Cheon.

521
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,420
- Go. 
 - Yes.

522
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,800
If Yoong's father did not quit gambling,

523
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,060
he is sure to be there.

524
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,870
I am also a crazy wench for coming out to find him like this.

525
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,390
Affection is to blame.

526
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:18,220
Consort Cheong Myeong snooped around

527
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,770
the secret gambling den, in addition to her family's home?

528
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,420
Yes, she seemed to be looking for someone.

529
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,930
It must be a man if she went to the gambling den.

530
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:33,420
Consort Cheong Myeong risked danger to bother looking?

531
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,470
Tell Father about this right now.

532
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

533
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,800
- Father. 
 - My goodness, so suddenly!

534
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,120
Gosh, you startled me.

535
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,820
What are you staring at?

536
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,210
Nu Ru, what brings you here?

537
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:16,380
The girls here are bedridden from having a stomach flu last night.

538
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,660
So, I brought some rice porridge.

539
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,530
Oh, really? Goodness.

540
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,590
Right!

541
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:27,220
I made this for you, Father.

542
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,050
What is this?

543
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,100
Gosh, you fool. A pendant for a man?

544
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,870
Why not? My father wore this every day!

545
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,830
If you wear it, you and I will be matching.

546
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,690
Matching—

547
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,190
The porridge will get cold.

548
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,650
I will get going now, Father.

549
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,140
I will bring you scorched rice with honey later.

550
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,970
Bye!

551
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,990
Stop calling me "Father."

552
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,400
I am a bachelor.

553
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,750
A father, huh?

554
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,790
Father.

555
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,960
The amusement troupe's women are sick?

556
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,090
Why at this time?

557
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,420
If they get on the ship together, the stomach flu will spread.

558
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,840
Besides those two women, how many can we send?

559
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,310
That would be three.

560
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,290
Did you not say you did not get enough women from the villages, either?

561
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,710
Please forgive me, Grand Prince.

562
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,890
Go find the two we are missing.

563
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,190
From within the palace?

564
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:46,540
The palace maids are what the palace has more than enough of.

565
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,980
Even if one or two were to disappear, no one would care.

566
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,920
- Unni! 
 - Nu Ru!

567
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,070
- Unni! Unni! 
 - What is going on?

568
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,590
- Unni! 
 - Hold on!

569
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:18,300
Unni, Unni, Unni!

570
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,660
Nu Ru must think her father only receives freebies, huh?

571
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,620
Ta-da!

572
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,220
She looks just as cute as these.

573
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,860
Oh, Sweetie, do you work here?

574
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,010
Is something wrong?

575
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,390
Nu Ru was...

576
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,270
Nu Ru was taken.

577
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,460
What?

578
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,660
The other unni, too.

579
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,530
When?

580
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,810
Nu Ru! Nu Ru!

581
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,510
Nu Ru!

582
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,070
 Your Majesty! 

583
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,620
Your Majesty!

584
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,610
Your Majesty, this is terrible.

585
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:20,650
Palace maids were taken by suspicious people!

586
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,700
- What did you say? 
 - I am sure they were also kidnapped.

587
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,460
Officer Ji, tell Head Minister and Defense Minister to gather the Royal Guards right now.

588
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

589
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:07,410
Your Majesty, I am told Prince Ga Ron is staying near Port Mihwari.

590
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,610
Are you talking about Hwang Ga Ron, the fourth prince of Jinhoi?

591
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,880
That is correct.

592
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,000
From what I know, he has kept close contact with Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

593
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,070
From now on, we will save our daughters, sisters, and

594
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,430
my precious people, the women of this nation.

595
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:34,910
Those who stand in our way, strike them all down!

596
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,300
To battle!

597
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,010
Follow His Majesty!

598
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,170
Officer Ji!

599
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:51,420
I will come, too.

600
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,780
Eunuch Neung, you cannot. It is dangerous.

601
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,800
My daughter was taken.

602
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,370
Her father will save her.

603
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,280
 Nu Ru, wait for me. 

604
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,870
 Father is coming. 

605
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,600
 You have to survive, kid. 

606
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:54,180
They are gathering all the women they kidnapped from all over the country.

607
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,320
The Wind Knives followed them from all over.

608
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,680
 Prince Ga Ron! 

609
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,960
The soldiers?

610
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,160
Are you telling Jinhoi to attack Asatae?

611
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,760
I am asking you to just pretend to do so.

612
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,570
To bring down Asatae's half-witted king, I need strong unity from the inside.

613
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,920
Lend me a hand, Prince Ga Ron.

614
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,060
You wench, it is this way!

615
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,550
Nu Ru! Nu Ru!

616
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:31,100
N-Nu Ru.

617
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:34,010
Hey, move along!

618
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,910
Come here!

619
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,110
Be quiet!

620
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,310
- E-Enemy ambush! 
 - It is an assassin!

621
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,250
Assassin!

622
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:07,770
Save the women! Do not leave a single person behind!

623
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,350
Your Majesty, are you okay?

624
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:39,530
Yes, I am fine.

625
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,400
Eunuch Neung.

626
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,810
Your Majesty.

627
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,610
That arrogant bastard, he doesn't know his place.

628
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,200
Your Highness.

629
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,770
Is something wrong?

630
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:19,710
The warehouse by the port was ambushed.

631
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:22,190
Let's go.

632
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,640
Do not move.

633
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,730
I knew I smelled a flowery scent.

634
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,060
You are very pretty.

635
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,590
Order the women in this warehouse to be released right now.

636
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,400
If you do not, this knife will stab your throat.

637
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,700
- You came to save the women. 
 - Right now!

638
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,930
I will release them if you accept my request.

639
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,480
What is your request?

640
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,600
Tonight,

641
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,760
become my woman.

642
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,490
Is that all you can think of?

643
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:17,020
- What— 
 - Sure.

644
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:20,080
Instead, order the women to be released right now.

645
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,160
How can I trust you?

646
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,650
You are also my type.

647
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,500
Hurry up and order them. It is hard to take them off with one hand.

648
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,790
Wind Knives and the Royal Guards, too?

649
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,380
How on Earth did they...

650
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:59,580
That is...

651
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,510
I found them!

652
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,340
Set the warehouse on fire.

653
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,970
Burn them all down!

654
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:15,330
 - Yes!  
 - Yes, Grand Prince!

655
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,700
Get out of here.

656
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,910
Nu Ru! Nu Ru, where are you?

657
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:25,820
Hurry up and escape right now!

658
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,020
Hurry it up!

659
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,390
Nu Ru! Nu Ru!

660
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,920
Nu Ru! Nu Ru!

661
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,300
Hurry up and come out!

662
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,790
Nu Ru! Nu Ru!

663
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:37,370
Hurry up and escape! Hurry!

00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,620
Run away!

665
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,730
We must hurry! Quickly!

666
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,440
Yes!

667
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,250
Master Yang!

668
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,220
Master Yang—

669
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,810
Be careful. Be careful.

670
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,680
Hurry up and move along!

671
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,660
Yeon Wol? Yeon Wol!

672
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,890
Yeon Wol! Yeon Wol!

673
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:37,800
Yeon Wol!

674
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,330
Hong Goon! Hong Goon, get it together!

675
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,290
Your Highness!

676
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,630
Hong Goon, get out. Please get out!

677
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:49,060
Get out! Get out!

678
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,990
It is okay. Get out.

679
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,890
Yeon Wol!

680
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:00,100
Goodness, Your Majesty!

681
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,160
Y-Yeon Wol is still inside.

682
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,460
Kyera!

683

♫  Dyed in the sad moonlight  ♫

684
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:21,400
♫  My sigh grows deeper  ♫

685

Kyera!

689
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,330
What the hell are you doing, Sajo Hyeon?

690
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,900
Kyera, I will save you.

691
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,000
♫  It feels like I can reach you from here  ♫

692
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,420
What is this? Why is it not letting me pass?

693
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:50,240
What is this?

694
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,710
Kyera!

695
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:59,430
♫  At the edge of the fleeting moonlight  ♫

696

♫  The place where you are, even if it'll only be a moment  ♫

701

♫  Please take me  ♫

702
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,410
- Master Yang, you cannot! 
 - Let go!

703
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,830
 I-I am sorry. 

704

♫  Please hold me so I do not waver  ♫

♫  Because I was you  ♫

708
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:15,170
Get it together. Hey, get it together and stand up!

709
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:17,220
Hurry up!

710
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,000
Soon Yi!

711
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,150
Soon Yi!

712
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,520
 I can call you my father. Right? 

713
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,630
Nu Ru.

714

Nu Ru.

715
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,130
Father is here.

716
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,410
Father is here, Nu Ru.

717
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,560
O-Open—

718
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,010
Open your eyes, Nu Ru!

719
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:32,150
Nu Ru! Nu Ru!

720
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,930
Sajo Hyeon, you half-witted bastard.

721
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:58,070
You could not even protect Kyera.

722
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,500
Sajo Hyeon, you half-witted bastard!

723
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:05,200
Yes.

724
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:09,230
I am indeed a half-wit.

725
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:14,290
What can a fool like me do?

726
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,480
I could not even protect my woman.

♫  That is how my night deepens, more and more  ♫

 You also know well who led the trafficking of our women. 

745
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,440
 Do you not, Grand Prince? 

746
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,760
 Could you be talking about what the late king did? 

747
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,600
 This is breaking news! 

748
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,570
 I thought it was only a rumor, but it was true. 

749
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,330
 Hurry up and give birth to a son. 

750
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:57,450
 That is our only way for survival.

 Summon the evil spirit right now. 

752

 If there comes a moment even His Majesty cannot save Yeon Wol... 

753
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,190
 - I am sorry.  
  - he might force his way out.
