Are you really His Majesty?

27
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,510

I missed you.

32
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,500

for which I am thankful. However...

37
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,770
But the thing is...

38
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,620
You never had feelings for me

39
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,460
as your lover?

40
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,200
Right?

41
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,090
I am sorry.

42
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,070
Leaving?

43
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,310
Ak Hee told you to leave, right?

44
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,440
Because he cannot stand us loving each other.

45
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,730
It was my decision.

46
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,110
With Grand Prince Sajo Yoong being so reckless like that,

47
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,070
I must leave for your sake, at least.

48
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,200
I will not let you.

49
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,630
There must be a way.

50
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,750
I will take care of this, so please-

51
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,840
It is only for a while.

52
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,540
Wherever I am, I will only think of Your Majesty.

53
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,160
I will only look for a way to help and protect you, Your Majesty.

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,610
I must get going now.

55
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,110
Yeon Wol.

56
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,330
I will set everything right without fail.

57
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,150
After that,

58
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,240
let us be together for sure.

59
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,440
Yes, for sure.

60
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,690
My feelings were right.

61
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,330
His Majesty was not insane.

62
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,550
Your Majesty.

63
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,300
Are you leaving?

64
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,380
Yes.

65
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,410
Great choice.

66
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,660
Do not ever come back.

67
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,460
Tell me about the evil spirit.

68
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,100
I mean the evil spirit haunting His Majesty.

69
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,180
Did you think I do not know?

70
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,050
You seized His Majesty's feelings and

71
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,390
controlled even the lust of the evil spirit inside His Majesty's body!

72
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,870
Your Majesty, His Majesty is in a very difficult situation right now.

73
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,330
Please be of assistance to His Majesty.

74
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,880
Arrogant wench.

75
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,180
How dare you!

76
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,250
You wench!

77
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,800
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is only looking for a way to harm His Majesty.

78
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,440
Ward off the Grand Prince and help His Majesty.

79
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,300
Even if you do not lecture me, I will do just fine on my own.

80
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,620
So, just leave the Palace and never come back.

81
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,610
That is how you can help His Majesty. Do you understand?

82
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,910
He will not seek me out for a while

83
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,560
since he would want to find out where I am going and what I am doing.

84
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,490
How far did Kyera go?

85
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,140
I hear she entered Chuyoung Valley.

86
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,260
I am sure she noticed we are following her.

87
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,010
Keep following her, nonetheless.

88
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,490
Quietly watch where she goes.

89
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,840
Yes, Grand Prince.

90
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,900
By the way, what is the reason you are keeping Kyera alive?

91
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,670
Since she left the Palace now, it is easier-

92
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:59,810
It is easier to kill her now, so why do I keep her alive?

93
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,360
Kyera will be...

94
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,700
used in a very handy way to cut off Sajo Hyun's ankle.

95
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,180
After Your Majesty disbanded the amusement troupe allowed them to return,

96
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,340
a part of amusement troupe's women left the Palace, but...

97
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,340
They said she should have been back five days ago, but she is still not here!

98
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,360
none of the women have returned.

99
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,890
Aigoo, your daughter is not home yet, either?

100
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,440
Wait, they never came home?

101
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,050
Also, another part of the amusement troupe still remains in the Palace.

102
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,230
Hurry up and come!

103
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,910
- Bye!
- In the dark of the night,

104
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,250
they are sending them out in small numbers.

105
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,750
Master Yang is secretly tracking them.

106
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,170
Eunuch Neung.

107
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

108
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,500
We have nowhere to return to.

109
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,940
So, they let us stay here for a while.

110
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,680
We have nowhere to go, and they feed and shelter us here in the Palace.

111
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,240
We are thankful.

112
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,120
That is true.

113
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,890
Did the ladies who left the Palace first all go back home, then?

114
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,680
Probably?

115
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,750
Did they write letters saying they got home safely?

116
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,050
Oh, we do not really know how to read and write.

117
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,610
That is what our eunuch in charge told us.

118
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,040
They do not seem anxious.

119
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,230
Rather, they are thankful.

120
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,190
They were probably assured to keep them at ease.

121
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,770
They must be happy enough to stop being a part of the amusement troupe, thanks to His Majesty.

122
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,660
By the way, did Yeon Wol really leave?

123
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,400
Without even telling me anything?

124
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,340
She must have thought it was not a farewell for life.

125
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,260
You will be able to meet her again.

126
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,150
Father!

127
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,740
- Father!
- Nu Ru!

128
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,610
Hi, Unni. Father.

129
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,050
Who?

130
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,410
Me?

131
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,230
N-Nu Ru is your daughter?

132
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,940
No, she is not!

133
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,210
My, now. Who are you calling your father?

134
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,680
You will get me in trouble.

135
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,870
I am sorry, Eunuch Neung.

136
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,990
How can you look just like my father?

137
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,860
Whoa, how amazing.

138
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,010
Nu Ru, you do not look like your father, huh?

139
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,860
Since you are this pretty.

140
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,240
Hey!

141
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,500
Sweetie, even if your father looks a lot like me,

142
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,100
your father at home will be sad to know you call just anyone your father.

143
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,520
My father is not home.

144
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,520
- What?
- Three years ago,

145
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,780
he went there.

146
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,260
Really?

147
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,820
You remind me of my father.

148
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,720
I am going to get a good look at your face.

149
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,150
M-Me? M-My goodness.

150
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,360
Whoa, Eunuch Neung, you are blushing!

151
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,440
N-No, I am not!

152
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,200
You can have this, Father.

153
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,810
What is this?

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,380
It is a donut, huh? I love these.

155
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,910
Really?

156
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,140
My father loved these, too!

157
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,660
I can call you my father, right?

158
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,170
H-Hey- You said her name is Nu Ru, right?

159
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,760
Hey, Nu Ru, I am a eunuch, you see.

160
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,380
So, a eunuch cannot really have a daughter-

161
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,170
Court Lady must be looking for me!

162
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,430
Bye, Father! Bye, Unni!

163
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,920
H-Hey, you will trip and fall! Be careful!

164
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,620
Nu Ru is cute, right?

165
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,450
She is a new palace maid who works in the kitchen.

166
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,020
Really?

167
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,000
She is cute.

168
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,890
Are you going to eat it alone?

169
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,530
I met the amusement troupe's women in person.

170
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,730
They seemed to be eating and doing well, at least on the surface.

171
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,310
It did not seem like they were lying, either.

172
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,940
Even those women must be unaware of the details of what is going on.

173
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,360
What happened?

174
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,220
It is also suspicious many villages' women are disappearing.

175
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,920
Amusement troupe was disbanded, but why are women still being kidnapped?

176
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,370
Women are still being kidnapped?

177
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,450
Did Kyera return safely?

178
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,020
Did you tell Yeon Wol to leave?

179
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,180
I did.

180
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,750
But she did not leave because I told her to.

181
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,490
You know it, too.

182
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,170
Kyera is not a woman who would obey what I say.

183
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,230
Well, I guess she listens to you.

184
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,540
We cannot say it was not because of you.

185
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,390
You threatened Yeon Wol to leave, and it bothered you,

186
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,870
which is why you called me over!

187
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,990
She could not help but leave in that situation!

188
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,450
Do you know how close it was for Kyera at the Hall of Spirits yesterday?

189
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,990
Sajo Yoong was as vicious as ever.

190
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,820
Hey, you should be thankful I was there, because if you were there

191
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,510
Kyera would not be alive right now.

192
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,550
As for that, I am thankful.

193
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,650
Aigoo, you two are just as polite as the other!

194
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,640
Aigoo, cannot stand the sight of you!

195
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,150
I heard Chung Ta said you and I have no choice but to share the body like we used to.

196
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,190
Try to hang in there as long as you can

197
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,790
until the full moon rises again.

198
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,550
I will go to sleep from now on and not fight it.

199
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,280
So, what do you say we share the body like before?

200
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,940
No, thank you.

201
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,900
I am going to rest here for good.

202
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,610
You can take it all.

203
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,320
- Ak Hee.
- The talk is over.

204
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,510
Oh, right.

205
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,150
What is it?

206
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,100
What are you going to do now?

207
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,280
Sajo Yoong caught on

208
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,860
about you and I switching in between.

209
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,510
- What?
- Do you know what Sajo Yoong said?

210
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,100
I can tell clearly now.

211
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,990
You are not Sajo Hyun.

212
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,680
You are the evil spirit.

213
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,590
The parasitic evil spirit in Sajo Hyun's body.

214
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
Wait, how did he...

215
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,950
Sajo Yoong must have bought out Chung Ta.

216
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,740
Chung Ta would never do that.

217
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,360
She knows I know her weakness.

218
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,840
What I mean is he has caught on now.

219
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,070
Aigoo, Sajo Yoong must have lived cautiously all his life. He can read people like an open book!

220
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,830
This is all because you acted thoughtlessly.

221
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,620
I told you to be careful so many times!

222
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,900
Oh, my. Who are you yelling at right now?

223
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,710
I told you because I was worried and-

224
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,160
Whatever, then! Leave.

225
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,150
Get out!

226
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,510
Master Yang, Ha Rang.

227
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,030
Kyera, you finally escaped the Palace.

228
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,050
Did you turn against Sajo Hyun?

229
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,790
That is not the case.

230
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,200
Sajo Yoong's killers are following me.

231
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,980
We are aware.

232
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,530
There is a place we must go together.

233
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,470
Which one are you right now?

234
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,820
Are you the evil spirit or Sajo Hyun?

235
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,010
Grand Prince Yoong, are you feeling all right?

236
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,360
You got so beat up last night.

237
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,050
I apologize for what happened last night.

238
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,870
Kyera's actions were becoming more cheeky by the day.

239
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,290
So, I meant to lecture her as her elder, but-

240
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,640
You do have the right to lecture her.

241
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,890
I heard you have sponsored Kyera for a long time now.

242
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,510
Rather than having sponsored-

243
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,510
Hence, I kicked her out of the Palace.

244
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,230
From now on, she will not cause cheeky problems.

245
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,200
All hail His Majesty!

246
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,670
Whenever I enter the Royal Council Hall, I feel suffocated.

247
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,210
It feels like the late king, who called me Half-Wit, is glaring at me.

248
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,540
It also feels like the ministers are laughing at me.

249
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,740
Will Half-Wit do his job well?

250
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,930
I am sure he will mention the tax again.

251
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,430
They are all imaginations.

252
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,540
The more you fear and run away, the bigger those imaginations will grow.

253
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,570
Whenever fear grows, open your mind's eyes widely.

254
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,870
And look the ministers clearly in their eyes.

255
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,880
"I am not afraid of you all."

256
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,360
I am not afraid of you all.

257
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,880
"I will not run away. I will not back down."

258
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,300
I will not run away.

259
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,430
I will not back down.

260
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,660
- I am
- "I am...

261
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,390
Sajo Hyun."

262
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,690
I am Sajo Hyun.

263
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,130
I seek to come to a conclusion about the issue of increasing taxes we discussed last time.

264
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,900
Your Majesty, increasing taxes was found problematic in many practical ways.

265
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,630
It is problematic because the ruling class, including you people,

266
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,880
only seeks their own interest.

267
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,450
Your Majesty, I am burdened to tell you this,

268
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:56,930
but I do not think being in a ruling class mandates one to take care of poor people's livelihoods.

269
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,250
Well, then.

270
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,790
What do you think about the Royal Family always having prioritized the nobles' concessions so far?

271
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,280
Sorry?

272
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,150
Your two sons were appointed royal public offices last year

273
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,210
and the year before that, without any conditions, Justice Minister.

274
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,230
Y-Your Majesty, that is-

275
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:25,760
I am clearly watching which position and department your children and kin have been appointed to!

276
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,810
Also, I know you ministers have more than 2,000 seoks of surplus rice

277
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,150
you collected from sharecroppers every year.

278
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,090
I cannot help but think about your selfishness of denying to share

279
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,150
not even a single grain of rice with the starving people!

280
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,840
Finance Minister, what is your thought on this?

281
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,050
Your Majesty, that is-

282
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,340
Stop giving flimsy excuses.

283
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,110
Your Majesty, I reckon the decision you made is absolutely correct.

284
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,880
I also agree...

285
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,430
with the Head Minister's opinion.

286
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,300
We will establish a Tax Adjusting Agency today right away, and

287
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,730
thoroughly review Your Majesty's orders to execute them without any flaws.

288
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,130
That is great to hear.

289
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,540
I am more than happy to have you all follow my opinion.

290
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,200
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

291
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,420
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

292
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,640
It is truly a monstrous thing.

293
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,030
His Majesty is sometimes a bum who is stubborn to no end

294
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,180
and is astute at other times, like today!

295
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,440
My, that is exactly so!

296
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,720
He does not look like a half-wit at all anymore.

297
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,550
I also got odd feelings from His Majesty many times.

298
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:10,750
It is as if there are two personalities in one body.

299
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,420
Yes, that is why there are those rumors in the capital.

300
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,300
That His Majesty is possessed by an evil spirit!

301
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,140
There would be no smoke without fire.

302
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,560
I am sincerely worried.

303
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,600
Master Yang, why did we come here?

304
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,120
Can you recognize it?

305
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,560
Father?

306
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:12,140
Ten years ago, we buried General Yeon Poong Hak here after Sajo Seung took his life.

307
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,480
Father.

308
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,160
I thought we could not even find his corpse.

309
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,950
Father.

310
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,540
Father.

311
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,420
Kyera, did you forget Sajo Seung massacred General Yeon Poong Hak

312
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,730
and the entire family of Yeon?

313
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,460
Did you forget?

314
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,970
How could I forget?

315
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,020
How could I forget my resentment I cannot forget even after death?

316
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,640
But why are you not turning your back on Sajo Hyun, your sworn enemy's son?

317
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,440
His Majesty is indeed my sworn enemy's son.

318
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,890
However, his hands are clean.

319
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,370
I was able to survive 10 years ago, thanks to His Majesty.

320
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,310
I am sorry.

321
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,510
That memory became a traumatic scar for His Majesty as well,

322
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,940
making him suffer even to this day.

323
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,360
That is a just consequence as a descendant of Sajo Seung, the traitor.

324
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,820
I risked my life to bring General Yeon Poong Hak here

325
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,590
to prepare for when your will for revenge might weaken.

326
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,380
I thought such a day would never come.

327
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,980
What would you like to do with me, Master Yang?

328
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:20,290
I cannot serve you anymore, My Lady, for you have abandoned all your duties and

329
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,430
grew feelings for your sworn enemy's son.

330
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,070
Master Yang.

331
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,600
If you cannot tolerate me, I have no other option, either.

332
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,980
I will cut ties with you.

333
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,050
In that case, since it is a relationship that will end anyway,

334
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,730
it will be beneficial for both of us to

335
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,000
let those bystanders know clearly.

336
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,850
Try to beat me.

337
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,710
If you beat me, I will let you cut ties.

338
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,720
Master Yang, why are you doing this?

339
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,310
Sure, Yang Jae Yi, I will beat you.

340
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,930
Thank you for interring my father.

341
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,330
Please be careful, My Lady.

342
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,720
I will not forget what you did for me.

343
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,400
I won, Yang Jae Yi.

344
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,120
Go back now.

345
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,610
She built a tent in front of Yeon Poong Hak's grave?

346
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,830
Is she trying to mourn for him at this point?

347
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,140
Seeing how Yang Jae Yi left after the duel,

348
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,280
it looks like her ties with Wind Knife are severed.

349
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,860
You must not look away from the tent even for a moment.

350
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,310
Yes, Grand Prince.

351
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,830
When will the ship to Jinhoi depart?

352
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,580
The night after tomorrow.

353
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,460
The night after tomorrow?

354
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,930
Please keep walking and listen.

355
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:11,070
Amusement troupe's women and even the villages' women are getting sent to Jinhoi.

356
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,880
Jinhoi, you say?

357
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,560
Where is the location of the send-off?

358
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,460
Port Mihwari.

359
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,030
It is a settlement taken over by Jinhoi.

360
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,900
This is the only time we are helping Kyera.

361
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,650
I am sorry, Master Yang.

362
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,790
This is a letter from Wind Knife.

363
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,400
Amusement troupe's women and even the villages' women are getting sold to Jinhoi.

364
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,840
The ship will depart at Port Mihwari the day after tomorrow?

365
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,380
Port Mihwari is Jinhoi's settlement, right?

366
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,720
They are intentionally using an enemy settlement.

367
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,860
It must be to prevent our military involvement.

368
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,860
Summon the Defense Minister right away.

369
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,030
We must move on the sly.

370
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,160
Your Majesty.

371
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,370
Defense Minister, who does your loyalty belong to?

372
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,650
Of course, it belongs to Your Majesty-

373
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,310
Do not lie.

374
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:12,530
You swore your loyalty to Sajo Yoong, blinded by your greed.

375
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,500
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

376
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,780
Due to inevitable circumstances, I let Grand Prince Sajo Yoong get the better of me.

377
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,300
Will you work for me from now on?

378
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,460
Yes, of course, Your Majesty!

379
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,440
I swear my loyalty and my life-

380
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,750
It is not just your life.

381
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,010
If you betray me one more time, you and all the members

382
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,540
of your household will be killed as well.

383
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,980
I will make sure to bear that in mind, Your Majesty!

384
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,740
Defense Minister, how many soldiers can we utilize right now?

385
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,350
We can utilize all soldiers,

386
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,690
but Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's henchmen are present everywhere.

387
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,320
It is hard to utilize the soldiers without Grand Prince Yoong knowing?

388
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

389
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,460
In that case, can we utilize the Royal Guards who guard the Palace?

390
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,010
The Royal Guards are under the control of Head Minister Jin Mu Dal.

391
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,880
So, it is out of my authority.

392
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,900
I will persuade the Head Minister,

393
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,160
so prepare an elite force with the Royal Guards, Defense Minister.

394
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,190
Be quick.

395
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,910
Yes, Your Majesty!

396
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,630
In the end, you found out as well, Your Majesty.

397
00:30:52,630 --> 00:31:00,630
Are you saying you knew about the women being sold to Jinhoi like animals, Head Minister?

398
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:06,230
Your Majesty, that is what diplomacy is like.

399
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,120
Please do not look at one single thing.

400
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,440
Become a wise king who looks at more than three or four things.

401
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,170
That is not what a wise king is!

402
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:22,500
That is only a half-witted king who is played by a great power.

403
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,900
Since I found out the truth, I will not look the other way.

404
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,500
I will save my people and

405
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,490
punish the wicked who sold them off.

406
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,190
Head Minister, give me a hand.

407
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,470
Mobilize the Royal Guards under your command,

408
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,860
so I can save my poor people.

409
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,100
Sure.

410
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,670
I will happily let you use my royal guards.

411
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,440
Thank you, Head Minister.

412
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,590
In that case,

413
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,630
what will you give this humble one, Your Majesty?

414
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,590
Head Minister,

415
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,910
I am not haggling for prices with you right now.

416
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,430
I am issuing a royal decree as the emperor.

417
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,350
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.

418
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,420
You said His Majesty's personality changes when he sleeps, right?

419
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,670
Yes.

420
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:45,760
Is there really no way for His Majesty to not come back even after sleeping?

421
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,570
I already told you.

422
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,450
There is none.

423
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,120
It seems like there is one.

424
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,690
I just said there is none.

425
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,640
The reason I came here today is

426
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,830
to give this back.

427
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,180
I must have lost it for a moment.

428
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,210
It came back just now.

429
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,400
What is the matter, Madam Chung Ta?

430
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,170
You are my strategist.

431
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,000
I do not want to be your strategist or anything else for that matter!

432
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:19,940
Looks like you still do not know me that well.

433
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,080
No one is allowed to recklessly dare

434
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,300
say no or refuse to anything I say.

435
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,310
You are not an exception, either, Madam Chung Ta.

436
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,120
Grand Prince, are you threatening me right now?

437
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,180
What is wrong with me? What is this?

438
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,580
It is a talisman from Tan Ya, a shaman of Jinhoi.

439
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,410
I hear you are not on good terms with Tan Ya.

440
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,480
Madam Chung Ta.

441
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,980
Help Ak Hee take over Sajo Hyun's body

442
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,510
and put Sajo Hyun to eternal sleep.

443
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,720
Of course, it would be best to put both to sleep.

444
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,840
I cannot, I will not!

445
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,230
The wind is cold.

446
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,450
Is it going to rain?

447
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,290
You are worried Yeon Wol might be cold, right?

448
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,550
It does not look like it will rain since I see a lot of stars.

449
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,500
You said Yeon Wol has been an assassin for more than a decade.

450
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,200
I am sure she is a veteran when it comes to tough life.

451
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,930
She must be tougher than what you think-

452
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,050
Eunuch Neung!

453
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,800
How can you say that?

454
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,890
Would you still speak so lightly even when your lover is

455
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,380
sleeping alone in a forest somewhere?

456
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,800
Your Majesty, this humble one cannot have and

457
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,030
is not allowed to have a lover.

458
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,400
I must sleep now.

459
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,930
Are you really going to sleep?

460
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:24,490
Then, tomorrow morning, Ak- That guy will be the one...

461
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,410
She said we are back to the old rules.

462
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,110
So it cannot be helped.

463
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,150
I have to share this body with Ak Hee.

464
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,870
Since he was considerate enough to let me send off Yeon Wol,

465
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,030
I should repay him.

466
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,720
Even if you repay him, he will not be the least bit thankful.

467
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,350
Already?

468
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,530
What do I do?

469
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,650
It is your turn, Ak Hee.

470
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,730
Sajo Hyun, did you really go to sleep?

471
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,150
I told you I am not going out!

472
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,460
We do not know when the ship with the kidnapped women will sail to Jinhoi.

473
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,950
When that time comes, make sure to wake me up.

474
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,620
W-Wait, Sajo Hyun, why are you doing this?

475
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,690
You think you look cool doing this, right?

476
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,540
Not at all!

477
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,600
Sajo Hyun, you punk.

478
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,740
I said I was fine.

479
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,720
Go to sleep. Go back to sleep.

480
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,170
I am sleepy, I am sleepy, I am sleepy-

481
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,770
Why is the moon so bright? I cannot sleep.

482
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,760
I miss Kyera.

483
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,050
Your Majesty.

484
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,320
I wonder if he fell asleep.

485
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,570
You never had feelings for me

486
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,040
as your lover?

487
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,410
Right?

488
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,260
Sir Ak Hee must have been hurt.

489
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,580
♫ Through the fallen leaves ♫

490
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:11,070
♫ That is how my night deepens, more and more ♫

491
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:20,420
♫ Fall more on this lotus tonight and shine on this night more ♫

492
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,290
♫ The dawn is lingering around ♫

493
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,510
Is this the one Sajo Hyun made?

494
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,320
He sure is skilled.

495
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,460
I cannot believe I am jealous of Sajo Hyun today.

496
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:47,850
♫ When the tears I swallowed disappear, please forget me ♫

497
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,950
Kyera.

498
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,800
I miss you.

499
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:08,740
♫ I will cherish it deep in my heart ♫

500
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,080
What is this?

501
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,250
Your Majesty, have you awakened?

502
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,050
Come in.

503
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,500
Why are you staring at me like that?

504
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,130
You are His Majesty, right?

505
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,570
- I am not.
- Come on.

506
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,200
This humble one can tell at a glance now.

507
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,960
You are His Majesty, for sure!

508
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,860
But this is weird.

509
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,430
Why is Sir Ak Hee not coming out?

510
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,270
That is my question.

511
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,370
Hey, look at her clothes there.

512
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,670
How many sacks of rice is she wearing?

513
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,970
Even her looks are- Whoa!

514
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,020
Why are they staring at me so much?

515
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,040
I am so dully dressed, but my looks still shine.

516
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,980
What should I do?

517
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,050
Over there. Okay?

518
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,270
Get in quietly and see if there is a man called Pal Cheon.

519
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,030
Pal Cheon.

520
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,120
- Go.
- Yes.

521
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,000
If Yoong's father did not quit gambling,

522
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,960
he is sure to be there.

523
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,970
I am also a crazy wench for coming out to find him like this.

524
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,290
Affection is to blame.

525
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,320
Consort Cheong Myeong snooped around

526
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,970
the secret gambling den, in addition to her family's home?

527
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,820
Yes, she seemed to be looking for someone.

528
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,830
It must be a man if she went to the gambling den.

529
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:33,120
Consort Cheong Myeong risked danger to bother looking?

530
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,670
Tell Father about this right now.

531
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

532
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,000
- Father.
- Aigoo, my goodness!

533
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,220
Gosh, you startled me.

534
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,920
What are you staring at?

535
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,310
Nu Ru, what brings you here?

536
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:16,580
The unnis here are bedridden from having a stomach flu last night.

537
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,760
So, I brought some rice porridge.

538
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,630
Oh, really? Aigoo.

539
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,990
Right!

540
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,520
I made this for you, Father.

541
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,950
What is this?

542
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,200
Gosh, you fool. A pendant for a man?

543
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,970
Why not? My father wore this every day!

544
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:41,030
If you wear it, you and I will be matching.

545
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,690
Matching-

546
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,290
The porridge will get cold.

547
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,750
I will get going now, Father.

548
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,240
I will bring you scorched rice with honey later.

549
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,770
Bye!

550
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,090
Stop calling me "father."

551
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,200
I am a bachelor.

552
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,150
A father, huh?

553
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,590
Father.

554
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,060
Amusement troupe's women are sick?

555
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,190
Why at this time?

556
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,220
If they get on the ship together, the stomach flu will spread.

557
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:22,040
Besides those two women, how many can we send?

558
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,510
That would be three.

559
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,390
Did you not say you did not get enough women from the villages, either?

560
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,510
Please forgive me, Grand Prince.

561
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:37,790
Go find the two we are missing.

562
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,390
From within the Palace?

563
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:46,640
The palace maids are what the Palace has more than enough of.

564
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,880
Even if one or two were to disappear, no one would care.

565
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,020
- Unni!
- Nu Ru!

566
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,170
- Unni, Unni!
- What is going on?

567
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,690
- Unni!
- Hold on!

568
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:18,000
Unni, Unni, Unni!

569
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:32,860
Nu Ru must think her father only receives freebies, huh?

570
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,020
Ta-da!

571
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,420
She looks just as cute as these.

572
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,760
Oh, Sweetie, do you work here?

573
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,110
Is something wrong?

574
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,690
Nu Ru was...

575
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,370
Nu Ru was taken.

576
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,560
What?

577
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,760
The other unni, too.

578
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,330
When?

579
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,910
Nu Ru, Nu Ru!

580
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,410
Nu Ru!

581
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,170
Your Majesty!

582
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,420
Your Majesty!

583
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,710
Your Majesty, this is terrible.

584
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,750
Palace maids were taken by suspicious people!

585
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,800
- What did you say?
- I am sure they were also kidnapped.

586
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,560
Officer Ji, tell Head Minister and Defense Minister to gather the Royal Guards right now.

587
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

588
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:07,610
Your Majesty, I am told Prince Ga Ron is staying near Port Mihwari.

589
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:10,810
Are you talking about Hwang Ga Ron, the fourth prince of Jinhoi?

590
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,080
That is correct.

591
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,100
From what I know, he has kept close contact with Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

592
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,270
From now on, we will save our daughters, sisters, and

593
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:30,630
my precious people, the women of this nation.

594
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:35,010
Those who stand in our way, strike them all down!

595
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,400
To battle!

596
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,810
Follow His Majesty!

597
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:49,670
Officer Ji!

598
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,520
I will come, too.

599
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,980
Eunuch Neung, you cannot. It is dangerous.

600
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,900
My daughter was taken.

601
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,170
Her father will save her.

602
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,380
Nu Ru, wait for me.

603
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,970
Father is coming.

604
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,300
You have to survive, kid.

605
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,380
They are gathering all the women they kidnapped from all over the country.

606
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,120
Wind Knife followed them from all over.

607
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,680
Prince Ga Ron!

608
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:50,060
The soldiers?

609
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,260
Are you telling Jinhoi to attack Asatae?

610
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,960
I am asking you to just pretend to do so.

611
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,470
To bring down Asatae's half-witted king, I need strong unity from the inside.

612
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,720
Lend me a hand, Prince Ga Ron.

613
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,160
You wench, it is this way!

614
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,650
Nu Ru, Nu Ru!

615
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,900
N-Nu Ru.

616
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,110
Hey, move along!

617
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,610
Come here!

618
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,910
Be quiet!

619
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,410
- E-Enemy ambush!
- It is an assassin!

620
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,250
Assassin!

621
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:07,670
Save the women! Do not leave a single person behind!

622
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,450
Your Majesty, are you okay?

623
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,330
Yes, I am fine.

624
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,200
Eunuch Neung.

625
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,610
Your Majesty.

626
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,710
That arrogant bastard, he knows not his place.

627
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,400
Your Highness.

628
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,870
Is something wrong?

629
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,510
The warehouse by the port was ambushed.

630
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:21,990
Let us go.

631
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,740
Do not move.

632
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,530
I knew I smelled a flowery scent.

633
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,660
You are very pretty.

634
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,690
Order the women in this warehouse to be released right now.

635
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,600
If you do not, this knife will stab your throat.

636
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,000
- You came to save the women.
- Right now!

637
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,030
I will release them if you accept my request.

638
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,680
What is your request?

639
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,300
Tonight,

640
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,660
become my woman.

641
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,690
Is that all you can think of?

642
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,120
- What-
- Sure.

643
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,280
Instead, order the women to be released right now.

644
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,960
How can I trust you?

645
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,950
You are also my type.

646
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,300
Hurry up and order them. It is hard to take them off with one hand.

647
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,890
Wind Knife and the Royal Guards, too?

648
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:50,180
How on Earth did they...

649
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:59,280
That is...

650
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,310
I found them!

651
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,440
Set the warehouse on fire.

652
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,070
Burn them all down!

653
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,030
- Yes!
- Yes, Grand Prince!

654
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,800
Get out of here.

655
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,210
Nu Ru! Nu Ru, where are you?

656
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,620
Hurry up and escape right now!

657
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,520
Hurry it up!

658
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,590
Nu Ru, Nu Ru!

659
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,920
Nu Ru, Nu Ru!

660
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,400
Hurry up and come out!

661
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,590
Nu Ru, Nu Ru!

662
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,170
Hurry up and escape! Hurry!

663
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,720
Run away!

664
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,830
We must hurry! Quickly!

665
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,240
Yes!

666
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:53,350
Master Yang!

667
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,020
Master Yang-

668
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,610
Be careful, be careful.

669
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,680
Hurry up and move along!

670
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,760
Yeon Wol? Yeon Wol!

671
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,990
Yeon Wol! Yeon Wol!

672
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,700
Yeon Wol!

673
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,430
Hong Gun! Hong Gun, get it together!

674
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,990
Your Highness!

675
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,730
Hong Gun, get out. Please get out!

676
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,160
Get out, get out!

677
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,890
It is okay. Get out.

678
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,790
Yeon Wol!

679
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,200
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

680
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,060
Y-Yeon Wol is still inside.

681
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,760
Kyera!

682
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:15,500
♫ Dyed in the sad moonlight ♫

683
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:21,500
♫ My sigh grows deeper ♫

684
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,870
Yeon Wol!

685
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:25,640
Yeon Wol.

686
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,570
Yeon Wol.

687
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,690
Kyera!

688
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:35,430
What the hell are you doing, Sajo Hyun?

689
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:37,840
Kyera, I will save you.

690
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,100
♫ It feels like I can reach you from here ♫

691
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,520
What is this? Why is it not letting me pass?

692
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,240
What is this?

693
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,110
Kyera!

694
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:59,630
♫ At the edge of the fleeting moonlight ♫

695
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,720
Kyera!

696
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,960
♫ Because I was always you ♫

697
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,660
♫ And you were always me ♫

698
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,180
♫ I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere ♫

699
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:28,900
♫ The place where you are, even if it'll only be a moment ♫

700
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,120
♫ Please take me ♫

701
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,560
- Master Yang, you cannot!
- Let go!

702
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,930
I-I am sorry.

703
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:49,820
♫ Please hold me so I do not waver ♫

704
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,790
♫ Please hug me ♫

705
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,020
Yeon Wol!

706
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:05,000
♫ Because I was you ♫

707
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,270
Get it together. Hey, get it together and stand up!

708
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,320
Hurry up!

709
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,100
Soon Yi!

710
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,250
Soon Yi!

711
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,320
I can call you my father, right?

712
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,430
Nu Ru.

713
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,920
Nu Ru.

714
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,930
Father is here.

715
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,010
Father is here, Nu Ru.

716
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:24,660
O-Open-

717
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,610
Open your eyes, Nu Ru!

718
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:33,150
Nu Ru, Nu Ru!

719
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:55,030
Sajo Hyun, you half-witted bastard.

720
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,270
You could not even protect Kyera.

721
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,600
Sajo Hyun, you half-witted bastard!

722
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,100
Yes.

723
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:09,030
I am indeed a half-wit.

724
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:14,090
What can a fool like me do?

725
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,280
I could not even protect my woman.

726
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,330
Yeon Wol?

727
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:11,940
Yeon Wol!

728
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,370
Yeon Wol!

729
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,900
Yeon Wol!

730
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:24,810
Yeon Wol.

731
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:31,840
♫ The feelings seeped through the hidden opening ♫

732
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,330
Your Majesty.

733
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,460
Yeon Wol.

734
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:43,800
♫ The sad memory ♫

735
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:53,260
♫ The feelings seeped through the fallen leaves ♫

736
01:02:53,260 --> 01:03:02,730
♫ That is how my night deepens, more and more ♫

737
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:12,250
♫ Fall more on this lotus tonight and shine on this night more ♫

738
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:21,980
♫ The dawn is lingering around my ears quietly, making me sad ♫

739
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:31,150
♫ I set afloat my deep feelings onto the moon, folded neatly ♫

740
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,210
♫ When the tears I swallowed disappear ♫

741
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:39,420
[Love Song for Illusion]

742
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,060
You also know well who led the trafficking of our women.

743
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,540
Do you not, Grand Prince?

744
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:48,860
Could you be talking about what the late king did?

745
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,700
This is breaking news!

746
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,670
I thought it was only a rumor, but it was true.

747
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:55,430
Hurry up and give birth to a son.

748
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:57,550
That is our only way for survival.

749
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:00,210
Summon the evil spirit right now.

750
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:04,220
If there comes a moment even His Majesty cannot save Yeon Wol...

751
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,290
- I am sorry.
- he might force his way out.

752
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,420
Kyera!

753
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:13,160
♫ Flying ever so sadly ♫
