00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,760
What are you all doing?

8
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,090
Arrest this evil spirit right now!

9
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,210
Sajo Yoong, you scoundrel!

10
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,000
On top of plotting a rebellion, are you mocking the King and the Royal Family?

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,850
How am I an evil spirit?

12
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,440
Everyone, watch clearly!

13
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,780
Your Majesty!

14
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,360
Your Majesty!

15
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,170
Did you see that?

16
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,290
If I am really an evil spirit,

17
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,330
would my blood be red like this?

18
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,250
You still do not believe me?

19
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,560
Fine.

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,860
If I am an evil spirit, I must be immortal and undying.

21
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,670
Sajo Yoong, strike my neck with your sword.

22
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,940
Your Majesty, please calm down.

23
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,880
Why can you not strike me down?

24
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,820
With everyone watching, kill the King and

What are the Royal Guards doing?

27
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,480
Arrest the rebels right away!

28
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,810
Lock up the rebels right away!

29
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,180
Officer Ji, tie this man up again.

30
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,830
Tie him up tightly!

31
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,090
Yes, Your Majesty!

32
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,680
Take him.

33
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,670
That man is definitely an evil spirit!

34
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,280
Chung Ta, where are you? Chung Ta!

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,000
Let go! He is an evil spirit!

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,330
He is the one you should take! Let me go!

37
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,000
You are Ak Hee, huh?

38
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,420
Please have us lowly ones killed for failing to protect you!

39
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,990
Please have us killed!

40
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:24,350
From this moment on, if anyone dares to refer to me as an evil spirit,

41
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,910
I will slash him with my sword right there and then.

42
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,360
Do you understand?

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,120
I shall heed your words to heart, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,080

Chung Ta.

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,390
What did you do to His Majesty?

48
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,830
What do you mean?

49
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,470
I saw you shoot the poison dart.

50
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,160
What kind of poison does it contain?

51
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,590
Poison- What poison dart are you talking about?

52
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,070
Sajo Yoong instigated you, right?

53
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,170
Why did you side with Sajo Yoong?

54
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,500
My goodness!

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,140
Chung Ta-

56
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,630
Hong Gun, do not move.

57
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeon Wol.

58
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,310
It will hurt a lot.

59
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,950
Endure it.

60
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,320
You cannot move for a while.

61
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,290
I will go find herbs in the mountain that help with wounds.

62
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,140
Yeon Wol.

63
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,880
Please just kill me.

64
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,270
Yeon Wol.

65
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,950
Yeon Wol.

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,370
I am sorry.

67
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,230
I am sorry.

68
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,880
He said they would sell my sisters, who live outside the Palace.

69
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,070
I am sorry!

70
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,770
Such a thing will not happen.

71
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,530
Run away right now.

72
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,190
I tried to run away,

73
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,120
but I got caught.

74
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,390
It looks like we should bring the physician.

75
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,440
What if it gets infected?

76
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,540
How fussy. It is fine.

77
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,950
Your Majesty, are you feeling unwell?

78
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,320
No.

79
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,640
Your Majesty, I apologize for asking,

80
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,090
but you are Sir Ak Hee, right?

81
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,300
I apologize, Your Majesty.

82
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,450
You are right. I am Ak Hee.

83
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,660
Then, what happened to His Majesty?

84
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,300
I heard he suddenly did not seem well on the interrogation grounds.

85
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,890
Right.

86
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,740
Well, I am sure he is not too well.

87
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,080
Aigoo, Your Majesty.

88
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,380
Your Majesty.

89
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,470
Listen carefully.

90
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,750
From now on, you two, Eunuch Neung and Ji Jeon Seo are the only people I can trust.

91
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,960
You know things are rough right now, right?

92
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,340
You need to get your acts together.

93
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,100
If you fall asleep, will His Majesty come back out, Sir Ak Hee?

94
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,870
Why? Are you worried Sajo Hyun will not come out?

95
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,200
Because I might take over this body?

96
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,860
This is unpleasant, Ji Jeon Seo.

97
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,240
For now, secretly check if Kyera is okay.

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,570
- Yes.
- Even if Sajo Yoong is in prison,

99
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,380
he will be squeezing his brains out for a big one, so keep a good watch on him.

100
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,430
- Yes.
- We will do that.

101
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,160
And also watch the Head Minister, Jin Mu Dal, and the Queen closely.

102
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,650
There are so many people to watch out for.

103
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,300
Kyera.

104
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,820
Master Yang.

105
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,630
I thought something happened because you did not come while I waited.

106
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,380
You came at the perfect time earlier.

107
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,930
It was really close.

108
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,250
By the way, were rumors spreading inside the capital true?

109
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,900
I also saw His Majesty starting to act strange.

110
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,970
That is His Majesty's deep scar I told you about before.

111
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,510
The day our family was massacred that is what happened to His Majesty.

112
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,330
The one I have been facing so far...

113
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,270
was the evil spirit?

114
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,760
No, you always met with His Majesty, except for just now at the interrogation grounds.

115
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,460
And Sir Ak Hee is not an evil spirit.

116
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,470
He is just another personality who resides in His Majesty's body.

117
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,610
Another personality?

118
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,410
Sir Ak Hee is unfortunate, too.

119
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,680
Hey, Sajo Hyun, you cannot speak here, either?

120
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,260
Man, it looks like that was a tranquilizing dart.

121
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,680
Gosh, Chung Ta, that son of a bitch.

122
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,250
Right, you can talk to me through your mind.

123
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,320
Try talking in your mind.

124
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,020
What happened to Yeon Wol?

125
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,540
You are still worried about Kyera in this situation?

126
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,480
The woman who was shot by an arrow earlier was not Kyera.

127
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,300
It was Hong Gun.

128
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,090
Sajo Yoong, that punk, wanted to force me out,

129
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,070
so he intentionally made it look like Kyera was in danger.

130
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,600
Your body needs to weaken for me to force my way out.

131
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,580
That is why you were shot with a tranquilizing dart.

132
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,380
I hope Yeon Wol is safe.

133
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,640
Aigoo, even in this state, Kyera is all you think about.

134
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,040
Is the floor not cold, huh?

135
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,920
Your mouth will start drooping.

136
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,930
Hold on a moment.

137
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,200
You are heavier than you look.

138
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,490
Ak Hee, please check if Yeon Wol is okay.

139
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,480
Hey, I already told them to check. Would I just do nothing?

140
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,310
Just worry about yourself!

141
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,740
Do you know how scary a tranquilizing dart is?

142
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,800
Tranquilizing darts show different effects according to the dosage you were hit with.

143
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,610
- You-
- Your Majesty!

144
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,040
Her Majesty and Head Minister have arrived.

145
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,010
Let them enter.

146
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,780
Your Majesty, I heard Grand Prince Sajo Yoong brought about an impertinent mayhem.

147
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,100
Are you okay?

148
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,980
Of course, I am okay.

149
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,570
I got to expose Sajo Yoong's impure intentions.

150
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,320
It is actually for the better.

151
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,550
By the way, according to the Palace people,

152
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,300
at the interrogation grounds, you were-

153
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,970
Did they say I displayed questionable behavior?

154
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,510
Looks like they are excited to talk about the king being possessed by an evil spirit.

155
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,220
So, did you come running as well to see for yourself?

156
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,260
Sir Ak Hee.

157
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,000
W-What did you just say?

158
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,670
Head Minister, are you doubting me as well?

159
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,030
Did I look so questionable for getting furious at Sajo Yoong, who plotted treason?

160
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:56,440
Sir Ak Hee, you have to be honest with me and Her Majesty.

161
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:04,090
That is how we can unite and fight off the wicked Sajo Yoong.

162
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,330
What nonsense are you saying, Head Minister?

163
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,460
Father, how could you dare say such a thing to His Majesty?

164
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,460
Apologize right away.

165
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,940
I apologize, Your Majesty.

166
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,090
Father, the current king is not His Majesty.

167
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,650
He is clearly the one called Ak Hee.

168
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,640
His gaze looks different.

169
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,850
Yes, this is a serious problem.

170
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,910
Sajo Yoong is wreaking havoc like that, and

171
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:44,000
His Majesty let everyone find out a significant weakness.

172
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,270
My goodness.

173
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,080
Sajo Yoong is imprisoned, so he will not have his way for a while.

174
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,970
Do you not know Sajo Yoong?

175
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,810
Even if his limbs are tied and put in solitary confinement,

176
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,600
he is wicked enough to manipulate the heavens and earth.

177
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,450
Actually...

178
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,720
a crisis might turn out to be an opportunity.

179
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,640
Your Majesty,

180
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:19,510
sleep with the one called Ak Hee right away.

181
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,450
He might be easy to win over.

182
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,840
Father, how can you tell me to sleep with an evil spirit?

183
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,120
Your Majesty, what happened-

184
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,400
Wait and see.

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,820
Fate might be on our side, perhaps.

186
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,340
I wonder if Hong Gun is okay with taking an arrow to her leg?

187
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,690
Yeon Wol!

188
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,780
Why are you here?

189
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,250
His Majesty's chamber is dangerous right now.

190
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,440
Everyone is looking intensely from everywhere.

191
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,630
Do you know what happened to His Majesty?

192
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,820
No.

193
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,890
I asked Sir Ak Hee, but he only got mad.

194
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,180
I am also worried to death.

195
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,850
Eunuch Neung, I must meet Sir Ak Hee.

196
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,670
Your Majesty?

197
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,580
I cannot even see you clearly now.

198
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,620
But I can still feel it.

199
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,760
That you are smiling right now.

200
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,650
Kyera.

201
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,510
- Sir Ak Hee.
- Were you disappointed

202
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,760
because I am not Sajo Hyun?

203
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,020
How is His Majesty right now?

204
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,530
He is not doing too well.

205
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,060
I think Chung Ta shot him with a tranquilizing dart.

206
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,900
A tranquilizing dart?

207
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,090
What happens when you get shot by a tranquilizing dart?

208
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,470
I lost my memories because of the sleeping incense.

209
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,890
Tranquilizing darts show different symptoms depending on the dosage.

210
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,360
Losing memories is one.

211
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,790
Shot in the wrong spot, you might lose your speech or

212
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,650
your body stiffens like Sajo Hyun.

213
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,010
His body stiffened and

214
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,340
he cannot speak?

215
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,330
How...

216
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,120
How do you treat it?

217
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,480
What do I need to do?

218
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,000
Who knows?

219
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,270
I do not know what to do.

220
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,300
Chung Ta must know the solution.

221
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,810
He helped me get my memories back, too.

222
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,630
Back then, I think he gave me the antidote.

223
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,210
I ran into him earlier.

224
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,780
I should have held onto him.

225
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,600
Sajo Hyun was worried sick about you, too.

226
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,550
Whether you got hurt or not and

227
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,840
about what happened to you.

228
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,240
About me?

229
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,640
Tell him I am doing well.

230
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,660
Tell him I will find a way to save him one way or the other.

231
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,760
Tell him he cannot be losing heart now.

232
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,750
Please...

233
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,030
make sure to tell him.

234
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,490
I am sorry, Sir Ak Hee.

235
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,480
I was just worried and confused.

236
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,450
It is upsetting to hear you are sorry.

237
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,600
We are really like strangers now.

238
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,690
People who have nothing to do with each other.

239
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,330
I am-

240
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,090
Sir Ak Hee, are you unwell?

241
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,380
Your eyes are a little...

242
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,020
Do not worry about me.

243
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,540
I will find a way to heal Sajo Hyun quickly.

244
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,140
Your Majesty!

245
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,890
Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

246
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,500
Something terrible happened.

247
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,680
What is wrong?

248
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,770
They said Prince Ga Ron was spitting blood and suddenly fainted!

249
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,370
Be careful.

250
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,570
I will get going now.

251
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,490
Bring me with you.

252
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,800
I might know what is going on.

253
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,230
Something seemed to have happened to Prince Ga Ron?

254
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,280
Seeing how he is staying inside, he must be ill.

255
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,730
Find out what illness it is.

256
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,590
Yes, I will.

257
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,340
Everyone got imprisoned.

258
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,220
What do we do now since all your men are tied down?

259
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,630
W-Why did he suddenly lose consciousness and faint?

260
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,170
It looks like the flu.

261
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,440
He spat blood because bad energies came in from outside, making his lungs heat up.

262
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,010
If Jinhoi finds out, they will start making all kinds of assumptions.

263
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,760
I will find the cure promptly.

264
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,440
It looks strongly contagious.

265
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,720
It might be spreading among the people already.

266
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,550
You have to make sure it does not spread.

267
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,150
The people are anxious, and turbulent lies are-

268
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,970
We will need to focus on containing the spread of the illness.

269
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,800
Minister of Medicine, especially the poor people and...

270
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,090
Ak Hee.

271
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,730
Are you causing a curse to be laid on Asatae?

272
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,520
Wind Knife are going around villages and bringing the sick who cannot move.

273
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,480
I knew things were looking unsettling from a few days ago.

274
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,990
And it is spreading like wildfire out of nowhere.

275
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,210
It is the same symptom Hwang Ga Ron had.

276
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,570
Does he also have the plague?

277
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,000
Sir Physician!

278
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,640
Sir, thank you for all your work.

279
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,630
This illness is highly contagious.

280
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,160
You must prevent contagion by making the sick cover their nose and mouths with a towel.

281
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,690
Are you a physician?

282
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,550
I studied medicine since I was young.

283
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,540
I will help out as well.

284
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,700
P-Please be careful.

285
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,300
A-Aigoo.

286
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,020
You must be dead tired

287
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,830
from discussing the measures all night.

288
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,960
If His Majesty wakes up because you go to sleep,

289
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,710
will he still be in that state?

290
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,870
Well...

291
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,710
probably?

292
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,290
So he cannot even talk and move freely?

293
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,960
That is why I cannot even sleep right now.

294
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,080
In this situation we have,

295
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,340
what will happen if Sajo Hyun comes out unable to speak with a stiff body?

296
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,220
W-What do you think will happen?

297
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,350
Could His Majesty not have gotten better in the meantime?

298
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,220
So I should get lost now?

299
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,790
Oh, okay. I will go.

300
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:33,060
Gosh! S-Sir Ak Hee! N-No.

301
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,560
You cannot go to sleep, Sir Ak Hee.

302
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,070
You are still calling me "Sir Ak Hee"?

303
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,080
Y-Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

304
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,740
Your Majesty, please do not sleep.

305
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,830
Aigoo! Y-Your Majesty, you cannot!

306
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,400
Wait, you cannot-

307
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,680
Ak Hee.

308
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,630
Please take care of my people...

309
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,460
and Yeon Wol, too.

310
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,810
The haunted king will bring forth a plague!

311
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,660
Hwang Ga Ron caught the plague?

312
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,860
Looks like the heavens are also helping me, Sajo Yoong. Right?

313
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,040
You will soon take the throne, Grand Prince.

314
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,600
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

315
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,750
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

316
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,750
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

317
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,670
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

318
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,710
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

319
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,720
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

320
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,780
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

321
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,870
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

322
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,930
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

323
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,950
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

324
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,900
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

325
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,150
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

326
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:23,320
"The haunted king will bring forth a plague!"

327
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,250
The posters' contents changed.

328
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,840
What is worse is the fact that there is an actual plague.

329
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,900
That is right.

330
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,860
Would that mean...

331
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,030
it is because the evil spirit is possessing His Majesty?

332
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,240
No matter how I think about it, it is weird.

333
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,500
At the interrogation grounds,

334
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,400
His Majesty clearly seemed to become a different person.

335
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,640
- You are right.
- Oh, right!

336
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,090
That must be why he locked up Grand Prince Sajo Yoong, do you not think?

337
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,380
Because he knows His Majesty's secret!

338
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,080
This is troublesome.

339
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,000
All hail His Majesty!

340
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,140
Hence, as more people are catching the plague all over the country and

341
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,860
the people's resentment grows by the day-

342
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,600
Minister of Finance.

343
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,810
Do you not know well how plagues came and went as seasons and times changed?

344
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,600
Just what is all this fuss about?

345
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,360
Your Majesty, it is not a fuss. In reality, within the capital,

346
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,850
there- Aigoo, Your Majesty- Never mind, Your Majesty.

347
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,630
The rumor that the plague was caused by the haunted king?

348
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,730
Are you not the ones who are actually trembling in fear, Ministers?

349
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,860
Stop feeding into the rumors here and there.

350
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,650
And I hope you will cooperate with the Minister of Medicine.

351
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,020
Answer?

352
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,050
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

353
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,010
Your Majesty!

354
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,810
I, Minister of General Affairs, report to you.

355
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:09,400
Jinhoi's messengers arrived at Port Mihwari and requested to meet you.

356
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,030
What do they want to see me about?

357
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,650
Well,

358
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,520
they are demanding Grand Prince Sajo Yoong to be released promptly.

359
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,060
W-What now?

360
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,550
Wait, who are they to tell me what to do?

361
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,330
You can all leave for today and

362
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,310
I want the Minister of General Affairs and Head Minister to stay.

363
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,580
They want to meet Prince Ga Ron?

365
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,880
Is that what the messengers asked for?

366
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,560
Yes, they heard a rumor that Prince Ga Ron is currently being detained inside the Palace.

367
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,850
So they want to meet Prince Ga Ron quickly and confirm his well-being.

368
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,230
He is detained? How ridiculous.

369
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,760
I will take care of this, so do not let this bother you too much.

370
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,930
I am sure it was here.

371
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:35,560
Gosh, what on Earth are you looking for?

372
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,040
Did you bury some gold around here?

373
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,470
Who am I talking to? Geez!

374
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,730
- Huh? Whoa!
- Whoa!

375
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,480
Whoa, whoa!

376
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,140
W-Whoa!

377
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,810
Gosh, we found it!

378
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,250
They're medical books my grandmother gave me.

379
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,890
Your grandmother?

380
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,960
You said she was a royal physician.

381
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,800
I think I read a similar plague going around in the past.

382
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,590
I found it, I found it!

383
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,080
My memory was right!

384
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,600
- It was right!
- You were right!

385
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,530
You hit* my right arm. Ouch.
(Sounds like "You're right" in Korean)

386
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,990
These are ephedra and licorice.

387
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,500
These are gypsum and apricot kernels.

388
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,780
Ephedra and gypsum only grow deep in the mountains.

389
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,400
If you continue to give ephedra gypsum tea to the patients, it will have an effect on the plague.

390
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,930
And make sure to use needle therapy on dazhui*.
(Acupuncture point used for fevers)

391
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,550
I understand.

392
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,330
Are you going to the Palace?

393
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,330
Prince Ga Ron needs to be saved.

394
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,400
Jinhoi will be sure to pose it as a problem.

395
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,810
And that is what Grand Prince Sajo Yoong would rejoice over.

396
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,190
Be careful.

397
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,580
Sajo Yoong's henchmen are everywhere.

398
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,300
Yes, Master Yang.

399
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,480
Why is he not regaining consciousness?

400
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,560
Prince Ga Ron was born with weak energy, so it looks like he cannot recover as quickly.

401
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,430
We need him to wake up so he can take the medicine.

402
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,440
Jinhoi is mistakenly thinking we are detaining this man.

403
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,240
They keep requesting to meet him.

404
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,040
Sajo Yoong must have contacted them.

405
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,870
Yes, what a wicked bastard.

406
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:53,820
I did intimidate the messengers, saying how dare they mock our Royal Family.

407
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,680
But their assumptions will only worsen as time goes on.

408
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,570
We will need to make sure he wakes up.

409
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,140
I will keep tending to him here.

410
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,050
Well...

411
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,200
Sajo Hyun is doing well.

412
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,040
He did not worsen.

413
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,200
It is a relief to hear he did not worsen.

414
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:48,110
♫ I will come and meet you ♫

415
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:55,150
♫ I will come to you where you are breathing ♫

416
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,230
♫ Close your eyes for a moment ♫

417
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,450
Your Majesty, how painful must you be?

418
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,620
How worried and lonely must you be?

419
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,830
I miss you, Your Majesty.

420
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,480
♫ Please embrace me ♫

421
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,880
♫ I will reach you now ♫

422
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,870
Kyera, you are crying.

423
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,140
♫ With my breath ♫

424
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,910
Your love for Sajo Hyun is deep enough

425
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,650
to shed tears without others knowing.

426
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:34,830
♫ The moment the flowers bloom again after this winter ♫

427
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:44,190
♫ I will reach you now ♫

428
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,900
Prince Ga Ron!

429
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,830
It is you again?

430
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,350
Great job! Thank you for overcoming!

431
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,320
Please drink it all.

432
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,260
Aigoo.

433
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,730
Aigoo, you drank it so well.

434
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,410
All right, this one, too.

435
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,110
I am sincerely glad you recovered.

436
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,580
You are all on your wits' ends.

437
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,630
You must have been scared that people would find out I got sick.

438
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,470
Of course, we were.

439
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,490
Because we do not know what issue a stronger country may raise against us.

440
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,870
However, aside from all of this,

441
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,300
we sincerely wished just for you to recover.

442
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Because a person's life should not be used as a tool,

443
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,860
much like Asatae's women, who were sold off to Jinhoi.

444
00:33:52,200 --> 00:34:00,000
I only had compassion as someone who practices medicine as I watched you suffer in pain.

445
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,340
Yeon Wol searched the mountains to bring precious medicinal herbs.

446
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,470
And she nursed you all day, every day.

447
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,160
Thanks.

448
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,240
Messengers from Jinhoi are waiting for you.

449
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,420
If you are truly apologetic to Asatae's women who were sacrificed unjustly,

450
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,230
if you have even an inkling of thanks for this woman who nursed you,

451
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,840
I trust you will be a good mediator.

452
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,600
I went to visit him and

453
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,360
Grand Prince had lost so much weight.

454
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,100
Queen, what if the Grand Prince dies like that?

455
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,420
Please save Grand Prince, Queen.

456
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,350
I will...

457
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,690
beg...

458
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,130
I will beg like this, Queen. Please?

459
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:19,300
As expected, a mother's love is quite sad and beautiful like this.

460
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,630
Of course!

461
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,220
If it is for my son, I am fine with getting ripped apart

462
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,740
and becoming the crows' food.

463
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,710
Queen, please...

464
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,080
If you help me, Consort Cheong Myeong, I will release Grand Prince.

465
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,360
How?

466
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,020
I will do anything. Just say the word.

467
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:50,540
Please announce that the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is not the late king's biological son.

468
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,060
How did you know-

469
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,240
What do you mean, Queen?

470
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,800
You see, my Yoong is...

471
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,980
a long time ago when I was-

472
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,400
So, when the late king was a general,

473
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,470
I secretly had such-and-such happen to give birth to him.

474
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,020
Of course, I did have a good-for-nothing husband at the time.

475
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,610
But he is nothing more than a fool.

476
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:26,370
I only loved His Majesty, so-

477
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,970
Hear ye.

478
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

479
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,090
Demote Consort Cheong Myeong, the mother of the rebel Sajo Yoong, to a court lady

480
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,850
and detain her in her residence.

481
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,140
Yes.

482
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,490
Wait, why?

483
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:47,160
I only came to beg you, Queen.

484
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,580
As the leader of Inner Court, I was thinking about demoting you to a court lady.

485
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,860
So you came at just the right time.

486
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,830
Be glad you are not kicked out of the Palace and

487
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,560
just stay put inside your residence.

488
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,860
Instead of peeking here and there within the Palace

489
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,370
like a stray cat to report to your son, Court Lady Gwang.

490
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,050
C-Court Lady Gwang?

491
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,320
Queen, how can you do this to me?

492
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,260
I am more or less your mother-in-law!

493
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,410
Let go, you lowly ones!

494
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,930
I am the late king's best concubine and

495
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,960
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's mother!

496
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,630
Let go of me!

497
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,640
Let go!

498
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,170
I am sure Chung Ta lived around here.

499
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,320
Chung Ta?

500
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,220
Kyera!

501
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,260
I got it from a powerful shaman.

502
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,840
Put this on one's forehead and

503
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,620
they freeze just like that.

504
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,640
Would Chung Ta not be more powerful than that shaman?

505
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,500
No, no, even tigers jump when bitten by a flea.

506
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,530
Take it. It is better than nothing.

507
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,140
Do not move!

508
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,020
Kyera.

509
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,120
Wait, so you would wander the mountains like this?

510
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,730
In the middle of the night? So fearlessly? All alone?

511
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,920
What can I do, then? Chung Ta is the only one who can fix His Majesty.

512
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,480
Look, and also,

513
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,870
these cheap talismans do not work on Chung Ta.

514
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,830
Where the heck is this punk, though?

515
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,120
Seeing how he appeared at the interrogation grounds,

516
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,530
I do not think he moved too far away.

517
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,970
Why did he not move far?

518
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,760
Look at your body.

519
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,200
It is fading away, right?

520
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,600
At this rate, you will disappear completely in the end.

521
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,720
And I will disappear, too, on top of that.

522
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,310
He cannot move that far.

523
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,460
Why?

524
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,740
Because Female Chung Ta is being held hostage.

525
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,540
Female Chung Ta?

526
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,580
There is a female Chung Ta?

527
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,800
Two people coexist in his body.

528
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,560
Male Chung Ta and Female Chung Ta.

529
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:46,040
Oh, so you are saying Chung Ta also shares one body like you and His Majesty.

530
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,690
Why must you compare me to them? That is insulting.

531
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,450
They are a man-woman.

532
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,610
So Sajo Hyun and I are...

533
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,690
A man-man?

534
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,210
Anyhow, something happened to Female Chung Ta.

535
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,830
That is why Male Chung Ta is doing as Sajo Yoong orders.

536
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:14,040
In that case, Female Chung Ta must be locked up somewhere.

537
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,880
A place where even Male Chung Ta cannot approach.

538
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,970
I am so hungry.

539
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,310
Chicken, a boar's hindleg, pig's feet,

540
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,130
bean rice cakes, honey rice cakes, deep-fried wheat cakes,

541
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,550
large beef intestines, small beef intestines, and beef abomasum.

542
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,640
It is our first time walking together like this.

543
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,750
Why?

544
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,950
Because the shadows only show us two.

545
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,520
Kyera and I.

546
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Neither fake or real, just me.

547
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,140
Your Majesty.

548
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,830
Do you miss Sajo Hyun that much?

549
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,940
I am sorry.

550
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,260
You said you do not like to hear this.

551
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,500
I will let you meet Sajo Hyun.

552
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,220
- Sir Ak Hee.
- You cannot see him for a long time.

553
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,300
It is only for a moment.

554
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,800
Are you going to fall asleep again? Right here?

555
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,370
You cannot. It is dangerous.

556
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,350
Sir Ak Hee.

557
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,880
Sorry.

558
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,010
I do not know if this will work,

559
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,480
but it might.

560
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,440
Close your eyes and think of Sajo Hyun.

561
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,230
Trust me.

562
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,870
Trust me fully.

563
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,040
I trust you.

564
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,110
Would it work?

565
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,700
Would I be able to take you to the mind's space, Kyera?

566
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,160
Where is this place?

567
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,430
This is the mind's room.

568
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,170
A place where Sajo Hyun and I meet.

569
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,910
Your Majesty!

570
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,280
Your Majesty.

571
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,720
Yeon Wol.

572
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,610
Your Majesty, even in this place, you are...

573
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,020
How did you bring Yeon Wol?

574
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,620
Hey, Sajo Hyun, do not scold me too much.

575
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,930
Last time, I could have slept if I wanted to,

576
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,490
but taking you out and having you stay the same will be troublesome.

577
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,720
They are already at it about the evil spirit and stuff!

578
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,050
Aigoo, I am dizzy.

579
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,440
It must have been exhausting to bring me here.

580
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,350
Your Majesty, does it hurt?

581
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,290
Where does it hurt?

582
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,940
Do not worry.

583
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,400
I am going to cure you for sure.

584
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,970
I am fine.

585
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,110
I am worried about you.

586
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,700
You have to be careful.

587
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,720
He said he is fine.

588
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,550
Acting tough, huh.

589
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,720
He said he is worried about you, so you should be careful.

590
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,660
Your Majesty, just think about the good stuff.

591
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,210
The good times we had.

592
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:48,540
The beautiful memories.

593
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,760
I will.

594
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,280
He said he will.

595
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,040
Gosh, why am I doing this for them?

596
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,740
♫ I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere ♫

597
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,230
Your Majesty.

598
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:15,600
♫ The place where you are, even if it'll only be a moment, please take me ♫

599
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:29,480
♫ Please hold me so I do not waver, I am tired ♫

600
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:42,210
♫ Please hug me so I can relax ♫

601
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,220
♫ Because I was you ♫

602
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,240
We must find Female Chung Ta.

603
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,000
I mean...

604
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,420
even Male Chung Ta is nowhere to be found.

605
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,880
So, how can we find Female Chung Ta?

606
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,260
If Female Chung Ta is locked up somewhere, it means she is immobile,

607
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,800
which means we can find her.

608
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
When pigs fly.

609
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,200
Rather than to find Female Chung Ta, I would-

610
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,740
You would rather?

611
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,330
Gosh, so dizzy.

612
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,310
You are exhausted because of me, right?

613
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,490
It is not because of you.

614
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:31,600
My nosiness is the problem.

615
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,090
Gosh, so annoying! I need to be able to see to do anything!

616
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,550
You cannot see this?

617
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,110
It was figurative speech.

618
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,950
Let me see.

619
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,290
Stop overreacting and hold it for a moment!

620
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:04,910
No, it hurts when we make contact!

621
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,640
We just made contact.

622
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,440
I am sorry.

623
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,380
Sir Ak Hee, your vision is blurry, right?

624
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:20,150
Nope, I can see just fine.

625
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,440
Officer Ji is over there.

626
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,160
Officer Ji!

627
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,810
Your Majesty, how far have you traveled?

628
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,830
Oh, just up to there.

629
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,000
You are going, right?

630
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,060
Take care, then.

631
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,160
- Sir Ak Hee-
- Please be careful!

632
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,220
Oh, I-I am fine.

633
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,290
Where did a plague suddenly come from?

634
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,880
I am about to die.

635
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,310
You got a lot better. You will be cured soon.

636
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,950
What is the use of just me getting cured?

637
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,400
The entire neighborhood is full of sick people.

638
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,570
Aigoo, it is because the king is haunted. We are all going to die.

639
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,630
That is not true, ahjumma. This is a curable sickness.

640
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,850
It only spreads because it is contagious.

641
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,650
All the rumors about the king being haunted are false.

642
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,580
What are you saying is false?

643
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,880
The fish died in groups, surfacing on the river.

644
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,590
They said healthy trees withered to death.

645
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,900
I saw it, too.

646
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,200
The fish died at once like that.

647
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,690
A 100-year-old white turtle died with its belly showing.

648
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:54,300
This is all because of the haunted king!

649
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,710
The evil spirit possessed...

650
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:06,240
We are the only ones dying out because of the haunted king!

651
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,590
They are heading to the government office today, too.

652
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:18,050
The haunted king should step down!

653
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:22,180
We are all going to die at this rate!

654
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,810
The haunted king should step down!

655
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,230
Sajo Yoong is manipulating public opinion again.

656
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,200
The people are being swayed.

657
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,040
It is because the plague is spreading.

658
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,600
You distributed the medicine I made, right?

659
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,960
Wind Knife is visiting each village to hand them out, but it is not enough.

660
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,460
I heard the border situation is looking dangerous, too.

661
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,290
Gosh, this is terrible.

662
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:47,200
The haunted king should step down!

663
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,680
The public opinion is worsening.

664
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,630
You have to step forward, Sir Ak Hee.

665
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,060
What? Should I step forward and

666
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,300
tell them I am not an evil spirit but the king?

667
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,110
That seems to be the best we can do for now.

668
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,490
I do not want to.

669
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,840
You promised me you would help His Majesty.

670
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,520
When did I?

671
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,400
You made that promise on your own, Kyera.

672
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,050
Letting you meet Sajo Hyun was not enough?

673
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,840
Are you not asking too much from me?

674
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,460
- Sir Ak Hee!
- Also,

675
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,940
I am an evil spirit.

676
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,630
You want me to stand in front of the people and say I am not an evil spirit?

677
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:27,080
What if a tranquilizing dart comes my way?

678
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,710
Are you going to take it in my place?

679
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,530
I apologize. I was feeling too desperate.

680
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,700
I brought you medicine for your eyes.

681
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,500
I will tell Eunuch Neung to brew it for you.

682
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,660
Wow.

683
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:55,000
I get such great treatment, thanks to Sajo Hyun.

684
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,080
Do you think these medicines will work on an evil spirit?

685
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,570
Take them back, and stop teasing me.

686
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,230
Sir Ak Hee, why are you so angry at me?

687
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:15,100
It is because of how I met His Majesty last time, right?

688
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,640
Yes, you are right!

689
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,730
I regret having helped you two meet!

690
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,270
Why do I need to help your romance, huh?

691
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:26,730
Go.

692
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,570
Go and never come to me again.

693
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,900
- Sir Ak Hee.
- This is a royal decree.

694
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,020
Get lost.

695
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,150
Is Chung Ta looking right now?

696
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,450
I hope he is looking.

697
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,700
Ak Hee, are you quite pissed now?

698
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,020
Why did you drive away Yeon Wol so harshly?

699
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,990
Do you not know Kyera?

700
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,140
No matter how harsh I am with her, she is not even fazed.

701
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,100
It is not like she would not come back just because I kicked her out.

702
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,680
Are you saying you did it on purpose?

703
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,790
Gosh, I do not know.

704
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,070
What will you do with your worsening vision?

705
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,300
Is there no way for you to get better?

706
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:40,530
There is.

707
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,700
If I seal you away with bonghamsal,

708
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,110
my eyes will probably get better again. Should I do that?

709
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:52,710
I am already annoyed seeing you and Kyera getting all lovey-dovey.

710
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,250
Do as you wish.

711
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,380
If I am to live on like this,

712
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,400
it will be better for you to take over this body.

713
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,110
Wait, really?

714
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,220
What about Kyera, then?

715
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,790
She will forget me one day.

716
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:17,190
It will be better than living in pain while watching me live in this state.

717
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,050
Even if that happens,

718
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,590
will you not regret it?

719
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,090
I will not regret it.

720
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,460
Consort Cheong Myeong was?

721
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,860
Yes.

722
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,170
She was demoted to a court lady overnight.

723
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,340
Her Majesty...

724
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,260
is really scary.

725
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,520
Where is Consort Cheong Myeong right now?

726
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,230
Your Highness Consort Cheong Myeong.

727
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,560
Your Highness, what happened to you?

728
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,570
Why did you come here?

729
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,600
Did you come to kill me?

730
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:25,690
No, I came to give you Grand Prince's message.

731
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:28,670
Are you not...

732
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,230
like this with Yoong?

733
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:33,310
It seems that way in other people's eyes.

734
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,860
He took care of me since I was young.

735
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:44,410
Grand Prince told me to tell you not to be too worried

736
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,400
and to cheer up.

737
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,380
My Yoong did?

738
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,950
Yoong.

739
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:05,570
Also, the Grand Prince asked if the one locked up at that time was doing okay.

740
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,560
Locked up?

741
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,670
Oh, right!

742
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:19,120
The shaman he locked up in the warehouse in Dabutgol.

743
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,380
Yes.

744
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,340
I am sure she is doing okay.

745
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,080
No one knows she is there.

746
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,620
Dabutgol is not far from the capital.

747
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,390
I hope Female Chung Ta is there.

748
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,450
[Sajo Hyun]

749
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,950
Well, it is about time for Chung Ta to show up.

750
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,900
Hey.

751
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,100
Long time no see.

752
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,810
Have you decided now?

753
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:11,510
Yes, I am going to seal Sajo Hyun with bonghamsal.

754
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,690
So I can take over this body.

755
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:17,350
What will you do with Grand Prince Sajo Yoong?

756
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,540
I will release him.

757
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:25,200
I am also going to give him the crown at the proper time.

758
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,750
You should have done so from the beginning.

759
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,640
You are so right.

760
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,510
Watching Sajo Hyun and Kyera, I had a soft spot for them out of pity for a while.

761
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,240
But it was pointless.

762
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,690
They are only happy by themselves.

763
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:43,150
Aigoo, I am losing my vision every day.

764
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,360
What is all this for?

765
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,950
Do you really want bonghamsal?

766
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:02,200
Of course! By the way, can you really do it?

767
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,540
The full moon passed already.

768
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,480
- Chung Ta, you know me, right?
- Yes, yes.

769
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,520
Please take off this talisman on my forehead

770
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,370
and all the other talismans!

771
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:30,890
Yes, I will take it off.

772
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,610
Yes, yes, hurry now!

773
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,550
Before that,

774
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,570
give me the antidote.

775
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,860
- Antidote?
- Do you not know?

776
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:44,260
Male Chung Ta tranquilized His Majesty so he could not move or speak.

777
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,390
That was ordered by Sajo Yoong.

778
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,370
Sajo Yoong, that evil bastard.

779
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,610
Give me the antidote, please, Chung Ta.

780
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,370
Things are chaotic inside the capital right now because of a plague and

781
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,080
even Jinhoi is taunting us.

782
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,040
His Majesty needs to wake up soon.

783
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,040
Sajo Yoong will not let me be.

784
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,170
I will protect you.

785
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,840
No, you cannot.

786
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,720
Chung Ta, then, instead,

787
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,770
make my body stiffen and let His Majesty wake up.

788
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:22,340
I cannot see him wither away powerlessly like that.

789
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:28,130
Make me like him instead or take my life, even. Do whatever. Instead...

790
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:33,570
Instead, please save His Majesty, Chung Ta.

791
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,620
Please.

792
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,310
Oh, my, your love is

793
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,110
really so romantic.

794
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,710
Can I really take your life?

795
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:52,980
Yes.

796
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,150
You cannot disappear if I do this, right?

797
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,410
I said I would expose your doings to the shaman association if you keep acting up, right?

798
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:22,130
How are you going to report me?

799
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,210
Jinhoi's shaman, Tan Ya.

800
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:27,340
Jinhoi's prince, Hwang Ga Ron, is best friends with Shaman Tan Ya.

801
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,450
So?

802
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:30,590
I will expose everything you did.

803
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:31,840
I got the evidence, too.

804
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,310
D-Darn!

805
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:36,400
So make Sajo Hyun wake up.

806
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,530
Right now!

807
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:41,520
You were lying about getting bonghamsal.

808
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,420
I am sure you did not come here to do bonghamsal, either.

809
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,680
The full moon passed already.

810
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,230
You catch on fast, Ak Hee.

811
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:53,400
That is right. I did not come to do bonghamsal.

812
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,590
I came to do geuminsal.

813
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:59,820
G-Geuminsal? What is that?

814
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,340
That would be...

815
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:22,030
This is it!

816
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:24,620
If I hold you down with that blade,

817
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,760
how are you going to report us?

818
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,420
You and Sajo Hyun both need to be eliminated

819
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,700
in order for us to survive.

820
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,710
Sorry, Ak Hee.

821
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,560
Ak Hee, what is wrong?

822
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,020
Ak Hee!

823
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,430
Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

824
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,880
Sir Ak Hee, did you enjoy your walk?

825
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,540
Eunuch Neung.

826
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,100
Your Majesty?

827
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,430
Oh, my! A-Aigoo!

828
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,240
Your Majesty!

829
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,730
Why are you so slow?

830
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,610
- Seriously.
- Yeon Wol.

831
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:05,560
- Chung Ta!
- Aigoo.

832
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:09,320
- Give me the antidote.
- What?

833
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,310
Cure His Majesty. Please give me the antidote!

834
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,280
Please give me the antidote!

835
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,710
Let me go, let go!

836
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:35,530
Female Chung Ta, you said you would give me the antidote, and that is why I saved you!

837
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:37,880
You trusted her words?

838
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:41,000
I am sorry!

839
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,180
Let us hurry!

840
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,100
Chung Ta! Hey!

841
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,980
Yeon Wol.

842
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,400
Kyera.

849
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:35,450
Ak Hee, open your eyes. Are you dead?

850
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:40,340
I think it is time we make our stance clear.

851
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,500
I need the antidote for a tranquilizing dart.

852
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,620
Are you ready?

853
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,570
All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

854
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:49,580
Is it not actually an opportunity for me?

855
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,600
I will come over there, so you pull this out.

856
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:57,510
We must get rid of the haunted king taking up space in the chamber.

857
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,760
I will come.

858
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,700
I will come into your mind's space and pull out the blade.

859
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,330
Yeon Wol.
