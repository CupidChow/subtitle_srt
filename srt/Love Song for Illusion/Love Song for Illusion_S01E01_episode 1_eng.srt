11
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,610
   

12
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,580
F-Father!

13
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,110
Pathetic punk.

14
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,460
Father!

15
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,760
Close the door.

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,350
F-Father.

17
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,380
Close them!

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,300
What am I going to do with you?

19
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,240
Father,

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,370
they are...

21
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,950
not just drawings.

22
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,410
You are still making excuses with your words?

23
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,870
Beg for forgiveness.

24
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,940
Swear you will never do such a foolish thing again and beg.

25
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,160
Beg!

26
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,950
You will not beg?

27
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,480
You would rather die at your father's hands?

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,000
Fine. The only heir I have has

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,970
no interest in politics and strategies,

30
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,840
but wastes his time drawing people without heads.

31
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,300
Die! Just die!

32
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,050
If my heir is dead and gone, I would at least have a reason to make my bastard child the next heir.

33
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,400
Die! Just die!

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,950
Die!

35
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,430
You half-witted brat! Die! Die!

36
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,040
Die!

37
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,100
Die!

38
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,080
Charge!

39
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,120
   

40
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,800
   

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,040
General Yeon Poong Hak and his wife have returned!

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,080
Father!

43
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,780
- General Yeon Poong Hak toured the 37 states of Asatae 
  - Hurray! 

44
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,240
- and strengthened our borders... 
 - Father.

45
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,660
Mother!

46
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,460
Wol!

47
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,130
- Wol! 
  - Hurray! 

48
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,830
Have you been well, my Wol? Did you study a lot?

49
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,580
I trained in martial arts a lot.

50
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,520
Now I can...

51
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,200
even do these things.

52
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
You did not study again?

53
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,670
It is okay to neglect her studies a bit.

54
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,730
Let me take a look now.

55
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,980
You must have played hard to have become so strong.

56
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,180
Here. It is a present.

57
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,290
This is your cherished dagger, Father.

58
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,400
It belongs to you now.

59
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,170
It is a precious sword that proves you are a royal heir of Asatae.

60
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,270
Father!

61
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,700
All right!

62
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,360
Wol, become a brave general.

63
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,740
 Hurray! Hurray, General Yeon! 

64
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,830
 - Hurray!  
 - Hurray!

65
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,410
- Hurray! 
  - Hurray! 

66
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,780
- Hurray! 
  - Hurray! 

67
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,960
Hurray!

68
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,850
Father.

69
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,180
You will become a real man today.

70
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,170
Follow me.

71
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,510
Is Yeon Poong Hak home?

72
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,650
Minister Sajo Seung!

73
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,880
We are here to punish the rebels, Yeon Poong Hak and his household, for treason!

74
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,000
Open the doors.

75
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,750
What is this noise?

76
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,260
 General, something terrible has happened! 

77
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,100
Minister Sajo Seung's troops stormed in and are slaying all the servants they see.

78
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,600
Seung is? There is no way.

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,170
 Traitor Yeon Poong Hak, come out right now and receive the king's order! 

80
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,560
This man!

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,790
I have a bad feeling about this. Escape to safety for now!

82
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,740
It must be a misunderstanding.

83
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,950
But we never know, so you take Wol and escape first.

84
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,280
Seung! What is this commotion in the middle of the night?

85
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,390
What is all of this—

86
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,380
Bring the traitor Yeon Poong Hak to his knees right away!

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,150
Look here, Seung. Have you gone mad? How could you—

88
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,770
Shut your mouth!

89
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,970
How dare you. Who do you think I am...

90
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,210
I am now the new king of this country, Asatae.

91
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,900
Watch what you say!

92
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,230
His Majesty is still sitting on the throne.

93
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,200
How could you become the king of this country?

94
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,140
His Majesty has already passed away.

95
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,750
What?

96
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,170
No way. Did you commit treason?

97
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,760
Are you in the right mind right now?

98
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,840
Let go!

99
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,810
Sajo Seung!

100
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,870
Poong Hak.

101
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,650
For our old times' sake, when we were once childhood friends,

102
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,600
I will give you two options.

103
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,540
First, you can admit this situation right now

104
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,750
and vow your loyalty to Sajo Seung, who has become the new king of Asatae.

105
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,720
If you do, you will become the most prosperous man in Asatae.

106
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,290
Second, if you do not vow your loyalty to me,

107
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:56,050
I will have you, your wife, and only daughter, Wol,

108
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,130
beheaded right this moment.

109
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,070
What kind of nonsense are you spewing, Seung?

110
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,240
Let him be.

111
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,480
The end of the road for my old friend...

112
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,220
I will send him off in person.

113
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,990
Sajo Hyeon,

114
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,960
open your eyes wide and watch.

115
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,720
This is the king's path!

116
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,820
This is His Majesty's order.

117
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,960
You idiot.

118
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,030
I said I would end him myself.

119
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,580
- Father! 
 - Wol!

120
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,740
General!

121
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,990
Wol!

122
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,760
Wol...

123
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,910
Father!

124
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,000
Sajo Seung, you bastard!

125
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,790
Do you not fear the heavens?

126
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,150
What did you say?

127
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,210
I will not forget this moment!

128
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,380
I will pay you back without fail!

129
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,500
I will also take away everything you have!

130
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,210
What are you all doing?

131
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,550
Strike that little wench's neck!

132
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,040
Mother!

133
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,320
Wol, run away! Right now!

134
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,990
I do not want to.

135
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,010
How can I leave you here and go alone?

136
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,470
Wol, you are now this country's only royal descendant.

137
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,400
Please survive and plan for the future.

138
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,630
Mother...

139
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,260
Go.

140
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,640
Hurry...

141
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,580
Hurry up and go.

142
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,320
Mother!

143
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,800
Kill the girl wearing the yellow upper garment!

144
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,720
She is Asatae's only royal descendant!

145
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,980
Behead her as soon as you see her!

146
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,930
Unni, I am sorry.

147
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,570
Rest in peace.

148
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,810
- Did the child come this way? 
 - Yes, she did.

149
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,120
- Search! 
 - Yes.

150
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,560
I have an inkling...

151
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,470
F-Father!

152
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,580
I saw her!

153
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,900
The child.

154
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,970
Where is she?

155
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,960
Did you definitely see her?

156
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,120
It is that way!

157
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,820
Kill the girl as soon as you see her!

158
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,610
Sajo Hyeon, what did you learn today?

159
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,860
I am asking what you learned at this place.

160
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,590
You still learned nothing after seeing this gratifying moment?

161
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,120
Even after seeing the moment your father became the king of this country,

162
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,270
even after seeing the moment you became this country's crown prince,

163
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,070
did you really feel nothing at all?

164
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,170
What a weak bastard.

165
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,070
We found the girl's corpse!

166
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,720
Set the entire house on fire!

167
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,860
Burn down everything that belongs to the damned Royal Family of Yeon!

168
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,300
Tell them that I am here if you dare.

169
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,610
You will lose your neck before you can.

170
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,910
I am sorry.

171
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,130
I-I am sorry.

172
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,400
I need to get out.

173
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,230
Let us all congratulate His Majesty Sajo Seung's ascent to the throne!

174
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,630
Your Majesty, congratulations on your ascension to the throne!

175
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,860
 Congratulations on your ascension to the throne! 

176
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,610
His Majesty Sajo Seung, hurray!

177
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,550
 Hurray! 

178
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,840
All right! Let us have a toast!

179
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,520
- Hurray! 
  - Hurray! 

180
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,320
- Hurray! 
  - Hurray! 

181
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,820
 - Hurray! 
 - Hurray! 

182
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,210
 - Hurray! 
- Hurray! 

183
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,830
 - Hurray! 
 - Hurray! 

184
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,530
What are you?

185
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,080
You evil spirit!

186
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,700
G-Get away from me!

187
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,810
Go away! Go away!

188
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,930
Go away—

189
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,320
   

190
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,030
Don't go anywhere. Got it?

191
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,530
I chose only the most beautiful girls.

192
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,080
All right, we will meet again.

193
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,110
Yes, we will.

194
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,740
Baby, what is the rush?

195
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,280
On top of being a corrupt official, you became a chaehongsa, too? 
  (An official who selects beautiful women to provide to the king) 

196
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,760
You wench, I am carrying out the royal decree right now!

197
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,120
Royal decree? I know.

198
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,270
The royal decree to secretly kidnap pretty boys and beautiful women from all over the country

199
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,800
and providing them as an amusement troupe to the tyrant, Sajo Seung.

200
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,430
Where did you lock up the other children?

201
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,570
Where are they?

202
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,100
What the hell are you doing? Capture her!

203
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,180
What took you so long?

204
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,760
Sorry, they followed me so persistently.

205
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,650
Get them!

206
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,620
I barely used it, so why would it break?

207
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,310
- Hurry up! 
 - Let me see—

208
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,070
- Hey, hey! 
 - A thief!

209
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,100
This is terrible.

210
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,100
The so-called king spends every day drinking, partying, and debauching in sodomy and women.

211
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,560
So, the entire country is infested with human trafficking.

212
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,700
Corrupt officials who are busy flattering the king are getting rich

213
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,760
and the poor people starve out on the streets.

214
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,980
Have some of this.

215
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,040
The entire country is in shambles just 10 years after Sajo Seung took the throne.

216
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,730
My goodness, Kyera!

217
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,030
Gosh, why do they make their clothes like this?

218
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,160
It was hard to move my arms while fighting earlier, too.

219
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,740
Hey, see you later!

220
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,100
Kyera? Do not be late!

221
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,710
Hey, hey! Stand back now!

222
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,570
I just want to see the seamstress! Why do you keep saying I cannot?

223
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,480
The thing is, our seamstress is very shy.

224
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,440
She does not meet anyone!

225
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,010
I will take my business elsewhere, then.

226
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,020
Do as you please.

227
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,590
Goodness, you have arrived, Madam?

228
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,950
Come this way, please.

229
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,840
This place is good, though.

230
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,040
They are good with the dyes, too.

231
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,310
Madam, take a look at this.

232
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:54,460
It is so pretty in yellow, is it not?

233
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,070
You are not a woman seamstress but a man?

234
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,540
W-Who are you? Get lost! Now!

235
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,410
Ice cold.

236
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,320
Y-You...

237
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,510
Y-You are...

238
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,380
Gosh, was that too hard? What do I do?

239
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,600
- Wait— 
 - Stay put, or you will be paralyzed.

240
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,810
Does it still hurt?

241
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,740
Do not worry.

242
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,650
After a good night's sleep, you will be better tomorrow.

243
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,130
Do you have trouble sleeping usually?

244
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,590
How did you know?

245
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,340
Your body was ice cold.

246
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,540
It is all because your qi is not circulating.

247
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,610
Are you a physician?

248
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,590
Wait! A physician would not wear these clothes.

249
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,140
Can you not tell from my clothes?

250
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,050
- I dance beautifully— 
 - You are an assassin.

251
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,880
I am not.

252
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,810
You are an assassin disguised as a dancer.

253
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,620
I said I am not!

254
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,720
Unless you are an assassin, why would you treat my baby so roughly?

255
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,350
Your baby?

256
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,650
Is it a precious piece of work to you, just like having given birth to your own baby?

257
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,820
Look here, Mister. I made this request to the owner last time.

258
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,680
Please make your clothes sturdy and practical!

259
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,950
But they still rip apart like paper.

260
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,050
It rips and tears every time I move.

261
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,170
By the way, why do you keep skipping the honorifics?

262
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,080
It is obvious, is it not? Because I am your customer.

263
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:08,100
Which is why I personally drew a design myself.

264
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,740
My requests are written, so you only need to fulfill them.

265
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,980
And do not do anything artistic.

266
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,080
Also, sew up the tear in this one, too.

267
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,360
Now, then. I will be off.

268
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
You...

269
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,690
do not have the right to wear my clothes.

270
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,540
Go somewhere else.

271
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,120
In that case, give me my clothes back.

272
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,520
I will have it fixed elsewhere.

273
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,360
- I cannot do that. 
 - Why not?

274
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,200
Because it is my baby I made with my blood, sweat, and soul.

275
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,760
I bought these clothes with the money I made with my blood, sweat, and soul.

276
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,670
Alas, I said you cannot.

277
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,220
Well, then. Give me my money back.

278
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,900
Since I bought it for five nyang and 20 jeon, taking off the wear and tear, give me five nyang.

279
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,550
How impertinent!

280
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,960
You are being so shameless after ruining my work like this.

281
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,600
Just be thankful I am not asking for money back for my work, and

282
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,970
get out of here right now.

283
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,380
You are an eyesore.

284
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,500
Mister...

285
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,480
you do not have friends, right?

286
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,090
And you are not very close to your family.

287
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:18,120
I can tell since you lock yourself up here and work and lie that you are the seamstress.

288
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,070
Your family must be against you doing this.

289
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,030
Meaning you cannot even be proud of your work.

290
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,180
So?

291
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,890
Are you mocking me right now?

292
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:34,050
Are you also taking me for a joke because a man likes to sew and meddle with fabrics?

293
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,710
Is that what your family says?

294
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,430
That you are a joke for doing this work?

295
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,420
Who is it? Is it your father?

296
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,550
"What is a man doing what the girls—"

297
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,740
Shut your mouth!

298
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,170
Are men not allowed to do these things?

299
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,610
Whether it is a man or a woman, you only need to enjoy what you do.

300
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,420
How could he say such things just because he is the father?

301
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,990
Are you his property or something?

302
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,680
How can he say that just because he gave birth to you?

303
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,460
Say all these things to your father.

304
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,420
You probably cannot even utter a word in front of your father.

305
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,940
Gosh, you have such pretty hands.

306
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,990
I am sure your heart is even more pretty and fragile.

307
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,760
Mister, you cannot live like this.

308
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,270
You said this is your precious baby. Right?

309
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,690
What kind of parent is ashamed of taking care of his own baby?

310
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,630
Kyera, you are still here?

311
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,740
I will go now!

312
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,780
All right, do it by tomorrow, then. Take care.

313
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,450
Excuse me.

314
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,360
Look over here!

315
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,130
Kyera.

316
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,140
Is her name Kyera?

317
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,110
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

318
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,270
Crown Prince!

319
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,090
Crown Prince, why did you come so late?

320
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,490
I almost had a nervous breakdown.

321
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,040
Ji Jeon, you should have brought back Crown Prince quickly.

322
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,650
How can you be so slow of a bodyguard?

323
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,700
Eunuch Neung, what is the matter?

324
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,520
Everyone has gathered inside your pavilion right now.

325
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,960
Inside your pavilion.

326
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,680
Your Majesty, did you have a nice trip to the hot springs?

327
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,250
Of course, I did. And that is why I am sitting here.

328
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,340
Why?

329
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,370
Did you hope for me to become fried and boiled in the steamy hot springs?

330
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,980
Your Majesty...

331
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,630
It would have been nice to have you there as well, Crown Prince.

332
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,010
We missed you the whole time.

333
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,750
Where are you coming back from?

334
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,900
Have you been wasting your time again, carrying that headless drawing of yours?

335
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,540
I must be right since you cannot answer me.

336
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,300
What did I say? Stopping by this place would only make me angry.

337
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,060
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

338
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:29,840
I thought His Majesty would be even more happy after bathing in hot springs

339
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,870
and being in a great mood since Crown Prince became

340
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,810
more manly and broad-minded lately.

341
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,080
Your Highness Consort Cheong Myeong,

342
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,430
you know I look manly and strong one day but become half-witted the day after

343
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,130
because of my madness, so how can you say that?

344
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,510
Could it be you brought His Majesty, hoping I was in my insane state?

345
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,350
Shut your mouth!

346
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,350
Is having a madness something you should be proud of?

347
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,060
How pathetic.

348
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:04,830
Goodness, how did my heir and concubine's son switch up like this?

349
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,690
 You probably cannot even utter a word in front of your father. 

350
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,360
 Gosh, you have such pretty hands. 

351
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,140
 I am sure your heart is even more pretty and fragile. 

352
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,050
 Mister, you cannot live like this. 

353
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,600
Is doing what I like to do...

354
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,620
- What did you say? 
 - Crown Prince.

355
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,590
What did you say just now?

356
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,990
What did you mutter just now?

357
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,330
Your Majesty, I think I heard him say he will do better from now on.

358
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,790
The assembly.

359
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,330
Yes, I heard everyone has gathered.

360
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,030
Let us go.

361
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,370
Your Majesty, please allow  Crown Prince to attend the assembly as well.

362
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,810
- That is nonsense. 
 - Absurd!

363
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,960
Did you hear him, Crown Princess?

364
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,430
Crown Prince chooses not to attend the assembly.

365
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,000
He is a half-wit who has no interest in managing a nation.

366
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,910
Crown Prince, do not let it bother you too much.

367
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,830
Even though His Majesty speaks that way,

368
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,630
you know he has a deep affection for you.

369
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,310
We are going out to hunt tomorrow morning with His Majesty.

370
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,310
Please join us. Okay?

371
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,010
Brother.

372
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,960
Is that what you really think?

373
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,450
What do you mean?

374
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,630
That His Majesty has deep affections for me,

375
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,480
and not you.

376
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,840
Do you want to stop now?

377
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,340
I must rest.

378
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,970
Your Highness, please practice a bit more.

379
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,420
Tomorrow is the hunt, is it not?

380
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,630
Did you come because you are worried

381
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,330
I might get scolded by His Majesty again tomorrow?

382
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,350
You got embarrassed by His Majesty earlier, too.

383
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,270
How unfortunate you are.

384
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,560
I am fine getting embarrassed by His Majesty.

385
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,780
However, I hear Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's hunting skills are getting better by the day.

386
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,400
Do you agree with what His Majesty said?

387
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,090
That Brother Sajo Yoong and I should have been switched.

388
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,740
Why did you become my wife if you think so?

389
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,030
- Your Highness— 
 - Because I am the crown prince, His Majesty's heir?

390
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,080
You never know what will happen in life, so what will you do

391
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,320
if I lose my place to Brother Yoong

392
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,030
as everyone worries,

393
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,530
or rather, as everyone wishes?

394
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,130
It is not like you can switch your husband.

395
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,750
It does not matter to me, even if you switch your husband.

396
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,090
Do as you wish.

397
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,050
This is uncalled for.

398
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,700
Sometimes, you are so kind to me,

399
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,560
but right now, you are...

400
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,420
How am I so fickle?

401
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,740
It is just as you said.

402
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,950
This is all because of the madness I have, is it not?

403
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,630
However,

404
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,160
we cannot really say you have no blame

405
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,240
since you married me knowing I have a madness.

406
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,860
Did he get a new amusement troupe again?

407
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,620
I apologize, Your Highness.

408
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,530
Crown Prince, you said you would not sleep tonight, did you not?

409
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,360
I did.

410
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,280
But I am extremely tired.

411
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,860
I must sleep.

412
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,750
Could it be because of tomorrow's hunt?

413
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,990
In that case, do not participate in tomorrow's hunt and...

414
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,500
How can I be absent when I am wide awake?

415
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,180
It is His Majesty's order.

416
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,730
But that does not mean I will get humiliated again at the hunt.

417
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,360
I apologize, Your Highness.

418
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,310
I do not like hunting.

419
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,520
I dislike the stench of blood from slaughtering.

420
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,450
Though they are only beasts,

421
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,600
I do not wish to entertain myself using those with life.

422
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:37,100
In that case, what about your visit to the drapery tomorrow?

423
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,620
   

424
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,870
 Do not make the chest too revealing. 

425
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,560
 Make the inner skirt's width as wide as you can. 

426
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,470
 Allow the arms to move backward freely. 

427
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,770
What a taste.

428
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,840
 How did my heir and concubine's son switch up like this? 

429
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,400
What is the use of any of these?

430
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,760
Ji Jeon, did the Crown Prince go to sleep last night?

431
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,800
He was reading, at least until I was standing guard.

432
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,390
Soldiers who were standing guard from night to dawn

433
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,790
also said the light was on in his bedchamber the whole time.

434
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,640
How fortunate.

435
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,450
Ak Hee must be furious right now.

436
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:03,710
He can wake up only if our Crown Prince goes to sleep.

437
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,600
Crown Prince, it is Eunuch Neung.

438
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,560
Have you awakened, Your Highness?

439
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,620
Enter.

440
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,510
Your Highness, did you not get enough sleep?

441
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,540
You told me not to sleep, Eunuch Neung.

442
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,260
I apologize, Your Highness.

443
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,540
In that case, for today's hunt...

444
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,020
Not sure.

445
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:04,410
Your Majesty, I heard you went to sleep only after the break of dawn.

446
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,830
Are you feeling well?

447
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,100
Cannot be any better.

448
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,400
I am full of energy, perhaps because I received youthful energy all night.

449
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,710
Is there still no word from the Crown Prince's pavilion?

450
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,720
I apologize.

451
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,070
Looks like Crown Prince will be absent for the hunt.

452
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:31,870
After early morning, the deer will move away to another mountain.

453
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,290
Let us go.

454
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,660
Your Majesty, please give him some more time.

455
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,900
I heard Crown Prince has been practicing archery regularly so far.

456
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,490
No amount of practice will make him better. At an indoor archery ground at that.

457
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,360
Let us go!

458
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,620
 Let us go! 

459
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,770
Your Majesty!

460
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,410
Easy, easy.

461
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,310
How could you depart without me?

462
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,940
Let us go!

463
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,010
Great job, Sajo Hyeon.

464
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,710
Looks like Crown Prince practiced a lot.

465
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:49,620
Not at all. I think Crown Prince is being manic again.

466
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,500
I see how he is attending the hunt for the first time in a while.

467
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:59,040
It must be proof his madness is worsening, Grand Prince.

468
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,800
I just do not know how to fail.

469
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,020
Gosh, I am so sore.

470
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,040
So, Ji Jeon Seo.

471
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,310
Is there something on my face, huh?

472
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,990
Why do you keep staring at me?

473
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,770
It is nothing.

474
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:32,590
I was just happy to see His Majesty being happy today.

475
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,390
It was a good idea to keep practicing at the indoor archery grounds.

476
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,490
I mean, it is all thanks to you, Ji Jeon Seo.

477
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:44,050
You are my martial arts master, are you not?

478
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,370
I am undeserving of such praise.

479
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,400
Are you not tired?

480
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,290
You said you could not sleep last night.

481
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,290
Easy.

482
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,680
I could not sleep?

483
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,650
When did I say...

484
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,990
I could not sleep?

485
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,410
Huh?

486
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,670
Disappointed?

487
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:10,380
Gosh, if you are so noticeably disappointed, it makes Ak Hee sad.

488
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,080
Go on without me. I have a place to stop by.

489
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,970
I am off.

490
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:47,350
Twelve wins in a row for Dal Bong!

491
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,410
Next contestant!

492
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,730
We would not have one, right?

493
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:02,430
All right, then. Today's fights are over with this!

494
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,090
 Wait! 

495
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,310
 - Wait! 
 - Who was that? 

496
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,640
 - Who is it? 
 - Who was that? 

497
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,140
Gosh, is it over already? How lame.

498
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,500
A-Ak- A-Ak...

499
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,430
It is Ak Hee! Ak Hee is back!

500
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:31,520
- Ak Hee? 
 - Ak Hee?

501
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,650
- Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 
   - Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 

502
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,420
 Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 

503
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,710
 Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 

504
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,810
   

505
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,350
I heard...

506
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,150
you are on a roll these days.

507
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,890
I will teach you a lesson—

508
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,610
 Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 

509
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,090
How cute.

510
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,280
Want me to let you win?

511
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,050
 It is a woman. 

512
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,260
Dal Bong! Hey!

513
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:11,890
Dal Bong forfeited! 
    

514
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,420
Ak Hee won!

515
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,010
- Goodness! 
  - Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 

516
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,750
 Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 

517
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,970
 Ak Hee! Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 

518
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,960
Gosh, he just had to interfere at the end.

519
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,830
I will be late.

520
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,850
- There you go! 
 - My goodness!

521
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,530
W-What is it now?

522
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,470
Who the hell are you?

523
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,530
I will let you off on a special note. Get lost.

524
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,250
You are mad you lost the prize to me, are you not?

525
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,220
I just might give all of this to you.

526
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,770
Instead, show me your entire face.

527
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,960
Get lost.

528
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,450
Come on, I will give you all of this.

529
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:11,860
You pretended to be a man and participated in the fights because you needed money.

530
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,520
Being so petty and hiding your face.

531
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,810
Oh, petty? I was being petty, huh.

532
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,360
What about you? Are you not being petty?

533
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,080
Do you think I would not know you just because you wore something like this?

534
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,360
I forgive you because I am busy right now.

535
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,270
Hold on a moment.

536
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:43,400
How do you know me?

537
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,680
H-How could you know?

538
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:50,000
In that case, d-do you know who you are talking to right now—

539
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,850
Did you finish fixing my clothes?

540
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,840
Did you even finish your work to be slacking off like this?

541
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,370
What?

542
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,810
You are...

543
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,770
way better as the drapery mister.

544
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,320
Drapery? Sajo Hyeon!

545
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,720
I never looked into his memory because it was too much work.

546
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,330
W-Wait, wait. Hold on.

547
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,670
You saw me at the drapery? When?

548
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:22,310
Are we close to each other, then?

549
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:26,450
Whoa, you are acting like you lost your memory now?

550
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,270
You did not finish fixing my clothes, did you?

551
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,030
That is why you are feigning ignorance.

552
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:36,010
Are you serious? Do you really prefer the guy at the drapery over me?

553
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,820
Yes.

554
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,680
How come? Why?

555
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,640
 When I saw you at the drapery, 

556
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,910
 you had some kind of an aura. 

557
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,730
What about now?

558
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,270
Right now?

559
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:56,890
This thing.

560
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,870
And this thing does not fit.

561
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,260
You seem fake for some reason.

562
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,480
Go back to the drapery, Young Master.

563
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,990
That is where you belong.

564
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,840
F-Fake...

565
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,650
Fake?

566
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,420
F-Fake—

567
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,420
Hey— Where did she go? Dal Bong!

568
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,900
I have never seen anyone who prefers the half-wit Sajo Hyeon over me.

569
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:08,650
♫  Never lost, I will not lose you  ♫

570
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:15,440
♫  Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self  ♫

571
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:22,240
♫  Never lost, when this darkness ends  ♫

572
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,340
♫  Even if I am tired or hurt  ♫

573
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,240
♫  I have to protect you  ♫

574
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,580
 Take some crops! Come and get some! 

575
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,720
♫  When this darkness ends  ♫

576
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,870
Wind Knives, hurray!

577
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,050
 Hurray! 

578
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:45,760
♫  I have to protect you, never lost  ♫

579
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,420
♫  Never lost  ♫

580
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:55,730
♫  Have to protect you, never lost  ♫

581
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,440
I claimed this first.

582
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,460
I ordered it first.

583
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,760
You can check the order form.

584
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,460
How am I?

585
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,320
Why are you wearing the mask, especially only half?

586
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,340
Oh, to look different from the brat from the drapery.

587
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,280
I am different from him.

588
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,150
What do you say? I look more real now, right?

589
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,210
Not at all.

590
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,390
A fake is fake forever.

591
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:50,010
Apologize. I am really not a fake. Okay?

592
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,160
Why are you so mindful?

593
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,930
Mindful?

594
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,140
I am?

595
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:03,390
No matter what anyone says, just say you are real, and that is it. Why be so touchy about it...

596
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:07,920
For now, treat other people with sincerity.

597
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,460
Once you do, even the most fake life will start looking real.

598
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:18,350
Wait! Are you saying I am not sincere?

599
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,370
Hollow.

600
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,130
As expected, there is no sincerity.

601
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,650
It is completely empty.

602
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:34,630
Fill this up first, please.

603
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,460
Fill it up?

604
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,600
I will fill it up with you.

605
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:05,670
 You are mad you lost the prize to me, are you not? 

606
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:10,510
 How impertinent! You are being so shameless after ruining my work like this. 

607
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,450
 Apologize. I am really not a fake. Okay? 

608
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,170
Gosh, is he really Miser from the drapery?

609
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:21,480
He looks the same, but how could he be so different?

610
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,590
Your skills improved.

611
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,510
Sir!

612
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,220
Have you been well?

613
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,860
I knew you would come.

614
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,970
Really?

615
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,930
The revolution will be soon.

616
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:38,090
I knew you would come since you are Wind Knives' godfather.

617
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,720
Godfather?

618
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,910
You are no longer calling me your sponsor?

619
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,490
The sponsor sounds more affectionate to me.

620
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,370
That was when I was immature.

621
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,980
By the way, when will you tell me which family you are from?

622
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:58,300
It is mean of you to only tell us to call you "Sir."

623
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,700
Were you upset?

624
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,650
Yes, I was upset.

625
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,590
- Quite a lot. 
 - Really?

626
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:08,510
Once we succeed in the revolution, you will find out.

627
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,950
That is a promise. Okay?

628
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,900
I promise you.

629
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,330
You made it, Sir.

630
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:27,660
While Kyera dances at the banquet, Wind Knives will...

631
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,550
sneak in this way and wait for Kyera.

632
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,790
It is near the king's bedchamber.

633
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:55,020
 Here. It is a present. It belongs to you now. 

634
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,950
 Young Lady! 

635
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,850
 - I am going to go get my revenge, let go! 
 - Young Lady. 

636
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:04,160
 Father! 

637
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,350
 Mother! 

638
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:16,070
 Father and Mother, it is finally time. 

639
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:20,360
 I will avenge your deaths without fail 

640
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,440
 and bring Asatae's throne back to its rightful state. 

641
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,550
We congratulate Your Majesty's honorable birth once again.

642
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:45,060
Long live the king!

643
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,550
 Long live the king! 

644
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,260
Thank you!

645
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,770
Eat a lot and enjoy all you want!

646
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,980
 Thank you for your grace! 

647
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:07,790
Is Crown Prince absent again today?

648
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,710
He should be at the study.

649
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:12,150
- He will soon— 
 - Forget it.

650
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:19,090
Tell him I do not need to see his long face on a joyous day like today.

651
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:22,050
Do you not agree, Grand Prince Yoong?

652
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,340
You think he is surely Crown Prince. Right?

653
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,370
Ak Hee would be sleeping.

654
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:03,550
Right?

655
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:08,810
Yes, Crown Prince should at least attend His Majesty's birthday banquet.

656
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:51,420
 What if the king chooses another dancer? 

657
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,190
 Ha Rang! 

658
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,580
 Based on what I confirmed, Kyera is the most beautiful one 

659
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:00,540
 out of all the dancers who will be at the banquet. 

660
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,070
 Will you be able to do a good job? 

661
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,950
 Please do not worry, Sir. 

662
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,920
 I have been waiting for this day. 

663
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,170
 Kyera has been trained as an assassin for a long time. 

664
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:21,460
 She is the most excellent member of Wind Knives, too. 

665
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:25,590
 - Most of all... 
 - She hates and resents His Majesty more than anyone else. 

666
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,530
 And that is her strongest weapon. 

667
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:31,330
 Grand Prince, for Kyera to succeed... 

668
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:34,670
 It means His Majesty will pass away. 

669
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,030
 That is our goal, is it not? 

670
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:44,560
 - However, he is your... 
 - He is my father. 

671
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,780
 It cannot be helped. 

672
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,680
 This is the way to bring the throne to its rightful state 

673
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,540
 and save the people who are suffering under a tyrant. 

674
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,620
 I am prepared to lose my filial morality. 

675
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,640
Long live the king!

676
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,790
Please wait a moment.

677
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,930
Sajo Seung, I have been waiting for this day.

678
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:20,130
I will take your life today according to the heavens' order!

679
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,070
You are...

680
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:46,070
You are not fit to be an assassin.

681
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:50,000
Your scent is too strong.

682
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:15,720
Have you awakened?

683
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,870
Are you okay?

684
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,840
Who are you?

685
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,800
Oh, I am called Hong Goon.

686
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,800
Hong Goon...

687
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,830
Where is this place?

688
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:37,530
Where else? It is Her Highness Consort Hyo's bedchamber.

689
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,600
I see. Sorry for the trouble.

690
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,570
Your Highness, please remain in bed.

691
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:47,660
You have been sleeping for four days and nights.

692
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:51,660
You will feel nauseous if you suddenly start moving like this.

693
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,280
I am Her Highness?

694
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,200
Yes, you are Her Highness Consort Hyo.

695
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,600
Of course, you have to go through your official investiture ceremony to become the concubine.

696
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,170
Consort Hyo...

697
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,920
I am a concubine?

698
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,110
Who— Concubine? The king's?

699
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,620
Yes.

700
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,090
You are Crown Prince's concubine.

701
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,990
- Who is Crown Prince? 
 - Sorry?

702
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:18,070
Your Highness, could it be...

703
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:21,020
you do not remember?

704
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:25,090
 I probably should not say I do not remember anything. 

705
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:26,960
T-The thing is...

706
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:30,520
 Crown Prince has arrived. 

707
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,910
Crown Prince is here.

708
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,510
You can stay put.

709
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:56,510
You are awake, Consort Hyo.

710
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:00,280
 I am this man's concubine? 

711
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:13,010
You have finally become my woman.

712
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,680
I missed you.

713
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,610
 Whoa! Where is this? 

714
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,840
 Who am I? 

715
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,390
Who are you?

716
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,010
Me?

717
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,740
I am your man.

718
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,220
 Hurry up and escape. 

719
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:38,490
 I want to take the dancer you chose tonight, Your Majesty. 

720
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,680
 You will realize I am real. 

721
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,190
 You will end up liking me. 

722
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,730
 Who is this man? 

723
01:07:55,020 --> 01:08:02,000

01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,800
♫  Never lost, I will never lose you  ♫

725
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:16,710
♫  Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self  ♫

726
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:23,160
♫  Never lost, when this darkness ends  ♫

727
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:28,280
   

728
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,300
 Do we really know each other? 

729
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,430
 We are very close. 

730
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:34,880
 Who are you? 

731
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,540
 That is what I want to know, too. 

732
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,850
 You are married. Why on Earth would I— 

733
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:40,640
 Why are you so talkative? 

734
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,890
 Something feels off. 

735
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:44,430
 Why am I so good at fighting? 

736
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:48,510
 I am asking why you did such a thing, fooling me and the Inner Court. 

737
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:53,370
 You are trying to get me in the end, using my woman. 

738
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:56,520
 Who is behind you? What is your identity? 

739
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,780
 - I will use you and get the better of Ak Hee.  
  - Sajo Hyeon!
