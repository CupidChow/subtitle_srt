How could you...

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,830
How could you!

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,990
I did not do it.

13
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,620
That is not the long needle I use.

14
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,980
It was someone else's doing.

15
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,370
Close the doors.

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,730
Do not let anyone besides the physician enter!

17
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,270
Yes!

His Majesty has passed away!

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,980

Open the doors.

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,630
The Crown Prince said not to let anyone enter-

27
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,920
Your Majesty!

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,340
Crown Princess.

29
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,360
Did His Majesty pass away?

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,810
Wait outside for one moment-

31
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,490
Is that long needle his cause of death?

32
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,910
It seems so.

33
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,170
That long needle is...

34
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,910
Search Consort Hyo's body!

35
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,070
Consort Hyo is still a concubine.

36
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,820
She should be interrogated according to the rules of Inner Court-

37
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,500
Your Highness, we must find the evidence before the guilty gets rid of it.

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,050
Here and now.

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,730
What are you all doing?

40
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,190
Confirm it.

41
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,590
They seem to be from the same set of needles.

42
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,100
How dare this wench...

43
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,290
Lock up this wench right away.

44
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,500
Yes!

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,050
Your Highness, it is not true.

46
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,650
Hold on.

47
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,120
Your Highness, this matter should not get leaked outside of the chamber.

48
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,970
Those who are waiting to prey on your weakness will not stay quiet.

49
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,770
We cannot jump to conclusions as to why His Majesty passed away yet.

50
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,760
Until his cause of death becomes clear, you all must not speak of this matter.

51
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,140
Do you understand?

52
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,830
Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,910
Lock up the guilty in the secret prison.

54
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,440
Do it in secret.

55
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,830
Yes!

56
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,180
Crown Princess, what is going on?

57
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,910
His Majesty passed-

58
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,760
It is not true, right, Crown Princess?

59
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,830
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

60
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,140
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

61
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,420
Aigoo, Yoong, why did you have to go hunt at a time like this?

62
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,570
Grand Prince went on a hunt?

63
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,330
When did he leave?

64
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,460
He left early yesterday morning.

65
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,070
You are the oldest son! Aigoo, Yoong...

66
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,900
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

67
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,600
- Aigoo, Your Majesty!
- The king is dead!

68
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,310
The king is dead!

69
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,200
Our prayers finally reached the heavens!

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,850
They said Sajo Seung suddenly died!

71
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,260
The king is dead!

72
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,610
The king is dead?

73
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,250
The damned king is dead!

74
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,160
He was punished by the heavens!

75
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,450
Did Kyera succeed in assassinating him?

76
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,880
The thing is, they said he died suddenly. Not murdered.

77
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,510
His over drinking and indulgent lifestyle are still thought to be the cause.

78
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,920
The heaven punished him!

79
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,320
I am sure that is the rumor the palace spread

80
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,680
so the people are not agitated.

81
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,880
I must find out what situation Kyera is in.

82
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,860
The king is dead!

83
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,520
Crown Prince, I am sorry to tell you this,

84
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,370
but the washing and shrouding ritual must take place promptly.

85
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,570
Who do you work for?

86
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,930
I would like a moment alone with His Majesty.

87
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,250
Yes.

88
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,160
You, too, Crown Princess.

89
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,130
I would like to atone for being a bad son.

90
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,890
Would you please understand?

91
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,920
Please go ahead.

92
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,920
Half-wit...

93
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,100
Just like you,

94
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,490
I am also ashamed of you.

95
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,370
Set the entire house on fire!

96
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,500
Burn down everything that belongs to the damned Royal Family of Yeon!

97
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,070
Is it karma, Father?

98
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,580
Investigate His Majesty's cause of death thoroughly.

99
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,600
Yes, Your Highness.

100
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,710
Young physicians stopped by?

101
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,620
Yes, they are physicians His Highness kept close by his side.

102
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,220
He kept close by his side?

103
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,180
Do not miss a thing about the situation in the chamber and report to me.

104
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,810
Yes, Your Highness.

105
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,480
I am sorry.

106
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,770
The young girl who was there.

107
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,550
I am sure she died.

108
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,590
I could not save her.

109
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,140
Her eyes are still vivid in my mind.

110
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,190
That is why I was punished by the heavens.

111
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,390
That is why an evil spirit possessed me.

112
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,180
I am sorry, Father.

113
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,780
Please have me punished by the heavens.

114
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,510
Who could have killed the king?

115
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,690
Wind Knife?

116
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,390
No.

117
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,670
It is obvious that I would be framed for sure. So, why at that hour?

118
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,230
Sajo Yoong?

119
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,350
How could he kill his own father?

120
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,860
Do you still deny your crime?

121
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,230
I am not denying it.

122
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,400
Because I did not do that.

123
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,690
After your memories came back,

124
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,340
how did you feel looking at me?

125
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,010
You must have thought I got what I deserved.

126
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,990
A crown prince who is called Half-wit

127
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,190
by his father because of his madness.

128
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,440
I am sure you kept quiet about getting your memories back

129
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
and belittled me all you want.

130
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,320
I did not belittle you.

131
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,340
I only resented you.

132
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,540
Because you erased my memories.

133
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,880
I am not the one who erased your memories.

134
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,180
It was Ak Hee's doing.

135
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,710
Ak Hee twisted everything.

136
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,710
The one who twisted everything in the first place is His Majesty Sajo Seung.

137
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,690
That is why you murdered...

138
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,740
His Majesty, my father.

139
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,450
I could not bring myself to do it.

140
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,490
Because of you.

141
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,170
It will be very hard on you from now on.

142
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,990
You might die, or rather

143
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,050
you will end up dying.

144
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,890
But I cannot stop it from happening.

145
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,430
I do not fear dying.

146
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,990
I am only sad you are mistaken about me.

147
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,070
However,

148
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,900
why would that matter?

149
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,470
It is true...

150
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,890
I did come here to have His Majesty end up that way.

151
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,940
We just...

152
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,250
should not have met in the first place.

153
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,760
I had...

154
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,320
let you have my heart, though only for a moment.

155
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,660
I cannot forgive you.

156
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,770
Your Highness.

157
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,250
Please be careful.

158
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,430
You must be wary of your surroundings at all times.

159
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,250
My surroundings?

160
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
I was betrayed by the one who was closest to me.

161
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,250
Who would I need to be wary of?

162
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,380
W-What is the matter?

163
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,850
Take her out of here!

164
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,210
What is the matter?

165
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,470
Lock up all these wenches!

166
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,020
Yes!

167
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,540
Chief.

168
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,670
Do you really wish to lose your neck?

169
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,570
Hurry up and confess the truth!

170
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,990
I have told you many times now.

171
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,800
I did not kill His Majesty.

172
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,860
You are saying the same thing again!

173
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,660
Do you still claim innocence when your long needle was found as the weapon of murder?

174
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,470
I have already told you about that many times, too.

175
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,250
That long needle is not mine.

176
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,910
How dare you!

177
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,030
Does that mean...

178
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,650
you had no interest at all in murdering His Majesty?

179
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,430
What is this?

180
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,960
Why was this found in your chamber?

181
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,610
This is the short knife that represents one being a direct descendant of the Royal Family of Yeon.

182
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:13,450
Do you think I do not know you are Yeon Wol, the daughter of Yeon Poong Hak,

183
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,760
who was executed 10 years ago for treason?

184
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,310
You came into the palace by seducing the Crown Prince,

185
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,150
in order to murder His Majesty.

186
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,180
Who is behind you?

187
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,550
Whose order was it?

188
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,190
I did not take

189
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,460
any orders from anyone.

190
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,490
You wretched wench.

191
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,030
Bring me that girl.

192
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,570
Hong Gun!

193
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,830
Your Highness!

194
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,120
This girl is innocent. She does not know anything!

195
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,950
Let her go free.

196
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,840
Who is the one who colluded with this woman?

197
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,940
Who secretly frequented Consort Hyo's pavilion?

198
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,610
No such thing happened.

199
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,330
No one frequented the pavilion!

200
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,150
Beat them harder until they speak the truth!

201
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,850
- Yes!
- Y-Your Highness!

202
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,980
Y-Your Highness, Your Highness!

203
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,170
It cannot be helped.

204
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,500
I cannot help you.

205
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,640
It must hurt.

206
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,430
It must be extremely painful.

207
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,900
I did not do it.

208
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,980
Did you find out the cause of death?

209
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,010
He did pass away from the poisoned needle.

210
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,110
Just kill me instead! Just kill me!

211
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,760
Do it harder.

212
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,400
Harder!

213
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,440
Harder!

214
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,200
Kyera!

215
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,760
I cannot leave her like that.

216
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,350
I cannot leave Consort Hyo like that.

217
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,380
Sajo Hyun!

218
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,590
Sajo Hyun, do you hear me?

219
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,900
Sajo Hyun!

220
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,660
Sajo Hyun!

221
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,540
Ak Hee?

222
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,230
Sajo Hyun, are you happy to have me this way from bonghamsal?

223
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,270
Are you happy you made Kyera end up like that?

224
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,430
Why did you call for me?

225
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,200
How are you still alive?

226
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,040
Kyera!

227
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,520
Ak Hee, how could you still be...

228
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,570
Why did you not disappear?

229
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,750
Because Kyera is in pain.

230
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,460
I cannot disappear because Kyera is having a hard time.

231
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,220
I cannot go away when Kyera is in that state!

232
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,980
Sajo Hyun, please save Kyera.

233
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,820
You know Kyera was not the one who did it.

234
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,240
We have evidence Consort Hyo murdered His Majesty.

235
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,120
Damn the evidence.

236
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,620
Do you believe it?

237
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,440
You also think Kyera did not do it!

238
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,630
I do not trust the woman who betrayed me.

239
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,250
What is your problem? You do trust Kyera!

240
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,130
I do not trust her.

241
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,290
Be gone, Ak Hee.

242
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,830
H-Hold on, hold on!

243
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,130
Then, release me, please.

244
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,990
Release me from bonghamsal.

245
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,190
I can save Kyera.

246
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,790
I know you want to save Kyera, too.

247
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,900
I know you are in pain, too!

248
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,430
I know you cannot do it because of your damn reputation.

249
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,380
I have a great plan.

250
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,400
So please release me.

251
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,470
I cannot do that.

252
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,110
I cannot forgive you either for bringing Consort Hyo into the palace when you knew who she was.

253
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,310
Be gone, Ak Hee.

254
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,010
Ak Hee!

255
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,980
Hold on, hold on!

256
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,760
I know who murdered His Majesty.

257
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,730
Who is it?

258
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,150
Who is the one who murdered His Majesty?

259
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,230
You want to know, right?

260
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,050
Then, release me from here first.

261
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,880
Do not even try to fool me, Ak Hee.

262
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,070
Hong Gun.

263
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,800
Hong Gun.

264
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,470
They should not remember they fell asleep.

265
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,620
I mixed it with bleeding-heart flowers.

266
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,120
Looks like bleeding-heart flowers are in the market again.

267
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,570
Let us go. Wind Knife is waiting for us outside.

268
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,480
I am not going.

269
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,800
- Will you die like this?
- Master Yang.

270
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,670
I did not kill Sajo Seung.

271
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,340
Then, who did it?

272
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,220
Let us leave first.

273
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,610
Right now is not the time. Please go back.

274
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,250
You think I will leave you to die like this?

275
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,590
Listen to me, Yang Jae Yi.

276
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,950
This is an order from the royal descendant of Yeon.

277
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,410
Please do not worry about me, and keep an eye on Sajo Yoong.

278
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,980
I find Sajo Yoong suspicious.

279
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,010
I am keeping a close watch,

280
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,810
Lady Yeon Wol.

281
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,920
Please stay strong.

282
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,210
- Aigoo!
- Your Majesty!

283
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,540
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

284
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,910
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

285
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,020
Aigoo, Your Majesty.

286
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,590
W-What is going on here?

287
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,630
What on Earth has...

288
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,320
Your Majesty!

289
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,190
Father!

290
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:43,220
Please let the heavens punish me for being a terrible son, Your Majesty!

291
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,230
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

292
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,610
Aigoo, Your Majesty-

293
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,350
Who did it?

294
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,410
Who was the one who...

295
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,280
Who was it?

296
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,330
It was not that someone harmed him. He just suddenly...

297
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,420
There is no way.

298
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:12,000
There is no way His Majesty would suddenly end up like this when he was in good health.

299
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,820
Your Majesty!

300
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,770
Father!

301
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,570
Your Majesty!

302
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,970
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

303
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,820
- Your Majesty!
- Aigoo, Your Majesty!

304
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,970
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

305
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,560
I did all kinds of things to gain your recognition.

306
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,080
I crawled like a dog.

307
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,450
But what? I am only a catalyst to provoke your son?

308
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,910
Let me show you the consequences of using and mocking me.

309
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,860
Go to hell, Sajo Seung.

310
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,140
I will take your place.

311
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,200
Sajo Hyun, it is your turn.

312
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,130
Hyungnim, what is the matter?

313
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,610
Sajo Hyun, you are taking your own life tonight.

314
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,090
The Crown Prince hung himself out of severe sadness, blaming himself for failing to save His Majesty.

315
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,400
blaming himself for failing to save His Majesty.

316
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,800
A half-wit who succumbed to his madness in the end and escaped from this world for eternity.

317
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,110
Farewell, Sajo Hyun.

318
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,900
Gosh, what is the matter, Hyungnim?

319
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:19,090
Why are you lashing out your anger at me for being sad about His Majesty's death?

320
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,750
Huh?

321
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,550
What is the matter with you?

322
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,910
People would say you are trying to kill me to take the throne if they saw us!

323
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,240
But I know that is not the case.

324
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,580
You are only resenting your brother for being a bad son.

325
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,640
Because you are a good son.

326
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,840
I have no interest in becoming the king.

327
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,450
Someone like you would qualify.

328
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:58,170
Hyungnim, calm down for now and

329
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,200
please help me out.

330
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,300
What do you need?

331
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,160
The guilty was ordered to be transferred.

332
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,080
Where am I going?

333
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,270
Was it the Crown Prince's order?

334
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,830
Your Highness?

335
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,160
Your Highness!

336
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,860
Where are you taking Her Highness?

337
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,920
Hong Gun.

338
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,800
Your Highness, no matter what the world says and points fingers at you, I believe you!

339
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,890
I know you would never do such a thing!

340
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,250
Your Highness!

341
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,340
Where am I going? Which prison is it?

342
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,560
Lower your voice.

343
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,960
You will be executed soon.

344
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,320
Your Highness, Consort Hyo is being transferred in secret.

345
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,470
They are transferring Consort Hyo in secret?

346
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,720
Is it the prison at Castle Sewoon?

347
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,750
Since they are headed to the north of the palace, it seems they are headed to the execution grounds.

348
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,480
The execution grounds?

349
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,560
Crown Princess, what brings you here at this late hour?

350
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,280
Grand Prince, what is the meaning of this?

351
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,780
Where did you send Consort Hyo?

352
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:55,610
The Crown Prince had ordered the execution of the guilty tonight.

353
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,860
The Crown Prince did?

354
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,690
Did he find clear evidence to prove Consort Hyo's crime?

355
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,770
The evidence is not the issue.

356
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,840
The coronation will soon take place.

357
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:13,430
It would be beneficial for everyone to get rid of any problems as soon as possible.

358
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:18,060
Did His Highness really order this?

359
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,970
To you, of all people?

360
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,000
To me, Sajo Yoong, of all people.

361
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,850
I must meet the Crown Prince.

362
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,410
The Crown Prince has gone to bed.

363
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:42,470
His body and mind were extremely fatigued due to His Majesty's sudden death.

364
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,290
Your Highness Crown Princess!

365
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,290
The Crown Prince had ordered not to let anyone enter.

366
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,730
It seems he finally got to fall asleep just now.

367
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,600
What are you trying to do?

368
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,750
What are you thinking?

369
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,580
Father, Mother.

370
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,970
I am coming to meet you two soon.

371
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,650
Who are you?

372
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,670
Wind Knife?

373
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,090
Are you a new recruit?

374
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,310
Where is Master Yang?

375
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,090
You are not Wind Knife, huh?

376
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,990
Your Highness?

377
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,260
Did you leave evidence Wind Knife was there?

378
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,060
Yes, Grand Prince. The rest are pursuing the guilty.

379
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,740
Who is the one who took Consort Hyo?

380
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,040
Was he from Wind Knife?

381
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,600
His attire was different.

382
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,510
He was wearing half of a mask.

383
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,190
A mask?

384
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,080
Hyungnim, calm down first and

385
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,440
please help me out.

386
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,770
With what?

387
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,350
Tell them I ordered the execution of Consort Hyo and

388
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,620
take her to the execution grounds behind the palace.

389
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,700
Someone will come to rescue Consort Hyo there.

390
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,110
The soldiers will not sit still.

391
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,650
You have to help me with taking down the soldiers.

392
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,600
Make sure to catch the guilty.

393
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,750
As soon as you do, check the identity of the one who took her and kill him.

394
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,630
And as for Consort Hyo...

395
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,720
Gosh, I really have no interest in the throne!

396
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:33,030
I dream of living happily with Consort Hyo in a faraway place. That is my dream.

397
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,540
As for Consort Hyo,

398
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,470
bring her alive.

399
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,750
Yes.

400
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,340
Also,

401
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
I really usually do not take this out.

402
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,780
It is something I really cherish.

403
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,580
Who knows? I might give this to you.

404
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:59,190
The one who takes this becomes the king of this country, right?

405
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,820
Hyungnim,

406
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,740
as long as you help me.

407
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,000
Sajo Hyun, you are a fool.

408
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,230
The Crown Prince is still in his chamber, right?

409
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,880
Yes, Grand Prince.

410
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,040
Why does it hurt whenever I touch Kyera?

411
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,610
Hang in there a moment.

412
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,280
What do I do?

413
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
It was my fault.

414
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,040
I am sorry.

415
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,690
Kyera!

416
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,600
N-No, you need to stay down.

417
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,150
Where is this place?

418
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,370
Huh? Oh, this place.

419
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,790
This is a cabin in the mountains.

420
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,030
You stayed up all night?

421
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,560
How fortunate. Your fever went down a lot.

422
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:38,010
- Your Highness?
- I am Ak Hee, not Sajo Hyun.

423
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,540
The real one, not the fake.

424
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,560
You are really not Crown Prince, huh?

425
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,440
No. Glad to see me, right?

426
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,620
It hurts a lot, right?

427
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,410
I did do first aid,

428
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,440
but I did not know how to use these herbs.

429
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,360
I brought them from the palace.

430
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,780
I can make a healing salve with that.

431
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,730
Help me get up, please.

432
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,080
Okay.

433
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,560
Are you injured?

434
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,980
H-Huh? N-No, I am not.

435
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,270
O-Oh, right.

436
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,420
A change of clothes.

437
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,260
Right here.

438
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,820
You lost her?

439
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,280
They said he disappeared suddenly in front of their eyes.

440
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,650
Disappeared suddenly?

441
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,570
You idiots. All of you could not handle one man?

442
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,610
I am sorry, Grand Prince.

443
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,060
I will make sure to find him and kill him.

444
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,080
Is the Crown Prince still in his chamber?

445
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,120
It seems so as tables of food and drinks were taken in and out all night.

446
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,710
I have no interest in becoming the king.

447
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,570
Someone like you would qualify.

448
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,850
Please help me out.

449
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,960
Crown Prince...

450
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,700
what are you thinking?

451
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,100
Huh?

452
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,660
Give it to me here.

453
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,250
He said not to let anyone enter.

454
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,340
Your Highness, I am bringing your food and drinks.

455
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:14,630
Crown Prince, how can you drink so much? Aigoo!

456
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,740
I am so nervous. It is killing me.

457
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:31,320
Your Highness, please stop drinking!

458
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,150
Oh, by the way,

459
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,780
I did not lift your clothes above your knees earlier, either.

460
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,150
B-Because...

461
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,270
I mean, the thing is-

462
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:22,290
No, only the urgent wounds were taken care of...

463
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,270
It is fine now.

464
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,720
Oh, okay. Can I turn around now?

465
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,020
Yes.

466
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,150
It must hurt more since you put the medicine on.

467
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,920
I will be fine in a bit.

468
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,830
You are hungry, right? I will make some porridge.

469
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,110
By the way,

470
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:58,340
if you change into the other personality like this...

471
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,840
Ak Hee.

472
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,810
I would like you to call me Ak Hee, not Crown Prince.

473
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,800
How can I call you that?

474
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,070
So what?

475
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:11,550
You already know I share this body with Sajo Hyun.

476
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:17,500
Sajo Hyun might enjoy acting arrogant and prefer being put on a pedestal by others.

477
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,260
But not me. Because I am the real one.

478
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,580
Were you going to ask me something?

479
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:40,040
After he is switched as you, Ak Hee, where is that Crown Prince?

480
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,450
Are you worried about Sajo Hyun?

481
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:47,710
Who knows? I am sure he is scrunched up somewhere.

482
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,100
You did not look for me like this, did you?

483
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,550
Sajo Hyun locked me up tight with bonghamsal, and I was so cold and hungry-

484
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,750
Right.

485
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,610
The evil spirit is no more.

486
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,440
A shaman called Chung Ta sealed him away.

487
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,860
What now? What is it?

488
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,730
I heard it, too. Ak-

489
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,960
He said a shaman called Chung Ta sealed you away.

490
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,320
How did you get back out?

491
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,800
See?

492
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,800
You remember I was sealed only now!

493
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,300
- You did not worry about me at all and only now...
- I did...

494
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,900
worry about you.

495
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,270
I see.

496
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,190
So, I got scared, too.

497
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,160
Chung Ta that traitor used bonghamsal on me,

498
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,900
after which my entire body was starting to freeze.

499
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,690
But hearing the sound of you being tortured was driving me nuts.

500
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,230
You can hear my voice?

501
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,550
Yes. It felt like I had ants all over my body, and I was losing my mind.

502
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:01,400
Sajo Hyun!

503
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,290
- Ak Hee?
- And...

504
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,180
I broke through and came out.

505
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,170
Amazing, right?

506
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,360
You are hungry, huh?

507
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,590
Wait...

508
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,670
It is so cold.

509
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,120
I wonder if Ak Hee is doing his job right.

510
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,860
Remember the ornament used for bonghamsal?

511
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:43,030
Find it and burn it. That is how you undo bonghamsal.

512
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,690
I will listen to you and stop causing trouble.

513
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,390
So let us save Kyera first, okay?

514
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,670
I cannot trust you.

515
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,730
What about Kyera, then?

516
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,140
Just let her die like this when she did nothing wrong?

517
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,010
Is that what you want?

518
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,050
That woman brought it upon herself.

519
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,980
It is not my business.

520
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,260
I said Kyera will die!

521
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,840
Save Kyera first and decide whether you will kill me or not.

522
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,160
It was so hard to meet Kyera, my love, again.

523
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,580
Kyera and I were so close and in love!

524
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,730
Consort Hyo liked you as well?

525
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,400
Did she consider you her lover?

526
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,670
Of course.

527
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,430
Consort Hyo had feelings for Ak Hee?

528
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:42,990
Why am I trying to save a woman like her?

529
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,790
Gosh, I said I will feed you.

530
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,500
It is okay.

531
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,630
Right.

532
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,500
I-I was worried you would burn your mouth.

533
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,710
S-So, how is it?

534
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,080
Not good?

535
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,220
It is good.

536
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,750
It tastes good?

537
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,490
You need to go back to the palace now.

538
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,920
They must be mourning for His Majesty.

539
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:56,070
How could I be absent as I am in the Crown Prince's body?

540
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,670
And since I also disappeared, the entire palace is probably...

541
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:03,160
I took the measures so that would not happen.

542
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,100
Also, you are not even guilty.

543
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,490
Do you believe I did not do it?

544
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,130
Of course, I believe you.

545
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,560
I told you I am not Sajo Hyun.

546
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,890
I cannot forgive you.

547
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,650
You have to watch out for Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

548
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:31,620
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is building a secret army.

549
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,870
You also know he is totally a sly serpent.

550
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:41,170
But he still cannot handle Ak Hee.

551
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,770
Consort Hyo murdered His Majesty?

552
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,430
I think that is the case.

553
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,850
And those Wind Knife bastards took Consort Hyo?

554
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,260
I found it odd the Crown Prince suddenly ordered the execution of Consort Hyo.

555
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:04,480
I presume he must have colluded with them.

556
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,190
How can the Crown Prince collude with rebels?

557
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,510
I am sincerely concerned.

558
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:18,610
The Crown Prince lost his mind because of a woman when he is to take the throne soon.

559
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,670
What will be the fate of Asatae from now on?

560
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,920
I am telling only you because I was too concerned, Minister of Finance.

561
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,210
So, please keep quiet about this.

562
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,580
Yes, Grand Prince.

563
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,640
It looks like Consort Hyo murdered His Majesty.

564
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,620
Come on, that is nonsense.

565
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,640
That is why Wind Knife rescued Consort Hyo.

566
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,000
Now, now. Watch what you say.

567
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,350
- I am saying Crown Prince-
- My goodness.

568
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,600
Aigoo, what a headache!

569
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,290
Crown Princess, you have come again.

570
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,570
How is the Crown Prince doing?

571
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:28,570
I apologize. He still wants to rest alone-

572
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,870
I know he is not in there.

573
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,660
Where is he?

574
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,180
I apologize, but I do not know, either.

575
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:40,560
How wicked. There is no way you would not know when you are his closest aide.

576
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,360
His Majesty's funeral will begin soon. What is he going to do?

577
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,930
Where is it? Is it the drapery in the marketplace?

578
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:49,920
Your Highness, this humble one really does not know!

579
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,060
Do you really wish to be beaten before speaking?

580
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,800
Your Highness.

581
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,890
Your pretty wrist will get hurt, Crown Princess.

582
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:08,890
Your Highness, what are you going to do?

583
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,500
People are saying you released Consort Hyo secretly

584
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,570
and helping a group of people plotting rebellion.

585
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,930
Crown Princess, do you have no faith in me?

586
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:20,070
Although I suffer from madness,

587
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,930
would I really help a group of rebels?

588
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,790
In that case, what about Consort Hyo?

589
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,450
I sent Consort Hyo into exile for now.

590
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:35,740
The physicians who analyzed His Majesty's dead body proved Consort Hyo to be innocent,

591
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,560
so it is clear she is not guilty, but you never know.

592
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,760
It was not Consort Hyo's doing?

593
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,480
Are you certain?

594
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,840
Yes, I heard from the physicians who analyzed His Majesty's dead body.

595
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:55,430
Of course, they told the Crown Prince it was Consort Hyo's doing.

596
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:57,180
Did the physicians really say it was not-

597
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,290
Since Consort Hyo is gone,

598
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,190
it is good news for you, is it not, Crown Princess?

599
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:05,720
Your Highness, you know your sudden decisions like these

600
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,320
are the best weak spots for Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

601
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,940
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong dares to take your place, Your Highness.

602
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,420
He is trying to become the king.

603
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:21,450
Oh, that is why you are anxious right now.

604
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,630
Because you might not become the queen because of Grand Prince Yoong.

605
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,780
- Your Highness.
- All right.

606
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,460
Let all your worries rest for now and

607
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,540
take a deep breath.

608
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,780
Let us get done with the funeral first, okay?

609
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,910
Your Highness,

610
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,690
I am going to become the queen, no matter what.

611
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:50,880
I will not let anyone stand in my way and stop me.

612
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,300
Crown Princess, you are really...

613
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,350
Just wait and see, Your Majesty.

614
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:36,530
See whose country Asatae becomes.

615
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:45,210
Father.

616
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,220
Father.

617
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,220
Your Majesty, I will escort you.

618
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,430
Officer Ji, stay here and protect the Crown Princess.

619
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,670
The Crown Princess is severely anxious,

620
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:33,670
so would it not help if you were by her side?

621
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,300
- Eunuch Neung!
- Yes, Your Highness.

622
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,270
Do you happen to know Chung Ta's whereabouts?

623
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:45,020
It seems she has relocated again.

624
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,620
Is that so?

625
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,830
I do not know, either.

626
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:52,100
By the way, why are you looking for Chung Ta again?

627
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,430
Huh?

628
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,030
I have something to discuss.

629
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,490
I will be back.

630
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,430
Please take care, Your Highness.

631
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,790
Ji Jeon.

632
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:11,960
Yes.

633
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,620
It looks like bonghamsal did not work.

634
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,800
Here. I steamed some potatoes.

635
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,260
Have some when you are hungry.

636
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,720
Also...

637
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,290
here is water for you, so drink it.

638
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,820
I can take care of myself.

639
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,870
Lastly...

640
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:03,750
you absolutely cannot move around yet, okay?

641
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,810
I will go to the palace and be right back.

642
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,120
Also...

643
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:36,640
if you h-have to...

644
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,260
like g-go...

645
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,760
I am here!

646
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,450
Gosh, I told her not to move around.

647
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,160
I am leaving because I have a place to be urgently.

648
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,200
Thank you for everything.

649
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,470
Did Sajo Yoong send you?

650
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,300
Are you okay?

651
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,570
I told you not to follow me.

652
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:41,050
I came to protect you, Your Highness.

653
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:44,000
I will stop them, so escape in the meantime.

In that case, you might aim your sword at me again one day.

669
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,140
I intend to wander as my footsteps take me.

670
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,090
Take care.

Please take care as well, Your Highness.

672
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,790
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong will become the king?

673
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,210
The assassins said they would kill the Crown Prince soon.

674
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:41,280
Is no one there?

675
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,400
I will give you one last chance.

676
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,750
Be my subordinate.

677
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:48,520
Your son is now the king of Asatae.
