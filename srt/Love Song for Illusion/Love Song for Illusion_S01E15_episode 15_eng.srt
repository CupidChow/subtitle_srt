1
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,340
   

2
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,010
   

3
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,660
   

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,120
   

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,360
   

6
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,940
   

7
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,730
Master Yang.

8
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,240
Please do not move.

9
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,000
Lady Yeon Wol,

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,640
I am sorry I could not do as you wished.

11
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,360
Please...

12
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,210
Please do not be sad because of me.

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,910
Please do not blame yourself.

14
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,520
Please...

15
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,000
just be happy.

16
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,930

17
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,880
Master Yang.

18
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,400
Master Yang.

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,610
Master Yang! Master Yang!

20
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,250
Master Yang!

21
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,640
 Ak Hee fooled me. 

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,290
 What Yeon Wol said was true. 

23
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,290
- Move aside. 
 - Your Majesty, it is dangerous.

24
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,610
- We will escort you. 
 - I told you to move aside.

25
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,420
What are you all doing?

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,720
Yeon Wol! Yeon Wol!

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,850
Yeon Wol.

28
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,570
Your Majesty.

29
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,140
Be gone, all of you!

30
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,080
Anyone who shoots will be executed.

31
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,100
Yeon Wol.

32
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,400
Master Yang.

33
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,720
Please go.

34
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,170
Yeon Wol...

35
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,870
I did not know.

36
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,390
- I did not— 
 - If you really understand my feelings,

37
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,650
please take all of them with you and leave.

38
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,840
That is my request.

39
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,990
I must have a talk with you.

40
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,590
I will tell all of them to go away, so—

41
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,620
We were...

42
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,410
never meant to be.

43
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,840
Please...

44
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,930
be careful.

45
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,320
Be gone, all of you!

46
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,470
No one shall harm this woman.

47
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,890
That is a royal decree!

48
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,830
   

49
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,470
It is my first time seeing you with your eyes closed, Master Yang.

50
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,500
You must have been so exhausted all this time.

51
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,240
How anxious must you have been day and night?

52
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,690
How restless must you have been because of me?

53
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,340
 I will not let them be. 

54
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,880
 Those suspicious schemes surrounding me. 

55
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,990
 I will expose all those who are bowing before me but cannot be trusted at all. 

56
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,370
 I will punish them. 

57
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,900
 Yeon Wol is in a relationship with me. 

58
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,060
 I must not look into my mind carelessly. 

59
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,840
 I must be the one in control. 

60
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,910
What is this, Sajo Hyeon?

61
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,380
 I can do it. 

62
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,960
 I can control my thoughts and feelings with strength. 

63
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,290
 I must do it. 

64
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,690
Hey, what did you think just now, huh?

65
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,440
Why can I not read them?

66
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,420
All hail His Majesty!

67
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,410
Your Majesty, congratulations on returning to the palace.

68
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,610
Congratulations on returning to the palace, Your Majesty.

69
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,750
 Congratulations on returning to the palace, Your Majesty. 

70
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,530
I was going to run out and welcome you in front of the palace,

71
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,350
but the Royal Council meeting took longer.

72
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,760
I apologize, Your Majesty.

73
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,200
It is fine.

74
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,810
State affairs come first.

75
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,600
Thank you for taking care of the state affairs in my place.

76
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,390
Thank you for your grace—

77
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,510
Have you all been doing well?

78
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,180
I was able to rest well thanks to your understanding, Ministers.

79
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,900
Congratulations on your recovery, Your Majesty.

80
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,550
 Congratulations, Your Majesty! 

81
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,650
Head Minister, have you been doing well?

82
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

83
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,620
I am so happy to see you in good health again, Your Majesty.

84
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,110
What were you discussing?

85
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,690
Report to me in detail.

86
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

87
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,410
Head Minister.

88
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

89
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,200
Firstly, there was a report on the Wind Knives,

90
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,460
a group of assassins that is growing in numbers nationally.

91
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,890
It seems His Majesty got his memories back. Right?

92
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,240
He is treating us ministers familiarly, is he not?

93
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,370
Yes, that is how I felt as well.

94
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,310
Frankly, he must have returned because he recovered completely.

95
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,560
Is the heavens not on Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's side once again?

96
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,460
Alas, Minister of Justice, watch what you say.

97
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,540
What did I say?

98
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,610
- Let us go. 
 - What?

99
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,790
   

100
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:50,170
I heard you ran into great trouble on the way back to the palace.

101
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,330
I was right to have the soldiers follow you secretly, just in case.

102
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,140
Just in case?

103
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,110
The soldiers did not seem to be following me, just in case,

104
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,460
but looking for an opportunity intently.

105
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,480
Because I was almost showered with arrows as well.

106
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,150
That could not be.

107
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:22,120
Right! I did get the report that Yang Jae Yi died, the leader of the Wind Knives.

108
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,320
He manipulated the people, plotting to restore the Royal Family of Yeon.

109
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,360
What a fitting death for him.

110
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,370
How strange.

111
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,630
Sorry?

112
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,210
Because you are saying such things when

113
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:42,070
you had once sponsored the Wind Knives and were close to Yang Jae Yi as well.

114
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,730
Your Majesty, that was when I did not know the Wind Knives were a group of assassins.

115
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,840
I only thought I was helping the poor—

116
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,420
Why are you looking at me like that?

117
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,200
Your Majesty, could it be you got your memories back?

118
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,240
What do you think?

119
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,510
I did not get the report saying you got your memories back.

120
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,420
All of your subordinates must be idiots.

121
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,880
So many of them were spying on me,

122
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,830
but none of them saw anything right.

123
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,870
What you are thinking is right, Grand Prince.

124
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,300
My memories came back.

125
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,470
Your memories came back?

126
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,880
W-Wait! When and how?

127
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,470
That is such great news.

128
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,610
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

129
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,850
I truly congratulate you.

130
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,140
Do not try too hard, Grand Prince.

131
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,290
I feel sorry for you.

132
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,340
Gosh, that cannot be.

133
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,010
Gosh. What do I do? It is too soon.

134
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,430
Hey, Sajo Hyeon, come see me.

135
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,640
 Hey, Sajo Hyeon, let me see you! 

136
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,880
Sajo Hyeon's memories came back?

137
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,700
His memories came back.

138
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,700
His memories came back!

139
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,520
Does it make sense you did not even notice any signs?

140
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,600
Are your eyes just for decoration?

141
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:03,770
I did think he did not seem like his previous self when he was ordering the soldiers at the mountain.

142
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,790
"You did think that"?

143
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,890
What a complete moron.

144
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,700
All right.

145
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,660
You are the root problem.

146
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,650
It was a remote mountainside where no one traveled.

147
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,110
You missed the chance the heavens gave.

148
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,620
You let the one who should be dead alive like that and

149
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,620
merely killed someone like Yang Jae Yi.

150
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,710
Is your head only full of crap?

151
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,390
Can you still call yourself a leader?

152
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,090
You will stab him, you will!

153
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,800
G-Gosh, what do I do?

154
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,980
W-What do I do?

155
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,670
Is it not strange?

156
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,300
Even if his memories came back, how can Sajo Hyeon be so different?

157
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,720
How can he become so confident and decisive?

158
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,140
Could it be that Ak Hee came out?

159
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,390
If he did, you would have recognized him already

160
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,040
since you are so keen.

161
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,790
How long will you let Sajo Hyeon be?

162
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,450
When are you going to do the geuminsal?

163
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,160
Looks like it is my turn.

164
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,270
F-Firstly, please agree on a term with Ak Hee.

165
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,890
You said he agreed to make a trade.

166
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,330
Forget Ak Hee and just do it.

167
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,140
Just do geuminsal right away!

168
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,230
You can do it yourself, then!

169
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
What did you say?

170
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,180
Do you also have a death wish?

171
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,450
- N-No— 
 - Huh?

172
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,390
Do whatever it takes and get rid of Sajo Hyeon.

173
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,580
If you fail this time again,

174
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:50,450
I will place this all over your body and shove you into a burning firepit, Cheong Ta!

175
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,410
Sir Head Minister.

176
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:13,470
Is it not about the time you became Minister of General Affairs or something similar?

177
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,740
Not at all.

178
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,560
How can someone like me even dare...

179
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,470
You are even humble.

180
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,650
I have never seen a general as humble and brave as you.

181
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:41,810
Do you know that Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is reorganizing his closest subordinates?

182
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,700
I have not heard of it.

183
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,460
After pouring new wine into a new bag,

184
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:00,510
the old residuals are thrown into the sewer without anyone even knowing.

185
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,760
But you are such a keeper.

186
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,510
 I must think of two things at the same time. 

187
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,680
 Ak Hee's painful memories. 

188
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,230
 At the same time, I must look into the memories inside Ak Hee's mind. 

189
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,890
Why does this keep happening?

190
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,930
 Would this not be what you call the best trade, Your Majesty? 

191
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,750
Why does this keep happening?

192
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,740
Your Majesty,

193
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,750
did you really get your memories back?

194
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,470
That is right.

195
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,770
My goodness.

196
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,330
I am truly glad, Your Majesty.

197
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,420
It seems this country will finally be set up upright now.

198
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,260
It is really fortunate.

199
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,300
How great of you to overcome it, Your Majesty.

200
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,710
I am proud of you.

201
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,640
Is that what you two sincerely think?

202
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,890
Of course. How can we be otherwise?

203
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:06,540
I prayed countless times to the heavens and the earth for your memories to come back, Your Majesty.

204
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,050
This baby is bringing us good fortune.

205
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,490
He is the heir who harbors the heavens' favor.

206
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:18,490
Watching the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong having his way without shame as if the throne was his,

207
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,210
I almost wanted to vomit blood and die.

208
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,460
I also felt the same way.

209
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,040
My, vomit blood and die?

210
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,940
Such a thing must not happen.

211
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,240
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

212
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,280
After the queen's baby is born safely and is made the crown prince,

213
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,270
you need to wait it out to become the regent and manipulate this country as you please.

214
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,300
So you have to live long in good health.

215
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,050
Your Majesty, how can you say such a thing?

216
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,190
It is a misunderstanding.

217
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,040
I have not fathomed such a thought even in my dream—

218
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,650
Queen.

219
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,370
Tell me honestly.

220
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,790
Who is it?

221
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,630
What do you mean?

222
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,820
What are you asking?

223
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,250
The father of the baby in your womb.

224
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,940
You have never...

225
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,900
slept with me, have you?

226
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,660
T-There is...

227
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,760
T-That cannot be, Your Majesty.

228
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,410
Could it be you have been ill for so long that you do not remember—

229
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,030
I slept with Ak Hee.

230
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,200
Your Majesty.

231
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,290
At first, I thought that man was Your Majesty.

232
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,440
I was speechless to find out it was Ak Hee in the morning.

233
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,210
I was conflicted about just ending my pathetic life so many times.

234
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,560
However,

235
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,450
after finding out this child had come to me, I could not.

236
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,440
Your Majesty, Ak Hee shares one body with you.

237
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,250
So, this baby does indeed have your blood.

238
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,820
You would not cruelly turn a blind eye, would you?

239
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,070
If you do that, Your Majesty,

240
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,960
it would be just too sad...

241
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,650
I feel so sorry for the baby.

242
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,340
Whoa, Geum Hwa is something else.

243
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,260
You are bold, for sure.

244
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,220
Sure, use me all you want and however you want.

245
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,960
You will come to your senses after shedding tears of blood later.

246
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,420
Our backs are against the wall now.

247
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:12,570
His Majesty is sure to confirm it with Ak Hee, though.

248
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,700
Ak Hee would not deny it, either.

249
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,630
Because defeating His Majesty would be his priority as well.

250
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,240
Yes.

251
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,580
Preparations to entrap Grand Prince Sajo Yoong are going well. Right?

252
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,530
Do not worry.

253
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:35,410
We will be the ones to have the last laugh in the end.

254
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,660
We must be.

255
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:46,720
By the way, I do not see Noh Ri Sa.

256
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,560
Confess the truth now.

257
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,950
Who is the father of the baby in the queen's womb?

258
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,330
Of course, it is His Majesty—

259
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,290
You still have not had enough, huh?

260
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,590
Hey, I know it is not His Majesty's child.

261
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,430
Who is the one who gave her the seed?

262
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,430
There is no way.

263
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,620
I really do not know—

264
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,020
You are such a fool.

265
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,310
If you do not know, you have to pretend to know at least.

266
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,940
That is how you can live.

267
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,520
It is not His Majesty's baby. Right?

268
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,100
It better not be.

269
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,860
It is not. Right?

270
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,620
There you go.

271
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,090
That is right.

272
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,570
Who knows?

273
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:59,790
Once Grand Prince Yoong becomes the emperor,

274
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,240
I just might make you a concubine.

275
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:11,120
So you have to tell His Majesty exactly what you just said. Got it?

276
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,230
Just try breaking your promise.

277
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,570
I will stick a poison arrow in this pretty head of—

278
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
What the hell?

279
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,710
Did you get rid of her?

280
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,950
Yes, she died instantly.

281
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,730
Good job.

282
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,350
You must not tell anyone about this.

283
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

284
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,480
 How is it? 

285
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,310
 Sajo Hyeon, come see me for a moment. 

286
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,950
 You keep ignoring me. 

287
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,910
 I marked spots you have to watch out for in the mountains and the village. 

288
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,110
 Be careful and be on your guard wherever you are. 

289
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,170
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

290
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:25,050
Did you get a good break?

291
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,380
I apologize.

292
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,670
I am fine now, so I will protect you, Your Majesty.

293
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,930
What happened to Eunuch Neung?

294
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,370
Please have me killed, Your Majesty.

295
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,140
By chance...

296
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,560
did he meet his end?

297
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,410
Where am I?

298
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,770
 I am sorry, Eunuch Neung. 

299
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,650
Ji Jeon, you bastard.

300
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:26,520
You would bite the hand that fed you?

301
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,050
That ungrateful bastard.

302
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,310
He tied me so tightly.

303
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,880
I am so sore.

304
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,280
Gosh, my arm is sore.

305
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,170
They came off. Good, good.

306
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,110
Good, good.

307
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,700
W-Whoa, I am free.

308
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,860
I am free.

309
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,920
Is anyone out there?

310
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,620
Please help!

311
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,600
G-Goodness, goodness, I am alive.

312
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,730
Gosh, I am alive.

313
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,930
I am alive!

314
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,340
Could Ji Jeon have?

315
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,430
 This is the Wind Knives' hideout inside the capital. 

316
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,010
 I hope you will never need this map. 

317
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,980
 It is a plan Yang Jae Yi would have made 

318
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,570
 since he considers all possible outcomes. 

319
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:57,300
Sajo Hyeon, that bastard, is doing as he pleases now.

320
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:08,840
We lost our leader out of nowhere and so vainly.

321
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,750
I am saddened beyond words.

322
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,260
However, if the Wind Knives loses morale because of this,

323
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,300
we will be forsaking Leader Yang Jae Yi's grand will.

324
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:23,210
Therefore, I suggest we take Kyera as the new leader of the Wind Knives today

325
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:27,490
and rise once more with determination.

326
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,420
Leader Yang Jae Yi would have wished for this as well.

327
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,690
All right, let us all serve our new leader as one.

328
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,690
Kyera!

329
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,710
Kyera!

330
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,310
Kyera!

331
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,310
 Kyera! Kyera! Kyera! 

332
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,140
 Kyera! Kyera! Kyera! 

333
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,160
I understand you all, including San Myo.

334
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,580
However, I have no intention of becoming the Wind Knives' leader.

335
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,300
Master Yang did not wish for me to become the leader, either.

336
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,160
Kyera.

337
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,080
How can you utter such words as the descendant of the Royal Family of Yeon?

338
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,260
For whom have we been risking our lives all this time?

339
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:18,460
We have been risking our lives to save the people suffering under Sajo Seung's tyranny.

340
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,020
It was not to take over the throne.

341
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,190
How can you say such a thing

342
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,520
- when you are our only hope? 
 - Brother!

343
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,240
Master Yang died because of her!

344
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,060
Please!

345
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,050
Please do not do this.

346
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,830
Master Yang died because of me.

347
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,040
Stab me.

348
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:52,160
If I can atone even a bit by my death, I will gladly offer up my life.

349
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,590
Stab me. Hurry up and stab me!

350
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,740
Calm down, everyone!

351
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,970
It is right to kill off someone who has such rotten thoughts.

352
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,500
But let us pay our final respects to the descendant of the Royal Family of Yeon.

353
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,600
You ungrateful brat.

354
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,930
We can no longer support you if that is what you truly believe.

355
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,300
Leave this place as soon as dawn breaks.

356
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,480
Brother San Myo!

357
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,230
You are being too harsh.

358
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,640
Kyera has worked so hard all this time!

359
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,420
I will do that.

360
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,430
It is right to leave right away, but I want to give you some time.

361
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:39,590
If there is any comrade whose anger still remains, come to me tonight and...

362
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,600
kill me.

363
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,960
I will be waiting.

364
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,340
 I hope that day will come soon. 

365
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,070
 The day you become happy. 

366
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,770
 - All right, there you go. 
 - Hurray, Wind Knives! 

367
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,320
 - Hurray! 
 - Hurray! 

368
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,600
Master Yang, I let you down. Right?

369
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,920
I am sorry.

370
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,760
 You are... 

371
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,860
 You are in so much pain because of me. What should I do? 

372
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,390
Master Yang told you about this place. Right?

373
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,860
Yeon Wol.

374
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:17,600
There was a map secretly hidden inside the notebook he gave me.

375
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,480
I knew Master Yang would do this.

376
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,800
He complained to me all the time...

377
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,920
but never left any openings.

378
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,520
He is making me feel even worse.

379
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,070
Yeon Wol.

380
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,070
Please go back.

381
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,160
I will make sure Master Yang will not have died in vain.

382
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,340
I will keep the promise I made to Master Yang.

383
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,350
Your memories...

384
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,270
came back. Right?

385
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,610
Your Majesty.

386
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,730
How fortunate.

387
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,390
Kyera is so happy.

388
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,340
Since your memories are back,

389
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,440
please focus on setting this country upright from now on.

390
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,570
I wish you good health.

391
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,020
Hold on.

392
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,560
Could you hold on a moment?

393
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,140
Just for a moment.

394
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,990
 I must remember it. 

395
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,550
 I must remember Ak Hee suffering in pain. 

396
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,880
 Continue. 

397
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,940
 Continue. 

398
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,580
Your Majesty.

399
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,880
 Something is going on. 

400
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,880
 He did not get his memories back. 

401
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,550
 He is deceiving Ak Hee. 

402
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,540
I will do my best as well.

403
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,070
So I will not be ashamed to face you.

404
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,610
Please...

405
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,370
be careful.

406
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,350
Your Majesty.

407
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,760
Sorry for everything.

408
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,050
Was my feeling correct?

409
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,770
If my feeling is correct,

410
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,650
His Majesty has found a way.

411
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,710
 Try harder until your brain starts sweating. 

412
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,680
 Focus your strength right here. 

413
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,380
He has been working hard the entire time, as I told him to.

414
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,650
Your Majesty.

415
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,120
No.

416
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,970
He has nothing to do with me now.

417
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,540
 It is His Majesty's child I conceived from sleeping with His Majesty. 

418
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,630
He has to go on a different path than me.

419
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,660
 Is that really what you think? 

420
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,390
Master Yang.

421
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,560
It is what you wished for as well.

422
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,390
For me to leave His Majesty's side.

423
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,780
 You never listened to me before, and now you are trying to obey? 

424
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,700
Because I love His Majesty,

425
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,750
I ended up losing you, Master Yang.

426
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,460
Because of me, you...

427
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,740
 Did you already forget what I said? 

428
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,600
 I told you not to blame yourself. 

429
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,690
 I told you to only become happy. 

430
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,510
 Listen to your true feelings. 

431
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,780
 That is the correct way. 

432
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,670
But you always said I only do as I please.

433
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,600
 I did. 

434
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,570
 However, to be honest, I also... 

435
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,090
 wished you to do that the most. 

436
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,120
 For you to become happy and 

437
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,720
 for you to be laughing. 

438
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,160
 Lady Yeon Wol, 

439
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,660
 please follow that path. 

440
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,100
Master Yang.

441
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,680
Officer Ji, you look a lot better.

442
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,400
I am on the way to bring His Majesty his medicine and the toilet.

443
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,010
 (Your Majesty.) 

444
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,850
G-Goodness, Your Majesty!

445
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,150
Are you hurt anywhere?

446
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,300
No, I am totally fine.

447
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,870
I thought I would never get to see you again, Your Majesty!

448
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,380
I thought so as well, and I was very anxious.

449
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,890
I had your family move to a safe place, Eunuch Neung.

450
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,770
Your mother is doing well, so please do not worry, Eunuch Neung.

451
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,670
Your Majesty!

452
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,240
Thank you for your grace!

453
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,800
Ji Jeon, you bastard!

454
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,630
- Do not hold me back! 
 - E-Eunuch Neung!

455
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:06,780
Y-Your Majesty, that bastard used sleeping incense on me like this and—

456
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,250
Ji Jeon Seo, draw your sword!

457
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,800
I have committed a grave sin against you, Eunuch Neung.

458
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,790
Still, we were able to move your family to safety thanks to Officer Ji's hard work.

459
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,640
Ji Jeon, you...

460
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,450
I am letting you off the hook just this once. Do better!

461
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,630
However, Your Majesty, what do we do from now on?

462
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,310
Once Grand Prince finds out, he will not let me be.

463
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,820
Since I am here, he will not be able to have his way.

464
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,900
But we never know, so stay here with me.

465
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,340
H-Here?

466
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,720
Stay right by my side.

467
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:56,150
Y-Yes, yes, Your Majesty.

468
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,030
I finally get to see you.

469
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:16,520
You were busy all day long.

470
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,880
I must rest.

471
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,630
You lied about getting your memories back. Right?

472
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,840
I wish it was a lie, too.

473
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,540
It is painful to know everything.

474
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,290
It must be painful

475
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:45,410
since you realized you and Kyera are not fated to be together.

476
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,710
Why did you deceive me,

477
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,310
saying you and Kyera are in love?

478
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,250
Well, it would only pain you to know the true story

479
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,600
and Kyera had requested so as well.

480
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,840
Yeon Wol did?

481
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,200
I see.

482
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:13,980
By the way, how did your memories come back?

483
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,620
Did Cheong Ta help you?

484
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,990
They came back naturally.

485
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:24,570
It might be because I was shocked by seeing Yang Jae Yi's death.

486
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,840
How weird.

487
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,620
 I know the agreement you made with Sajo Yoong. 

488
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,720
W-What? What is it?

489
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,500
Ak Hee,

490
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,870
did you sleep with the queen?

491
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,700
 I slept with Ak Hee! 

492
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,130
I mean, well, it just happened.

493
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,610
 Ak Hee did not sleep with the queen, either. 

494
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,330
Are you not going to get mad?

495
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,990
"You are worse than a beast, you evil spirit!"

496
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,720
"How can you do such a thing?"

497
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,680
Are you not going to say anything like that?

498
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,690
What is the use in doing that at this point?

499
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:20,570
I do not want to say bad things about a life that has been conceived already.

500
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,680
Gosh, what a good bastard.

501
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,550
Rest up.

502
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:44,730
Ak Hee, are you unable to read my mind in here anymore?

503
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:15,010
 Why can I not read Sajo Hyeon's thoughts in the mind's space? 

504
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,140
 I am weakening. 

505
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,080
Looks like I will perish.

506
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,010
Gosh, that scared me.

507
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,870
Why did he tell Eunuch Neung to stay here?

508
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,590
Eunuch Neung.

509
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,040
Eunuch Neung.

510
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,220
Go back to sleep.

511
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:38,510
If Ak Hee woke up today, he will surely come to see me.

512
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,380
Ak Hee is definitely planning something.

513
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,920
Hey, you are really a great horse.

514
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,400
You run so well even though I cannot see well.

515
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,380
Stay here. Okay?

516
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,870
 He thinks obsession is love. 

517
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:39,850
 He will do anything to satisfy his greed in the end. 

518
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,970
 His Majesty is in danger. 

519
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,010
Sir Ak Hee.

520
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,110
Kyera!

521
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,230
Did you come to find me?

522
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,610
Yes, I was worried.

523
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,850
It was hard after what happened to Master Yang. Right?

524
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,430
Your eyes must have worsened.

525
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,530
Did you take the medicine I made you?

526
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,100
Huh? Well...

527
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:22,810
Of course! I am taking them diligently.

528
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:27,270
I can see so clearly. Over there...

529
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,330
I can see everything.

530
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,450
I am glad we ran into each other.

531
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,100
I was on my way to leave.

532
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,500
What?

533
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,280
To where?

534
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,240
Wherever.

535
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,010
I want to go to a place where I can be of use.

536
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,660
Does Sajo Hyeon know you are leaving, too?

537
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,460
He did not seem to know.

538
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,930
Is there a need to tell him?

539
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,660
Then...

540
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,330
am I the only one you are telling?

541
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,180
Sajo Hyeon was here yesterday, too. Right?

542
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,390
Did he tell you?

543
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:09,090
Gosh, I know, even if he does not tell me.

544
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,860
I can read every thought Sajo Hyeon has.

545
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,090
And I also watch what he does.

546
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,020
But he cannot do the same.

547
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,440
That is right.

548
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:26,480
Do you also know that His Majesty's memories are back?

549
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,780
Exactly.

550
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,970
This is so strange. How did his memories come back?

551
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:37,630
His Majesty and I have really become enemies now

552
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:41,020
since he got all of his memories back.

553
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,770
True.

554
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:47,520
On top of that, the queen became pregnant, too.

555
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:55,440
But he was just happy to death yesterday after all that.

556
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,380
 Ak Hee does not know His Majesty can control his mind now. 

557
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,290
Why?

558
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:12,980
Do you still like Sajo Hyeon?

559
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,060
I am going to forget him.

560
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,580
What? Wait, really?

561
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,750
Wait! What about me, then?

562
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,940
Well, Sir Ak Hee, you will be just a friend.

563
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,750
Did you really come because you were worried about me, not because something was wrong?

564
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,590
If nothing is wrong, then I am glad.

565
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,370
I should get going.

566
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:45,930
Doing this gives you pain.

567
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,850
Kyera, let us go far away together.

568
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,850
How can we do that?

569
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:56,170
You are going to become His Majesty after sleeping.

570
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:57,970
I really do not want to see His Majesty anymore.

571
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:01,130
I will perish soon at this rate.

572
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,780
I want to live.

573
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:07,000
I really want to live forever by your side.

574
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,690
I know a way not to change into Sajo Hyeon.

575
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:12,990
I just need to do that...

576
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,540
and leave.

577
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,580
How can you not change into His Majesty?

578
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,230
What?

579
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,300
What is it?

580
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:31,560
I will tell you about that later.

581
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,920
If that happens,

582
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,180
His Majesty is going to perish in your place, is he not?

583
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,240
You said you would forget him.

584
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,030
What does it matter if he perishes or not?

585
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,370
My feelings are not what matters.

586
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:52,220
Without His Majesty, Sajo Yoong will become the king of this country.

587
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,290
That cannot happen.

588
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:56,290
He is already harassing the people here and there.

589
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,510
In that case,

590
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:01,530
is it okay for me to perish? Is that what you want?

591
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,750
 This man's anxiety and jealousy will lash out at His Majesty. 

592
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,870
 I must keep calm. 

593
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:08,640
Was everything all a lie?

594
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Sir Ak Hee, I do not wish you or His Majesty to perish.

595
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,340
Would there not be a way if you looked?

596
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,660
I am sure there is.

597
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,190
You do not...

598
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,960
want me to perish?

599
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,840
Thank you, Kyera.

600
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,840
Thank you.

601
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,330
Ak Hee.

602
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:59,100
He cannot read my mind in here anymore.

603
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,240
I am going to read...

604
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,170
all of Ak Hee's memories while I am here.

605
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:19,030
 Sajo Yoong! 

606
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:22,330
 If I can read all of Ak Hee's memories... 

607
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,030
 What is your identity? 

608
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,930
 I will leave. 

609
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,360
 it will be the same as my memories coming back in the end. 

610
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,910
 Father! Father! 

611
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:34,170
 - How could you!  
  - All hail His Majesty! 

612
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,820
 - I love you.  
  - I love you. 

613
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,920
 - Yeon Wol! 
 - Precious lives were lost because of me. 

614
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,520
 Are you really of the late king's bloodline? 

615
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,650
 I am recovering my memories on my own. 

616
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:45,830
 Kyera. 

617
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,000
 Kyera, you like Sajo Hyeon, not me? 

618
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,190
 - You never had feelings for me as your lover? 
 - I am sorry. 

619
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,630
 I am going to take everything. 

620
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,630
 Sajo Hyeon, you are going to be gone now. 

621
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,040
 - Your Majesty! 
 - I envy you, Sajo Hyeon. 

622
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,940
 I am going to seal Sajo Hyeon with bonghamsal. 

623
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,620
 I got the evidence, too. 

624
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,390
 The day you allow the passing of the crown, 

625
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,850
 Cheong Ta will perform geuminsal on Sajo Hyeon. 

626
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,790
 By geuminsal, you mean 

627
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:15,050
 she will stab Sajo Hyeon in the back with the blade? 

628
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:21,430
 Would this not be what you call the best trade, Your Majesty? 

629
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,690
Geuminsal?

630
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,100
I was going to come to your chamber,

631
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:04,630
but I thought this place would be better for secret conversations.

632
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,640
Well, is geuminsal ready to be done?

633
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,620
When will you pass the crown?

634
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,270
You only need to put the seal right here.

635
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:22,120
And why would I trust you?

636
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,850
I will put the seal on this after I confirm...

637
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,750
Sajo Hyeon is gone.

638
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:41,680
It will be tonight at the Hall of Spirits.

639
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,650
Sure.

640
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,630
What are those two scheming right now?

641
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,900
I cannot really tell.

642
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,580
How come?

643
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,990
Why would a traitor not know?

644
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,070
Passing of the crown?

645
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,320
When is he going to pass the crown?

646
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,640
It will be tomorrow, I believe.

647
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,680
Is that so?

648
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:25,620
This is the residence you will be living in starting today, Minister of General Affairs.

649
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,640
I am sure you will like it.

650
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,330
Minister of General Affairs?

651
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,380
The moment Sajo Yoong is eliminated,

652
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,620
I will appoint you as the Minister of General Affairs.

653
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:04,570
 I know a way to not change into Sajo Hyeon. 

654
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,780
 I just need to do that... 

655
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,460
 and leave. 

656
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,550
Ak Hee.

657
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:20,140
I am sorry, Sajo Hyeon.

658
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,300
What? You cannot do geuminsal?

659
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,400
This is different from what Sajo Yoong said! He said it would be done today!

660
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,370
Well, the thing is...

661
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:06,940
As you know, we were expelled from the Heavenly Shaman Association.

662
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:13,550
So, Male Cheong Ta cannot create the blade.

663
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,250
No, you cannot! Do not go!

664
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,190
If Sajo Yoong finds out, he will go mad and throw a fit!

665
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,040
He is going to kill me! You cannot—

666
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,230
Get off me.

667
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:28,140
There is a way.

668
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:39,590
You have the blade you were stabbed with. Right?

669
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,750
- That thing? 
 - Bring me that thing.

670
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,290
I will be able to do it, then.

671
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,450
Oh, really?

672
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,710
I got it. In that case,

673
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:52,190
w-wait for me.

674
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,740
The blade?

675
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,060
 If that happens, 

676
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:02,250
 His Majesty is going to perish in your place, is he not? 

677
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,370
 You said you will forget him. 

678
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:08,370
 What does it matter if he perishes or not? 

679
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,990
Would it be okay for me to go out?

680
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,060
Whoa, my goodness.

681
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,500
It is just— There is something I forgot to take.

682
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,870
Really?

683
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,600
Is this what you were looking for?

684
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:04,260
- Sir Ak Hee! 
 - No! No...

685
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,600
Gosh, my back.

686
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:17,430
No! No!

687
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:20,340
Take me with you.

688
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,700
Do not stab His Majesty.

689
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:03,690
Sir Ak Hee. Sir Ak Hee, wake up. How can you do this?

690
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,740
You said you will look for a way with me!

691
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:08,060
 Ak Hee, please wake up! 

692
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,590
 Wake up! Wake up! 

693
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:14,240
 Sir Ak Hee, wake up! 

694
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,510
Wake up! Wake up!

695
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,010
Ak Hee.

696
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,440
What did you do to His Majesty?

697
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,950
What did you do?

698
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,270
What did you do?

699
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,890
I am sorry.

700
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:03,250
Kyera.

701
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:08,790
♫  When the deep darkness consumes me  ♫

702
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:15,590
♫  My eyes soak up the sadness  ♫

703
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:23,430
♫  My heart is scarred deeply  ♫

704
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:29,420
♫  Please fill it up with your warmth  ♫

705
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:35,140
♫  Because I was always you  ♫

706
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,630
♫  And you were always me  ♫

707
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:45,490
♫  I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere  ♫

708
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:53,920
♫  The place where you are, even if it'll only be a moment  ♫

709
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,770
♫  Please take me anywhere, a place, go away  ♫

710
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:03,410
