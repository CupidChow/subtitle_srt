7
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,570
I am sorry.

8
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,480
Consort Hyo.

9
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,320
Did you make me lose my memories?

10
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,730
Why?

11
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,980
Was it revenge for trying to kill your father?

12
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,890
Is that why you still took me in, knowing I am an assassin?

13
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,730
That man is not the Crown Prince!

14
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,830
He is the evil spirit!

15
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:03,290
Or did you do it because you are an evil spirit?

16
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,460
Is something wrong?

17
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,720
You look sad.

18
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,250
It is fine if nothing is wrong.

19
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,500
Your Highness.

20
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,950
I will do as you said.

21
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,790
I will stay here longer until my memories come back.

22
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,560
A crown prince possessed an evil spirit.

23
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,000
Were you punished?

24
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,620
Were you the one who was punished by the heavens

25
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,930
for the massacre of my family?

26
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,510
Father!

27
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,060
You are now this country's only royal descendant.

28
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,870
Please survive and plan for the future.

29
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,880
Father.

30
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,760

[Episode 4]

32
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,850
Why do I feel so uneasy?

33
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,750
I have a terrible feeling.

34
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,160
I am sure bonghamsal worked successfully.

35
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,530
Dear heavens, hear my prayer.

36
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,780
Hear my prayer.

- What?

40
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,300
Be respectful!

[Ak Hee]

42
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,460
Gosh, no way. I am sure it worked.

43
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,870
Yes.

44
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,020
What the heck? Is it Eunuch Neung?

45
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,740
Chung Ta?

46
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,250
If bonghamsal worked successfully,

47
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,340
he should have turned back into Crown Prince Sajo Hyun.

48
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,630
- Eunuch Neung.
- Your Highness?

49
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,350
You have come back, Your Highness!

50
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,450
How dare you come in here when you should be at the laundry!

51
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,410
T-This humble one only...

52
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,820
c-came to get my stuff.

53
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,970
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

54
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,510
Kyera, pull yourself together.

55
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,900
Get your revenge, no matter what.

56
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,010
Bring more alcohol.

57
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,450
I told you to bring more-

58
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,540
You are...

59
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,200
Yeon Poong Hak's wife.

60
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,180
Are you happy?

61
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,910
You massacred your best friend's family and

62
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,160
live a life of debauchery in the people's blood.

63
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,900
Are you happy now?

64
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,460
Unable to see an inch into the future,

65
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,560
do you feel you own the world?

66
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,550
H-Hear ye, is anyone there?

67
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,780
You are worse than a beast.

68
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,210
All the resentful spirits who died will take your life tonight.

69
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,790
Fall into hell, Sajo Seung!

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,510
You wretched wench!

75
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,250
W-Why do you keep harassing me?

76
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,730
Why are you still roaming this world?

77
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,550
Your Majesty, did you have another nightmare?

78
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,080
It is me, Consort Cheong Myeong, Your-

79
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,680
Your Majesty!

80
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,390
Your Majesty!

81
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,360
Get the physician here right now!

82
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,870
It was a dream, Your Majesty.

83
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,810
It was all but a dream, Your Majesty.

84
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,150
Alcohol.

85
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,530
Bring me alcohol.

86
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,780
Your Majesty, it is already deep into the night.

87
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,150
Your Majesty, I will give you needle treatment, so rest-

88
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,810
Bring me alcohol! Alcohol!

89
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,670
Bring me alcohol! Bring me alcohol.

90
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,080
Your Majesty!

91
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,660
Bring me alcohol!

92
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,260
Your Majesty!

93
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,830
Set up the table and alcohol! What are you all doing?

94
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,360
Your Majesty.

95
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,840
I am in so much pain!

96
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,600
Your Majesty, I told them to set up the table and alcohol, so please wait a moment.

97
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,320
You will be at ease soon.

98
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,610
Hurry up and get to it, all of you!

99
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,300
You are the only one who cares about me, Yoong.

100
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,180
Right, Your Majesty? Grand Prince Yoong is the only one who cares.

101
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,410
Grand Prince Yoong is standing guard in the room next to us every night.

102
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,320
He is worried something will happen to you, Your Majesty...

103
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,470
Grand Prince, what is the matter?

104
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,500
It is nothing.

105
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,360
Ha Rang.

106
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,420
Master Yang.

107
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,320
You forgot this.

108
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,630
I failed my mission and even lost my memories.

109
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,880
I am too ashamed to face them.

110
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,850
I will succeed no matter what.

111
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,470
Even if it means I will be back as a corpse,

112
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,060
I will kill Sajo Seung this time, for sure.

113
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,090
Consort Hyo, you are prettier than you were at the installation ceremony.

114
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,610
The Crown Prince must be treating you so well.

115
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,600
Yes, Consort Hyo's face is pretty like crepe myrtle flowers.

116
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,980
I am eternally thankful.

117
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,280
I cannot believe he was a son of a concubine.

118
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,470
Why did he sponsor a group of assassins when he is the king's son?

119
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,790
Is it his resentment as a bastard child?

120
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,530
You did not even show your face last night.

121
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,120
It must not matter to you whether your father dies or lives.

122
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,500
- I am sorry-
- Your Majesty,

123
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,270
The Crown Prince had fallen weak last night-

124
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,090
Forget it!

125
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,710
What use are you as a man when you are so fragile?

126
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,210
You can all leave now since you greeted me.

127
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,600
Your Majesty, are you feeling the pain here by chance?

129
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,520
From here to all the way here,

130
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,140
it feels like I am being stabbed by a knife.

131
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,340
If so, you should try pressing those spots in pain like this.

132
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,590
Consort Hyo, you are being rude.

133
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,230
How dare you speak up.

134
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,430
Your Highness Consort Cheong Myeong, will you help?

135
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,270
Consort Hyo, do it yourself.

136
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,340
Do you not hear me?

137
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,380
Consort Hyo, come over here and do it yourself.

138
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,530
See? It must be giving him more pain.

139
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,590
Come out here, Consort Hyo.

140
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,560
Consort Hyo!

141
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,940
Just endure it a bit longer, Your Majesty.

142
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,990
How do you feel, Your Majesty?

143
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,260
My goodness. Bring the physician right now-

144
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,850
How odd.

145
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,930
The pain is gone as if it was washed away.

146
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,190
Consort Hyo, did you study medicine?

147
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,970
I heard Consort Hyo has been studying medicine in her spare time

148
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,150
due to her vast interest since she was young.

149
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,030
Really? My goodness.

150
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,360
The skills you have studied in your spare time are better than those of the royal physician.

151
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,250
Our Royal Family gained a great physician, huh.

152
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,960
How amazing.

153
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:01,750
Crown Prince, have I had a vast interest in medicine when I was young?

154
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,260
I would not know that.

155
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,090
Since you do not remember,

156
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,330
I had no choice but to concoct a story.

157
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,820
I see.

158
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,490
- Thank you.
- I am the thankful one.

159
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,570
I scored some points from His Majesty, thanks to you.

160
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,930
Well, I guess the Crown Princess was displeased.

161
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,240
Is he the evil spirit or the Crown Prince?

162
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,600
By the way, what have you been pondering about since last night?

163
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Wondering if I am the evil spirit or not?

164
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:53,290
Yes, Eunuch Neung told me that your personality changes whenever you sleep.

165
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,030
Well, then.

166
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,620
Who do you think is standing in front of you, Consort Hyo?

167
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,810
Not sure.

168
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,150
I do not know which one is the evil spirit,

169
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,460
but I noticed your temperatures are different.

170
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,770
Temperatures, huh?

171
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,210
One day, you are as cold as ice, and

172
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,240
another day, extremely hot.

173
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,960
In that case,

174
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,520
what about now?

175
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,520
Right now,

176
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,250
you are neither hot nor cold.

177
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,910
Really?

178
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,790
Interesting.

179
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,350
Whomever you may be, I will not forgive you.

180
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,090
If you are the evil spirit, I cannot forgive you for erasing my memories.

181
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,150
If you are the Crown Prince,

182
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,000
I cannot forgive you since you are my enemy's son.

183
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,710
Hong Gun, are you okay?

184
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,580
Aigoo, aigoo, stand up.

185
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,390
Do you think you can get up?

186
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,380
My goodness...

187
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,910
I am deeply sorry, Your Highness Consort Hyo.

188
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,870
I was rushing because of an urgent matter.

189
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,770
Not at all. It is okay.

190
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,790
- Grand Prince.
- Yes, Your Highness.

191
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,860
Never mind.

192
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,120
Kyera, do you have something to tell me?

193
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,630
All right, then.

194
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,100
Your Highness?

195
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,970
Sajo Yoong, you tried to kill me.

196
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,540
Why did he try to kill me?

197
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,840
Because I might cause harm to Wind Knife?

198
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,610
Be careful. Someone will come to kill you.

199
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,670
Did Master Yang agree to this?

200
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,210
Or did he do it without Master Yang knowing?

201
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,840
Or...

202
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,090
did Master Yang have a change of heart?

203
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,360
Young Lady Wol!

204
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,210
Who am I supposed to trust here?

205
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,770
Who is it?

206
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,920
Why did you come so late? I told you to tell me quickly!

207
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,930
So, how did bonghamsal turn out?

208
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,440
D-Did it succeed? It worked, right?

209
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,300
It did not work?

210
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,370
D-Damn it!

211
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,590
I need to run away! I need to run!

212
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,590
Do not tell him you saw me.

213
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:12,050
A-Aigoo, Sir Ak Hee!

214
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,000
Congratulations!

215
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,660
Congratulations on the success of bonghamsal!

216
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,540
Why are you shaking so much when you are happy for me?

217
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,580
W-Well, I was too happy to see you in good health.

218
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,500
I am shaking from the joy, and it is making me dance.

219
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,030
By the way, you are not Ak Hee, right?

220
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,230
You know you are not.

221
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,950
You are not him! Hurray, it worked!

222
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,640
It worked!

223
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,890
Hurray!

224
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,140
How dare you lie to me!

225
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,890
You dared to lock me up by plotting with Ak Hee?

226
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,590
N-No, Ak Hee-

227
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,350
That is absolutely not the case!

228
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,550
Can you not see how you came back?

229
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,390
I did everything in my power to bring you back!

230
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,720
Come on, talk. You should have let me know sooner!

231
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,040
I did not even know and was worried about bonghamsal.

232
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,700
I could not even sleep a bite or eat a wink!

233
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,240
All I could do was think about you, Your Highness.

234
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,150
Gosh, I freaked out at first, too.

235
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,100
Your Highness? You are the real crown prince, right?

236
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,300
Your Highness, why must you trick me like this?

237
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,400
Hate you...

238
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,470
I told him not to tell you.

239
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,710
Since you released me, I reckoned you can lock me up again at will.

240
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,680
So I have been watching you quietly.

241
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,410
O-Oh, I see. Lock you up again?

242
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,310
I can never do that.

243
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,210
No one can escape bonghamsal once they are locked up.

244
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,000
- Chung Ta.
- Yes.

245
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,580
Why did Ak Hee erase Consort Hyo's memories?

246
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,810
The thing is, I-I do not really know-

247
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,020
He erased Consort Hyo's memories with the sleeping incense you provided!

248
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,110
O-Oh, probably...

249
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,440
From what I assume,

250
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,560
Ak Hee had a crush on Consort Hyo.

251
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,980
So he erased her memories and made it look like they were in a passionate relationship.

252
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,040
There is something more than that. Spill it.

253
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,550
I do not really know more than that, either.

254
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:55,050
Even so, you erased that woman's memories.

255
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,600
Why on Earth did you do that, Ak Hee?

256
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
What can I do, then?

257
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,340
If I left her memories intact, she would never be together with me.

258
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,580
Just think about it! How can you love your sworn enemy's son?

259
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,180
But still! How can you defy fate like that!

260
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,900
Whatever. It could not be helped.

261
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,930
Anyhow, this is a secret only between you and me.

262
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:22,700
So, just try talking about it somewhere. Your life as a shaman will be over.

263
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,840
Mark my words.

264
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,320
I cannot tell you.

265
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,420
- You know what it is. Speak!
- I cannot tell you.

266
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,630
What did you say? Tell me.

267
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,170
- Spill it!
- I cannot tell you!

268
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,250
Huh?

269
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,500
What is this?

270
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,900
Chung Ta is using a cheap trick.

271
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,430
Hey, you!

272
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,770
Are you showing off just because you are a famous shaman?

273
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,820
W-Whoa-

274
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,940
Chung Ta?

275
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,840
Crown Prince, stay away from Her Highness Consort Hyo.

276
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,610
Let her leave.

277
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,210
Otherwise, your life will be in peril.

278
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,640
Please remember my words.

279
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,210
What on Earth...

280
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,480
Do you think this is true, Your Highness?

281
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,480
M-My goodness.

282
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:42,260
Your Highness, why would Chung Ta tell you to make Her Highness leave you?

283
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,910
Right, could it be because she has become close to Ak Hee already?

284
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,860
Was Consort Hyo that close to Ak Hee?

285
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,350
Well, Ak Hee was really quite good to Consort Hyo.

286
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,480
He had honey falling out of his eyes when he looked at her.

287
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,010
Well, then.

288
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,150
Did Consort Hyo like him, too?

289
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,300
Probably so?

290
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,390
I am sure Ak Hee was pretending to be you, wandering everywhere,

291
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:16,260
and fell in love at first sight when he saw Her Highness!

292
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,890
With your good looks as a weapon,

293
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,640
I am sure he made all the moves he can.

294
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,150
Gosh, that wicked Ak Hee!

295
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,400
- Eunuch Neung!
- Yes, Your Highness.

296
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,540
Even though Ak Hee is an evil spirit,

297
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,730
he had once resided in my body.

298
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,350
It bothers me to hear you badmouth him every time.

299
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,990
Aigoo, Your Highness, I apologize.

300
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,150
Let us go.

301
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,050
My big mouth. My big mouth. My big mouth.

302
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,100
I need to pick my words carefully!

303
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,640
Your Highness!

304
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,230
Ji Jeon!

305
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,120
Ji Jeon!

306
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,850
You know I cannot get on by myself!

307
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,600
Consort Hyo, were you really Ak Hee's woman?

308
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,920
Have you returned to being a cowardly nerd?

309
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,250
Were you looking manly only because of your madness?

310
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,980
I will change.

311
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,810
I am going to be better than Ak Hee.

312
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,260
Your Majesty, though we fortified our guard,

313
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,200
the theft and arson by the poor are endless.

314
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,530
Strengthening the border is only a makeshift solution.

315
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:30,880
I reckon the wise solution is to provide additional rice for free to the poor who are causing trouble.

316
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,790
That is also only a makeshift solution!

317
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Your Majesty, you cannot console your people who turned into rioters due to poverty

318
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,730
merely by providing free rice.

319
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:10,360
I think teaching how to make a bowl of rice is wiser than giving a bowl of rice.

320
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,040
Therefore, please punish the criminals by sentencing them

321
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,910
to working the barren lands instead of beatings.

322
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,280
If allowed to take 80% of whatever they make

323
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,770
on those barren lands, they will not commit

324
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:29,280
anymore theft or arson, even if someone were to beg them to do so.

325
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,160
Your Majesty, working the barren lands-

326
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,020
Head Minister!

327
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

328
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,330
Do as the Crown Prince said.

329
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,950
Today's assembly is over now.

330
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,340
Crown Prince.

331
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,520
What is the occasion?

332
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,670
Is it wrong for the crown prince to attend the assembly?

333
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,360
It is because you have not attended so far.

334
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,040
In that case, do you plan to keep attending the assembly?

335
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,720
If you do, I will have your spot prepared from now on-

336
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,470
Your question itself is wrong, Grand Prince.

337
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:36,220
An assembly is supposed to be led by His Majesty and myself, the Crown Prince.

338
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,290
Am I supposed to get permission from you?

339
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,190
Sajo Hyun!

340
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:06,060
How dare you, you half-witted nerd!

341
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,950
No way!

342
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,560
No way.

343
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,470
There must be a way.

344
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,300
A way.

345
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,080
The path to this location is in bad condition.

346
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,290
- Therefore...
- Yes.

347
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,400
Sajo Yoong, a secret army, too?

348
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,450
Stay away from Her Highness Consort Hyo.

349
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,260
Let her leave.

350
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:28,490
Otherwise, your life will be in peril.

351
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,080
Did you go for a walk?

352
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,790
Yes, I felt a bit stuffy in here.

353
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,080
You must be.

354
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,850
Since you are confined in the palace all day.

355
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,040
There is no need to feel confined anymore.

356
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,160
Leave the palace.

357
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,140
I told you I will not leave.

358
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,120
Why?

359
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,930
I want to stay by your side.

360
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,210
I might be the evil spirit.

361
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,560
If you are, you would try to make me stay.

362
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,400
- How come?
- Because the evil spirit is the fake one.

363
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,360
His greed would best his morals.

364
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,580
His greed, huh?

365
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,230
Are you talking about his greed for wanting to have you by his side?

366
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,360
I would say it is closer to lust than greed.

367
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,170
Are you also being shaken by the evil spirit's lust?

368
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,000
- Are you that starved for affection?
- Your words are too much, Your Highness.

369
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:25,290
Leave at once. I do not wish to see you anymore.

370
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,480
I cannot do so.

371
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,270
I am a concubine who has been officially installed.

372
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,870
If you really want me to leave,

373
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,420
please kick me out harshly yourself.

374
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,130
I will keep an eye on you.

375
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:47,670
I will make sure to watch with my own eyes how you realize

376
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:52,210
what a trivial creature the evil spirit you have feelings for is.

377
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,510
In the mountains?

378
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,820
Yes.

379
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,140
I heard Consort Hyo spends all day in the mountains.

380
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:08,490
And she comes back around sunset with dirt all over her.

381
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,260
Why is she doing that?

382
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,360
Who knows?

383
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,910
They said the Crown Prince does not even head toward Consort Hyo's pavilion.

384
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,800
So she must be mad about that, right?

385
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,260
It must be to discipline her mind.

386
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,500
I am back, Your Highness-

387
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,490
Gosh, I said I will do it!

388
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,110
I am almost done.

389
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,050
Why did the Crown Princess want to see you?

390
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,900
Oh, well.

391
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:58,320
The Crown Princess told you not to go outside starting tomorrow.

392
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,080
She is worried something might happen to you.

393
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,870
Really?

394
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,780
- Are you going to boil this?
- Yes.

395
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,670
N-No, I will do it.

396
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,760
- What do you mean?
- Gosh, it is okay. I can do it-

397
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,130
You have dirt all over your hands, Your Highness!

398
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,210
Do I have to keep fanning?

399
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,570
Consort Hyo's pavilion reeked of medicinal herbs.

400
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,540
It must be the concoction for the Crown Prince.

401
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,010
That was why she was wandering in the mountains.

402
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,240
W-Whoa, what do I do?

403
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,470
Gosh, what is this?

404
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,390
W-What happened?

405
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,430
Y-Your Highness, this is bad!

406
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,860
The concoction was...

407
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,700
What about the concoction? Did it topple or something?

408
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,560
How did you know?

409
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,760
It cannot be helped.

410
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,640
It cannot be helped?

411
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,300
You went through so much to get those medicinal herbs!

412
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,630
These are what you are talking about.

413
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,300
Aigoo, I spent all night preparing them.

414
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,650
Your Highness, did you expect something like this to happen?

415
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,640
Hong Gun, can you deliver this to the Crown Prince?

416
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,320
- Consort Hyo did?
- Yes, Your Highness.

417
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:54,820
Crown Prince, I will be waiting for you in front of His Majesty's chamber.

418
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,890
You came for me.

419
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,710
When will you be leaving?

420
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,200
When will you kick me out?

421
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,410
I prepared a concoction for His Majesty.

422
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,520
I asked to see you to present it to him together.

423
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,970
You will help me gain His Majesty's favor with a mere medicine?

424
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,990
You are doing anything to catch my attention.

425
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,940
Did I really catch your attention at all?

426
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,760
I am glad, then.

427
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,110
I-I am sorry.

428
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,470
You were that child, huh?

429
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:12,590
Your Majesty, your body and mind will be at ease if you take this medicine.

430
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,970
Who knows if they will be at ease or

431
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,880
rest in peace forever inside the coffin?

432
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,340
Forgive me, but I will consume it first-

433
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,280
Consort Hyo obtained those herbs from wandering the rough mountains.

434
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,420
If you will not take it, I will take it instead.

435
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:52,840
You are a fool who is head over heels for Consort Hyo, huh?

436
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,690
I will soon be meeting my grandson.

437
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,150
Are you happy now?

438
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,870
He will soon be meeting his grandson?

439
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,520
Your Majesty, it is a bit uncomfortable, right?

440
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,730
I am at ease.

441
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,460
My headache is also gone, perhaps because of the medicine I just took.

442
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,650
I am glad.

443
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,540
Crown Prince.

444
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

445
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,780
Would it be okay if I call over Consort Hyo like this from time to time?

446
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,310
Just as my physician, that is.

447
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,790
Will you be okay?

448
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,200
How could I answer otherwise? Please call for me whenever, Your Majesty.

449
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,790
Consort Hyo is the boss of our Royal Family.

450
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,040
I make a request to the Crown Prince and

451
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,590
the Crown Prince makes a request to Consort Hyo.

452
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,260
So, that would make you the true boss, would it not?

453
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,790
I do not deserve your graceful compliment, Your Majesty.

454
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,240
By the way, Consort Hyo, you look familiar for some reason.

455
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,910
Is that so?

456
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,050
You seem to take after someone a lot.

457
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,100
Someone I know quite well.

458
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,250
Right.

459
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,890
It is that person.

460
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,750
That person I know very well.

461
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,310
My son!

462
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,990
They say a married couple resembles each other.

463
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,350
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is here.

464
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,030
Come in!

465
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,430
Your Majesty.

466
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,320
I must have interrupted a lovely time you were having.

467
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,800
I will come back later.

468
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,360
No need to come back. Just cut to the chase and leave.

469
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,070
The Minister of Hunting just notified me

470
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:29,370
that the northern borders' boars and wolves are headed to the capital.

471
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,040
But it is not time yet.

472
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,490
He said it happened due to a fire at Mt. Baekhwa on the northern border.

473
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,200
I am reporting because they will pass our capital's mountains by dawn tomorrow.

474
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,890
Really?

475
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,630
We need to go out to hunt, then!

476
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,300
Yes, I will make the preparations, Your Majesty.

477
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,980
You should also join us, Crown Prince.

478
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,950
You showed a great performance at the last hunt, too.

479
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,640
The Crown Prince can stay.

480
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,710
He does not even seem to be in his mad state.

481
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:02,740
- Yes, that will be for the better-
- I will be attending as well.

482
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,120
Crown Prince, please do not overexert yourself.

483
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,310
I am so thankful you care for me so dearly, Hyungnim.

484
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:16,860
I will try overexerting my half-witted self at the hunt again this time.

485
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,080
So please give me a hand.

486
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,660
W-Wait, that one stung a bit.

487
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,220
Gosh, I am sorry.

488
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,000
No, no, it is okay.

489
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,230
I told them not to let anyone in.

490
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,980
Why do you only practice indoors?

491
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,860
Now that you got complimented by His Majesty,

492
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,120
do my words sound like a joke to you?

493
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,770
I apologize.

494
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,750
I do not like hearing the slashing sound of the winds.

495
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,590
When I am outside, that sound is too clear.

496
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,720
The sound of the arrow ripping the wind apart.

497
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,850
What are you going to do about tomorrow's hunt, then?

498
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,260
Not sure. Perhaps the evil spirit will help me.

499
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:10,310
The wind is just a wind.

500
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,880
Wherever you are, try lingering around yourself and yourself only.

501
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,330
Do not avert and look straight on.

502
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:21,580
The sound of the wind ripping apart will disappear.

503
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,950
Is your mind a bit more at ease now?

504
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,790
When will you leave?

505
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:59,290
As long as you are here, my mind will always be disturbed.

506
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:24,270
I feel like I could fly since I am on the hunt with my son after such a long time.

507
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,640
I feel the same way, Your Majesty.

508
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,210
There is a red boar at the western boulder!

509
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,440
All right, let us go!

510
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,040
The wind is...

511
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,950
just a wind.

512
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,660
Wherever you are, try lingering around yourself and yourself only.

513
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,850
Do not avert and look straight on.

514
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,130
The sound of the wind ripping apart will disappear.

515
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,320
Stop, stop!

516
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,470
He is down.

517
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:21,250
The Crown Prince has hunted down the boar!

518
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,700
Do not do this, Grand Prince. Grand Prince!

519
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,240
The Crown Prince has finally succeeded, huh?

520
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,110
Where is it?

521
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,500
Your Majesty, it seems the Crown Prince was too startled.

522
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,840
Grand Prince Yoong hunted the boar. It was not me.

523
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,090
Your Majesty!

524
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:53,500
I only helped a little bit because the Crown Prince almost had it.

525
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,260
Your Majesty.

526
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,640
I will pierce your forehead next time

527
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,440
if you mock my son again.

528
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:29,220
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

529
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,530
Half-wit...

530
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:35,390
Just like you,

531
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,890
I am also ashamed of you.

532
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,160
You will have to lead Asatae after me.

533
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,020
But what the hell is all this!

534
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,630
You cannot. This one is for Mother.

535
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,310
I am going to give it to Mother!

536
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,770
More than three months passed since your mother died.

537
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,520
Yet you have not come to your senses!

538
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,040
It was supposed to be for Mother.

539
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,300
I was going to give it to her on her birthday.

540
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,430
Get off me!

541
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,140
I know why you ordered Mother to die by poison.

542
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:31,020
It is not because Mother envied Yoong hyung's mother.

543
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:31,910
What did you say?

544
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:35,260
It is because she always said the right things to you.

545
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,850
You could not endure Mother's honest opinions.

546
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,370
So you...

547
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,370
What about me?

548
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,840
Go on.

549
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,810
What about your father?

550
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:56,000
Go on and say it.

551
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,690
What about me? Huh?

552
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,800
Go on and say it before I rip your mouth apart.

553
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,740
- Say it!
- I am ashamed...

554
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,920
of you, Father.

555
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,390
All right, let us take a shot.

556
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,130
Gosh! Come on now!

557
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,180
Aigoo, seriously!

558
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,020
What are you doing here?

559
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,010
I was passing by, and the crepe myrtle flowers were too beautiful.

560
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,400
I did not know there were crepe myrtle trees here, too.

561
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,030
All right, then.

562
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,750
You can stay...

563
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,110
for a moment if you want.

564
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,130
Today is the date my mother passed away.

565
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,270
I did not know.

566
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,860
No one knows.

567
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,670
No one is supposed to remember.

568
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,290
You should not...

569
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,300
have done it.

570
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:48,280
You massacred General Yeon Poong Hak,

571
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,060
your best friend, and his family.

572
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,350
Including his young daughter, too.

573
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,190
Shut your mouth!

574
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:00,310
You wicked wench.

575
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,780
What are you all doing? Make her drink more of the poison!

576
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,030
M-Mother!

577
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,980
Mother!

578
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:21,490
Mother, Mother!

579
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:27,050
Mother, Mother!

580
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,100
Mother!

581
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,670
How was the hunt today?

582
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,370
Square one.

583
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,460
Everything is completely back to square one.

584
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,510
I guess the evil spirit did not help you.

585
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:33,260
The evil spirit is no more.

586
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:36,520
A shaman called Chung Ta sealed him away.

587
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,690
You do not have to believe me.

588
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,840
You can resent me.

589
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:48,090
Technically, it is my fault you ended up here.

590
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:52,210
The evil spirit inside my body had feelings for you

591
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,960
and made you live at the palace.

592
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:00,890
If what you said is true,

593
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,900
how could it be your fault?

594
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,410
Because the evil spirit possessed me due to my fault in the first place.

595
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,170
Because I am a half-wit.

596
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,050
I told you I only use the indoor archery field

597
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,660
because I hate to hear the sound of the wind slashing, right?

598
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,310
Whenever I hear that sound, I am reminded of that day.

599
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,260
That house I saw when I was young.

600
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,360
The site of the massacre.

601
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,840
The swords ripping through the air,

602
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,820
the screams,

603
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,740
and the dead bodies.

604
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:47,980
The young girl who was there.

605
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,580
I am sure she died.

606
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,880
I could not save her.

607
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,040
Just like how I could not save my mother.

608
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,590
Her eyes are still vivid in my mind.

609
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:10,280
Even more so when I hear the slashing of the wind.

610
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,060
That is why I was punished by the heavens.

611
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,810
That is why.

612
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:23,080
That is why an evil spirit possessed me.

613
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:29,590
This man remembers that day.

614
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,110
That day has become a deep wound for him, just like me.

615
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:45,510
♫ Because I was always here, and you were always there ♫

616
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:52,430
♫ Please take me anywhere, a place, go away ♫

617
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:06,200
♫ Please hold me so I do not waver, I am tired ♫

618
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:18,860
♫ Please hug me so I can relax ♫

619
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,900
♫ Because I was here ♫

620
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,230
Be careful, Your Majesty.

621
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,770
I will call over a court lady.

622
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,960
Forget it!

623
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,290
My Yoong is taking care of me so well,

624
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:32,580
so, who else would I need?

625
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,150
I do not know what to say, Your Majesty.

626
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:39,600
Now, then. This humble one will do it for you.

627
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,390
Yoong!

628
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

629
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:47,260
You are a really reliable fellow.

630
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,780
I am thankful.

631
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,350
Be satisfied with what you have now.

632
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,530
Pardon?

633
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,580
I am telling you not to overtake my son.

634
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,790
Your Majesty...

635
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:09,360
You know very well that my bastard children are all over this country.

636
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,550
A bastard child is only a bastard child.

637
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:15,470
Sajo Hyun, the heir, is my only real son.

638
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,350
You said we should have

639
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,300
been switched, did you not?

640
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,240
You said I should have been the heir.

641
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,630
That I should have been the crown prince. Did you not say so?

642
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,350
You mean, you actually believed that?

643
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:45,770
How could you not know I was only trying to provoke my son?

644
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,160
That is so unfair, Father.

645
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,960
How much more effort and hard work

646
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,950
must I display for you to consider me your son?

647
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,860
Poor thing.

648
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:09,540
Why do you keep pretending to forget the fact you and I both know?

649
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:16,380
You are not even my real son.

650
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,290
Did you think I did not know?

651
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:24,600
I took you in and made you a grand prince when you are not even my blood.

652
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:27,060
I believe I have done enough as well.

653
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,360
Do you not think so?

654
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,850
I must sleep now!

655
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:40,420
Consort Hyo takes such a good care of me,

656
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,700
so I get good sleep, and my mind is at ease.

657
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,450
I told His Majesty that Yoong is his son.

658
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:01,940
He took me while knowing you are my husband,

659
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,240
so he just went along with it.

660
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:07,680
Good job. That way, it is beneficial for all of us.

661
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,420
You became prettier since becoming a concubine.

662
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:16,070
Aigoo, what is with you?

663
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,850
What if Yoong sees us?

664
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,810
You said Yoong went to play by the stream.

665
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:22,370
Do not be like that and come over here.

666
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:28,780
Grow more mustache. You look just like Yoong.

667
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,950
Okay, I will.

668
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:30,530
Hold on a moment.

669
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,650
How could this be...

670
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,650
She is Ak Hee's woman.

671
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,340
But Ak Hee is gone now.

672
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,130
Consort Hyo, I gave it a lot of thought.

673
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:54,160
No matter what I think, kicking you out harshly is against the rules of the Inner Court.

674
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,180
If you wish, you may stay here.

675
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,200
Stay by my side, Consort Hyo.

676
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,490
- Stay by-
- Your Highness!

677
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:08,640
Her Highness the Crown Princess is here-

678
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:11,850
What is the matter, Crown Princess?

679
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:15,430
Your Highness, do you know Consort Hyo's true identity?

680
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:16,740
What identity?

681
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:21,510
I heard Consort Hyo is the only daughter of General Yeon Poong Hak, who was executed 10 years ago

682
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,450
for plotting a rebellion, Yeon Wol.

683
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,920
Wait, where did you hear such nonsense?

684
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:32,260
Consort Hyo is sure to possess this dagger.

685
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,990
Search Consort Hyo's pavilion right this moment

686
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:38,760
and interrogate her strictly.

687
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,730
Calm down first, Crown Princess.

688
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:42,470
I will take care of this matter.

689
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:44,690
So, keep quiet about it for now. I ask of you.

690
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:48,950
However, she might harm His Majesty in the meantime.

691
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,460
Where is Consort Hyo right now?

692
01:03:56,090 --> 01:04:00,640
Thanks to you, I sleep very well these days.

693
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,810
I do not even have nightmares.

694
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:05,150
I am glad, Your Majesty.

695
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:13,000
I do not even let the Royal Physician take care of me this comfortably.

696
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:21,800
Ak Hee is the only one who knows whether Consort Hyo is an assassin.

697
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:27,360
Ak Hee is the only one who knows what happened that day in His Majesty's bathroom.

698
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:33,970
Ak Hee, is that why you erased Consort Hyo's memories?

699
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:37,460
Did he know everything all along, then?

700
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,290
I am sorry.

701
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,020
I am sorry.

702
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:45,040
Your Highness, there is something I must tell you.

703
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:49,790
I will do as you said.

704
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:51,710
I will leave.

705
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,120
Leave?

706
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:00,230
You said you will stay in the palace until I kick you out.

707
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,400
I did.

708
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,190
However, there is something I told you way before that.

709
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:10,250
That I will leave once my memories come back.

710
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,840
My memories...

711
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:19,250
came back.

712
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:25,730
When did your memories come back?

713
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,630
Not too long ago.

714
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:32,460
You hid it even after your memories came back?

715
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,230
You knew who you are,

716
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,690
but you kept it hidden from me?

717
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,450
In that case,

718
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,840
were you not sincere that day?

719
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:57,210
That day was...

720
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:01,140
Is your name Yeon Wol?

721
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,300
Will you say you do not know that name?

722
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,950
Even after your memories came back?

723
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:12,410
Did you already know who I am?

724
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,380
Are you really...

725
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:19,240
an assassin who came in to kill His Majesty?

726
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,170
Tell me.

727
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,700
Right now.

728
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,620
Yes.

729
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:33,960
Did you also keep quiet about getting your memories back

730
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:38,000
for the purpose of killing His Majesty?

731
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,060
Tell me it is not true.

732
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,130
Say it is not true.

733
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,640
You deceived me.

734
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:03,320
But I showed my sincerity.

735
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,890
Why?

736
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,630
Why?

737
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,800
Your Highness!

738
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,080
Your Highness, there is a terrible incident.

739
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,540
His Majesty has...

740
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,350
His Majesty...

741
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,660
Your Majesty.

742
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,940
Father.

743
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,770
Father!

744
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,760
Father, Father.

745
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,280
Father! Father...

746
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:50,330
Father...

747
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,520
Father!

748
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:10,140
How...

749
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,850
How could you...

750
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,020
How could you!

751
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:22,230
I did not do it.

752
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:28,910
[Love Song for Illusion]

753
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:37,030
♫ Never lost, I will never lose you ♫

754
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:43,840
♫ Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self ♫

755
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:50,960
♫ Never lost, when this darkness ends ♫

756
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,390
I cannot...

757
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,380
I cannot ever forgive you.

758
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,760
Who could have killed the king?

759
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,180
- I do not fear dying.
- Your Majesty!

760
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,250
I am only sad you are mistaken about me.

761
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,230
Sajo Hyun, you will take your own life tonight.

762
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:10,090
The Crown Prince hung himself out of severe sadness.

763
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,180
Sajo Hyun!

764
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:15,380
The Crown Prince has ordered the execution of the guilty.

765
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:17,670
Father, Mother.

766
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:21,110
Your daughter is coming to meet you soon.
