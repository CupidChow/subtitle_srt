10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,180
Crown Prince, why did you not tell me?

11
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,640
You did not tell me, although I asked you so many times, but why-

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,780
Your Majesty, please. Please hear me out.

13
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,300
I will tell you my current condition, Your Majesty!

14
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,850
Halt.

15
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,350
Do you not hear the Crown Prince's order? Halt!

16
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,650
Crown Prince, what are you doing right now?

17
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,110
Your Majesty, Consort Hyo is indeed an assassin.

18
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,920
Since she was dressed as an assassin that day,

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,270
that woman would see her as an assassin. However,

20
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,080
I am the one who...

21
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,470
told her to dress up that way.

22
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,250
What did you say?

23
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,520
On the night of Your Majesty's birthday banquet, Consort Hyo and-

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,980
No.

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,290
Kyera, you are still here?

26
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,760
Her name before she became Consort Hyo was Kyera.

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,850
I had promised to spend a romantic time with Kyera outside the palace.

28
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,190
So, I told her to wear these clothes.

29
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,400
Does that mean you knew Consort Hyo from before?

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
That is correct.

31
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,890
It was my mistake that I thought Kyera was the dancer you chose that night.

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,780
What in the world.

33
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,480
I want to take the dancer you chose tonight, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,900
Is that why you were in such a hurry?

35
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,760
I apologize.

36
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,220
So, you were in a romantic relationship with her?

37
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,320
Is that true?

38
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,670
I asked if that was true!

39
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,360
That is true, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,770
I have...

41
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,640
a hobby of making clothes, as you know.

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,860
I acquainted Consort Hyo at the drapery outside the palace where I work from time to time.

43
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,610
That is the hand-drawn clothing design this woman requested from me long ago.

44
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,900
Write down what I say, Consort Hyo.

45
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,600
Do not make the chest too revealing.

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,580
Make the armhole wide enough for the shoulders to rotate freely.

47
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,520
Draw the clothing that fits the said requirements.

48
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,780
As you can see, you can tell they were written and drawn by the same person.

49
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,680
Also, this clothing is what I made according to the design.

50
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,430
As expected, your body remembers.

51
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,810
It is just as I had believed.

52
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,620
Kyera, what are you thinking?

53
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,270
What are you planning?

54
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,480
Hong Gun, I can walk alone. I'm okay.

55
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,970
It is fine, Your Highness.

56
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,980
You were scared earlier, right?

57
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,820
But I am glad the misunderstanding was cleared, thanks to the Crown Prince.

58
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,760
It is so gorgeous.

59
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,040
I cannot believe it was handmade by the Crown Prince.

60
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,090
Crepe myrtle flowers.

61
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,740
How pretty.

62
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,160
Oh, Eunuch Neung said

63
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,410
crepe myrtle flowers are the Crown Prince's favorite flowers.

64
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,780
Really?

65
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,320
Your Highness, what are you going to do?

66
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,930
Let me see.

67
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,290
Grand Prince.

68
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,600
I was on my way to see Mother, and I run into you like this, Your Highness Consort Hyo.

69
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,490
Let me congratulate you one more time on getting installed as Consort Hyo.

70
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,170
Thank you.

71
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,230
He is my bodyguard.

72
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,900
I see.

73
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,930
I am sure Kyera lost her memories.

74
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,800
Could it have been an accident or...

75
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,230
Who knows? It could be someone's trap.

76
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,860
There is no way.

77
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,370
Kyera would never go down that easily.

78
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,720
Could you not tell from seeing her?

79
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,680
This will not do. Since things ended up this way, I must make a move quickly.

80
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,650
What kind of move do you mean?

81
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,950
We will have to cut off the tail.

82
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,170
Before someone steps on it.

83
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,620
Why on Earth did you frame Consort Hyo?

84
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,850
What do you mean by frame?

85
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,990
They said this was found near Consort Hyo's pavilion.

86
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,260
So I was just worried for Your Majesty.

87
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,550
Who is it? Who instigated you?

88
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,460
Was it Yoong?

89
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,770
No! Why mention our Yoong?

90
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,270
Who was it, then?

91
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,320
Was it the Crown Princess?

92
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,720
Well, maybe.

93
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,480
Your Majesty, the Crown Princess has arrived.

94
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,730
Apparently, that dancer testified falsely because she was jealous of

95
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,380
Consort Hyo for being chosen by the Crown Prince.

96
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,840
I ordered her to be punished severely for lying under oath.

97
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,320
Great job, Crown Princess.

98
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,700
This must have also been done by those who envy Consort Hyo.

99
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,480
She is the Crown Prince's concubine and might even become the queen of Asatae. How dare they...

100
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,860
I am already anxious every day because of those who are after my life.

101
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,200
Hear ye! Bring the alcohol and the food quickly!

102
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,380
Bring in the amusement troupe, too!

103
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,060
Yes, Your Majesty!

104
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,640
Why would you do something like that?

105
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,050
Why? You did not even consult me.

106
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,210
I mean...

107
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,910
they said one of the dancers disappeared.

108
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,080
So, I thought it would be perfect to make it into an assassin incident.

109
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,220
If he is found to have kept quiet about the assassin incident,

110
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,920
the Crown Prince would be cornered.

111
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,610
And if they start saying things about his madness again,

112
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,250
it might even lead to the revocation of the Crown Prince.

113
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,010
Did you think such a big matter would be achieved so easily?

114
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,970
Is that why you were played by the Crown Princess again?

115
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,830
Crown Princess?

116
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,040
- That means, again-
- Yes.

117
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,560
The Crown Princess only tested you with a rotten bait,

118
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,970
which you went ahead and bit.

119
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,350
Gosh.

120
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,090
Geez...

121
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,310
Geum Hwa, that white fox!

122
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,670
Gosh, I hate her!

123
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,640
Crown Prince, I am really glad Consort Hyo's name was cleared.

124
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,140
I was so concerned.

125
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,930
It is all thanks to your wise efforts, Crown Prince.

126
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,050
Is that what you think?

127
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,780
Of course.

128
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,310
If you do,

129
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,240
why did you do it?

130
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,020
Did you think you could kick Consort Hyo out of the palace?

131
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,050
Your Highness, what do you mean?

132
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,910
The dancer you brought to interrogation grounds as a witness, Head Minister.

133
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,900
She is fake, is she not?

134
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,420
Crown Prince, that is utter nonsense.

135
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,670
I am sure it was for my sake.

136
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:33,090
Because neither of you would gain anything from cornering me.

137
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,930
Crown Prince, you misunderstood.

138
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,370
How could Father and I do such a thing?

139
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,600
The dancer from the birthday banquet...

140
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,240
I am the one keeping her safe.

141
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,090
Should I bring her here and check the facts?

142
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,260
The dancer His Majesty chose is being kept safe somewhere, right?

143
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,250
I am sorry to say, but that is what Ak Hee ordered.

144
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,910
Ak Hee is indeed quite clever.

145
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,420
I took such a measure in fear of unfortunate events like this one.

146
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,480
But why do bad feelings never prove to be otherwise?

147
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,100
His Majesty would not remember a lowly dancer's face.

148
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,570
And I am sure it was not hard to make the dancers

149
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,190
from the birthday banquet provide the same testimony.

150
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,990
Your Highness, Crown Princess is innocent.

151
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,330
It was all planned by this humble one.

152
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,430
Crown Prince, how distraught must I have been to do something like this?

153
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,210
I was just sad and sympathetic for my daughter

154
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,380
who gets ignored by her husband.

155
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,700
Please punish me as you see fit.

156
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,180
- I will accept anything you say.
- Father...

157
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,970
Crown Prince, it was just a misunderstanding.

158
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,570
That dancer envied Consort Hyo to lie under oath-

159
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,750
Goodness, Crown Princess...

160
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,720
you are really working too hard.

161
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,220
Punishment? There is no need.

162
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,340
I envy the Crown Princess.

163
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,240
For she has such an affectionate father.

164
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,710
Do not worry. I will keep quiet about this matter.

165
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,020
Still, it was quite fun, thanks to you two.

166
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:34,090
I was also able to check the ambitions of those in the western annex.

167
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,460
What is your identity?

168
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,620
That is what I want to know, too.

169
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,870
- You are a dancer?
- You said I am a dancer.

170
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,570
You fell for me while making my clothes, right?

171
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,940
Your Majesty, please. Please hear me out.

172
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,770
I will tell you my current condition, Your Majesty!

173
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,180
Who are you, really?

174
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,780
Why did you seduce Ak Hee, and why are you here?

175
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,510
Are you really an assassin?

176
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,970
Your Highness.

177
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,610
What brings you here?

178
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:42,740
♫ The feelings seeped through the hidden opening ♫

179
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,930
Hey, Sajo Hyun, take a shot.

180
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,610
Try killing my woman if you dare.

181
00:15:51,830 --> 00:16:01,270
♫ The feelings seeped through the fallen leaves ♫

182
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:10,730
♫ That's how the feelings are knocking at my heart ♫

183
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:20,140
♫ Fall more on this lotus tonight and shine on this night more ♫

184
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:30,050
♫ The dawn is lingering around my ears quietly, making me sad ♫

185
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,030
T-Take your leave.

186
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,520
Well. Thank you for what you did on the interrogation grounds.

187
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,380
I came to tell you this.

188
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,610
How arrogant.

189
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,350
You think I did it for Consort-

190
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,960
You think I did it for your sake?

191
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,470
I did it to prevent any unnecessary trouble within the palace.

192
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,560
But still, thank you.

193
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,750
Do not let me ever see you again.

194
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,610
I could not help but install you as my concubine.

195
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,860
But this is it for my good gesture.

196
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,840
Sajo Hyun, you are feeling sleepy right now.

197
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,220
You are very sleepy.

198
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,750
Your eyelids start feeling heavy.

199
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,250
You are falling asleep.

200
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,590
You are sleepy.

201
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,480
You are sleepy.

202
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,470
Gosh, why is this guy not sleeping?

203
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,920
Do not try anything funny, Ak Hee.

204
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,780
I will not lose to the likes of you.

205
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,400
Your Highness,

206
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,050
you need to get some rest.

207
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,250
You cannot avoid sleep for this long.

208
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,570
I will not fall asleep.

209
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,950
I will not let Ak Hee take over this body.

210
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,950
Aigoo, Your Highness...

211
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,030
If I am to live like this, I would rather...

212
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,770
I would rather...

213
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,460
You are...

214
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,730
You wench!

215
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,610
I will not forget this moment!

216
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,440
I will pay you back without fail!

217
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,160
I will also take away everything you have!

218
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,820
You wench, that is my seat. Move!

219
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,790
Do not come.

220
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,740
Do not come closer! Go away!

221
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,250
Your Majesty!

222
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,080
Your Majesty, I will bring the physician.

223
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,450
It is fine! Just bring some more alcohol.

224
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,030
What are you all doing? Hurry up and dance!

225
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,400
And play some music, too!

226
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,090
Hurry up and dance!

227
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,630
You wicked bastard!

228
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,960
You said nothing to me when you knew the Crown Prince hid the dancer?

229
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,980
How can you do this to me? How could you?

230
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,560
You will get hurt.

231
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,930
Ji Jeon Seo, whose side are you on? Huh?

232
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,470
I am the Crown Prince's man.

233
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,540
Traitor. I should not have placed you by the Crown Prince's side.

234
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,680
Please do not call me anymore.

235
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,310
Even if you do,

236
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,180
I will not come out.

237
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,710
Even if I die?

238
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,890
Get out of the palace quickly.

239
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,980
Your life is in danger.

240
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,300
We made this for you because you went through so much.

241
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,830
I do not know what to say...

242
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,440
You really went through a lot.

243
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,380
The Crown Prince said no one was to come inside.

244
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,920
Really?

245
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,310
Give it to me. That court lady will at least deliver it if you give it to her.

246
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,640
Absolutely do not let Consort Hyo in from now on.

247
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,620
Yes, Your Highness.

248
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,050
Your Highness.

249
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,830
You...

250
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,790
W-What-

251
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,720
I apologize. I was only going to leave the dye and go.

252
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,440
Open your eyes wide and watch.

253
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,500
This is the king's path!

254
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,560
Your Highness, did I startle you?

255
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,490
Your Highness, are you unwell?

256
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,790
I will call Eunuch Neung.

257
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,290
You...

258
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,230
Who are you?

259
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,690
You are an assassin, right?

260
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,060
How could I be? I am not.

261
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,900
I know you are an assassin.

262
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,770
Although I knew you were an assassin, I could not leave you to die.

263
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,530
Because...

264
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,130
of those eyes.

265
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,580
From the first moment I saw you,

266
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,340
why do you make me feel endlessly guilty?

267
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,220
Why do you make me feel unreasonably afraid?

268
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,840
Please do not be afraid.

269
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,300
I will be by your side.

270
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,130
You are the cause.

271
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,670
You are the cause!

272
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,670
I lost my way because of you.

273
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,510
My future became hopeless because of you.

274
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,790
Because of you, I was...

275
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,470
I-I am sorry.

276
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,230
Be gone.

277
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,510
Along with Ak Hee!

278
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,570
Stop right there, Sajo Hyun!

279
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,060
Eunuch Neung!

280
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,500
No!

281
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,080
- One moment.
- Let go!

282
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,830
Help me.

283
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,780
Let her go, Sajo Hyun.

284
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,070
You evil spirit, let go!

285
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,410
Let go!

286
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,450
Ak Hee, what is the meaning of this?

287
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,390
How dare you force your way out of my body?

288
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,910
Surprised?

289
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,230
You and I switch places only if one of us sleeps.

290
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,340
But I can still force my way out.

291
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,120
I did not know I was capable of such things.

292
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,830
What kind of nonsense is that?

293
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,820
Come on, you cannot win me in a fight.

294
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,620
You know it.

295
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,900
Your Highness.

296
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,070
Your Highness, brace your heart. I am right here.

297
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,870
Your Highness, this is Eunuch Neung!

298
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,660
What is the matter?

299
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,230
I am going in, Your Highness!

300
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,720
Eunuch Neung, hold on!

301
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,390
Your Highness.

302
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,280
Kyera.

303
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,230
His eyes look different.

304
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,880
Your Highness, Your Highness!

305
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,750
Your Highness!

306
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,790
What is the problem? Your Highness!

307
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,680
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

308
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,430
Your Highness!

309
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,540
He feels hot now.

310
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,910
He used to be ice cold.

311
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,590
But he is hot like fire now.

312
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,740
Your Highness, Your Highness-

313
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,730
Your Highness.

314
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,890
His pulse is normal.

315
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,910
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

316
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:07,940
His fever will come down since I gave him acupuncture.

317
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,410
But he is still hot.

318
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,560
It will go down in about an hour.

319
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:20,300
It is more of an internal problem, not an external one. Because his spirit is weak, is it not?

320
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,100
The Crown Prince has experienced some discouraging things.

321
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,230
Your Highness Consort Hyo, did you study medicine?

322
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,240
Well, that is not it.

323
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,120
It is because Consort Hyo is...

324
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,140
knowledgeable in many aspects.

325
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,720
She is like a walking library.

326
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,070
Your Highness, are you okay?

327
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,880
Your Highness.

328
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,740
What if I am not?

329
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,110
You even called the physician. How fussy are you?

330
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,440
Thank you. You may go now.

331
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,240
It is an honor.

332
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,670
Consort Hyo, you may go now as well.

333
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,740
I want to rest.

334
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,520
Your Highness, can I see you for a moment?

335
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,960
- I have something to ask.
- Well...

336
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,440
Could

337
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,860
could you ask me later?

338
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,710
Consort Hyo, I think you should do that.

339
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,340
Crown Prince, the Crown Princess has arrived.

340
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,230
Let her in.

341
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,940
Crown Prince!

342
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,070
I rushed over after hearing the physician was here.

343
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,280
Are you all right?

344
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,660
I am fine, as you can see.

345
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,030
I am glad. I was so scared.

346
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:57,480
Aigoo, Crown Princess, looks like you were very shocked.

347
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,020
How weird.

348
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,040
It felt like he had become a different person.

349
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:43,450
Gosh, she put so much effort into this.

350
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,150
"These are the dyes I made.

351
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,890
I hope you will like them.

352
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,340
- Also, thank you for-"
- Saving me.

353
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,200
I was so scared at the interrogation grounds,

354
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,890
but I was able to endure because you were there.

355
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,120
I will leave tonight.

356
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,640
No matter how much I think about it, I do not think I belong here.

357
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,030
Since you already permitted it, I will replace my farewell with this letter.

358
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,120
Thank you for everything.

359
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,850
Leave?

360
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,450
Sajo Hyun, who are you to tell her to leave?

361
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,960
My goodness.

362
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,650
What a headache.

363
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,430
Crown Prince.

364
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,170
Crown Prince!

365
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,640
Your Highness!

366
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,500
Are you sleeping?

367
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,580
Resting.

368
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,990
Aigoo, I see.

369
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,410
You can rest all you want, but you cannot sleep.

370
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,760
- You know, right?
- Yes, I know.

371
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,340
O-Oh, Ji Jeon and I will

372
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,910
go to Chung Ta and beg one more time.

373
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,750
For what?

374
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,310
For a way to get rid of Ak Hee, that scum for good!

375
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,720
What a scoundrel.

376
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,080
In my opinion, I think Chung Ta knows the method.

377
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,880
I see. I wish you luck.

378
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,500
Yes, Your Highness.

379
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,650
Just trust me, and rest assured.

380
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,690
Eunuch Neung, are you serious?

381
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,120
Sorry?

382
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,440
You dared to fool me and use sleeping incense

383
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,080
with Ji Jeon Seo as your accomplice?

384
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,790
Well, you complimented me back then-

385
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,030
Sir Ak Hee?

386
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,490
"Sir"? Not a scum, but "Sir"?

387
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,070
W-Why are you calling me "Sir"?

388
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,790
Just call me scum.

389
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,470
That is not it. My mouth is wretched.

390
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,290
Ji Jeon Seo, are you there?

391
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,110
Yes, Your Highness!

392
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,530
Eunuch Neung is demoted to the laundry starting today.

393
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,400
- Sorry?
- Your Highness,

394
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,300
a demotion to the laundry is unjust.

395
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,890
Oh, it is unjust, is it not?

396
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,760
It is unjust. We cannot very well have that.

397
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,790
Hear ye! Take this arrogant and disloyal Ji Jeon Seo to prison right now!

398
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,010
Ji Jeon.

399
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,450
I am going that way.

400
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,070
I wish you...

401
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,350
good health, Eunuch Neung.

402
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,880
What do we do about His Highness now?

403
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,970
I know...

404
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,060
Do not skip your meals!

405
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,120
I will come and visit!

406
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,910
- Your Highness.
- What is this?

407
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,530
You are leaving?

408
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,870
Does that mean this is a farewell gift?

409
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,220
Huh?

410
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,440
I will be seriously upset.

411
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,840
You even saw me faint earlier.

412
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,130
But leaving is all you can think of?

413
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,190
Oh, are you okay?

414
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,520
No, I am not okay.

415
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,700
Because...

416
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,970
all of this stemmed from here.

417
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,200
You heard the rumors, right? About my madness.

418
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,840
I do not know the cause,

419
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,270
but I think it is because your heart is suffering.

420
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,840
It could also be because of a bad memory.

421
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,020
A bad memory?

422
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,440
What is this? Does she feel sorry for Sajo Hyun?

423
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,240
Did they become close already?

424
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,480
What do I do?

425
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,690
She must have been so scared.

426
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,230
Why am I worried about Consort Hyo?

427
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,270
She is Ak Hee's woman.

428
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,890
To be honest with you,

429
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,320
there is an evil spirit inside my body.

430
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,240
- An evil spirit?
- Yes.

431
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,890
I have quite the wicked one.

432
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,410
I am sure Ak Hee, this bastard,

433
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,910
is planning something right now.

434
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,830
It was soon after His Majesty took the throne.

435
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,520
Go away! Go away!

436
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,510
An evil spirit entered my body one day and

437
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,500
I have been sharing my body with the evil spirit since then.

438
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,750
Is such a thing really possible?

439
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,410
I cannot believe it.

440
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,390
It surely is unbelievable.

441
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,990
That is why I was mean to you sometimes as if I were a different person.

442
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,770
I see.

443
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:33,150
Then the one who was mean to me is the evil spirit?

444
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,900
However...

445
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,170
why did I not dislike...

446
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,820
H-However?

447
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,320
Never mind.

448
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,740
I am going to get rid of the evil spirit now.

449
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,710
How?

450
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,720
You could not get rid of him until now.

451
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,430
I can get rid of him now.

452
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,610
As long as you are by my side,

453
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,930
I think I can ward off the evil spirit somehow.

454
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,530
Will you help?

455
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,760
Thank you.

456
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,940
Crown Prince, are you unwell?

457
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,230
That man is an evil spirit?

458
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,230
Who is it?

459
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,200
Do not turn around.

460
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,440
Do you not remember my voice?

461
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,160
Are you the one who threw a letter into my room a few days ago?

462
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,330
Yes.

463
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,190
Who am I?

464
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,300
Realizing it will bring you pain.

465
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,000
Tell me.

466
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,450
Kyera, come with me.

467
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,760
Why would I trust you?

468
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,220
Trust me. Let us go.

469
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,860
I do not trust anyone.

470
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,470
Until your memories come back.

471
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,850
Consort Hyo?

472
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,940
Be careful. Someone will come to kill you.

473
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,860
You forgot this.

474
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,510
Must be because it would be a waste to get dirty blood on it.

475
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,990
Consort Hyo, when did you come out?

476
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:22,220
I-I just had a short walk.

477
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,970
Kyera, you will need this when your memories come back.

478
00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:00,050
Ak Hee, what did you do this time?

479
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,740
I did not do anything yet.

480
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,720
Is Consort Hyo...

481
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,970
Is she doing okay?

482
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,340
Of course, she is.

483
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,510
She was very glad to see me.

484
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,470
Because I am not mean.

485
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,700
Well, I guess she was talking about you.

486
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,950
No, wait a moment. Are you...

487
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,010
Are you worried about my woman right now?

488
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,700
Worried?

489
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,920
- You think I am like you?
- That is right!

490
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,070
You are not me.

491
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,740
Kyera is not your woman, either.

492
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,240
And this body will not be yours anymore.

493
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,290
Ak Hee, what are you planning this time?

494
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,210
Guess what I am planning.

495
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,250
Ak Hee.

496
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,680
Ak Hee!

497
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,020
I am going to take everything.

498
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,580
Sajo Hyun,

499
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,250
you are...

500
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,660
going to be gone now.

501
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,290
Aigoo, the dirt won't come out if you do it like this.

502
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,140
Thank you.

503
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:53,630
C-Consort Hyo-

504
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,180
I borrowed it from Hong Gun.

505
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,060
Why did you get transferred to work here?

506
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,230
I was so surprised after hearing it from Hong Gun.

507
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,780
Aigoo.

508
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,570
Could it be the evil spirit's doing?

509
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,940
You know?

510
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,720
I heard from the Crown Prince last night.

511
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,430
Last night?

512
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,710
That man is not the Crown Prince!

513
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,080
He is the evil spirit! Oh, my.

514
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:32,440
Sorry? The current Crown Prince is an evil spirit?

515
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,000
Oh, my.

516
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,480
You cannot believe it, right?

517
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,630
You do not believe me, huh.

518
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,920
Are you also an evil spirit, Eunuch Neung?

519
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,310
You are with him, right?

520
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,600
Aigoo, I-I am sorry.

521
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,460
Gosh, I do not know who to trust.

522
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,350
I do not even know if what the Crown Prince said about the evil spirit is true.

523
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,820
I understand you, Your Highness.

524
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,110
Ji Jeon and I also took a long time to understand this.

525
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:06,600
Your Highness Consort Hyo, please help us.

526
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,380
Including Ji Jeon, all our hands are tied.

527
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,810
I am so anxious that I could die.

528
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:19,460
E.C.

529
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:22,290
Eating Chung Ta.

530
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,430
Yes?

531
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,990
Yes!

532
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,440
Yes!

533
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,260
Who is-

534
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,950
O-Oh, my, A-Ak Hee!

535
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,680
What brings you here?

536
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,460
Back to original form.

537
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,650
This is my original form-

538
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,920
Easy now.

539
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,370
Seriously? You put me to sleep?

540
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:54,360
No, the thing is, Eunuch Neung and Ji Jeon Seo bothered me so much.

541
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,280
They were harassing me every day.

542
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,230
So, it was just a small amount of sleeping incense.

543
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,760
It was also the lowest quality, on top of that.

544
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,540
I did not know you could put someone to sleep with that.

545
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,400
- You were bad, right?
- I was bad.

546
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,600
- You should recover your credibility, right?
- I will.

547
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:20,230
Let us lock him up. Sajo Hyun.

548
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,000
Wait, lock him up?

549
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:31,000
Bonghamsal. Let us lock up Sajo Hyun.

550
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,350
Okay?

551
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:38,210
Wait, I cannot do it.

552
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:42,790
You cannot do it? You cannot?

553
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:46,630
In that case, should I tell everyone you sell sleeping incense,

554
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,810
including your leader?

555
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:52,150
You cannot even do business here, then.

556
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,620
Aigoo, seriously.

557
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,280
Gosh.

558
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,630
Bonghamsal is...

559
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:24,930
where you crash an evil spirit with divine power

560
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,390
to seal him away.

561
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,580
Evil spirit.

562
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,300
N-No.

563
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,690
However, the Crown Prince Sajo Hyun is not

564
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:38,690
technically an evil spirit-

565
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,320
Just do it and lock him up!

566
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,550
Just do it?

567
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,820
What do you need for the preparation, huh?

568
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,880
Hurry up and get Sajo Hyun locked up.

569
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,060
I am exhausted right now.

570
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,030
In that case,

571
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:56,630
prepare an object that harbors the Crown Prince Sajo Hyun's energy

572
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,440
and then,

573
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,740
write his name here...

574
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,900
and then call for me.

575
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,840
Got it.

576
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,240
- Come tonight.
- Tonight is too soon.

577
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,800
I have a lot of things to prepare, too.

578
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,130
- And I also have to take a bath to relax-
- Tonight, it is.

579
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,630
T-Tonight- Yes. Got it.

580
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,610
However!

581
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,400
Until bonghamsal is complete,

582
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,380
you absolutely cannot meet Her Highness Consort Hyo.

583
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,460
Why?

584
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,280
If personal feelings of love seep into you,

585
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,970
your energy will weaken.

586
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:46,270
If you want to crash the Crown Prince Sajo Hyun with bonghamsal,

587
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:50,010
you have to save your power.

588
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,810
It cannot be helped.

589
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,930
I will have to endure.

590
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,990
If you go straight past the bamboo forest,

591
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:48,730
this is where Shaman Chung Ta lives.

592
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,970
If you go here and beg, we might be able to get help.

593
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,820
Please beg her to save the Crown Prince.

594
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,920
Okay.

595
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,400
By the way, Ak Hee might have gone there, too.

596
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,240
The evil spirit.

597
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,350
The evil spirit's name is Ak Hee?

598
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,810
So annoying!

599
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,240
Did you forget something?

600
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,440
Seriously!

601
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,980
What is this? Seriously.

602
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:46,160
How do you do?

603
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,910
Who are you?

604
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,270
I am Consort-

605
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:56,630
These eyes are of one who lost her memories from breathing in too much sleeping incense.

606
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,240
She is afraid of me.

607
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,930
- A-Aigoo!
- W-Wait-

608
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,460
Excuse me, Chung Ta!

609
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,860
I am Consort Hyo, the Crown Prince's concubine, for now.

610
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,650
I knew this would happen! I knew it!

611
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:13,240
I am losing it! Seriously!

612
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,440
I heard from Eunuch Neung before coming

613
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,200
that you can help us, Chung Ta.

614
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,640
Chung Ta!

615
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,340
I do not know anything.

616
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,190
I know nothing.

617
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:27,130
Why are you asking me about your memory loss?

618
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:30,240
She knows I lost my memories?

619
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,580
Go away, g-go!

620
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,040
No sound.

621
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,160
Did she leave?

622
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,770
She left.

623
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,880
Chung Ta, please help me out.

624
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,620
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

625
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,200
Since you know about my memory loss,

626
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,990
- it means you are linked to it or-
- Nothing.

627
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:12,130
I have nothing to do with it, nothing at all.

628
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:18,020
Or it means you can help me to get my memories back.

629
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:28,870
Chung Ta, I feel really hopeless right now.

630
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,300
Inside my head is a complete blank,

631
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:37,770
but my feelings keep growing deeper for something without a plan.

632
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:43,270
Well, that is what people usually call love.

633
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,730
No, there is no way.

634
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:49,440
There is always a way.

635
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:55,500
I feel like there is an absurd reason why my memories are gone and

636
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,270
because I feel like I will face the truth

637
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:01,480
I cannot handle if my memories come back one day...

638
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,230
I live each and every day in fear.

639
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,830
Please help me out, Chung Ta. Please?

640
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:25,160
My goodness.

641
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:36,010
Right, he liked to wear this thing a lot.

642
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:39,510
D-Do you put it on like this?

643
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,920
Gosh, what a taste.

644
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:03,080
Sajo Hyun.

645
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,030
A great calligrapher.

646
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,360
There you go.

647
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,910
Sajo Hyun, sorry.

648
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:33,780
Gosh, why is Chung Ta not coming?

649
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,410
I am so sleepy.

650
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:38,750
Your Highness, Your Highness!

651
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,820
Hey, Chung-

652
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,520
Your Highness, C-Consort Hyo is coming.

653
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,950
What?

654
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,950
Until bonghamsal is complete,

655
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:53,310
you absolutely cannot meet Her Highness Consort Hyo.

656
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,650
She told me not to meet her.

657
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,910
Your Highness!

658
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,870
Your Highness! Your Highness Crown Prince!

659
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:06,160
Y-Your Highness Consort Hyo!

660
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,760
Your Highness Consort Hyo! Y-Your Highness-

661
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,690
Y-Your Highness Consort Hyo!

662
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,340
The Crown Prince has a business to take care of, so he cannot meet you.

663
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,820
Again? He said the same thing earlier.

664
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,410
The Crown Prince is avoiding me, right?

665
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:32,370
I need to see him to confirm

666
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,790
whether he is the evil spirit or not.

667
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,080
Gosh, Chung Ta sounded like he was going to help!

668
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,920
Go back to the palace for now.

669
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,830
Y-You are going to help me, right?

670
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,570
W-Wait, Chung Ta.

671
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:01,810
I will give it some thought.

672
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:05,450
Should I have begged more?

673
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,630
Chung Ta?

674
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,440
Are you here?

675
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:48,760
Be careful. Someone will come to kill you.

676
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,630
Who are you?

677
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,230
Yes, there you go.

678
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,420
I hope the medicine works well for her.

679
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,570
Well, I guess it will.

680
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,770
Gosh, he is so heavy!

681
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,140
Right, he cannot.

682
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:33,300
Damn it. You lost your touch, Chung Ta!

683
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,100
Your Highness!

684
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:52,300
Your Highness, Shaman Chung Ta has arrived at the Hall of Spirits.

685
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,300
This is Sajo Hyun's favorite ornament and the paper with his name on it.

686
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,600
[Sajo Hyun]

687
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:16,820
Yes.

688
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:20,800
Let me tell you one more time.

689
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:26,420
After bonghamsal is done, you might also suffer from bad side effects.

690
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:29,150
Including losing your strength suddenly,

691
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:35,570
you might also feel extreme pain that feels like being poked with a needle day and night.

692
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:39,650
Or, like a senile old man, you might eat a lot-

693
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,540
Gosh, that is fine.

694
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:46,480
Anyhow, Sajo Hyun will never be able to come out of this body once bonghamsal is done, right?

695
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,070
- You are sure, right?
- Yes.

696
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,690
Great. Begin.

697
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,850
Well, what do I do?

698
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,700
Oh, yes. I will begin.

699
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,200
First, put your hands together.

700
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:04,170
Get on your knees.

701
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:07,540
Kneel down.

702
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:16,780
You are showing your respect for the gods who rule the universe.

703
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,840
Straighten your body and mind.

704
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,200
There must not be any talking.

705
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,090
Now.

706
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,640
[Sajo Hyun]

707
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,460
Water...

708
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,630
Get it together, Yeon Wol!

709
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,130
I do not trust anyone.

710
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:48,070
Not until your memories come back.

711
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,210
Master Yang.

712
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:55,810
What am I doing right now?

713
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:01,790
Sajo Seung is the last person who would do that.

714
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:06,940
Burn down everything that belongs to the damned Royal Family of Yeon!

715
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,970
Father...

716
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:16,720
Mother...

717
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:22,380
Sajo Seung, I have been waiting for this day.

718
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,570
You are not fit to be an assassin.

719
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,890
Who are you?

720
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,950
I am your man.

721
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,610
My memories...

722
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,910
came back.

723
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:56,880
Are you the one who erased my memories?

724
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:15,680
You knew I would come.

725
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,400
How?

726
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:19,900
Consort Hyo.

727
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,870
Crown Prince.

728
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:46,870
I was worried because you avoided me earlier.

729
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,080
I had my reasons.

730
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,430
I am sorry.

731
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:00,020
Not at all.

732
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:16,180
Did you make me lose my memories?

733
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:18,170
Why?

734
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:20,360
Why?

735
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:35,650
[Love Song for Illusion]

736
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:43,710
♫ Never lost, I will never lose you ♫

737
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:50,600
♫ Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self ♫

738
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:58,130
♫ Never lost, when this darkness ends ♫

739
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:01,750
Kyera, pull yourself together.

740
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:05,600
Who do you think is standing in front of you, Consort Hyo?

741
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,920
No one can escape bonghamsal once they are locked up.

742
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,370
I knew you seemed familiar.

743
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:14,180
I could not save her.

744
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:17,030
Her eyes are still vivid in my mind.

745
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:21,370
My memories came back.

746
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,450
Search Consort Hyo's pavilion right this moment!

747
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,710
She looks a lot like somebody.

748
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:29,270
Right, I remember now.
