You were alive.

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,080
Thank you for staying alive.

You were alive.

00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,600
Thank you.

13
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,200
Precious lives were lost because of me.

14
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,340
All of them could have been saved.

15
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,820
But because of their half-witted king...

16
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,380
It is not your fault, Your Majesty.

17

You did your best.

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,700
No.

Well done.

34
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,320
I will order them to be taken care of until they can return home.

35
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,880
What will you do with the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong?

36
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,100
He will feign ignorance for sure.

37
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,470
I am sure he will.

38
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,870
It is only right to interrogate him and punish him.

39
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,350
But I will watch closely for a while and look for an opportunity.

40
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,390
It must be because he is closely related to Jinhoi.

41
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,750
Border disputes with Jinhoi are frequent as of now.

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,070
So, the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong will surely use it to his advantage.

43
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,590
Did the Defense Minister depart?

44
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,630
Yes, he departed in a hurry.

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,860
You will be with the Wind Knife now, right?

46
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,810
Yes, I will be at a distance where you can call for me.

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,410

You are less than a bug!

85
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:50,820
You did not notice anything until Sajo Hyun arrived at the port with the Royal Guards?

86
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,370
Are your eyes and ears of no use?

87
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,010
Please have us killed, Grand Prince!

88
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,190
Please have us killed!

89
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,700
Sure.

Yes, Grand Prince.

Follow me!

98
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,930
You, scoundrels, confess the truth!

99
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,400
How could we have sold off the amusement troupe's women?

100
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,500
I have never heard of this!

101
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,860
Everyone, beat them until they confess the truth!

102
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,410
Yes!

103
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,200
All hail His Majesty!

104
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,440
Have you arrived, Your Majesty?

105
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,880
What is the meaning of all this?

106
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,970
I am quite sorry to inform you,

107
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,110
but I found out they sold the amusement troupe's women to Jinhoi.

108
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,250
Hence, I arrested all the relevant individuals for interrogation.

109
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,620
These men are innocent.

110
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,800
You also know well who led the trafficking of our women. Do you not, Grand Prince?

111
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,070
Who might this person be?

112
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,360
Halt the interrogations right away and let these men go!

113
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,310
Do you not hear the king's order?

114
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,100
Will you come to your senses only after getting the same beating?

115
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,220
Hurry up and release them!

116
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,400
In that case,

117
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,790
are you saying you have nothing to do with this incident, Grand Prince?

118
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,770
I apologize, Your Majesty.

119
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,140
My crime for not having realized until matters got this bad does deserve death,

120
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,990
but I did not partake in selling those women off to Jinhoi.

121
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,610
Grand Prince,

122
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,870
you are seriously shameless.

123
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,900
How can you get rid of the evidence like this and

124
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,210
lie even in front of me?

125
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,990
Could you be...

126
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,330
talking about what the late king did?

127
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:07,370
Yes, I could not help but partake in that matter.

128
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:14,300
You also know how I had to take all the blame for the late king's wrongdoings.

129
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,510
- Grand Prince Sajo Yoong-
- Your Majesty.

130
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:22,500
If you continue to mention this matter, you are insulting the late king and

131
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,420
only amplify the hatred of the people, in my opinion.

132
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:33,610
Not to mention, the people are feeling unsettled because of a wicked rumor about you currently.

133
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,550
A rumor?

134
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,250
Are you talking about this?

135
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,850
[The haunted King will be the doom of Asatae.]

136
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,320
You ended up seeing it, too, Your Majesty.

137
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,420
Gosh, what kind of a wicked person could have done this?

138
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,180
It is a seriously big trouble, Your Majesty.

139
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,600
That is right.

140
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,950
This is a really big trouble.

141
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,480
Because there is a fool who think the people can be swayed by something like this.

142
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,960
I will revoke your right to interrogate from this moment.

143
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,530
Take your hands off of all matters you are involved in.

144
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,060
Why are you giving me such orders, Your Majesty?

145
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,450
I cannot entrust the government matters to a delusional liar.

146
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,650
This is unfair, Your Majesty!

147
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,860
Unfair, you say?

148
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:38,630
What is truly unfair are the innocent people who lost their lives at the port.

149
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,460
Sajo Yoong.

150
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,150
How do you plan to pay for all those sins in the future?

151
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,290
Your Majesty.

152
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,150
I will help you lose all interest in gambling!

153
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,650
Leave your right hand and get lost!

154
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,760
No, no- Please, please!

155
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,400
H-Hold on.

156
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,200
T-Take this hand instead.

157
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,510
Because you cannot gamble without this hand?

158
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,560
That will not work, you idiot!

159
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,260
Clench your teeth tight!

160
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,220
Will this be enough?

161
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,670
How can I ever repay you for this?

162
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,710
T-Though I look like this, I am quite good with my hands.

163
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,400
Please tell me if your roof or chimney ever needs a repair.

164
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,910
I will come right away and-

165
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,260
Huh?

166
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,930
Your son told me to deliver it to you.

167
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,380
My Yoong did?

168
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,050
Yes.

169
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,020
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong did.

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,020
His Majesty ordered you not to enter, Grand Prince.

171
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,340
Please wait here.

172
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,910
Move aside.

173
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,510
I apologize.

174
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,820
I know yesterday's atrocity stemmed from the late king's wrongful judgment.

175
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,410
As the late king's son,

176
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,260
I strongly feel the responsibility.

177
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,120
I will cooperate as well so such an incident will never happen again.

178
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,660
So I hope our ministers will also work together.

179
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,220
Your order has been heard, Your Majesty.

180
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,670
In addition,

181
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,030
starting today, the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong has been

182
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,660
resigned from public office.

183
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,590
If there is any minister who made secret dealings with the Grand Prince,

184
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,860
he will surely know the reason.

185
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,660
Once all the truths are uncovered,

186
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,270
I will also rebuke any ministers who are linked.

187
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:15,280
However, if you regret your wrongdoings now and cooperate with me,

188
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,070
I will lighten your sentence, so give it some thought.

189
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,300
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty!

190
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,040
Go on and tell me.

191
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,390
Is the one on the throne really Sajo Hyun?

192
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,580
He is Sajo Hyun.

193
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,010
No, no, there is no way.

194
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,370
Sajo Hyun, the half-wit, cannot be that confident!

195
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,970
But I am sure he is!

196
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,920
Summon the evil spirit right now.

197
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,150
Get rid of Sajo Hyun.

198
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,550
If you cannot do so,

199
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,110
I will shove this down your throat.

200
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,760
Stop!

201
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,850
After that day from 10 years ago,

202
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,490
I was able to feel the sound of the wind.

203
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,060
Is it a gift the pain gave me?

204
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,410
I can feel the wind.

205
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,900
The trapped wind that stayed in an empty space.

206
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,290
Break this wall down.

207
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

208
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,430
There is space inside.

209
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,380
You are coming to the Palace tomorrow?

210
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,800
His Majesty invited me.

211
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,590
He told me to come right away.

212
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,410
But I said I will come tomorrow because I am tired today.

213
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,920
Prince Ga Ron, there is a trust you and I have built so far.

214
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,680
You accepted His Majesty's invitation without even consulting me?

215
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,400
How can I reject an invitation from Asatae's emperor?

216
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,280
Do you not know the relationship between Sajo Hyun and me?

217
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,150
But how could you?

218
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,950
If it is trust you want to build,

219
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,610
you can find me this woman.

220
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,190
Kyera.

221
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,760
I fell for her at first sight.

222
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,490
I just could not forget her, so I told a painter to draw her face.

223
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:37,000
Judging by her beauty, she might have been in the amusement troupe.

224
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,760
Kyera, you even approached Prince Ga Ron?

225
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,370
Find Kyera quickly.

226
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,080
Yes, Grand Prince.

227
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,560
Looks like Hwang Ga Ron is looking for you.

228
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
So, what happened?

229
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,500
I only gave him an unforgettable memory.

230
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,330
I know what you are thinking.

231
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,310
You must not do that.

232
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,820
If you want to catch the tiger, you have to run into its den.

233
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,490
Please allow me, Master Yang.

234
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,030
Kyera.

235
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,070
Gosh, seriously.

236
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,640
The haunted King will

237
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,200
be the doom of Asatae!

238
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,570
It is a big problem these rumors keep circulating.

239
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,430
I thought it was only a rumor,

240
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,840
but it was true.

241
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,460
You had confirmed it?

242
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,100
Yes.

243
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,600
I saw and heard it with my own eyes and ears.

244
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,770
By the way, Your Majesty,

245
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,240
you kind of seem quite different today.

246
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,320
Ak Hee told you to leave, right?

247
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,460
Because he cannot stand us loving each other.

248
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,750
Were you aware of this already?

249
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,670
Wait, Sir Ak Hee, when did you come out?

250
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,580
Surprised?

251
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,720
Because Sajo Hyun and I switched in broad daylight?

252
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,530
Oh, my goodness.

253
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,410
This is because His Highness took cold medicine just now.

254
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,010
So, you should not have given him cold medicine.

255
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,070
Sajo Hyun fell asleep after taking it,

256
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,200
so I came out again.

257
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,730
You have been wanting to come out in the morning, right?

258
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,050
Idiot, we switch whenever one sleeps.

259
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,900
Also,

260
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,310
stop bringing these things!

261
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,320
I said I am different from Sajo Hyun, the half-wit!

262
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,000
Aigoo, please calm down!

263
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,770
Someone will see you!

264
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,220
S-Sir Ak Hee!

265
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:07,290
Are you saying you already knew about it for a long time, Father?

266
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,320
And you still married me to His Majesty?

267
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,940
To a man possessed by an evil spirit?

268
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,410
Did you forget?

269
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,690
It was what you wanted, Your Majesty.

270
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,180
You said you want to become the most powerful woman in Asatae.

271
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,730
You said you do not fear anything to achieve that purpose.

272
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,750
Was it just to let me achieve my ambition?

273
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,930
Was it not because of your greed, Father?

274
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,540
Should I have left you be?

275
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,850
Should I have let you fool around with Ji Jeon Seo, who became our servant

276
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,160
after wandering as a homeless?

277
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,530
Do you see me as such a person?

278
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,680
I am Jin Chae Ryeon, Father.

279
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,360
I am not swayed by mere emotions.

280
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,610
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

281
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,190
If you can really do anything,

282
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:06,420
how are you still unable to win over His Majesty?

283
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,400
Do you really not know you have become a mockery for women inside the Palace

284
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,940
after failing to sleep with him last time?

285
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,120
How impertinent, Head Minister!

286
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,870
How dare you speak that way-

287
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:26,210
This humble one made you the queen, did I not?

288
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:32,290
You should also repay your father, Queen.

289
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,960
Hurry up and give birth to a son.

290
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,780
That is our only way to survive.

291
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,810
If something happens to His Majesty before you bear his child,

292
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:58,540
you will also not escape the fate similar to that of the

293
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,320
forgotten Consort Cheong Myeong.

294
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,100
Your Majesty.

295
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,720
You said you would not come even if I called for you again.

296
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
But you do come.

297
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,790
Please go back to the Palace.

298
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,740
I will escort you.

299
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,750
Ji Jeon Seo.

300
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,120
I need you to help me out.

301
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,390
Is something wrong?

302
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,350
Help me bear a child.

303
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,640
Y-Your Majesty, how can you say such-

304
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,940
I will take my leave first.

305
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,740
I am going to scream.

306
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,340
The moment you leave this room,

307
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,080
I will say you called me out and tried to rape me.

308
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,330
Do as you please.

309
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,800
I would rather die an unfair death than follow your order.

310
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,990
I apologize, Your Majesty.

311
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,040
Ji Jeon Seo!

312
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,880
Please help me out.

313
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,710
You said you can do anything if it is for my sake.

314
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,240
Please.

315
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,410
Do not do this, My Lady.

316
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:49,820
I cannot bear to watch you end up in misery.

317
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,330
I apologize.

318
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,420
No, do not do it.

319
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,330
Do not do this.

320
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,400
I will leave.

321
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,660
Hey, Chung Ta, you can do something like this, too?

322
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,240
Aigoo, this is tiring.

323
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,390
I used my last resort.

324
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,940
How bad must it be for me to come in like this?

325
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,760
Sir Ak Hee.

326
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,510
Can you see the full moon over there?

327
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,850
Ten years ago, when you possessed the Crown Prince Sajo Hyun,

328
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,570
that same moon was there.

329
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,960
If we do bonghamsal today,

330
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,460
we can seal His Majesty for good, forever.

331
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,710
You never had feelings for me

332
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,100
as your lover?

333
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,230
Right?

334
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,110
I am sorry.

335
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,250
Forget it. I am not doing it.

336
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,030
Come on, Sir Ak Hee.

337
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,310
Look at your body.

338
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,530
It is fading away, right?

339
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:37,040
At this rate, you will disappear completely in the end.

340
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,420
And I will disappear, too, on top of that.

341
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,730
I am not doing it.

342
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,420
Let us just disappear, okay?

343
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,070
Hand in hand, let us disappear together.

344
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,610
We need to survive together.

345
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,800
Right.

346
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,200
You know, yesterday, Kyera was in a really dangerous situation.

347
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
So I tried to force my way out to save her.

348
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,390
But why could I not go out?

349
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,480
It worked last time, right?

350
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,410
Do you really not know the reason?

351
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,060
It is because His Majesty's energy strengthened!

352
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:22,070
So, you cannot even force your way out anymore.

353
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,750
Oh, is that so?

354
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,920
I guess this is it for me, huh?

355
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,960
Let us go.

356
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,730
I will do bonghamsal for you.

357
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,100
- I am not doing it.
- Let us do it.

358
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,600
I am not! I said I am not doing it!

359
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,280
My goodness.

360
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,480
I will wait at the Hall of Spirits.

361
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,850
I trust you will come out.

362
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,400
Precious lives were lost because of me.

363
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,880
All of them could have been saved.

364
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,310
But because of their half-witted king...

365
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,490
How painful must it be for him?

366
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:54,200
♫ I will come and meet you ♫

367
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,040
♫ I will come to you where you are breathing ♫

368
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,620
Your Majesty.

369
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,700
♫ When I am reminded of you in my white dream ♫

370
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,580
Your Majesty, I just miss you for no reason tonight.

371
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Even though I know I cannot meet you just because I go there running,

372
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,600
I just want to be near where you are for a moment.

373
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,260
For no reason. Nothing at all.

374
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,290
Yeon Wol.

375
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,870
How did you c-come here?

376
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,610
I missed you too much.

377
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,760
I just came without a second thought.

378
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,420
I also missed you too much,

379
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,080
so I just came outside without a second thought.

380
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,150
Yeon Wol.

381
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,700
Your Majesty.

382
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,210
Your heart was heavy, right?

383
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,300
It was painful, was it not?

384
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,510
I need to overcome it.

385
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,180
I need to endure it and

386
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,480
set right those who hurt us.

387
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,280
You will do that for sure.

388
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,120
You are a beautiful person.

389
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,450
A precious person.

390
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,430
I love you.

391
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,530
I love you.

392
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:17,500
♫ I will reach for you, where you are ♫

393
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:26,370
♫ With my breath, I will send myself to you ♫

394
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:33,470
♫ The moment the flowers bloom again after this winter ♫

395
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:42,530
♫ Embraced in your arms, just for a moment ♫

396
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:49,410
♫ If time will stop like this forever ♫

397
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,940
♫ Tears keep rolling down ♫

398
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,910
I also think of you all the time,

399
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,500
knowing I do not have the right to.

400
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:11,140
♫ My feelings will not change, I will now reach for you ♫

401
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,070
[Sajo Hyun]

402
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:25,400
And the j-jar next to me, too.

403
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,550
Did Ak Hee say he will come?

404
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,070
He will come.

405
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,160
I am sure.

406
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,530
Your Majesty.

407
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,990
Ak Hee, are you really never going to come outside again?

408
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,960
I need to take a break today, too.

409
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,480
Go outside for a moment and get some air.

410
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,280
And come back if you want. Do as you please.

411
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,900
Do as you please.

412
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,190
I am not going to take your body even if you fall asleep.

413
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,310
So you can rest easy and get a good night's sleep.

414
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,700
What is the matter with you?

415
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,260
You are the one who always said so to me!

416
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,020
That the fake should disappear.

417
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,140
Things ended up the way you wanted.

418
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,890
Why? Did I grow on you or something?

419
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,640
Who knows? I am sure you did grow on me.

420
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,300
I am sorry, but not for me.

421
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,370
Even now, whenever I see you,

422
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,530
I just want to- Gosh.

423
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,600
Is it because of Yeon Wol? I am sorry.

424
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,120
I do not hear you. I cannot hear you.

425
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:36,860
Never say that name with your mouth in front of me again.

426
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,790
Leave.

427
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,000
Ak Hee.

428
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,220
Gosh, I said I was fine! Get lost!

429
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:55,630
Sir Ak Hee, this is your last chance.

430
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,870
If today passes,

431
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:02,910
your existence will get erased gradually.

432
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,660
Come out to the Hall of Spirits.

433
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,560
- Your Majesty, what happened-
- You may not speak of

434
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,750
what happened tonight, even in the afterlife.

435
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,400
Forget it.

436
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,100
Your Majesty-

437
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,810
I could not help it.

438
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,210
Because I need to survive.

439
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,740
Because I have to stay alive.

440
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,760
Please...

441
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,590
What is the meaning of this? Why did Ak Hee not come?

442
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:27,810
W-Well... H-He should. Why is he not coming?

443
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,650
His Majesty went to sleep.

444
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,490
How weird.

445
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,550
Is there no other way besides bonghamsal?

446
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,170
There is none. Not anymore.

447
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,910
I have no more use for you, then.

448
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,630
Open your mouth right now!

449
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,120
There is one! There is one more!

450
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,520
There is one last method.

451
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,100
What is it? Tell me.

452
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,250
To force his way out.

453
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,160
Force his way out?

454
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,080
What do you mean?

455
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,430
That woman, Yeon Wol.

456
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,350
Are you talking about Kyera?

457
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,970
Yes.

458
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,270
If that woman is about to lose her life and

459
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,660
if even His Majesty Sajo Hyun cannot save her,

460
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,280
he might force his way out.

461
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,660
Last time, he-

462
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,280
That is what he did.

463
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,080
To draw Ak Hee out, I need Kyera?

464
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,360
Are you still looking for Kyera?

465
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,500
We are still looking.

466
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,880
Kyera.

467
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,840
Wait.

468
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,880
Ak Hee, you did not...

469
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,230
Move aside!

470
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,880
He is the fourth prince of Jinhoi.

471
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,210
- The fourth prince?
- Why did he come?

472
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,460
Sir, please spare me some change!

473
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,230
- Move aside!
- Move aside!

474
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,860
- Please spare some change!
- Get lost!

475
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,790
Let them be!

476
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,760
It is entertaining.

477
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,780
All right, here comes money!

478
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,750
Hey, you!

479
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,200
Do you think we are beggars?

480
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,750
Which one of you? How dare you!

481
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,520
Let him be!

482
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,590
Sir, please spare me some change.

483
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,680
Please spare me some change.

484
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,520
There, it is money!

485
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,640
Move aside!

486
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,500
Blood?

487
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,300
A-Aigoo, ahjumma.

488
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,470
- Ahjumma, y-you are bleeding.
- Blood...

489
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,470
I apologize for asking to see you when you must be busy.

490
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,920
You must be at ease now, Grand Prince.

491
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,070
Since you were relieved of cumbersome governing affairs.

492
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:55,010
It is all thanks to His Majesty's consideration.

493
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,420
Head Minister, do you remember General Yeon Poong Hak?

494
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,110
What do you think caused General Yeon Poong Hak's downfall

495
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,800
when he was reaching new heights every day?

496
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,170
It was his foolishness for failing to recognize the real hero.

497
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:21,300
It is because he could not grab the late king's hand, who was a general at the time.

498
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,450
What are you trying to say?

499
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,710
Right now, it is exactly the same as that time.

500
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,070
I am the late king from that time and

501
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,800
you are General Yeon Poong Hak from that time.

502
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,410
It is still not too late.

503
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,510
You should take my hand.

504
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,820
If you do so, even after I take the throne,

505
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,920
your daughter will stay as the Queen.

506
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,330
Are you saying you will take the Queen as your wife,

507
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:56,400
when she used to be His Majesty's wife?

508
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,740
Of course.

509
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,270
You will continue to stay as the king's father-in-law.

510
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,580
This is so funny that it is making me tear up.

511
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,510
What do you say, Head Minister?

512
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:27,360
I have someone to introduce you to, Grand Prince.

513
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,510
You may come in.

514
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,080
You can recognize who he is, right?

515
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,300
Who is that man?

516
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,370
I have no idea.

517
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,080
You cannot recognize him?

518
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,850
You two are so much alike. How could you not recognize him?

519
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,190
You two almost look like a father and a son.

520
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,410
That is a bizarre thing to say, Head Minister.

521
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:31,090
To have you insult me like this, Head Minister...

522
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,750
I will not forget this.

523
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,470
Consort Cheong Myeong is coming in.

524
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,050
Why did you want to see me, Head Minister?

525
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,620
My, Hon-

526
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,490
Grand Prince.

527
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,610
Your family got to reunite after a long time.

528
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,560
So I will go now.

529
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,880
Head Minister!

530
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,120
Grand Prince, you should be the one giving it some thought

531
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,050
about which way to kneel.

532
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,610
However...

533
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:36,050
do you even qualify to be a grand prince?

534
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,300
Of course, I am-

535
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,950
Jin Mu Dal-

536
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:00,470
Hear ye. Is no one out there?

537
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,820
Yoong, please!

538
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,550
Honey, hurry up and run.

539
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,390
I am sorry!

540
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,160
Y-Yoong, please!

541
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,230
Please spare him for my sake.

542
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,480
- Move aside.
- Yoong!

543
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,270
Yoong, he is your father!

544
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:22,050
Damn it!

545
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,610
Who are you saying is my father?

546
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,050
Who are you saying is my father?

547
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:42,420
That man, who drags me down like a burden! Why is-

548
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,450
Why is he my father?

549
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,260
Why?

550
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,130
I will... I will keep him in check.

551
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:58,290
I will manage him so he does not cause any trouble.

552
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:04,190
If something happens, I will die with him right away.

553
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,500
Just this once. Please ignore him just this once.

554
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,710
Please, Yoong.

555
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,550
Yoong!

556
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,600
Officer Jin, is something wrong?

557
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,110
You are not looking too well.

558
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,570
No, Your Majesty.

559
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,590
Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

560
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,760
Prince Ga Ron of Jinhoi has arrived.

561
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:48,460
Really? I must get changed.

562
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,570
By the way, you will be glad to see who is at your chamber, Your Majesty.

563
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,870
Y-Yeon Wol.

564
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,820
It is great to see you again, Your Majesty.

565
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,460
Yeon Wol.

566
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,540
Wait, you want to meet Hwang Ga Ron?

567
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,880
You cannot.

568
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,450
I cannot use you just to convince him.

569
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,550
I am not being used.

570
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,140
We are joining forces.

571
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,970
Hwang Ga Ron wants to meet me badly, so I will be of use to convince him.

572
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,400
He is after you as a woman, Yeon Wol.

573
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,570
I will not treat him as a woman.

574
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:01,890
More importantly, I have dependable you by my side, Your Majesty.

575
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,010
I am not afraid.

576
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,610
Prince Ga Ron, thank you for accepting my invitation.

577
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,800
I am thankful.

578
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,780
Your palace is gorgeous.

579
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:25,080
I prepared this meeting to have a serious conversation with you.

580
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,740
But I am not sure how you find it.

581
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,500
I like it.

582
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,200
First off, I wanted to meet you to tell you two things.

583
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,910
Firstly, do not take Asatae's women to Jinhoi ever again.

584
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,630
I apologize for what happened at Port Mihwari.

585
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:49,420
Secondly, the border dispute between Asatae and Jinhoi is endless right now.

586
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,380
Please help our two countries sign a peace treaty.

587
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:58,220
Diplomatic matters are not for me to meddle with.

588
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,690
Innocent women of Asatae lost their lives because of the recent incident.

589
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:08,210
I hope you will feel the responsibility as Jinhoi's prince who is involved in this incident.

590
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:14,630
It looks like you keep connecting that incident and me.

591
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,940
But do you even have a proof?

592
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,060
Yes, he does.

593
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,810
You are-

594
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:33,830
You live here?

595
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,460
The amusement troupe?

596
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,570
Prince Ga Ron, be careful what you say.

597
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,980
She is someone I love.

598
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,310
Is the back of your neck okay?

599
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:46,410
Hurry up and order them.

600
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,870
It is hard to take them off with one hand.

601
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,700
Hear ye!

602
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,960
Yes, Your Highness.

603
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,380
Release the women locked up in the basement right now.

604
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,390
- Sorry?
- Hurry up and let them go right now!

605
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,130
Yes, Your Highness, as you command.

606
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,380
Hear ye!

607
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,080
Happy now?

608
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,760
Good job.

609
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,830
You like these plays?

610
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,520
I like them, too.

611
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,550
Thanks to the back of your neck, the women locked up in the basement were rescued.

612
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,580
These women are the witnesses.

613
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:35,640
Prince Ga Ron, I plan to officially object to Jinhoi's Royal Family about this matter.

614
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,280
Depending on how well you cooperate with us,

615
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,120
the weight of your responsibility will vary.

616
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:53,090
You see, I only came to have fun sometimes because Grand Prince Sajo Yoong invited me.

617
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,680
And lend him the warehouse by my villa.

618
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,500
The truth will be uncovered and

619
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,320
other princes who are competing with you

620
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,760
will be very glad to hear this.

621
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:21,380
Kyera, you dared to come into this place.

622
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:28,690
I think the negotiation with Prince Ga Ron went well.

623
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,580
It is thanks to you.

624
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,200
Thank you.

625
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,850
I will get going now.

626
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:44,670
Wind Knife is waiting outside.

627
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,050
We are parting again.

628
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,510
We will meet again.

629
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:58,700
Will you come running again like this, then?

630
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,400
Probably. After holding back as much as I could.

631
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,580
Bye, now.

632
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:01,420
Officer Ji, summon Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

633
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

634
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,050
Yeon Wol!

635
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,560
Hong Gun!

636
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,650
Yeon Wol, I could not thank you properly at Port Mihwari.

637
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,040
Thank you so much.

638
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,430
It was really scary, was it not?

639
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:26,360
What about your injury? Is it better now?

640
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:29,960
Yes.

641
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,450
Yeon Wol!

642
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,410
Yeon Wol.

643
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:45,780
I am sorry.

644
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,370
Did you want to see me, Your Majesty?

645
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,020
Grand Prince, everything is over now.

646
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,760
The fact you built an army at a secret hideout and

647
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,220
kidnapped women from the villages to sell them off to Jinhoi with

648
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,530
the amusement troupe's women as well.

649
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:21,350
You worked hard to disguise your secret hideout as a warehouse for food supplies.

650
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:26,630
The secret army was made to protect you during an unforeseen event.

651
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:30,490
For confidentiality, it was normally disguised as a food warehouse.

652
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:34,660
Also, I have no idea about selling the women off to Jinhoi,

653
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:39,060
as I already told you.

654
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,050
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

655
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,990
Do you not fear the heavens?

656
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:50,690
This is injustice, Your Majesty.

657
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,410
Though I am the son of a concubine,

658
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:57,770
I am still your hyung and the late king's oldest son, so how can you be so harsh-

659
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:00,070
My hyung and the oldest son?

660
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:07,260
Are you really of the late king's bloodline?

661
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:11,920
Your biological father is a man called Pal Cheon, is he not?

662
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:20,340
I gave you a chance to confess for our old times' sake.

663
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:24,400
Hear ye! Bring Sajo Yoong, the criminal, to the interrogation grounds!

664
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,620
Yes, Your Majesty! Take away the criminal.

665
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,370
- Yes!
- Your Majesty.

666
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,040
Your Majesty, this is unjust.

667
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,170
None of this is true.

668
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:37,690
Your Majesty, please hear me out!

669
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,420
Your Majesty!

670
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,540
Sajo Yoong.

671
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,990
You were clearly found to have plotted a rebellion

672
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:52,140
by building a secret army and organizing the human trafficking of women.

673
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,260
But are you still denying your crimes?

674
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,510
I told you already.

675
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,540
All of it is an entrapment!

676
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,140
What a shameless man.

677
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:10,870
Your Majesty, please order the guilty to be interrogated through torture.

678
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:13,490
Tie down the guilty for torture.

679
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:14,760
Tie him down!

680
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,340
- Yes!
- Yes!

681
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,630
I-I will speak!

682
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,100
I will confess everything!

683
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:28,370
Your Majesty, I will now confess all the truth.

684
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:30,610
So, please give me some time.

685
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:34,960
Your Majesty, there is no need to listen to his pathetic excuses.

686
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,590
It is right to tie him down and interrogate-

687
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:42,040
I am begging you, Your Majesty!

688
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,530
Go ahead.

689
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,390
Thank you for your grace.

690
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,910
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

691
00:57:52,900 --> 00:58:01,260
This humble one, Sajo Yoong, will tell all the ministers here, including the Head Minister,

692
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,420
a very shocking fact!

693
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:09,840
His Majesty, who is sitting there, is

694
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:20,330
possessed by an evil spirit.

695
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,850
Sajo Yoong!

696
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:23,900
How impertinent!

697
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:28,370
Your Majesty, I have told you already.

698
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:33,220
There is no need to show mercy for that wicked criminal!

699
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,030
Sajo Yoong.

700
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:43,910
How can you be such a shameless human being?

701
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,820
I gave you your last chance,

702
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,940
but how do you still...

703
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:58,960
dare to say I am possessed by...

704
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,800
a-an evil spirit-

705
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,750
What is going on?

706
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,490
Your Majesty!

707
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:14,450
Your Majesty, are you feeling unwell?

708
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:17,660
I cannot speak.

709
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,950
Did you all see it?

710
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,060
Because His Majesty's body is possessed by an evil spirit,

711
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:33,530
he is acting like that suddenly.

712
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:37,200
The evil spirit is coming alive with the energy from the moon!

713
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,500
You scoundrel! Shut your mouth!

714
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:46,390
The king will turn into an evil spirit now.

715
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:50,390
I hope all of you will watch closely and witness it.

716
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,030
Do not move!

717
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,530
His Majesty's life will be at risk.

718
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,770
This is truly a rebellion!

719
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:16,200
Hear ye, take all those rebels right now-

720
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,630
Bring me Kyera.

721
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:24,340
Yeon Wol?

722
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,980
K-Kyera?

723
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,030
The caught Kyera?

724
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,230
Darn you.

725
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,790
How dare you.

726
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,520
Yeon Wol.

727
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,100
I cannot move.

728
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,370
Your Majesty, please watch closely.

729
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,560
Yeon Wol.

730
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,410
Kyera!

731
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:59,930
Everyone, watch closely

732
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:03,060
what is about to unfold from this moment.

733
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,170
Stop there, Sajo Yoong!

734
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,610
Kyera, Kyera, Kyera.

735
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,430
Kyera.

736
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:13,590
That is not me, Your Majesty! Your Majesty-

737
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,390
Kyera.

738
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:34,130
Did you all see it?

739
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:37,930
This man is not His Majesty.

740
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,220
He is an evil spirit.

741
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,000
The king is possessed by an evil spirit!

742
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,350
Your Majesty.

743
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,420
Bring it on, Evil Spirit.

744
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,660
Come on.

745
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:59,850
Sajo Yoong.

746
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,810
Sajo Yoong!

747
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:20,680
♫ Never lost, I will not lose you ♫

748
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:27,600
♫ Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self ♫

749
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:34,500
♫ Never lost, when this darkness ends ♫

750
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:39,270
[Love Song for Illusion]

751
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,070
What happened to Yeon Wol?

752
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,030
You are still worried about Kyera in this situation?

753
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:48,190
Ak Hee, I leave my people and Yeon Wol in your hands.

754
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:53,010
The haunted king will bring forth a plague!

755
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:56,150
Looks like the heavens are also helping me, Sajo Yoong.

756
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:59,580
They said Prince Ga Ron suddenly fainted!

757
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,820
His Majesty needs to come back quickly.

758
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:05,250
Make my body stiffen and let His Majesty wake up.

759
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,550
Would I be able to take you to the mind's space, Kyera?
