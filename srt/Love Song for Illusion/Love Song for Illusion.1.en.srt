00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,370
they are...

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,950
not just drawings.

22
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,310
You are still making excuses with your words?

23
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,870
Beg for forgiveness.

24
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,140
Swear you will never do such a foolish thing again and beg.

00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,160
Beg!

26
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,950
You will not beg?

00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,480
You would rather die at your father's hands?

no interest in politics and strategies,

30

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,580
I trained in martial arts a lot.

even do these things.

Shut your mouth!

His Majesty is still sitting on the throne.

93

96
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,170
No way. Did you commit treason?

97
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,960
Are you in the right mind right now?

98
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,540

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,750
For our old times' sake, when we were once childhood friends,

102
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,800
I will give you two options.

103
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,640
First, you can admit this situation right now

104
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,950
and vow your loyalty to Sajo Seung, who has become the new king of Asatae.

105
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,220
If you do, you will become the most prosperous man in Asatae.

106
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,390
Second, if you do not vow your loyalty to me,

107
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,750
I will have you, your wife, and only daughter, Wol,

108
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,030
beheaded right this moment.

109
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,070
What kind of nonsense are you spewing, Seung?

110
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
Let him be.

111
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,280
The end of the road for my old friend...

112
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,320
I will send him off in person.

113
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,890
Sajo Hyun,

114
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,060
open your eyes wide and watch.

115
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,720
This is the king's path!

116
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,720
This is His Majesty's order.

117
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,060
You idiot.

118
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,030
I said I would end him myself.

119
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,480

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,890
Do you not fear the heavens?

126
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,550
What did you say?

127
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,310
I will not forget this moment!

128
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,480
I will pay you back without fail!

129
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,600
I will also take away everything you have!

130
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,310
What are you all doing?

131
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,550

Wol, run away! Right now!

134
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,990
I do not want to.

135
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,010
How can I leave you here and go alone?

136
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,470

139
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,260
Go.

141
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,580
Hurry up and go.

142

Behead her as soon as you see her!

146
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,930
Unni, I am sorry.

147
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,570
Rest in peace.

148
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,810
- Did the child come this way?
- Yes, she did.

149
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,120
- Search!
- Yes.

150
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,560
I have an inkling...

151
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,470
F-Father!

152
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,580
I saw her!

153
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,900
The child.

154
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,970
Where is she?

155
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,960
Did you definitely see her?

156
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,120
It is that way!

157
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,820
Kill the girl as soon as you see her!

158
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,610
Sajo Hyun, what did you learn today?

159
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,860
I am asking what you learned at this place.

160
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,590
You still learned nothing after seeing this gratifying moment?

161
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,120
Even after seeing the moment your father became the king of this country,

162
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,270
even after seeing the moment you became this country's crown prince,

163
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,070
did you really feel nothing at all?

164
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,170
What a weak bastard.

165
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,070
We found the girl's corpse!

166
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,720
Set the entire house on fire!

167
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,860
Burn down everything that belongs to the damned Royal Family of Yeon!

168
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,300
Tell them that I am here if you dare.

169
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,610
You will lose your neck before you can.

170
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,910
I am sorry.

171
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,130
I-I am sorry.

172
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,400
I need to get out.

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,700
G-Get away from me!

187
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,810
Go away! Go away!

188
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,930
Go away-

189
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,320
[10 years later]

190
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,030
Do not go anywhere. Got it?

191
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,530
I chose only the most beautiful girls.

192
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,080
All right, we will meet again.

193
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,110
Yes, we will.

194
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,740
Baby, what is the rush?

195
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,280
On top of being a corrupt official, you became a chaehongsa*, too?
(An official who selects beautiful women to provide to the king)

196
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,760
You wench, I am carrying out the royal decree right now!

197
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,120
Royal decree? I know.

198
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,270
The royal decree to secretly kidnap pretty boys and beautiful women from all over the country

199
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,800
and providing them as an amusement troupe to the tyrant, Sajo Seung.

200
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,430
Where did you lock up the other children?

201
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,570
Where are they?

202
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,100
What the hell are you doing? Capture her!

203
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,180
What took you so long?

204
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,760
Sorry, they followed me so persistently.

205
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,650
Get them!

206
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,620
I barely used it, so why would it break?

207
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,310
- Hurry up!
- Let me see-

208
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,070
- Hey, hey!
- A thief!

209
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,100
This is terrible.

210
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,100
The so-called king spends every day drinking, partying, and debauching in sodomy and women.

211
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,560
So, the entire country is infested with human trafficking.

212
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,700
Corrupt officials who are busy flattering the king are getting rich

213
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,760
and the poor people starve out on the streets.

214
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,980
Have some of this.

215
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,040
The entire country is in shambles just 10 years after Sajo Seung took the throne.

216
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,730
My goodness, Kyera!

217
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,030
Gosh, why do they make their clothes like this?

218
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,160
It was hard to move my arms while fighting earlier, too.

219
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,740
Hey, see you later!

220
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,100
Kyera? Do not be late!

221
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,710
Hey, hey! Stand back now!

222
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,570
I just want to see the seamstress! Why do you keep saying I cannot?

223
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,480
The thing is, our seamstress is very shy.

224
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,440
She does not meet anyone!

225
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,010
I will take my business elsewhere, then.

226
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,020
Do as you please.

227
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,590
Aigoo, you have arrived, Madam?

228
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,950
Come this way, please.

229
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,840
This place is good, though.

230
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,040
They are good with the dyes, too.

231
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,310
Madam, take a look at this.

232
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:54,460
It is so pretty in yellow, is it not?

233
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,070
You are not a woman seamstress but a man?

234
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,540
W-Who are you? Get lost! Now!

235
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,410
Ice cold.

236
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,320
Y-You...

237
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,510
Y-You are...

238
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,380
Gosh, was that too hard? What do I do?

239
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,600
- Wait-
- Stay put, or you will get paralyzed.

240
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,710
Does it still hurt?

241
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,840
Do not worry.

242
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,750
After a good night's sleep, you will get better tomorrow.

243
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,230
Do you have trouble sleeping usually?

244
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,690
How did you know?

245
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,440
Your body was ice cold.

246
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,640
It is all because your qi is not circulating.

247
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,710
Are you a physician?

248
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,690
Wait, a physician would not wear these clothes.

249
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,240
Can you not tell from my clothes?

250
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,150
- I dance beautifully-
- You are an assassin.

251
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:19,880
I am not.

252
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,910
You are an assassin disguised as a dancer.

253
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,620
I said I am not!

254
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,820
Unless you are an assassin, why would you treat my baby so roughly?

255
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,250
Your baby?

256
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,750
Is it a precious piece of work to you, just like having given birth to your own baby?

257
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,820
Look here, Ahjae*. I made this request to the owner last time.
(Means "Mister" or "Ahjussi")

258
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,780
Please make your clothes sturdy and practical!

259
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,050
But they still rip apart like paper.

260
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,850
It rips and tears every time I move.

261
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,620
My goodness.

262
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,270
By the way, why do you keep skipping the honorifics?

263
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,080
It is obvious, is it not? Because I am your customer.

264
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,200
Which is why I personally drew a design myself.

265
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,840
My requests are written, so you only need to fulfill them.

266
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,980
And do not do anything artistic.

267
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,180
Also, sew up the tear in this one, too.

268
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,460
Now, then. I will be off.

269
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,260
You...

270
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,790
do not have the right to wear my clothes.

271
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,640
Go somewhere else.

272
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,220
In that case, give me my clothes back.

273
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,520
I will have it fixed elsewhere.

274
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,460
- I cannot do that.
- Why not?

275
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,200
Because it is my baby I made with my blood, sweat, and soul.

276
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,860
I bought these clothes with the money I made with my blood, sweat, and soul.

277
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,670
Alas, I said you cannot.

278
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,320
Well, then. Give me my money back.

279
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,000
Since I bought it for five nyang and 20 jeon, taking off the wear and tear, give me five nyang.

280
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,650
How impertinent!

281
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,060
You are being so shameless after ruining my work like this.

282
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,700
Just be thankful I am not asking for money back for my work, and

283
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,070
get out of here right now.

284
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,280
You are an eyesore.

285
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,500
Ahjae...

286
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,580
you do not have friends, right?

287
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,090
And you are not very close to your family.

288
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:18,120
I can tell since you lock yourself up here and work and lie that you are the seamstress.

289
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,170
Your family must be against you doing this.

290
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,130
Meaning you cannot even be proud of your work.

291
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,480
So?

292
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,990
Are you mocking me right now?

293
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:34,150
Are you also taking me for a joke because a man likes to sew and meddle with fabrics?

294
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,810
Is that what your family says?

295
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,530
That you are a joke for doing this work?

296
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,220
Who is it? Is it your father?

297
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,550
"What is a man doing what the girls-"

298
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,640
Shut your mouth!

299
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,270
Are men not allowed to do these things?

300
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,710
Whether it is a man or a woman, you only need to enjoy what you do.

301
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,520
How could he say such things just because he is the father?

302
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,090
Are you his property or something?

303
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,780
How can he say that just because he gave birth to you?

304
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,360
Say all these things to your father.

305
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,220
You probably cannot even utter a word in front of your father.

306
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,840
Aigoo, you have such pretty hands.

307
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,890
I am sure your heart is even more pretty and fragile.

308
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,560
Ahjae, you cannot live like this.

309
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,370
You said this is your precious baby, right?

310
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,690
What kind of parent is ashamed of taking care of his own baby?

311
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,730
Kyera, you are still here?

312
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,840
I will go now!

313
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,680
All right, do it by tomorrow, then. Take care.

314
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,550
Excuse me.

315
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,260
Look over here!

316
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,930
Kyera.

317
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,140
Is her name Kyera?

318
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,210
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

319
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,370
Crown Prince!

320
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,190
Crown Prince, why did you come so late?

321
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,490
I almost had a nervous breakdown.

322
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,140
Ji Jeon, you should have brought back the Crown Prince quickly.

323
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,750
How can you be so slow of a bodyguard?

324
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,800
Eunuch Neung, what is the matter?

325
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,620
Everyone has gathered inside your pavilion right now.

326
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,060
inside your pavilion.

327
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,780
Your Majesty, did you have a nice trip to the hot springs?

328
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,350
Of course, I did. And that is why I am sitting here.

329
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,740
Why?

330
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,470
Did you hope for me to become fried and boiled in the steamy hot springs?

331
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,080
Your Majesty...

332
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,730
It would have been nice to have you there as well, Crown Prince.

333
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,810
We missed you the whole time.

334
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,850
Where are you coming back from?

335
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,900
Have you been wasting your time again, carrying that headless drawing of yours?

336
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,640
I must be right since you cannot answer me.

337
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,000
What did I say? Stopping by this place would only make me angry.

338
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,160
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

339
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,940
I thought His Majesty would be even more happy after bathing in hot springs

340
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,870
and being in a great mood since the Crown Prince became

341
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,910
more manly and broad-minded lately.

342
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,180
Your Highness Consort Cheong Myeong,

343
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,530
you know I look manly and strong one day but become half-witted the day after

344
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,230
because of my madness, so how can you say that?

345
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,610
Could it be you brought His Majesty, hoping I was in my insane state?

346
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,450
Shut your mouth!

347
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,450
Is having a madness something you should be proud of?

348
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,860
How pathetic.

349
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:04,830
Aigoo, how did my heir and concubine's son switch up like this?

350
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,590
You probably cannot even utter a word in front of your father.

351
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,260
Aigoo, you have such pretty hands.

352
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,240
I am sure your heart is even more pretty and fragile.

353
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,150
Ahjae, you cannot live like this.

354
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,700
Is doing what I like to do...

355
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,320
- What did you say?
- Crown Prince.

356
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,690
What did you say just now?

357
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,090
What did you mutter just now?

358
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:40,230
Your Majesty, I think I heard him say he will do better from now on.

359
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,890
The assembly.

360
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,430
Yes, I heard everyone has gathered.

361
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,930
Let us go.

362
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,470
Your Majesty, please allow the Crown Prince to attend the assembly as well.

363
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,910
- That is nonsense.
- Absurd!

364
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,060
Did you hear him, Crown Princess?

365
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,230
The Crown Prince chooses not to attend the assembly.

366
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,900
He is a half-wit who has no interest in managing a nation.

367
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,010
Crown Prince, do not let it bother you too much.

368
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,930
Even though His Majesty speaks that way,

369
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,730
you know he has a deep affection for you.

370
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,410
We are going out to hunt tomorrow morning with His Majesty.

371
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,310
Please join us, okay?

372
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,810
Hyungnim.

373
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,960
Is that what you really think?

374
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,550
What do you mean?

375
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,430
That His Majesty has deep affections for me,

376
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,380
not you.

377
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,640
Do you want to stop now?

378
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,340
I must rest.

379
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,070
Your Highness, please practice a bit more.

380
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,520
Tomorrow is the hunt, is it not?

381
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,730
Did you come because you are worried

382
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,430
I might get scolded by His Majesty again tomorrow?

383
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,450
You got embarrassed by His Majesty earlier, too.

384
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,370
How unfortunate you are.

385
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,660
I am fine getting embarrassed by His Majesty.

386
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,780
However, I hear Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's hunting skills are getting better by the day.

387
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,500
Do you agree with what His Majesty said?

388
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,190
That Sajo Yoong hyung and I should have been switched.

389
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,840
Why did you become my wife if you think so?

390
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,130
- Your Highness-
- Because I am the crown prince, His Majesty's heir?

391
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,180
You never know what will happen in life, so what will you do

392
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,420
if I lose my place to Yoong hyung

393
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,130
as everyone worries,

394
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,630
or rather, as everyone wishes?

395
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,130
It is not like you can switch your husband.

396
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,850
It does not matter to me, even if you switch your husband.

397
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,190
Do as you wish.

398
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,150
This is uncalled for.

399
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,800
Sometimes, you are so kind to me,

400
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,660
but right now, you are...

401
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,220
How am I so fickle?

402
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,840
It is just as you said.

403
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,050
This is all because of the madness I have, is it not?

404
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,530
However,

405
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,260
we cannot really say you have no blame

406
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,540
since you married me knowing I have a madness.

407
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,960
Did he get a new amusement troupe again?

408
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,620
I apologize, Your Highness.

409
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,630
Crown Prince, you said you would not sleep tonight, did you not?

410
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,160
I did.

411
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,380
But I am extremely tired.

412
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,960
I must sleep.

413
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,850
Could it be because of tomorrow's hunt?

414
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,090
In that case, do not participate in tomorrow's hunt and...

415
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,600
How can I be absent when I am wide awake?

416
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,280
It is His Majesty's order.

417
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,830
But that does not mean I would get humiliated again at the hunt.

418
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,260
I apologize, Your Highness.

419
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,410
I do not like hunting.

420
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,620
I dislike the stench of blood from slaughtering.

421
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,550
Though they are only beasts,

422
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,600
I do not wish to entertain myself using those with life.

423
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:37,000
In that case, what about your visit to the drapery tomorrow?

424
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,720
[Do not make the chest too revealing.]

425
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,970
Do not make the chest too revealing.

426
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,660
Make the inner skirt's width as wide as you can.

427
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,570
Allow the arms to move backward freely.

428
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,770
What a taste.

429
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,940
How did my heir and concubine's son switch up like this?

430
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,400
What is the use of any of these?

431
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,860
Ji Jeon, did the Crown Prince go to sleep last night?

432
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,900
He was reading, at least until I was standing guard.

433
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,490
Soldiers who were standing guard from night to dawn

434
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,890
also said the light was on in his bedchamber the whole time.

435
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,740
How fortunate.

436
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,550
Ak Hee must be furious right now.

437
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:03,610
He can wake up only if our Crown Prince goes to sleep.

438
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,700
Crown Prince, it is Eunuch Neung.

439
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,660
Have you awakened, Your Highness?

440
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,320
Enter.

441
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,610
Your Highness, did you not get enough sleep?

442
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,640
You told me not to sleep, Eunuch Neung.

443
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,160
I apologize, Your Highness.

444
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,540
In that case, for today's hunt...

445
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,920
Not sure.

446
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,510
Your Majesty, I heard you went to sleep only after break of dawn.

447
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,230
Are you feeling well?

448
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,200
Cannot be any better.

449
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,800
I am full of energy, perhaps because I received youthful energy all night.

450
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,810
Is there still no word from the Crown Prince's pavilion?

451
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,620
I apologize.

452
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:26,170
Looks like the Crown Prince will be absent for the hunt.

453
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:31,770
After early morning, the deer will move away to another mountain.

454
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,390
Let us go.

455
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,760
Your Majesty, please give him some more time.

456
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,000
I heard Crown Prince has been practicing archery regularly so far.

457
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,490
No amount of practice will make him better. At an indoor archery ground at that.

458
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,360
Let us go!

459
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,420
Let us go!

460
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,870
Your Majesty!

461
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,310
Easy, easy.

462
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,210
How could you depart without me?

463
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,840
Let us go!

464
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,810
Great job, Sajo Hyun.

465
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,810
Looks like the Crown Prince practiced a lot.

466
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:49,720
Not at all. I think Crown Prince is being manic again.

467
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,600
I see how he is attending the hunt for the first time in a while.

468
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,940
It must be proof his madness is worsening, Grand Prince.

469
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,900
I just do not know how to fail.

470
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,820
Aigoo, I am so sore.

471
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,140
So, Ji Jeon Seo.

472
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,410
Is there something on my face, huh?

473
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,190
Why do you keep staring at me?

474
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,870
It is nothing.

475
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:32,690
I was just happy to see His Majesty being happy today.

476
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:37,090
It was a good idea to keep practicing at the indoor archery grounds.

477
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,590
I mean, it is all thanks to you, Ji Jeon Seo.

478
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,150
You are my martial arts master, are you not?

479
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,870
I am undeserving of such praise.

480
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,500
Are you not tired?

481
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,390
You said you could not sleep last night.

482
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,090
Easy.

483
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,680
I could not sleep?

484
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,550
When did I say...

485
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,990
I could not sleep?

486
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,510
Huh?

487
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,770
Disappointed?

488
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,280
Gosh, if you are so noticeably disappointed, it makes Ak Hee sad.

489
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,280
My goodness.

490
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,180
Go on without me. I have a place to stop by.

491
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,970
I am off.

492
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:47,350
Twelve wins in a row for Dal Bong!

493
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,510
Next contestant!

494
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,730
We would not have one, right?

495
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:02,530
All right, then. Today's fights are over with this!

496
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,090
Wait!

497
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,410
- Wait!
- Who was that?

498
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,540
- Who is it?
- Who was that?

499
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,240
Gosh, is it over already? How lame.

500
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,600
A-Ak- A-Ak...

501
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,530
It is Ak Hee! Ak Hee is back!

502
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,620
- Ak Hee?
- Ak Hee?

503
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,650
- Ak Hee! Ak Hee!
- Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

504
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,520
Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

505
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,710
Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

506
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,210
[Dal Bong, Ak Hee]

507
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,250
I heard...

508
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,450
you are on a roll these days.

509
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,790
I will teach you a lesson-

510
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,110
Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

511
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,090
How cute.

512
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,180
Want me to let you win?

513
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,950
It is a woman.

514
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,560
Dal Bong! Hey!

515
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,160
Geez.

516
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:11,690
Dal Bong forfeited!
[Ak Hee]

517
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,420
Ak Hee won!

518
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,010
- Aigoo!
- Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

519
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,750
Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

520
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,870
Ak Hee! Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

521
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:37,960
Gosh, he just had to interfere at the end.

522
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,730
I will be late.

523
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,750
- There you go!
- My goodness!

524
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,630
W-What is it now?

525
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,470
Who the hell are you?

526
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:53,730
I will let you off on a special note. Get lost.

527
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,350
You are mad you lost the prize to me, are you not?

528
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,320
I just might give all of this to you.

529
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,870
Instead, show me your entire face.

530
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,060
Get lost.

531
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,550
Come on, I will give you all of this.

532
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,960
You pretended to be a man and participated in the fights because you needed money.

533
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,620
Being so petty and hiding your face.

534
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,710
Oh, petty? I was being petty, huh.

535
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,360
What about you? Are you not being petty?

536
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,180
Do you think I would not know you just because you wore something like this?

537
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,160
I forgive you because I am busy right now.

538
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,370
Hold on a moment.

539
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,500
How do you know me?

540
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,780
H-How could you know?

541
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:50,100
In that case, d-do you know who you are talking to right now-

542
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,950
Did you finish fixing my clothes?

543
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,940
Did you even finish your work to be slacking off like this?

544
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,270
What?

545
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,810
You are...

546
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,670
way better as the drapery's Ahjae.

547
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,320
Drapery? Sajo Hyun!

548
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,620
I was not looking into his memory because it was too much work.

549
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,430
W-Wait, wait. Hold on.

550
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,770
You saw me at the drapery? When?

551
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,410
Are we close to each other, then?

552
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,550
Whoa, you are acting like you lost your memory now?

553
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,270
You did not finish fixing my clothes, did you?

554
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,130
That is why you are feigning ignorance.

555
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:36,010
Are you serious? Do you really prefer the guy at the drapery over me?

556
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,920
Yes.

557
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,480
How come? Why?

558
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,640
When I saw you at the drapery,

559
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,210
you had some kind of an aura.

560
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,630
What about now?

561
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,570
Right now?

562
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,990
This thing.

563
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,970
And this thing does not fit.

564
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,360
You seem fake for some reason.

565
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,580
Go back to the drapery, Young Master.

566
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,990
That is where you belong.

567
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,040
F-Fake...

568
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,650
Fake?

569
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,520
F-Fake-

570
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,120
Hey- Where did she go? Dal Bong!

571
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:22,000
I have never seen anyone who prefers the half-wit Sajo Hyun over me.

572
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:08,650
♫ Never lost, I will not lose you ♫

573
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:15,440
♫ Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self ♫

574
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:22,240
♫ Never lost, when this darkness ends ♫

575
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,340
♫ Even if I am tired or hurt ♫

576
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,340
♫ I have to protect you ♫

577
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,580
♫ Never lost ♫
Take some crops! Come and get some!

578
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,720
♫ When this darkness ends ♫

579
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,870
Wind Knife, hurray!

580
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,050
Hurray!

581
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:45,760
♫ I have to protect you, never lost ♫

582
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,420
♫ Never lost ♫

583
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:55,730
♫ Have to protect you, never lost ♫

584
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,540
I claimed this first.

585
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,560
I ordered it first.

586
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,760
You can check the order form.

587
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,460
How am I?

588
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,420
Why did you wear the mask, especially just half?

589
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,440
Oh, to look different from the brat from the drapery.

590
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,380
I am different from him.

591
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,250
What do you say? I look more real now, right?

592
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,310
Not at all.

593
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:42,390
A fake is fake forever.

594
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:49,810
Apologize. I am really not a fake, okay?

595
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,260
Why are you so mindful?

596
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,830
Mindful?

597
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,540
I am?

598
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:03,590
No matter what anyone says, just say you are real, and that is it. Why be so touchy about it...

599
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:08,020
For now, treat other people with sincerity.

600
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,760
Once you do, even the most fake life will start looking real.

601
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:18,250
Wait, are you saying I am not sincere?

602
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,470
Hollow.

603
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,230
As expected, there is no sincerity.

604
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,950
It is completely empty.

605
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,630
Fill this up first, please.

606
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,260
Fill it up?

607
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,300
I will fill it up with you.

608
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,770
You are mad you lost the prize to me, are you not?

609
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:10,610
How impertinent! You are being so shameless after ruining my work like this.

610
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,550
Apologize. I am really not a fake, okay?

611
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,270
Gosh, is he really Ahjae from the drapery?

612
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:21,480
He looks the same, but how could he be so different?

613
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,690
Your skills improved.

614
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,910
Sir!

615
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,220
Have you been well?

616
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,960
I knew you would come.

617
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,970
Really?

618
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,030
The revolution will be soon.

619
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:38,190
I knew you would come since you are Wind Knife's godfather.

620
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,820
Godfather?

621
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,010
You are no longer calling me your sponsor?

622
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:44,590
The sponsor sounds more affectionate to me.

623
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,370
That was when I was immature.

624
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:54,080
By the way, when will you tell me which family you are from?

625
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,400
It is mean of you to only tell us to call you "Sir."

626
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,700
Were you upset?

627
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,650
Yes, I was upset.

628
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,690
- Quite a lot.
- Really?

629
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:08,610
Once we succeed in the revolution, you will find out.

630
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,050
That is a promise, okay?

631
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,800
I promise you.

632
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,030
You made it, Sir.

633
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,560
While Kyera dances at the banquet, Wind Knife will

634
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,650
sneak in this way and wait for Kyera.

635
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,790
It is near the king's bedchamber.

636
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,020
Here. It is a present. It belongs to you now.

637
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,850
Young Lady!

638
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,950
- I am going to go get my revenge, let go!
- Young Lady.

639
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,260
Father!

640
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,150
Mother!

641
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:16,070
Father and Mother, it is finally time.

642
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,760
I will avenge your deaths without fail

643
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,640
and bring Asatae's throne back to its rightful state.

644
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,650
We congratulate Your Majesty's honorable birth once again.

645
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,160
Long live the king!

646
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,650
Long live the king!

647
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,360
Thank you!

648
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,870
Eat a lot and enjoy all you want!

649
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,980
Thank you for your grace!

650
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:07,890
Is the Crown Prince absent again today?

651
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,810
He should be at the study.

652
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:12,250
- He will soon-
- Forget it.

653
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:19,190
Tell him I do not need to see his long face on a joyous day like today.

654
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:22,050
Do you not agree, Grand Prince Yoong?

655
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,440
You think he is surely the Crown Prince, right?

656
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,470
Ak Hee would be sleeping.

657
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:03,650
Right?

658
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:08,710
Yes, the Crown Prince should at least attend His Majesty's birthday banquet.

659
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:51,520
What if the king chooses another dancer?

660
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,590
Ha Rang!

661
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,680
Based on what I confirmed, Kyera is the most beautiful one

662
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,740
out of all the dancers who will be at the banquet.

663
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,170
Will you be able to do a good job?

664
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,050
Please do not worry, Sir.

665
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:09,020
I have been waiting for this day.

666
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:18,270
Kyera has been trained as an assassin for a long time.

667
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:20,760
She is the most excellent member of Wind Knife, too.

668
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:25,590
- Most of all...
- She hates and resents His Majesty more than anyone else.

669
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,630
And that is her strongest weapon.

670
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:31,430
Grand Prince, for Kyera to succeed...

671
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:34,570
It means His Majesty will pass away.

672
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,130
That is our goal, is it not?

673
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:44,560
- However, he is your...
- He is my father.

674
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,880
It cannot be helped.

675
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,780
This is the way to bring the throne to its rightful state

676
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,440
and save the people who are suffering under a tyrant.

677
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,520
I am prepared to lose my filial morality.

678
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,940
Long live the king!

679
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,690
Please wait a moment.

680
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,030
Sajo Seung, I have been waiting for this day.

681
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:20,230
I will take your life today according to the heavens' order!

682
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:41,170
You are...

683
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:46,070
You are not fit to be an assassin.

684
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:50,100
Your scent is too strong.

685
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,820
Have you awakened?

686
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,670
Are you okay?

687
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,940
Who are you?

688
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,900
Oh, I am called Hong Gun.

689
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,800
Hong Gun...

690
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,230
Where is this place?

691
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:37,330
Where else? It is Her Highness Consort Hyo's bedchamber.

692
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,200
I see. Sorry for the trouble.

693
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,670
Your Highness, please remain in bed.

694
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,760
You have been sleeping for four days and nights.

695
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,560
You will feel nauseous if you suddenly start moving like this.

696
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,380
I am Her Highness?

697
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,300
Yes, you are Her Highness Consort Hyo.

698
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,700
Of course, you have to go through your official investiture ceremony to become the concubine.

699
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,270
Consort Hyo...

700
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:05,020
I am a concubine?

701
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,210
Who- Concubine? The king's?

702
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,320
Yes.

703
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,190
You are the Crown Prince's concubine.

704
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:14,790
- Who is the Crown Prince?
- Sorry?

705
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:18,170
Your Highness, could it be...

706
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,120
you do not remember?

707
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,190
I probably should not say I do not remember anything.

708
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,760
T-The thing is...

709
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:30,620
Crown Prince has arrived.

710
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,910
The Crown Prince is here.

711
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,510
You can stay put.

712
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:56,610
You are awake, Consort Hyo.

713
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:59,880
I am this man's concubine?

714
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,810
You have finally become my woman.

715
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,780
I missed you.

716
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:18,710
Whoa, where is this?

717
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,740
Who am I?

718
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,490
Who are you?

719
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:27,910
Me?

720
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,640
I am your man.

721
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,320
Hurry up and escape.

722
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:38,490
I want to take the dancer you chose tonight, Your Majesty.

723
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,780
You will realize I am real.

724
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,290
You will end up liking me.

725
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,830
Who is this man?

726
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,900
♫ Never lost, I will never lose you ♫

727
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:16,710
♫ Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self ♫

728
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:23,160
♫ Never lost, when this darkness ends ♫

729
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:27,780
[Love Song for Illusion]

730
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:31,400
Do we really know each other?

731
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,530
We are very close.

732
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:34,880
Who are you?

733
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,540
That is what I want to know, too.

734
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,850
You are married. Why on Earth would I-

735
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:40,740
Why are you so talkative?

736
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,990
Something feels off.

737
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,430
Why am I so good at fighting?

738
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:48,610
I am asking why you did such a thing, fooling me and the Inner Court.

739
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:53,470
You are trying to get me in the end, using my woman.

740
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:56,620
Who is behind you? What is your identity?

741
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:02,010
- I will use you and get the better of Ak Hee.
- Sajo Hyun!
