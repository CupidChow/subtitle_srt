00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,830
I missed you, Kyera.

8
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,720
Sir Ak Hee?

9
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,150
Sir Ak Hee, your blade was removed.

10
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,600
I am glad.

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,480
I was very worried since I could not confirm before leaving.

12
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,920
You were worried?

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,970
Of course, you were not waking up as Sir Ak Hee. I was so worried.

14
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,710
You were worried, huh?

15
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,370
I guess you are still unwell.

16
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,200
It still hurts a lot here, does it not?

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,250
Yes, there is a little bit of bleeding.

18
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,020
It kind of- A little- No, it hurts a lot.

19

Still? Let me see. I will try treating it.

20
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,690
N-No, it is okay.

21
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,480

Are you okay?

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,910
How can you leave without even telling us?

27
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,910
Sorry. I made you worry, right?

28
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,310
Why did you do such a reckless thing?

29
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,350
I am sorry, Master Yang.

30
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,260
How did you know I was here?

31
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,920
His Majesty sought us out.

I have something to talk about with Kyera.

How did you know where to find Master Yang?

34
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,820
I-It was not me. It was Sajo Hyun.

35
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,280
Did Yeon Wol get this for me? To save my life?

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,310
That is correct.

37
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,660
But why did she leave without a word?

38
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,040
Why?

39
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,960
I know. Why would she suddenly leave?

Where are you going?

43
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,200
Yeon Wol might be in danger! I must save her.

You do not even know where she went!

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,580
You cannot. This is dangerous.

It worked. It did.

How do you have my face?

70
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,540
Look at this. I guess you really lost all your memories.

71
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,210
Hey, I could not even go out because you lost your memories.

72
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,110
W-Who are you?

73
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,080
And where is this place?

74
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,380
Oh, this place?

75
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,950
I guess you can say this place is

76
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:09,380
our mind's space where we have our friendly meetings.

77
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,820

78
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,310

79
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,120
What a heinous evil spirit.

80
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,130
This is still the same even though you have lost your memories.

81
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,750
Evil spirit?

82
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,650
Wow, it is unpleasant but amazing at the same time.

83
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,090
How impertinent, you scum!

84
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,140
Hey...

85
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,500
stop yelling and...

86
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,110
come. Come take a seat here.

87
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,710
Answer me. I asked who you are.

88
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,700
I said I will answer you, so come take a seat.

89
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,780
It has not been long since I got that removed, so I cannot really move.

90
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,390
I explained the situation to Sajo Hyun in a hurry.

91
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,230
The urgent matters first for now.

92
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,730
He is smart because he takes after me.

93
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,640
He sure understood quickly.

94
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,080
Two personalities?

95
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,740
Confusing, right?

96
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,860
But you do not have the time to be doing this.

97
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,870
I got it. I must go save Yeon Wol first.

98
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,820
On your own? You do not even have Ji Jeon Seo with you.

99
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,040
I know where to find the man you called Master Yang.

100
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,890
By the way, how do I get out?

101
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,310
Is there anyone here who knows Yeon Wol?

102
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,360
If you do, show yourself! I have to say something.

103
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,520
Hey, Sajo Hyun, absolutely do not be kind to Hwang Ga Ron.

104
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,540
Get the drop on him, no matter what, okay?

105
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,890
Act like you saw through everything.

106
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,680
Absolutely do not let him know you lost your memories.

107
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,760
By the way, why did you suddenly come out?

108
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,550
You are disappointed I came out.

109
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,140
Should I go back inside?

110
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,180
That is not it.

111
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,610
You could have come out after we got back-

112
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,640
I wanted to see you.

113
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,250
I wanted to see you as soon as possible, so I asked Sajo Hyun.

114
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,080
For telling him how to save you, I asked him to allow me to meet you quickly.

115
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,120
Sir Ak Hee, your eyes are worse than before, right?

116
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,470
N-No.

117
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,210
I-I can see just fine.

118
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,360
That cannot be. Your focus is not right.

119
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,470
We are done talking. Let us go.

120
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,270
Thank you for helping me today.

121
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,650
Please help so His Majesty's memories can return soon.

122
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,970
You knew I was not Sajo Hyun?

123
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,790
D-Do I not look like a king?

124
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,690
We must rush to go back before sunset.

125
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,800
Those two are looking down on me, right?

126
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,580
Your eyes did get worse. You are misunderstanding them.

127
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,520
No, I can see just fine.

128
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,100
Did Sajo Hyun's memories come back?

129
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,750
I do not know that,

130
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,870
but he told off Prince Ga Ron and took Kyera back.

131
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,070
That man is not Sajo Hyun.

132
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,680
He is Ak Hee.

133
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,520
No way.

134
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,880
There is no way the blade was removed.

135
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,850
Even if it was removed, His Majesty has lost his memories,

136
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,510
so Ak Hee cannot come out.

137
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,720
Incorrect. Even if the one who took Kyera was Sajo Hyun,

138
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,350
he could not have done it alone.

139
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,140
One way or another, Ak Hee is influencing him.

140
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,130
It means Ak Hee survived.

141
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,160
Oh, my. This is such a letdown for you.

142
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,950
You thought Ak Hee had died.

143
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,500
If he survived, I just need to make use of him alive,

144
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,100
manipulating his boiling obsession and ambition.

145
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:52,340
I realized it clearly after nearly perishing for good.

146
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,830
I...

147
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,010
do not want to let you go.

148
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,150
I do not want to lose you to Sajo Hyun.

149
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,830
I have been sharing my body with such an untidy person?

150
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,980
He still survived even after being stabbed with something like this?

151
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,190
My goodness.

152
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,760
Wait a moment.

153
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,390
Anyhow, you want to save Kyera,

154
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,180
although you do not remember her.

155
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,800
That is right.

156
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,560
You were having a great time yesterday, being all lovey-dovey.

157
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,570
Wait, how would you know that?

158
00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,470
Sir Ak Hee can read everything you experience and think.

159
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:05,230
You get to read me, but why can I not read you?

160
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,880
That is the difference between you and me.

161
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,520
The proof that I am way greater than you are.

162
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,610
Ak Hee gets to read my mind and my memories.

163
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,420
But why can I not do the same?

164
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
I can also read Ak Hee's mind.

165
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,210
I can read it.

166
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,310
Gosh, it is not working.

167
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,570
Goodness, I was looking elsewhere.

168
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,480
W-What is this?

169
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,360
Wait, he came to such a rundown place?

170
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,140
Exactly.

171
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,980
Yeon Wol!

172
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,640
Aigoo, Yeon Wol!

173
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,510
You left without even a word. Do you know how shocked I was?

174
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,240
I am sorry, Eunuch Neung. I made you worried sick, right?

175
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,120
Gosh, seriously.

176
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,520
Your Majesty, you, too.

177
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,180
I was guarding you all day, and you left the moment I went to take a leak.

178
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,220
Well, I apologize.

179
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,260
Sorry?

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Sir Ak Hee?

181
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,110
You are Sir Ak Hee, right?

182
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,340
Aigoo, Sir Ak Hee!

183
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,500
Aigoo, aigoo...

184
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,800
What in the world? I never thought I would be so glad to see Sir Ak Hee.

185
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,660
What makes you think I am Ak Hee?

186
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,430
Come on, Sir Ak Hee.

187
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,300
I can tell with one glance.

188
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,260
What about His Majesty?

189
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,850
He is doing well, right?

190
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,740
He does not even have his memories. Would this not confuse him more?

191
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,270
Sir Ak Hee, as for your memories...

192
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,030
You recognize me, so you are fine. Right?

193
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,850
Aigoo, His Majesty is the only troubled one.

194
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,540
Aigoo, what do I do?

195
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,860
Gosh, everyone is only worried about Sajo Hyun.

196
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,720
Yeon Wol, you will not go anywhere now, right?

197
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,130
For a while.

198
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,460
Huh? Where are you trying to go now?

199
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,710
Even if I go, I will make sure to tell you, Eunuch Neung.

200
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,740
I promise.

201
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,720
Yes, you must do that.

202
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,350
Sir Ak Hee, you will have dinner, right?

203
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,080
What? Why?

204
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,290
Should I just skip dinner and go inside?

205
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,050
So you can see Sajo Hyun sooner?

206
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,640
Gosh, why are you saying that, Sir Ak Hee?

207
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,960
Let me treat your wound. We have the medicinal herbs, too.

208
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,050
What wound?

209
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,860
I will treat your wound.

210
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,100
And let us have dinner together, too.

211
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,510
She said she would treat me.

212
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,420
She wants to eat with me.

213
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,930
C-Chung Ta?

214
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,270
Why you little...

215
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,360
W-Wait, what is the matter with you?

216
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,590
Stop it!

217
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,540
H-Hey, hold on, stay right there.

218
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,930
Wait-

219
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,520
You bastard, how dare you stick the blade in me?

220
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,830
You tried to kill me!

221
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,590
So, you should have listened to me from the beginning.

222
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,720
I gave you a chance, but you did not even budge.

223
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,240
Oh, really? You should try getting stabbed, too.

224
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,420
See how much it hurts, okay?

225
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,000
Kyera!

226
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,870
You need to have Kyera.

227
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,570
You can have her.

228
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,090
You just need to get rid of Sajo Hyun.

229
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,120
Once Sajo Hyun is gone,

230
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,990
you can take over that body

231
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,600
and Kyera will have no choice.

232
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,930
That talk is already over.

233
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,330
You are going to disappear soon! You know that!

234
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,370
See? You are more or less blind now, are you not?

235
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,340
You forced your way out earlier. So even your power must have weakened more.

236
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,340
And Sajo Hyun became stronger!

237
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,890
Sajo Hyun lost his memories anyway.

238
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,580
That is why this is a chance for you.

239
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,290
Sajo Hyun fully trusts you right now.

240
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,260
He does not know who you really are.

241
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,780
Perform geuminsal* on Sajo Hyun.
(Killing with a metal)

242
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,030
You will stick the blade in him.

243
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,570
How about it?

244
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,240
Are you sure the Queen is pregnant?

245
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,650
Yes, you told me to confirm it, so I went to her chamber again.

246
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:38,600
Queen, guess what I brought.

247
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:45,500
They are the highest quality silk I got from the country of Jinhoi.

248
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,830
Take a look.

249
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,400
I rubbed peach skins all over the silk before taking them with me.

250
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,770
Hold on.

251
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,840
Wait, why?

252
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,750
She cannot fool my eyes.

253
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,690
She is pregnant, for sure.

254
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,510
Grand Prince, I did well, right?

255
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,290
Grand Prince, Grand Prince!

256
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,880
Grand Prince, you must be busy with state affairs.

257
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
What brings you here?

258
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,640
No matter how much I think about it,

259
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,590
I reckoned it cannot be overlooked. So I came running.

260
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,610
Did another problem break out?

261
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,240
It did.

262
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,860
And it is a serious matter.

263
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,960
I had a dream last night.

264
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,530
A large dragon was embracing the Queen's pavilion.

265
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,210
I had a weird feeling and asked High Priest Chung Ta.

266
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,260
She said it must be a highly fortunate conception dream.

267
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,250
Now that I see, Your Majesty, your complexion looks quite rough.

268
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,990
My dream is a conception dream, right?

269
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,640
Grand Prince, that is total nonsense-

270
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,430
It is.

271
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,710
I did not tell anyone because I was being cautious.

272
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,590
But as expected, you are special because you are the uncle.

273
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,670
What great news!

274
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,780
Your Majesty,

275
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,880
I sincerely congratulate you.

276
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,470
Head Minister, congratulations.

277
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,470
You will now become a grandfather.

278
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,480
Father did not know, either.

279
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,560
I apologize for not having told you.

280
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,250
Oh, yes, Queen.

281
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,410
His Majesty should be a part of this joyful news.

282
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,290
But he is fighting an illness, and it makes me sad.

283
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,880
Exactly so.

284
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,990
But still, I feel so reassured to have you here, Grand Prince.

285
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,590
Yes, I will protect the baby

286
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,360
in your womb without fail as his uncle.

287
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,980
As expected, I was right to bring that person.

288
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,170
Pardon?

289
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,550
To serve Your Majesty, the precious one, with even more care,

290
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,420
I brought a trustworthy bodyguard.

291
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,250
Come in.

292
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,710
What are you waiting for?

293
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,240
Come in and offer your greetings.

294
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,570
Officer Ji will protect you starting today, Your Majesty.

295
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:59,520
Grand Prince, this man is His Majesty's bodyguard.

296
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,030
Since you are pardoning him anyway, why not send him to His Majesty-

297
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:10,160
My subordinates are protecting His Majesty rigorously, so do not worry.

298
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,940
I heard Officer Ji was taken in by Your Majesty's family.

299
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,710
The baby in the womb will also be at ease

300
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,220
if Her Majesty is served by someone she used to know.

301
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,990
Aigoo, now that I think about it,

302
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,850
this man also found out about Her Majesty's pregnancy.

303
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,410
Officer Ji, you must protect Her Majesty with your life.

304
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,060
Do you understand?

305
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,600
I might as well use your room.

306
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,440
Did you meet Yeon Wol?

307
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,310
How was your talk with her?

308
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,230
Was she not surprised to see you?

309
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,760
What took you so long?

310
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,200
Gosh, ask me one thing at a time.

311
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,550
Could it be that Yeon Wol left soon after?

312
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,800
Yes, she sends her regards to you.

313
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,440
Aigoo.

314
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,440
She left.

315
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,020
Without even a farewell.

316
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,360
I am kidding.

317
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,850
She is at the villa right now.

318
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,400
R-Really?

319
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,520
I stopped her from leaving and told her to be with me.

320
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,760
Thank you, Ak Hee.

321
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,680
H-Hey, I am not fully healed here.

322
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,430
Anyhow, thank you.

323
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,870
Why thank me? I only told my woman-

324
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,200
What were you going to say?

325
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,890
You can go now.

326
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,670
Can I really do that?

327
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,320
Help the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

328
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,610
If you do, I will stick the blade in Sajo Hyun's body.

329
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,320
Will Sir Ak Hee yield tomorrow?

330
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,270
I told him the wound needs to be disinfected again tomorrow, right?

331
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,240
Should I not have said that?

332
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,220
Sir Ak Hee.

333
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,930
You are trying not to fall asleep, right?

334
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,630
Your Majesty?

335
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,160
It is Your Majesty, right?

336
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,700
Your Majesty.

337
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,670
Your Majesty.

338
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,530
I mean...

339
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,640
how did you recognize me when it is this dark?

340
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,950
Just a feeling.

341
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:20,530
♫ Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment ♫

342
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,880
I was too harsh on you at Prince Ga Ron's royal villa.

343
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,490
I was too shocked.

344
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,460
It is okay. I understand.

345
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,580
But still, I was able to save you because Ak Hee could read my mind.

346
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,640
I am really glad Sir Ak Hee did not lose his memories.

347
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,260
However, that is really...

348
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:49,720
Ak Hee can see my memories, but I cannot.

349
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,680
I heard that is how it was from the beginning.

350
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:00,470
Could it be because you thought you could not do it from the beginning?

351
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,030
It is because I never tried to do it?

352
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,500
I did try earlier.

353
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,090
Try harder until your brain starts sweating.

354
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,270
Until it sweats?

355
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:24,190
♫ So that I can feel the faint sound of you breathing ♫

356
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,150
Yes.

357
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,500
Focus your strength right here.

358
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:43,210
♫ Even if the memories get erased and become blurry ♫

359
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:50,600
♫ Your warmth remains in my heart ♫

360
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:58,430
♫ Even if you become wind and cannot hold you ♫

361
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,350
Your brain must be sweaty.

362
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:10,270
♫ I'll stay here and wait for you ♫

363
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,790
♫ Even if you disappear again tomorrow, I will wait ♫

364
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,500
Is it refreshing?

365
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,910
It is refreshing, and it is cold.

366
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:28,270
♫ So that I can feel the faint sound of you breathing ♫

367
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,220
How is it? Is it refreshing?

368
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,380
It is very refreshing.

369
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,020
Have some more.

370
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,810
They are having the time of their lives.

371
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:54,550
Just let the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong deal with the bothersome throne.

372
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:58,130
Go far away with Kyera and

373
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,110
live happily ever after, Sir Ak Hee.

374
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,660
Is this also an herb?

375
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,260
Oh, this is a medicinal herb good for the eyes.

376
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,900
Sir Ak Hee's eyes keep getting worse.

377
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,600
Did something get in your eye?

378
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,200
I think my eyes keep getting blurry as well.

379
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,250
I will give you some as well, Your Majesty.

380
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,100
Gosh, I will give you a lot.

381
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,250
I think dirt got in for real.

382
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,060
Let me see.

383
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,910
Open your eye.

384
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,350
Aigoo, stop overreacting and bear it.

385
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,300
I am sorry.

386
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,980
For what?

387
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,960
I am sorry for liking you this much when I have the Queen.

388
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,230
I am sorry-

389
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,240
I would like to come pick greens again tomorrow.

390
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,080
Tomorrow is Sir Ak Hee's turn to wake up.

391
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,380
Oh, in that case, the day after tomorrow?

392
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,950
S-Sure thing.

393
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:47,000
And also, it will be dangerous for Ak Hee to come

394
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,880
pick greens because his eyes are bad.

395
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,590
I reckon it would be better for Ak Hee to just stay in bed.

396
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,740
Yes!

397
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,020
I will make sure Sir Ak Hee stays in bed all day.

398
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,800
I thought you were taken by a tiger while picking greens.

399
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,020
You did not even gather that much greens, either.

400
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,940
What were you two doing?

401
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,510
So, where are you coming from?

402
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,430
The market, so I can make a delicious dinner later.

403
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,820
Ji Jeon!

404
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,600
Aigoo, Ji Jeon, you were released, huh?

405
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,400
You went through so much. Look how much you waned.

406
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,810
Your Majesty.

407
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,810
He is Officer Ji, who used to guard you, Your Majesty.

408
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,730
Ji Jeon, you did not come alone?

409
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,640
Her Majesty has arrived.

410
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,030
What?

411
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,620
The Queen?

412
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,620
Your Majesty, where have you been?

413
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,560
I was coming to meet you because I was worried.

414
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,950
What brings you here, My Queen?

415
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,890
What do you mean?

416
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,620
Would there be a reason for a wife to come see her husband?

417
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,920
Who do we have here? Are you not Yeon Wol?

418
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,280
Have you been doing well?

419
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

420
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,990
Your Majesty, the wind is cold.

421
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,780
It is.

422
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,210
I should go inside.

423
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,470
My Queen, are you unwell?

424
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:54,810
Yes, I am a little unwell.

425
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,980
I will do it.

426
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,210
Is she sick?

427
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:39,350
In fact, I came to deliver joyful news to you, Your Majesty.

428
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,210
I have...

429
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,640
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

430
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,620
Her Majesty is with a child.

431
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,890
With a child?

432
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,960
S-Sajo Yoong, you scum.

433
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,050
W-With a child?

434
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,540
I found out a while ago.

435
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,110
But I get to tell you now because I kept quiet since it is an important and cautious matter.

436
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:31,270
I am sorry I could not inform you sooner, Your Majesty.

437
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,760
Yeon Wol, why are you standing there?

438
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,540
The sun is hot. Come on up here.

439
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,870
Yeon Wol, will you congratulate me on my pregnancy?

440
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,370
You were once my servant.

441
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:06,020
I heard you used to be a palace maid in the royal kitchen.

442
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,140
Did you also serve the Queen?

443
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,740
Yes, she did. Only very briefly.

444
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:20,930
Congratulations on your pregnancy, Your Majesty.

445
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,840
Thank you.

446
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,790
Thank you for making this long trip.

447
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,580
Rest comfortably in the master bedroom.

448
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,620
Yes, I made this long trip because I missed you so much.

449
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,780
But I am actually quite tired.

450
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,290
Let Her Majesty rest in my bed.

451
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,930
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- No.

452
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,950
Could you do it, Yeon Wol?

453
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,500
I am glad to see you in a long time.

454
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

455
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,490
Eunuch Neung.

456
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

457
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:36,400
Eunuch Neung, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong said to remember the promise.

458
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,510
I am sorry, Eunuch Neung.

459
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,420
Your Majesty.

460
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,240
Why are you still lingering around His Majesty?

461
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,010
Did you really...

462
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,850
bear His Majesty's child?

463
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,440
What?

464
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,510
You wicked wench!

465
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,030
Be careful.

466
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,920
You will get hurt.

467
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,840
It is His Majesty's child I conceived from sleeping with His Majesty.

468
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,520
What an idiot.

469
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,540
Did you think your behavior with His Majesty was love?

470
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,840
Did you mistake him to be sincere?

471
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,590
Do you think His Majesty really loved you, you lowly wench?

472
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,420
Get lost, you wench.

473
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,310
Do not ever come near His Majesty again.

474
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,260
If I see you one more time,

475
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,310
I will rip you into pieces alive!

476
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,420
If your pregnancy is true, consider your baby in the womb.

477
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,260
Such harsh language is bad for prenatal care.

478
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,790
What?

479
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Eunuch Neung, did I really...

480
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,050
Did I really have a good relationship with the Queen?

481
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,150
You were kind to everyone, Your Majesty.

482
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,950
Are you saying I turned my eyes to another woman

483
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,020
when I had a good relationship with the Queen?

484
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,710
Answer me, Eunuch Neung.

485
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,780
You are the only one I can trust right now.

486
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,260
Your Majesty, the thing is...

487
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,200
The moment you spout nonsense,

488
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,040
your old mother, your brother couple, and your young nieces and nephews

489
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,980
will all be torn apart limb from limb.

490
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,200
I do not really know, either.

491
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,910
Did you used to be my bodyguard?

492
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

493
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,450
Is Yeon Wol still serving her?

494
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,800
She left just now.

495
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,680
Her Majesty is with a child.

496
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,520
W-With a child?

497
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,370
There is no way.

498
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,690
There is no way.

499
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,200
What an idiot.

500
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,970
Did you think your behavior with His Majesty was love?

501
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,520
Did you mistake him to be sincere?

502
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,020
Master Yang.

503
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,720
Have you realized everything now?

504
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,780
Everyone is conspiring to mock His Majesty.

505
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,850
We cannot let things be.

506
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,090
Why did you become so foolish?

507
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,590
Did your love for His Majesty do this to you?

508
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,240
What can you do by going back to that house?

509
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,940
What will you do with His Majesty, who lost his memories?

510
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,260
The Queen even became pregnant.

511
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,870
What are you even going to do?

512
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,370
I will not stand by and watch anymore.

513
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,000
If you will not forsake everything and follow me,

514
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,880
this will be the end of our connection.

515
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,160
Master-

516
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,860
What am I going to do by meeting her?

517
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,680
What excuse am I trying to give?

518
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,260
I do not have the right.

519
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,900
Sajo Hyun would never do that.

520
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,190
Once she loses all feelings of love for Sajo Hyun,

521
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,790
Kyera will not have any other choice.

522
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,770
H-How will she lose all feelings of love?

523
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,350
She is bound to end up that way.

524
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:41,450
This is really your final chance, Ak Hee.

525
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,280
That was why.

526
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,530
I am standing at the edge of a cliff right now.

527
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,930
And all my memories are gone.

528
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,080
What should I do?

529
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,720
Who should I trust?

530
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,770
Ak Hee, let us have a talk.

531
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,720
Please summon me.

532
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,040
Ak Hee, summon me to that room.

533
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,850
I cannot go there on my own yet.

534
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,680
Gosh, if I face this bastard right now,

535
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,920
I will have to lie to him.

536
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,880
Hey, come to your senses.

537
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,450
You are an evil spirit.

538
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,310
Guilt does not suit you.

539
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:57,220
Ak Hee, Ak Hee!

540
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,990
If there is no way to regain my memories,

541
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,910
I need to read Ak Hee's mind, at least.

542
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,640
I will be able to read it.

543
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,900
I will be able to read it.

544
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,790
Sir Ak Hee.

545
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,760
I must tell His Majesty the honest truth.

546
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,540
Mother, I am sorry.

547
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,720
I am sorry, Eunuch Neung.

548
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:36,220
Ak Hee, I have to meet you this way since you will not summon me.

549
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:11,030
Looks like Officer Ji delivered my words properly.

550
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,630
Is it to your liking?

551
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,200
The current situation I prepared for you, Sir Ak Hee.

552
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,310
Everything exists for your sake, Sir Ak Hee.

553
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,400
Are you even human?

554
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,390
I may not be human!

555
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,330
I may be an evil spirit like you.

556
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,500
You are doing all this to become the king, right?

557
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,690
Wow, you are really something else.

558
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:44,430
It is natural for me to become the king.

559
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,130
The method is what matters.

560
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,710
I want a peaceful passing of the crown.

561
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,610
Peaceful passing of the crown?

562
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:57,070
You are scared because people are saying you are the most wicked of them all.

563
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,880
Those who yearn for the restoration of the Royal Family of Yeon.

564
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,380
Those who support Sajo Hyun.

565
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,810
There are even those who doubt my legitimacy to the throne.

566
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:08,050
In order to silence them at once,

567
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,290
peaceful passing of the crown will be best.

568
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,560
Will Sajo Hyun just watch, huh?

569
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,330
Though he lost his memories, he is very smart.

570
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:18,960
That is why I am saying I need your help.

571
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,300
The day you allow the passing of the crown,

572
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,860
Chung Ta will perform geuminsal on Sajo Hyun.

573
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,840
I heard it from Chung Ta.

574
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,000
That you will disappear soon.

575
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,710
So, this is really a trade that is good for you, me, and everyone else.

576
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,460
Use honorifics.

577
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,320
I am the king.

578
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:48,070
Would this not be what you call the best trade, Your Majesty?

579
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,050
How would I know if you will keep your promise or not?

580
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,720
That is the same for me as well.

581
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:01,370
Would it not also be quite fun to doubt and suspect each other

582
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:05,900
until the very last moment, Your Majesty?

583
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,590
I will not disappear.

584
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,350
You were avoiding me. So what brings you here?

585
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,840
I am going back to the Palace tomorrow.

586
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,840
Did you already come to an agreement?

587
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,650
Since I recovered, I cannot very well stay here forever.

588
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,950
Ak Hee, regarding the Queen, did you-

589
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:25,070
Am I the one who impregnated the Queen?

590
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,170
Tell me honestly.

591
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,540
Why would I?

592
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:39,040
I have a woman I love. So, why would I?

593
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,140
You had a woman you love?

594
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,800
Who is it?

595
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,180
Hey, Sajo Hyun.

596
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:55,150
There is something you are mistaken about.

597
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,540
Kyera- No.

598
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:00,950
Yeon Wol...

599
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,500
is in a relationship with me.

600
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:06,890
What?

601
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,990
I got to know her while roaming outside the Palace and came to like her.

602
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:15,310
Back then, you had your queen...

603
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,530
Kyera and I liked each other so much that I took her in as a concubine.

604
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,220
I took her in as a concubine.

605
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,780
A concubine?

606
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:25,430
Did I just sit back?

607
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,560
I did nothing when you took in a concubine-

608
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,930
Would you have done nothing, you ask?

609
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,860
You made such a scene.

610
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,370
You and I fought a lot.

611
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:37,110
Aigoo, when I think about back then...

612
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,790
There is no way.

613
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,440
- Yeon Wol-
- Would not have liked me instead of you?

614
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,970
There is no way since she was so kind to you?

615
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,380
Hey, she did all that because

616
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,370
you need to recover and get your memories back for me to live.

617
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:58,480
You cannot mistake such things.

618
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,950
Why are you telling me this only now?

619
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,940
You kept quiet all this time, so why now-

620
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,990
Well, it has been chaotic and...

621
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:10,030
you seemed to like Kyera.

622
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:14,340
So, I did not know how to bring this up.

623
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,300
But the Queen suddenly came.

624
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,180
So, I cannot help but tell you the truth.

625
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,830
I am sorry-

626
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,910
Well, what? What is it?

627
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,320
Well...

628
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,980
nothing happened between you two already, right

629
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:52,130
I have been sick for a while, so I could not look into the world.

630
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,060
I see.

631
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,410
Aigoo, you are too kind.

632
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,830
Anyhow, I am sorry.

633
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,210
Things became complicated because of me.

634
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,450
Be good to the Queen.

635
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:17,090
The Queen went through a lot because I brought Kyera as my concubine.

636
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,410
More tightly.

637
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,610
It was all a misunderstanding?

638
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:08,780
Yeon Wol was Ak Hee's woman?

639
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,650
Her Majesty is with a child.

640
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,390
Will you be able to leave tomorrow like this?

641
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,680
I will leave.

642
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,370
Go back to Sajo Hyun.

643
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:54,650
Go tell him everything, honestly

644
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,890
and become Sajo Hyun's concubine again.

645
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,760
Master Yang, how can you say that?

646
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,350
I do not wish to see you like this anymore.

647
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:05,500
Have you no shame to face the people wishing for the restoration of the Royal Family of Yeon?

648
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,700
What would they say if they found out about this?

649
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,410
Master Yang, I know I cannot repay you for saving my life and

650
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:16,220
taking care of me thus far, even with my death. However,

651
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,180
I do not want any more violence or killing.

652
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,100
In that case,

653
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,150
we will have to part ways now.

654
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,890
Master Yang.

655
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,570
Do not think you are indebted to me.

656
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,120
I only did my duty as a vassal of the Yeon Family.

657
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,310
I will no longer live for your sake now that you have changed like this.

658
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,950
Let us go our own ways tomorrow morning.

659
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,490
Master Yang.

660
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:21,910
This is a treasure as valuable as my life that I inherited from my late father.

661
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:23,930
I will leave this here.

662
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,530
Make sure to...

663
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,280
keep your promise.

664
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,550
Master Yang?

665
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,720
Master Yang, are we parting ways with Kyera like this?

666
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,370
You are really too harsh!

667
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:01,970
Ha Rang, go and bring Wind Knife from the western valley.

668
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:03,420
Right now.

669
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,820
Yes.

670
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,330
Master Yang.

671
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:15,490
Please be careful.

672
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:45,420
It would be great if I could read Ak Hee's mind.

673
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,060
Do not waste your energy, Sajo Hyun.

674
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,200
You are making me feel worse.

675
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,240
I can read it.

676
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,890
I can read Ak Hee's memory.

677
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,590
I will take your life today.

678
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:16,130
You seem fake for some reason- I am sorry.

679
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,550
Please take care, Your Majesty.

680
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,350
Master Yang?

681
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:57,580
Master Yang, what is the matter?

682
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,490
- Master Yang.
- Your Majesty.

683
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:01,500
Have you forgotten...

684
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,940
the promise you made to me?

685
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:12,400
Can you give me a chance, please?

686
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,380
Can you watch me take care of the wicked doings of the previous king

687
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:22,350
and build a country where the despaired people live with hope yet again?

688
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,740
Kill me with this sword.

689
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:35,110
- Your Majesty-
- If I do not keep my promise or

690
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,460
if I follow the previous king's footsteps,

691
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,120
do not hesitate to kill me with this sword, then.

692
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,800
- That is-
- It has to be you, Yang Jae Yi.

693
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,320
It has to be you and

694
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,130
no one else who will slash my neck.

695
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,900
What promise did I make to you? Tell me.

696
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,700
You told me to strike you with this sword if you go down the wrong path.

697
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,390
You are going down the wrong path right now, Your Majesty.

698
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,100
- Shut up, Master Yang!
- Officer Ji!

699
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:07,260
You only loved Lady Yeon Wol, Your Majesty.

700
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,060
Lady Yeon Wol offered her everything for your sake.

701
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,160
Please realize this fact and

702
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,170
do not let the Queen and Sajo Yoong deceive you.

703
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,280
- Master Yang!
- Master Yang!

704
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,920
Your Majesty, it is dangerous.

705
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,520
Please escape!

706
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,250
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

707
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,510
Please protect Lady Yeon Wol!

708
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:37,560
You are the only one for My Lady!

709
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,480
Your Majesty!

710
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,720
Master Yang!

711
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:57,080
Do not come. Kyera!

712
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,890
Master Yang.

713
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:39,460
Please do not move.

714
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,540
Lady Yeon Wol,

715
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:52,450
I am sorry I could not do as you wished.

716
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,960
Please...

717
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,210
Master Yang.

718
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:32,630
Master Yang.

719
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,840
Master Yang, Master Yang!

720
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,470
Master Yang!

721
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,170
A fake is fake forever. As expected, there is no sincerity.

722
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:00,320
You seem fake for some reason.

723
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,000
I know you like me, Kyera.

724
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,600
I clearly felt it.

725
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:13,250
That must be because I thought you were His Majesty, Sir Ak Hee.

726
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,540
- I am sorry.
- That is not true.

727
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,600
T-That cannot be.

728
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,020
Ak Hee, perform geuminsal on Sajo Hyun.

729
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:36,020
Would this not be what you call the best trade, Your Majesty?

730
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,440
Ak Hee.

731
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,520
He was lying.

732
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:53,020
Yeon Wol, Yeon Wol!

733
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,540
♫ Because I was always you ♫

734
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:01,500
♫ And you were always me ♫

735
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:07,750
♫ I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere ♫

736
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:16,280
♫ The place where you are, even if it'll only be a moment ♫

737
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:20,430
♫ Please take me anywhere ♫

738
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:24,810
[Love Song for Illusion]

739
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,910
We were never meant to be.

740
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:31,200
I must not look into my mind carelessly.

741
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,270
Who is it?

742
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:34,670
The father of the baby in your womb.

743
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:36,470
What you think is right, Grand Prince.

744
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,710
My memories came back.

745
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:41,120
Do whatever it takes and get rid of Sajo Hyun.

746
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,910
I am going to read all of Ak Hee's memories while I am here.

747
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:49,700
I will put the seal on this after I confirm Sajo Hyun is gone.

748
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,420
What did you do to His Majesty?

749
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,630
What did you do?

750
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:56,480
I am sorry, Kyera.
