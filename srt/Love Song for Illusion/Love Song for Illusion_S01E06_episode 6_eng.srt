9
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,990
Consort Hyo!

10
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,940
You were alive?

11
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,290
W-What is going on here?

12
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,730
W-What happened to me?

13
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,450
 He changed. 

14
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,240
Crown Prince?

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,300
Did you run away safely?

16
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,430
Are you the crown prince?

17
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,350
If I am not the crown prince, would I be the evil spirit?

18
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,860
Is anyone out there?

19
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,530
Ji Jeon Seo!

20
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,830
W-What are you doing?

21
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,550
 He is cold. But he was warm up until just now. 

22
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,810
Where did he go?

23
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,180
Who?

24
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,370
Sir Ak Hee.

25
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,910
I finally came back to my body,

26
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,480
yet you are only looking for Ak Hee?

27
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,160
Ji Jeon Seo!

28
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,210
Ji Jeon Seo!

29
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,090
No one is here. It was only Sir Ak Hee—

30
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,730
I mean...

31
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,340
Because you and I fell off the cliff while trying to run away.

32
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,150
The cliff?

33
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,840
Are you having chills?

34
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,860
I must pull myself together.

35
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,410
I will not let Ak Hee take over this body again.

36
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,550
A-Are you injured?

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,320
D-Does it hurt a lot?

38
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,160
How unbelievable.

39
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,040
How can there be two people in one body?

40
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,750
Ak Hee is not a person, to be exact.

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,150
He is only a fake.

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,450
 A fake? 

43
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,960
 This thing. And this thing does not fit. 

44
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,330
 You seem fake for some reason. 

45
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,340
 Not at all. 

46
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,550
 A fake is fake forever. 

47
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,190
 Apologize. I am really not a fake. Okay? 

48
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,750
 That was why he did not like being called a fake. 

49
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,950
Ak Hee hates being called a fake more than anything.

50
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,160
Is Sir Ak Hee not human, then?

51
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,590
Is he something like a goblin or a ghost?

52
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,470
I do not know, either.

53
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,220
He barged in one day out of nowhere and started living in this body.

54
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,540
Whether he is a goblin or an apparition, he is a lowly being with no sense of conscience.

55
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,270
I heard you gave him your heart,

56
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,860
not knowing what he is like. How naïve.

57
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,470
I mean—

58
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,860
The sun will set soon.

59
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,150
We must hurry.

60
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,000
Get on my back.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,360
I am fine.

62
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,110
Come on.

63
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,020
How long are we going to circle around here?

64
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,660
I think your chills are getting worse.

65
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,570
I am okay.

66
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,580
It seems to be even worse because your body is always cold.

67
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,410
You said Ak Hee felt warm. Right?

68
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,770
Yes.

69
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,750
It must have been nice since he was warm.

70
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,400
He would have kept you warm even when you were soaked like this.

71
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,370
I do not know if he would keep me warm, but he would be in much pain.

72
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,350
He would be in pain?

73
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,160
He seemed to feel pain when he got in contact with my body.

74
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,970
Pain, huh?

75
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,540
I guess he could not even lay a finger on you because of the pain.

76
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,570
Poor bastard.

77
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,650
But he seemed to endure as much as he could.

78
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,200
 As much as he could? 

79
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,250
Does that mean he endured as much as he could to brush past you?

80
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,300
Did he only brush past or

81
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,160
d-did he actually touch you?

82
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,010
You should hurry.

83
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,000
The sun is setting.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,030
Are you ordering me around while you are riding on my back?

85
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,220
I apologize.

86
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,160
Wait!  W-Why am I suddenly here? Why?

87
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,330
W-Why on Earth did I come back here? Why?

88
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,460
Gosh, the mood was great.

89
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,170
I am sure Kyera liked it, too!

90
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,150
W-Why am I back here?

91
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,160
 If personal feelings of love seep into you, 

92
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,060
 your energy will weaken. 

93
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,620
 If you want to crash the Crown Prince Sajo Hyeon with bonghamsal, 

94
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,760
 you have to save your power. 

95
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,810
 Alas! 

96
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,200
 The moment your love for Consort Hyo 

97
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,100
 turns... 

98
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,060
 into a man's... 

99
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,490
 l-lust for a woman, 

100
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:17,910
 you will be dragged into the heart's space far, far away. 

101
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,010
 W-Wait, hold on. 

102
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,480
 I cannot love or lust. How come I cannot do so many things? 

103
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,990
 Well, should we call it quits, then? 

104
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,110
 H-Huh? No, do it. 

105
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,420
 I should be satisfied with being by her side. 

106
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,810
That was why!

107
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,490
 Sajo Hyeon, come here! Huh? 

108
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,490
 Come over here for a moment! 

109
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,390
Are your chills getting worse?

110
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,430
No, I am fine.

111
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,680
 Hey! 

112
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,580
He was summoned right away when I called him before. Why is he not coming now?

113
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,870
Is it because I was sealed by bonghamsal once?

114
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,560
Cheong Ta, you...

115
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,770
T-There is a village here.

116
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,850
Are you able to tell where this is?

117
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,590
I think it is about 30 ri away from the palace. 
  (1 ri = 400 m) 

118
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,240
3-30 ri?

119
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,310
Gosh, I need to get back to the palace quickly.

120
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,180
Why did Ak Hee come all the way here?

121
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,420
It was not this far.

122
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,680
After we fell off the cliff to evade the killers,

123
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,520
we ended up here because of the current.

124
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,600
They were killers sent by the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

125
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,700
Yes, I am sure they were.

126
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,100
 I know who murdered His Majesty. 

127
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,070
 Who was it? 

128
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,570
 Who was the one who murdered His Majesty? 

129
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,620
 You want to know. Right? 

130
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,880
 Then... 

131
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,550
 Then, release me from here first. 

132
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,510
 Do not try to play petty tricks on me, Ak Hee. 

133
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,500
 Your brother! 

134
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,590
 It was your brother! 

135
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,150
 Sajo Yoong. 

136
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,740
 Why? 

137
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,060
 Why would Brother... 

138
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,520
 Even if he was blinded by the throne, no way... 

139
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,250
 No way would he kill his father? 

140
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,610
 Sajo Yoong could do worse things. 

141
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,080
 He is not even his biological father. What is there to hesitate? 

142
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,210
 Brother is not a biological son? 

143
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,950
 You really have no interest in your family matters. 

144
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,540
 Right! Do you even know Sajo Yoong is raising a secret army? 

145
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,810
 A secret army? 

146
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,100
 This is seriously bad. 

147
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,410
 Anyhow, I will take care of everything. 

148
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,560
 So, release me from here first. Okay? 

149
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,900
You already know about Grand Prince Sajo Yoong?

150
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,100
Do you think there are things I do not know? I only pretended not to know.

151
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,860
Ak Hee was talking big, but he got what he deserved.

152
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,820
Oh, you already talked about it with Sir Ak Hee.

153
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,440
So I can run away.

154
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,130
It is not that we talked about it.

155
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,410
I was the one who ordered Ak Hee to do so.

156
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,090
From what I heard, Sir Ak Hee is the one who convinced you.

157
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,050
Are you defending Ak Hee again?

158
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,400
Also, it bothers me to hear "Sir Ak Hee."

159
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,800
I cannot just call him Ak Hee.

160
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,740
He is someone who resides in your body, Crown Prince.

161
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,060
Did you disagree with Ak Hee on everything like this, too?

162
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,010
Sir Ak Hee does not argue on every matter like this.

163
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,390
Gosh, I am getting the chills.

164
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,770
Your clothes are almost dry.

165
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,610
We will be able to find a way to get back to the capital in this village.

166
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,190
Please travel safely.

167
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,790
I never told you...

168
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,370
to leave.

169
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,610
You said you ordered me to run away.

170
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,490
Am I not supposed to leave?

171
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,040
You cannot.

172
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,930
Why—

173
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
You must still think I am a criminal.

174
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,350
Now that I think about it, I am still skeptical about some aspects.

175
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,310
If so, please arrest me again.

176
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,330
Gosh, how fickle.

177
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,850
Fickle—

178
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,490
Why do you think I went so far as to take the chance of releasing Ak Hee from bonghamsal?

179
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,870
This was all for your—

180
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,860
Sure, I will arrest you from now on.

181
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,970
You may not travel freely without my permission from hereon.

182
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,440
Sure thing, Your Highness.

183
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,620
Would you like to tie my hands, too?

184
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,360
That is fine.

185
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,620
You just need to stay by my side and...

186
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,200
It seems the local dogs are alarmed by strange scents.

187
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,830
Lower your knees quietly and look away—

188
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,180
What?

189
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,370
Consort Hyo jumped into the river?

190
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,480
Was she with the crown prince?

191
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,140
He did not seem to be the crown prince because he was good at martial arts.

192
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,080
I am not sure who it was,

193
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,230
but he was wearing a mask.

194
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,120
It was found at a river bank, miles away from the cliff.

195
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,730
You must find and bring me the corpse.

196
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,120
Search every river and mountain and bring me the corpse.

197
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,700
Yes, Grand Prince.

198
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,360
Even you are in this state, so that wretched Ak Hee—

199
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,800
I wonder if the crown prince is all right.

200
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,040
How did you realize Sir Ak Hee had switched with him?

201
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,160
It is so obvious!

202
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,430
I served His Highness since he was this tall.

203
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,670
Right when he grabbed the crown princess's wrist and said,

204
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,740
"Your pretty wrist will get hurt, Crown Princess..."

205
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,450
I knew something was off since then.

206
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,070
Could bonghamsal have been lifted?

207
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,070
That is what I am saying!

208
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,090
Cheong Ta, that fraud of a shaman, the next time I see her, I will—

209
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,540
M-My goodness!

210
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,970
How did you come in here?

211
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,900
Are you a ghost or something? My heart dropped.

212
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,550
It stings a lot, right?

213
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,240
Let me rub it on you.

214
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,240
E-Eunuch Neung—

215
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,620
   

216
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,630
   

217
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,900
Are you redoing bonghamsal?

218
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,610
We need to lock him up again.

219
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,530
Gosh, this is so ridiculous.

220
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,190
What, "that fraud"?

221
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,440
I will let you know clearly.

222
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:37,040
Sir Ak Hee did not break free from bonghamsal because I am a fraud.

223
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,760
I am sure His Highness Sajo Hyeon released him.

224
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,420
Gosh, it is not like His Highness lost his mind.

225
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,460
Why would he bother to wake up Ak Hee from his slumber?

226
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,070
No one knows.

227
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:02,990
Perhaps he lost control over something here, not his mind.

228
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,210
When love seeps deep into your heart,

229
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,740
your judgment becomes blinded.

230
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,730
That is what love is.

231
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,100
I will go stand guard outside.

232
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,160
It will be done soon—

233
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,080
- Let me come with you— 
 - Show your respect!

234
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
And kneel down.

235
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,140
Did it work?

236
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,260
It worked, right? Gosh, how great!

237
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,880
It is not working.

238
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,580
It will not work.

239
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,450
It must be because the target is not here.

240
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,630
What do we do about this?

241
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,760
You really had to—

242
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,920
This is the only way.

243
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,620
If we go around in this getup, we will be spotted in no time.

244
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,860
Wait—

245
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,590
I do not wish to become a thief.

246
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,550
Then, I will be the only one wearing it.

247
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,600
What now?

248
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,600
I-I do not want to become a thief.

249
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,540
Did you have to make me look like this?

250
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,790
You still shine dressed like this.

251
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,830
You even joke now.

252
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,470
You are hungry. Right?

253
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,980
I do not think that sound was from me.

254
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,480
I heard it all—

255
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,000
Was that really your last ring?

256
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,310
- That was the last one. 
 - You should have told me early on.

257
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,020
That ring would have been enough for 100 bowls of soup and rice.

258
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:06,430
Are you saying we should have stolen these clothes—

259
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:15,600
I am traveling with that man there, but I am...

260
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,300
- Come have a seat this way. 
 - Thank you.

261
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,050
I put more in there just for you.

262
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,290
Thank you.

263
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,470
Gosh, thank you so much.

264
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,250
You look fine outside, but starve your wife and child?

265
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,560
I am treating you because your wife said she is due very soon.

266
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,850
So, eat this to cheer up and do your job as a man starting tomorrow.

267
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,350
W-What job are you talking about?

268
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,670
I am telling you to earn a living!

269
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,330
If you go over there, you can easily get hired as a farmhand.

270
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,840
Wait, is she—

271
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,880
Let us eat.

272
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,190
Did you lie because you could not steal?

273
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,140
How dare you turn me into a punk who starves his wife and child?

274
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,640
Gosh! See what I mean?

275
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,520
Incompetent husbands always get loud in front of their wives!

276
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,750
- Should I take it away? 
 - N-No, this is...

277
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,370
Be good to your wife.

278
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,950
How nice is it? Since Sajo Seung, the tyrant, is off to the afterlife,

279
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,980
a peaceful time is bound to start now.

280
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,950
Gosh, ma'am, it is too early to feel rest assured.

281
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,850
His son is still there.

282
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,290
Once that punk becomes the king,

283
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,690
it will be the same shit because he is just like his dad.

284
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,890
Do you think so?

285
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,330
It would be great if his son would also die suddenly like him.

286
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,620
Come on, the crown prince cannot become the king.

287
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,250
I heard he is a half-wit,

288
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,090
who lost his mind from madness.

289
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,760
No, that is all a false rumor—

290
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,980
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong would be the perfect king.

291
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,250
Seriously.

292
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,640
I heard the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is ever so great.

293
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,660
And righteous.

294
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,810
Gosh, even my youngest son is all for Grand Prince Sajo Yoong,

295
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,960
saying he is the hero we need.

296
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,980
How do you know about the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong so well?

297
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,640
Whoa! How are you so unaware, young lady?

298
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,930
The Grand Prince gave food to the poor and

299
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,000
treatment for the ill.

300
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,360
He has been helping all this time.

301
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,300
Are there a lot of people who received help? You, too, ma'am?

302
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,790
Huh? No, not me.

303
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,980
The rumors are widespread.

304
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:56,870
That is why people gathered at the capital to make the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong the king.

305
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,660
Right, I heard your youngest son went there, too.

306
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,170
He did go because his friends in the neighborhood wanted to go.

307
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:09,040
Gosh, I just cannot sleep these days because I am so worried—

308
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,520
- Oh, no, what is wrong? 
 - Oh no!  Goodness, what is wrong with me?

309
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,810
Gosh, ma'am! What is wrong?

310
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,940
What is wrong? What is the matter? Ma'am, what is wrong?

311
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,100
Let me take a look.

312
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,140
Thank you, young lady.

313
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,740
I did not even realize I had indigestion.

314
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,090
It feels much better now.

315
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,680
You have indigestion, and your circulation is not good, either.

316
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,650
Looks like you had a lot of worries all this time.

317
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,540
Of course, I do.

318
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,370
My husband was executed during Sajo Seung's rebellion and

319
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,960
my older son died after he was taken to build the king's castle.

320
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,320
Now, even my youngest son went to the capital like that, so I cannot—

321
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,580
You cannot keep crying like this.

322
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,730
Please ease your heart and sleep.

323
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,320
Among the herbs you got me, I took out the ones that are good for you.

324
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,610
Make sure to drink them as tea.

325
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,620
We will take our leave now.

326
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,310
Huh? Gosh, where are you going this late at night?

327
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,340
- Spend the night here. 
 - Goodness...

328
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,050
We have a long way to go.

329
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,110
Gosh, seriously!

330
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,300
Your wife is bearing a child!

331
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,470
You two can sleep here and go on when dawn breaks.

332
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,250
Wait! How can two people—

333
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,920
I am going to sleep in my youngest son's room.

334
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,420
No, it is okay.

335
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,360
H-How can the two of us sleep here by ourselves?

336
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,960
What now? Do you want me to sleep with you two or something?

337
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,840
A married couple does not have to stay apart, so what is the matter?

338
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,780
N-No, it is okay. We are too busy to stay.

339
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,350
The wild dogs are everywhere right now because it is nighttime.

340
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,440
What are you going to do? Goodness sakes.

341
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,840
Gosh, he is more stubborn than a mule.

342
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,120
He only has his handsome face to show for it.

343
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,380
Treat yourself to the warm floor and get some sleep.

344
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,480
Ma'am...

345
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,580
You should get some rest.

346
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,550
Do not let what the villagers said earlier bother you too much.

347
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,560
Don't people talk about the misfortunes of others when they are not around?

348
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,210
Is that supposed to console me?

349
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,350
Who was the person who was treated the most harshly by the king?

350
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,200
Maybe you are not consoling me.

351
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,500
It might be satisfying for you.

352
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,920
I will do it.

353
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,660
How can I rest if you keep making a noise like this next to me?

354
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,350
You are quite good.

355
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,450
It looks like you forgot that I make clothes.

356
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,810
I did not know Brother Yoong was so trusted by the people.

357
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:05,010
In my opinion, they are only saying these things after hearing the rumors.

358
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:10,340
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong must have manipulated public opinion to go after the throne.

359
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,280
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong has been sponsoring the Wind Knives for a long time.

360
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,490
The organization I was a part of.

361
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,360
The group of assassins?

362
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,640
Building a secret army,

363
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,600
sponsoring assassins, and manipulating the public, too?

364
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,070
Sajo Seung, the tyrant, is finally gone!

365
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,650
We cannot let Sajo Seung's half-witted son take this country!

366
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,110
Let us rise with courage!

367
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,230
 Rise with courage! 

368
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,630
Half-witted Crown Prince, step down!

369
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,240
 Step down! 

370
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,700
Sajo Hyeon, step down!

371
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,040
 Step down! 

372
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,150
Let us serve the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong as our king!

373
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,200
 Let us serve him! 

374
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,300
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is the only righteous lord who cares for his people!

375
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,210
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong, hurray!

376
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,540
 Hurray! 

377
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,580
 - Hurray!  
  - Hurray! 

378
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,890
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong will become the king?

379
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,290
Master Yang, what is going on?

380
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,880
Sajo Yoong's henchmen are instigating the people.

381
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,060
They are trying to make Sajo Yoong the king by fishing in the troubled waters.

382
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,660
What?

383
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,150
 I, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong, would like to inform the ministers. 

384
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:35,530
 After His Majesty passed away, our country of Asatae became infested with rebels and 

385
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,080
 our people are becoming more turbulent by the day. 

386
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,780
 Half-witted Crown Prince, step down! 

387
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,920
 Step down! Step down! 

388
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,890
 The Crown Prince Sajo Hyeon is only indulging in a woman, 

389
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,390
 wandering outside the capital with no care for national affairs. 

390
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,170
 Though I am only a bastard child, 

391
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,600
 I advised the crown prince many times as I am still his brother. 

392
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,520
 But my words only fell on deaf ears. 

393
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,460
 I cannot stand by and watch this country's fate worsen by the day. 

394
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,400
 So, I resorted to writing my sorrow out like this. 

395
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,360
 Dear Ministers, let us gather strength. 

396
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,580
 Let us rid of the crown prince, who is prodigal and fragile. 

397
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,280
 Let us bring Asatae's kingship to its rightful state. 

398
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,210
 Please lend me, Sajo Yoong, your strength. 

399
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,200
How bold of you to even dare to come before me.

400
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,000
Why did you fool us all this time?

401
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,610
While pretending to help restore the Royal Family of Yeon,

402
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,040
were you trying to take...

403
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,380
the throne by using us, the Wind Knives?

404
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,610
The Royal Family of Yeon is hopeless, is it not?

405
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,340
I am now the only person who can lead Asatae to success.

406
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,290
Shut your mouth, Grand Prince.

407
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,410
 Grand Prince, what is the matter? 

408
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,060
No need to come in.

409
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,400
 Is someone with you? 

410
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,340
A dear friend came to visit from far away.

411
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,400
I had to risk my life to bring Kyera to safety.

412
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,600
- But this is all I get in return? 
 - Stop lying.

413
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,380
You tried to kill Kyera.

414
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,340
How bad must it have been for me to try to kill Kyera, whom I considered my flesh and blood?

415
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,610
How can I let her be when she betrayed her duties because she was crazy for a man?

416
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,720
Shut your mouth, Sajo Yoong.

417
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,420
How dare you try to drive a wedge between Lady Yeon Wol and me?

418
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,990
- Grand Prince— 
 - I told you not to come in!

419
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:25,900
Yang Jae Yi, I will give you one last chance.

420
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,380
Be my subordinate.

421
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,120
I will also give you one last chance.

422
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,770
Forsake your vain greed.

423
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,220
How unfortunate.

424
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,380
You are a man of unparalleled ability.

425
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:59,320
This will be the last time I let you go.

426
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,580
Do not forget that.

427
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,020
 If I fall asleep, Ak Hee might come out again. 

428
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:20,870
♫  Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment  ♫

429
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:27,420
♫  Your warmth remains in my heart  ♫

430
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:34,670
♫  Even if you become wind and cannot hold you  ♫

431
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:40,150
♫  We will always feel each other, the two of us  ♫

432
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:48,990
♫  So that you will not get far, so that we will not be apart even for a moment  ♫

433
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:54,600
♫  Even if I grasp, you become blurry  ♫

434
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,770
♫  I'll stay here and wait for you  ♫

435
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:11,430
♫  Even if you disappear again tomorrow, I will wait  ♫

436
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:20,660
♫  So that I can feel the faint sound of you breathing  ♫

437
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,170
Will you sit up straight?

438
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,670
My shoulder is sore.

439
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,750
I saw you wake up already.

440
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,770
Did you stay awake because Sir Ak Hee might come out?

441
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,170
Are you upset?

442
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,530
Because I did not let Ak Hee take over?

443
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,800
The dawn has arrived. Let us depart.

444
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,020
If you want,

445
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,910
you may go your own way, Consort Hyo.

446
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,100
Did you not arrest me?

447
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,360
I will release you.

448
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,630
All right, then.

449
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,490
Are you not feeling well?

450
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,430
No, I am fine.

451
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,480
Let me take a look.

452
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,660
What are you doing?

453
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,170
You endured all this time until it got this bad?

454
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,540
Gosh, Ak Hee, that punk. How dare he do this to my body.

455
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,510
If we put this on, it will get better.

456
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,080
I-It is okay.

457
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,320
I-I will do it.

458
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,870
We need to treat it right away.

459
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:26,690
If the inflammation worsens, you will not make it to the capital.

460
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,140
I did not put it on yet.

461
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,370
All right, then.

462
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,390
You take care.

463
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,550
Please take care of yourself as well, Your Highness.

464
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,930
Do you plan to go back to the Wind Knives?

465
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:32,590
In that case, you might aim your sword at me again one day.

466
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,930
I will wander as my footsteps take me.

467
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:46,120
Perhaps I will find my use somewhere one day.

468
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,540
You asked why I kept quiet

469
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,770
about getting my memories back from you. Right?

470
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,830
 Did you also keep quiet about getting your memories back 

471
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,120
 for the purpose of killing His Majesty? 

472
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,710
 Tell me it is not true. 

473
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,770
 Say it is not true. 

474
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,730
 You deceived me. 

475
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,200
 But I showed my sincerity. 

476
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,890
 Why? 

477
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,920
 Why? 

478
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,850
I was afraid.

479
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:40,740
Afraid you would also find out the truth behind everything like I did.

480
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,570
I had thought Your Highness and I had become quite good friends,

481
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,880
so I was afraid.

482
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,940
Please be safe.

483
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,540
- Well— 
 - Please also tell Sir Ak Hee...

484
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,960
that I am thankful.

485
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,300
Are you upset that you did not get to say bye to Ak Hee?

486
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,520
Rather than that—

487
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,670
I do not think I can grant your request...

488
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,740
because I do not think I will see him again.

489
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,630
Announce me.

490
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,300
I apologize for making you come this early in the morning.

491
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,960
Since this gathering was to discuss important national affairs related to the crown prince,

492
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,800
I intentionally did not communicate with the Head Minister, who is his father-in-law.

493
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,150
I hear the crown prince is currently enjoying his honeymoon outside the palace

494
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,030
with Her Highness Consort Hyo right now.

495
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,800
What do you mean "honeymoon"? That is absurd.

496
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,500
The crown prince only went out for a short while to soothe his sadness.

497
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,910
I heard the Consort Hyo was the daughter of Yeon Poong Hak, who was exterminated

498
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,490
10 years ago, while plotting treason.

499
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,640
Were you aware of this?

500
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:12,950
Crown Princess, we can no longer sit idly by as this country is heading toward destruction,

501
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,930
so we have decided to take special measures.

502
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,810
I am informing you of this since

503
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,610
I have decided to conduct government affairs on behalf of...

504
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,230
the crown prince until he returns to the palace.

505
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,710
Such insolence.

506
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,750
The crown prince who will inherit the throne is clearly alive.

507
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,280
How can the Grand Prince and the Ministers decide who will run government affairs?

508
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,320
Well, I have relayed my message.

509
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,850
Now, shall we discuss current national affairs?

510
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:46,580
Too many problems have piled up, so there is no time.

511
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,680
The crown princess is taking her leave. Quickly escort her.

512
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,300
 Yes! 

513
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,370
What should we do with the rebels who are imprisoned?

514
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:05,280
We shall follow your will, Grand Prince.

515
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:13,470
Young lady, how will I ever repay you?

516
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:17,510
Wait! Where did that pretty husband of yours go?

517
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,760
That man, I ought to—

518
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,880
Please take the medicine I gave you and feel better soon.

519
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,010
Thank you.

520
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:28,240
Mother!

521
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,490
My son!

522
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,820
Look at you! What in the world happened?

523
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,670
I was fighting the government troops.

524
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,770
I barely escaped.

525
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,210
Young lady, please take a look at my youngest son, too.

526
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,680
Okay.

527
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,750
I will take a look.

528
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,320
Fortunately, the wound is not deep.

529
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,850
This is the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's...

530
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,310
You recognize this?

531
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:58,080
I finally received one, too.

532
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,830
Whoever has this tile can be in the government troops when the

533
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,720
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong becomes the king.

534
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,580
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong will become the king?

535
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,330
How is that possible when the crown prince is alive?

536
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:10,580
The assassins said they would kill the crown prince soon.

537
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,410
A half-wit cannot become king!

538
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,670
Gosh, watch your mouth, you scoundrel.

539
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,560
Look over here!

540
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,070
Are you headed to the capital?

541
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,970
I am. Why?

542
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,350
I see you are on your way to join the uprising.

543
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,510
Let us kick out that half-wit crown prince. Am I right?

544
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,330
Yes, I guess.

545
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,260
Ride my daughter's horse.

546
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,700
We shall ride one together.

547
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,910
Get on.

548
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,530
This is the least we can do to help a young man doing righteous work.

549
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,360
It is because of Sajo Seung, the wicked king.

550
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,330
She was trying to run away to avoid becoming his amusement troupe.

551
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,800
But they caught her and did this to her.

552
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,190
I heard the capital is full of girls who are just like her. Gosh.

553
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,980
Let us go.

554
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:54,980
 I heard the capital is full of girls who are just like her. Gosh. 

555
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,350
Arrest every single one who joined the riot!

556
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,210
How dare you!

557
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,980
Run away.

558
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,260
 Once that punk becomes the king, 

559
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,560
 it will be the same shit because he is just like his dad. 

560
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,950
 Come on! The crown prince cannot become the king. 

561
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,620
 I heard he is a half-wit who lost his mind from madness. 

562
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,640
Your Highness...

563
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,200
I am sorry!

564
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,930
Consort Hyo!

565
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,890
Kyera, you were alive.

566
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:03,800
Sajo Yoong's henchmen are instigating the people.

567
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,640
I am aware.

568
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,040
Countless people were locked up because of that.

569
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,390
Was it the Grand Prince's order?

570
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,550
I heard they will all be executed.

571
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,820
Go on.

572
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,400
Did you come running because you were worried about me?

573
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,580
I will escort you to the palace.

574
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,230
There is no need.

575
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:51,080
I will not be going back to the palace.

576
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,600
What do you mean?

577
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,770
What can I even do when I am the half-witted son

578
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,500
of Sajo Seung, the tyrant?

579
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,780
So, you are just going to leave your people to suffer like this?

580
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,580
If Sajo Yoong becomes the king, he will not let you be.

581
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,300
It cannot be helped even if I get killed!

582
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,170
I do not wish to save my useless life.

583
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,080
Why did you come back if you were going to say that?

584
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,980
Let Ak Hee take over if you are going to be like this.

585
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,180
Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

586
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,820
Is Ak Hee the only one you think of, Consort Hyo?

587
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,420
Yes, that is right!

588
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,230
Sir Ak Hee is not weak like you.

589
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:32,810
If it was Ak Hee, he would not have run away like this.

590
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,590
What?

591
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,780
Crown Prince,

592
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,710
I am truly disappointed.

593
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,350
Disappointed, huh?

594
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:54,930
 Just like you, 

595
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,410
 I am also ashamed of you. 

596
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,660
- Where are you going? 
 - I have to fight against Sajo Yoong's henchmen.

597
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,810
I will expose the true nature of Sajo Yoong, who is deceiving the people and bringing chaos,

598
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,040
pretending to care for them.

599
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,740
The assassins will take you down.

600
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,140
If I get taken down, all that will happen is that I get killed.

601
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,160
Just like you, who has lost all will.

602
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,580
You cannot, Consort Hyo!

603
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,790
I cannot let you die.

604
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,930
What is all this?

605
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,340
They seem to be preparing for the coronation.

606
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,580
Is this a dream or a reality?

607
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:01,640
Grand Prince, are you really becoming the king of Asatae?

608
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,940
Mother, how many times will you ask?

609
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,150
Yes, your son is now the king of Asatae.

610
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,110
This day has finally come.

611
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:24,640
The crown prince won't come back. Right?

612
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,890
The crown prince has no interest in becoming the king.

613
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:33,410
He probably ran away to a place far from here by now.

614
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:35,400
With Consort Hyo?

615
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,280
Gosh, those were the days.

616
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,670
Yes, that is what befits the half-witted crown prince.

617
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,250
Poor Crown Princess.

618
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,610
Looks like she will die a grass widow inside the palace.

619
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,530
Here you are.

620
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,730
You said you would conduct government affairs temporarily.

621
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,530
But you are taking the crown?

622
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:05,520
Please consider this a government affair as well.

623
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,160
A ceremony like this would be needed to correct

624
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,500
a country's discipline. Right?

625
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:17,380
Your Highness Consort Cheong Myeong, you enjoy acupuncture. Right?

626
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:23,390
Well, I am quite a cultured person.

627
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,250
It was proven that the long needle Her Highness uses

628
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,870
and the long needle used to murder His Majesty are the same ones.

629
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:42,260
Also, it is different from the one Consort Hyo used.

630
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,580
Are you saying I murdered His Majesty?

631
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,010
That is nonsense.

632
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:53,090
There are palace maids who saw Your Highness' servant coming out of

633
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,510
His Majesty's chamber right before his death.

634
00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:01,150
I have always been doing that to keep a watch on his chamber.

635
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,270
Is there evidence Her Highness' long needle was used to murder His Majesty?

636
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,210
Physician Jeong, please come in.

637
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,470
I heard Physician Jeong is Your Highness' uncle.

638
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:27,210
What do you say, Physician Jeong?

639
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:32,320
It is indeed Her Highness Consort Cheong Myeong's...

640
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,210
long needle.

641
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,700
Oh, my, my. Uncle!

642
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,530
Mother.

643
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,270
No, no, it is not true.

644
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,180
The Head Minister must have bought out Physician Jeong.

645
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,200
I treated you so well, you old fart.

646
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,560
But you sided with them?

647
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:58,460
Is that long needle really yours, Mother?

648
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:03,530
It is true that the needle is mine,

649
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,520
but no. I really did not do anything.

650
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,570
Mother!

651
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,390
What do you say, Grand Prince?

652
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:24,490
Must you really watch Her Highness Cheong Myeong get locked up or

653
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:30,020
would you like to let the bygones be bygones?

654
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,460
Since His Majesty was already announced to have died

655
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,530
from an unknown cause rather than murder.

656
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,110
Hear ye.

657
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,140
Lock up Consort Cheong Myeong...

658
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:50,160
in the prison right now.

659
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,320
Grand Prince.

660
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,040
What are you all doing?

661
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,900
Arrest Consort Choeng Myeong and

662
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,000
investigate thoroughly to confirm Physician Jeong's testimony!

663
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,570
Y-Yoong, i-it was not me. I did nothing. I am not crazy!

664
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,210
Yoong, Yoong- Grand Prince!

665
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,920
Let go! Let go of me!

666
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,390
Grand Prince Yoong,

667
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,490
you are very manly.

668
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:20,190
All right, shall we commence the coronation now?

669
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:25,370
I am told the man of the hour has arrived as well.

670
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,170
His Majesty the Emperor enters!

671
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:31,410
Now, His Majesty will now pray for endless prosperity of Asatae

672
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,870
before the heavens and the earth.

673
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,800
Halt.

674
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:39,410
There is something I must say before the ceremony.

675
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:43,610
I heard countless rioters are locked up right now.

676
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:48,200
Their provocative actions of planning to take over the throne and

677
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,600
causing chaos deserve to be punished severely.

678
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,820
 Though their method was wrong, 

679
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:57,940
 I reckon their love for this country, Asatae, is not any different than mine. 

680
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,590
On this meaningful day of my crowning,

681
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,610
I will pardon all of them.

682
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,770
Also, the amusement troupe that stayed in the palace

683
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:13,500
during the previous king's reign will be dismissed.

684
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,440
So everyone, go back to your hometown.

685
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,250
 Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty! 

686
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,820
Are you looking for Consort Hyo?

687
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,120
Consort Hyo is not on that side.

688
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,600
She is over there.

689
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,910
What is the meaning of this?

690
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,840
She is still a concubine,

691
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,270
but she will live as a court lady without any ranks.

692
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:12,100
I am the leader of the Inner Court.

693
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,930
You will allow me at least this much authority, right, Your Majesty?

694
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,430
 Hong Gun. 

695
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:24,890
 Your Highness! Your Highness! 

696
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,410
 This is for putting the crown prince in trouble. 

697
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,080
 This is for mocking me and the Inner Court. 

698
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,200
 You shameless bitch. 

699
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:56,880
 This is not where you belong. 

700
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,270
That girl also accepted it willingly.

701
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,600
She said she would feel more comfortable living as a court lady

702
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,660
than to be locked up in Consort Hyo's pavilion.

703
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,410
 You cannot, Consort Hyo! 

704
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,780
 I will not let you die. 

705
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,490
 Come back to your pavilion. 

706
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:43,430
 Are you telling me to go back to being your concubine? 

707
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,990
 I will not do that. 

708
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:48,690
 I came running... 

709
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,930
 only because I was worried about you. 

710
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:54,000
 Okay, then. 

711
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,150
 To be honest, 

712
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,970
 I am terribly scared. 

713
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,920
 And anxious. 

714
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:08,220
 I am afraid this anxiety will turn me into a monstrosity. 

715
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,180
 I would like you to... 

716
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,560
 keep me strong, Consort Hyo. 

717
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:20,420
 So that I will not become a monster like my father, 

718
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,790
 please help me. 

719
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,760
 I will protect you. 

720
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:43,810
 But if you end up a monster like your father, 

721
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:48,650
 my sword will come your way. 

722
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:06,770
 Kyera, how could you? 

723
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:28,590
 Was it you? 

724
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,620
 Tell them I ordered the execution of Consort Hyo and 

725
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,940
 take her to the execution grounds behind the palace. 

726
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,840
 Someone will come to rescue Consort Hyo there. 

727
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,280
 The one who took Kyera. 

728
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,900
 However, the current you is... 

729
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,150
 Who knows? I might give this to you. 

730
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:52,960
 The one who takes this becomes the king of this country. Right? 

731
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,020
 Brother, as long as you help me. 

732
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,140
 That is not him. 

733
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,460
 He is a different man. 

734
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:04,400
 Which one is Sajo Hyeon? 

735
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:10,910

 Father. 

745
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:51,860
 Tell them to keep giving her work so she cannot rest even a moment. 

746
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:56,820
 When will you keep the promise you made to me? 

747
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,710
 You think I sat you there so you can do as you please? 

748

 What did you say? 

749
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:06,290
 You have to spend the night with Her Highness the Queen tonight.
