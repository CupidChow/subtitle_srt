7
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,170
Your Majesty! Aigoo, what do I do?

8
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,960
Did Sir Ak Hee fall asleep?

9
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,530
Aigoo, my gosh.

10
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,730
Aigoo, how frustrating.

11
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,270
You cannot even write to communicate because your body is so stiff.

12
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,800
Where did Ji Jeon go?

13
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,960
What is this?

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,090
The bag used to carry sleeping incense.

15
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,470
It is proof Chung Ta sold me sleeping incense.

16
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,300
I am going to meet Chung Ta at the Hall of Spirits tonight.

17
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,920
Officer Ji, stand guard at the door, and if I am

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,470
nowhere to be seen, but Chung Ta leaves the Hall of Spirits all alone,

19
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,880
then take these two things and go to Prince Ga Ron right away.

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,280
If Chung Ta leaves the Hall of Spirits alone,

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,980
it means your plan failed, does it not?

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,480
I must catch Chung Ta first and-

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,490
There is no use attacking him.

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,210
It would be too late by then already.

25
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,080
So, if you want to help me and Sajo Hyun,

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,490
go meet Prince Ga Ron as quickly as you can. Got it?

27
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,890
[Episode 12]
Your Majesty, it is uncomfortable, right?

28
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,730
I apologize, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,740
I cannot tell the palace maids to help.

30
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,440
Your water.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,830
A-Aigoo, I am really sorry, Your Majesty!

32
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,190
Aigoo, p-please have some water.

33
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,660
There, there.

34
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,810
Her Majesty has arrived.

35
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,660
Oh, my.

36
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,240
No.

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,460
A-Ask her to wait a moment!

38
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,970
Eunuch Neung, what are you doing?

39
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,600
Well... t-the thing is...

40
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,450
Your Majesty?

41
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,440
Everyone, step back now!

42
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,440
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,090
How did this happen?

44
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,730
Where did Ak Hee go?

45
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,180
Well, I-I do not really know, either.

46
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,200
Around early evening, Sir Ak Hee went out alone for a walk and...

47
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,310
Sleep with the one called Ak Hee right away.

48
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,790
He might be easy to win over.

49
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,830
Your Majesty, you cannot stay like this.

50
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,610
You must entrust everything to Ak Hee for a while.

51
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,340
What are you doing? Help His Majesty lie down and let him go to sleep. Hurry.

52
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,570
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,050
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

54
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,960
Your Majesty, the times are looking turbulent.

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,820
Your officials may barge in at any given moment and ask to see you.

56
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,500
You cannot let them see you like this.

57
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,350
Go to sleep right now.

58
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,880
My goodness, she is about to slap me if I do not go to sleep.

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,620
All right, have peaceful thoughts.

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,600
Is it not actually an opportunity for me?

61
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,980
Your Majesty, this humble one will be by His Majesty's side tonight, so you can-

62
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,530
I will be by His Majesty's side tonight.

63
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,530
- Sorry?
- It is a natural thing to do as the Queen.

64
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,730
Eunuch Neung, you can take your leave.

65
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,080
- But still-
- What are you waiting for? Hurry up and go.

66
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,460
Eunuch Neung.

68
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,140
Eunuch Neung!

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,550
All right, please close your eyes, Your Majesty.

70
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,480
Aigoo, it will be better to close my eyes.

71
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,470
Huh?

72
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,620
Wait.

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,800
What will she do to His Majesty, who is already unwell?

74
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,300
Aigoo.

75
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,060
Ak Hee, what is going on?

76
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,820
Open your eyes.

77
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,680
Are you dead?

78
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,440
If I were dead,

79
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,230
would you have been summoned here?

80
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,440
However,

81
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,570
it does feel like I am in the process of dying.

82
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,290
Did Chung Ta do this to you?

83
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,380
Chung Ta talked you into taking over this body, did he not?

84
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,680
But why did he do this to you?

85
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,870
It means he does not need either of us now.

86
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,950
It means he is head over heels for Sajo Yoong.

87
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,800
Did you upset Chung Ta?

88
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,250
I told you to treat him well!

89
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,540
Gosh, you are nagging again.

90
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,430
Will I miss this, too?

91
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,700
If I am erased...

92
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,970
Stay with me, Ak Hee.

93
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,950
You cannot die, Ak Hee!

94
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,790
So noisy.

95
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,020
We did not switch.

96
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,180
Sir Ak Hee?

97
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,900
Your Majesty.

98
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,190
What should we do about this?

99
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,240
I thought he would switch with Ak Hee today if he sleeps.

100
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,980
Where is the man called Ak Hee?

101
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,550
Do you know, Eunuch Neung?

102
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,010
I-I do not really know.

103
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,810
Eunuch Neung does not know, either. No one knows.

104
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,600
Could it not be the evil spirit is gone for good?

105
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,870
So the evil spirit is gone, and the half-witted-

106
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,500
And only His Majesty remains in this state?

107
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,710
Are they thinking I became an idiot who cannot even understand what is going on?

108
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,580
More so, we must remain calm.

109
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,400
First off, please lead today's assembly, Father.

110
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,800
Yeon Wol, where are you?

111
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,210
I hope you did not catch the plague while tending to the sick.

112
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,870
I am sure she is working hard for me wherever she is.

113
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,770
Looks like something is going on in his chamber.

114
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,770
This is a serious problem.

115
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,340
Did the Queen spend the night in his chamber?

116
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,210
With Sir Ak Hee?

117
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,260
Eunuch Neung!

118
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,280
His Majesty switched back?

119
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,250
Yes. Wait-

120
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,690
You cannot.

121
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,820
Her Majesty has been sticking around right by his side since last night.

122
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,720
His Majesty and Her Majesty spent the night together, then?

123
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,690
Yes.

124
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:32,210
Oh, t-the thing is, t-they could not really do much...

125
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,190
Well, anyhow.

126
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,860
His Majesty still cannot move or speak.

127
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,510
Sir Ak Hee promised so confidently he would help until His Majesty got better.

128
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,390
I know.

129
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,370
Ak Hee, that flip-flopper, must have been ticked off by something again

130
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,380
or something happened to him.

131
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,710
And Ji Jeon is nowhere to be seen, either.

132
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,700
Officer Ji?

133
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,070
You want me to introduce you to Shaman Tan Ya?

134
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,580
For what business?

135
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,920
I do not know the details, either.

136
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,720
However, if you will grant me this request,

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,030
His Majesty said he will continue to help you, Prince Ga Ron.

138
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,940
I am indeed close to Tan Ya.

139
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,720
It is an urgent matter.

140
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,130
Please help.

141
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,150
These things will not do.

142
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,010
Perhaps, if Yeon Wol were to come in person...

143
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,160
- Prince Ga Ron-
- I do not have time, either.

144
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,580
Because I am going back to Jinhoi today.

145
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,070
His Majesty is feeling unwell,

146
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,050
so I will lead today's assembly.

147
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,290
How exactly is His Majesty feeling unwell?

148
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,530
His Majesty was just concerned about the plethora of current governing issues,

149
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,230
which made him rather lethargic.

150
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,780
So, do not make unnecessary guesses.

151
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,960
Minister of General Affairs.

152
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,210
How did the issue with Jinhoi go?

153
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:18,270
They have been calling into question our military actions at Port Mihwari ever since.

154
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,610
Alas, my goodness!

155
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,080
It looks like our relationship with Jinhoi, which took a long time to build,

156
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,960
will crumble overnight.

157
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,860
That is exactly so.

158
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,420
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong had to work so hard with the late king to

159
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,780
build our relationship with Jinhoi, did he not?

160
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,570
Thanks to him, we were able to fend off neighboring tribes' invasions, too.

161
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,430
That is correct.

162
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,780
His Majesty could not even

163
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,880
come to the assembly at the Royal Council Hall?

164
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,120
I had gone to His Majesty's chamber,

165
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,500
but Her Majesty strictly forbade us from meeting him.

166
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,640
What do you fear about a mere queen that you could not even see His Majesty?

167
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,600
You must pull on the rein even more at a time like this.

168
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,080
Tell Jinhoi's messengers to come forth more strongly.

169
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,840
I can tell now.

170
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,170
Chung Ta must have done something to Sir Ak Hee.

171
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,640
That is why His Majesty came back.

172
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,080
I do not know what to do.

173
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,800
Prince Ga Ron said he would go back to Jinhoi today.

174
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,790
He must have said that to make us more anxious.

175
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,510
I will go to him.

176
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,020
I apologize.

177
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,550
Gosh, I feel so weak.

178
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,300
Chung Ta.

179
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,940
Make my body stiffen and let His Majesty wake up.

180
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,940
Make me like him instead or take my life, even. Do whatever. Instead...

181
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,330
Instead, please save His Majesty, Chung Ta.

182
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,430
Even risking her life for love...

183
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,730
That dearly love...

184
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,530
It is so romantic.

185
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,000
I wanted to help.

186
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,780
Gosh, seriously!

187
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,640
I am the one who risked my life to save you.

188
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,750
Does love feed you?

189
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,080
Wake up now.

190
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,340
You have not starved enough.

191
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,330
What is this?

192
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,980
Who is it?

193
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,980
I need to move locations or something, seriously.

194
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,120
The Heavenly Shaman Association. Long time no see.

195
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,550
There must be a meeting.

196
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,590
It has been a while.

197
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,320
What is wrong? What is it?

198
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,330
Expelled from the Shaman Association?

199
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,710
W-What do we do?

200
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,930
It is Tan Ya's doing.

201
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,170
Jinhoi's Tan Ya must have reported.

202
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,190
Who the hell ratted us out to Tan Ya?

203
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,670
I said I would expose your doings to

204
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,100
the shaman association if you keep acting up, right?

205
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,910
How are you going to report me?

206
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,380
Jinhoi's shaman, Tan Ya.

207
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,350
Jinhoi's prince, Hwang Ga Ron, is best friends with Shaman Tan Ya.

208
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,980
I will expose everything you did.

209
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,620
Ak Hee!

210
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,440
This bastard.

211
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,600
Chung Ta, that bastard.

212
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,130
He should have heard the news by now.

213
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,340
Ak Hee will not go down alone.

214
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,470
I want to see Kyera.

215
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,580
Kyera.

216
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,660
I said he left just now.

217
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,030
Prince Ga Ron, please wait!

218
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,320
I have something to tell you-

219
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,330
Prince Ga Ron!

220
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,730
Prince Ga Ron!

221
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,680
Go back.

222
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,270
One moment-

223
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,280
Prince Ga Ron!

224
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,010
Prince Ga Ron-

225
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,310
Aigoo.

226
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,750
Prince Ga Ron, one moment!

227
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,130
Prince Ga Ron-

228
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,190
Kyera.

229
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,930
W-What is wrong?

230
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,220
Kyera.

231
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,510
Yeon Wol.

232
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,940
Your Majesty, how are you feeling?

233
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,230
Are you able to speak?

234
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,430
Why am I so anxious?

235
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,800
Why is it so suffocating?

236
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,670
Yeon Wol.

237
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,140
Where is Kyera? Where did she go?

238
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,370
She went to meet Prince Ga Ron.

239
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,940
Did you dare to instigate Kyera?

240
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,570
How dare you!

241
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,110
- I only asked for her advice-
- I know

242
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,720
you knew Kyera would help you.

243
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,270
Do you not care what happens to Kyera if it is for His Majesty's sake?

244
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,190
Did you not ever feel the same way, Master Yang?

245
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,820
Did you ever have someone you could willingly give up your life for?

246
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,400
Shut your mouth, Ji Jeon Seo.

247
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,620
Lady Yeon Wol is the only one for me.

248
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,940
If I were ever to give up my life,

249
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,420
it would be for Lady Yeon Wol.

250
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,280
If anything happens to Kyera,

251
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,120
I will take your life.

252
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,110
The Queen is so vicious, is she not?

253
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,500
How dare she demote me to a court lady like this?

254
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,490
I was barely allowed to visit you here, too.

255
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,170
The Minister of Finance helped out.

256
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,510
Grand Prince, do I have to let her step all over me like this?

257
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,020
You have to.

258
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,220
You have a long way to go.

259
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,980
Crawl even lower on the ground.

260
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,300
Lay low in front of the Queen and kiss her feet if you can.

261
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,100
That is how you will let me live.

262
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,740
Do you understand?

263
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,500
Grand Prince, you really will not wither away like this, right?

264
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,690
You have a plan in mind, right?

265
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,350
Right?

266
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,730
Aigoo, what is going on?

267
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,050
My gosh, what is this? Aigoo!

268
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,310
Aigoo, what is going on here?

269
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,000
H-How can chickens freeze to death in this hot weather?

270
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,820
The fish also died in great numbers last time! Geez!

271
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,400
This is all because of the haunted king!

272
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,170
That evil spirit is causing a plague to go around, too.

273
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,950
This country will be doomed at this rate!

274
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,330
That is why Grand Prince Sajo Yoong must become the king.

275
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,850
He was imprisoned for saying the right thing to the king!

276
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,380
- Wait, what?
- W-What do you mean? What are you saying?

277
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,250
- Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is in prison?
- Yes.

278
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,110
He said Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is in prison.

279
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,680
Does it make sense for a good man like him to be in prison?

280
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,420
Are you all ready?

281
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,250
Yes, Grand Prince!

282
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,440
For Asatae's sake!

283
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,540
For Asatae's sake!

284
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,690
He is still like this, no matter how many times he goes to sleep during the day.

285
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,100
Ak Hee will not come out.

286
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,660
This is terrible.

287
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,150
This is a serious problem.

288
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,090
Jinhoi keeps causing trouble, too.

289
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,420
Father, what should we do?

290
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,790
My Queen,

291
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,180
I think it is time we make our stance clear.

292
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,980
Our stance?

293
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,310
Your Majesty!

294
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,280
Sir Head Minister! Your Majesty-

295
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,030
Your Majesty- Sir Head Minister!

296
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,650
Eunuch Neung, what is the matter?

297
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,520
Ji Jeon, this is bad.

298
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,870
Your Majesty, this is Eunuch Neung!

299
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,150
Why so noisy first thing in the morning?

300
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:05,740
Your Majesty, t-the ministers are headed this way right now.

301
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,940
What?

302
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,020
I will take care of this.

303
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,600
Please do not step forward, Your Majesty.

304
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,780
This is an impertinent act, showing up without even a word.

305
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,470
Head Minister,

306
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:29,240
we, ministers, will no longer ignore the perilous crisis we are in.

307
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,150
Let us meet His Majesty!

308
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,400
We will report the current situation to His Majesty in person and-

309
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,860
Did I not say His Majesty is currently unwell?

310
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,730
You should be the ones to care about His Majesty's health and-

311
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,080
In that case, we must see him in person

312
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,570
just how unwell His Majesty is.

313
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:56,140
If His Majesty is still in the condition he was at the interrogation grounds and not able to perform his duties,

314
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,710
should we not find a different solution quickly?

315
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,980
Head Minister, Jinhoi has started its invasion and

316
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,730
each village's people are rising up, too.

317
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,350
Please understand us.

318
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,360
Before we meet His Majesty,

319
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,970
all the ministers will not move an inch from here.

320
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,910
Please allow us to meet His Majesty!

321
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,060
Please allow us to meet His Majesty!

322
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,370
Ak Hee, do something about this.

323
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,640
Where did all your confident bravado go?

324
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,200
What can I do in this state?

325
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,950
What do I need to do?

326
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,020
What do you need me to do?

327
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,660
It is simple.

328
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,940
You can come over here and

329
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,670
take out the blade from my back.

330
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,450
Do it if you think you can.

331
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,860
Head Minister!

332
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,100
If His Majesty is unable to move...

333
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,880
In that case, at least until His Majesty recovers,

334
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,650
you should let Grand Prince Sajo Yoong govern our country.

335
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,240
Minister of Justice!

336
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,110
How dare you mention a rebel who is imprisoned for plotting treason!

337
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,450
Technically speaking, he is not a rebel.

338
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,050
Minister of Finance!

339
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,850
I am sure it was a decision for Asatae's sake.

340
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,680
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is the late king's son and

341
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,390
remember that he is the only royal descendant along with His Majesty, Sir Head Minister!

342
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,940
The late king's son?

343
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,150
The only royal descendant?

344
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,260
In addition,

345
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,890
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is the only one who can appease Jinhoi.

346
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,330
Your Majesty and Head Minister, please make a wise decision.

347
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,320
Sir Head Minister!

348
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,130
Our borders collapsed!

349
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,780
- What?
- Moreover,

350
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,000
even Jinhoi's subject states joined in to invade us!

351
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,190
Minister of General Affairs, leave for the borders promptly.

352
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,430
Yes.

353
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,940
Let us go.

354
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,680
Head Minister, will you still not come to a decision?

355
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,780
If His Majesty's reign is at stake,

356
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,080
do you really not know your position is also at risk, Head Minister?

357
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,900
Minister of Finance!

358
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,200
Are you daring to threaten me right now?

359
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,990
I will do as you said.

360
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,290
Release Grand Prince Sajo Yoong and

361
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,780
he shall manage the governing affairs temporarily.

362
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,440
Your Majesty.

363
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,210
I just discussed it with His Majesty.

364
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,050
And His Majesty allowed it as well.

365
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,360
Thank you for your grace!

366
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,430
I allowed it?

367
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,590
When did I allow it?

368
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,910
Ak Hee, Ak Hee!

369
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,700
What?

370
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,560
Did you say I need to pull out that blade?

371
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,770
Are you going to pull it out?

372
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,570
Come here and try, then.

373
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,850
Since I cannot move,

374
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,650
do you think you can come here?

375
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,440
How can I move in this state?

376
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,010
You can.

377
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,440
You have a blade in your back, but you are not paralyzed.

378
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,310
Try moving now.

379
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,730
Hurry!

380
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,150
Gosh, seriously.

381
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,170
Does it hurt?

382
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,900
"Does it hurt?"

383
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,040
Gosh, seriously.

384
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,090
The smell of the sun is so sweet.

385
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,240
My time has finally come in full swing.

386
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,860
All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

387
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,270
All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

388
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,600
All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

389
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,990
All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

390
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,370
All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

391
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,930
All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

392
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,430
All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

393
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,080
Oh, my!

394
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,980
You are too caring.

395
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,850
Let us stop seeing each other from now on.

396
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,360
I am going to leave far away.

397
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,660
I heard the Shaman Association expelled you.

398
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,590
You know a lot.

399
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:33,430
In that case, you should enjoy the riches of the world now.

400
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,530
Help Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

401
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,200
Rather...

402
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,600
- help His Majesty Sajo Yoong.
- His Majesty?

403
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,290
Excuse me.

404
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,420
I have no interest in such-

405
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,310
Why would you not? Tell him you will!

406
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,530
Actually, I do.

407
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,250
Have you come to?

408
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,510
Where am I?

409
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,790
Could it be the ship?

410
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,770
Is it the ship to Jinhoi?

411
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,560
I saved you from drowning to death.

412
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,360
Thankful, right?

413
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,380
Go on and tell me now.

414
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,540
What is it you want to tell me?

415
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,480
Please let me meet the shaman named Tan Ya.

416
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,830
You want Tan Ya, too?

417
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,860
Did someone else want to meet Tan Ya?

418
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,440
Who did?

419
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,430
Your king.

420
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:02,720
Sir Ak Hee was working hard to save His Majesty.

421
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,310
I need the antidote for a tranquilizing dart.

422
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,590
Your king got hit by a tranquilizing dart, huh?

423
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,650
By whom? It was Chung Ta, huh.

424
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,390
Yes.

425
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,560
Chung Ta would not give the antidote,

426
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,670
so I must ask Tan Ya for help.

427
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,410
Please help.

428
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,640
I also have the antidote, you know.

429
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,830
Really? Please give me the antidote, then.

430
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,480
I beg of you.

431
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,560
If I give you the antidote,

432
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,960
how will you repay me?

433
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,160
What do you want from me?

434
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,230
Come to Jinhoi with me and

435
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,900
become my wife.

436
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,820
You know His Majesty and I love each other.

437
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,370
So, how can you say such a thing?

438
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,480
This is to save His Majesty you love.

439
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,790
- Should you not do this much, at least?
- Prince Ga Ron,

440
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,750
I saved your life.

441
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,710
Technically speaking, is that not enough as a payment?

442
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,960
Forget it if you do not want to.

443
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,710
I will tell them to drop you off on some island on the way.

444
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,460
Or you could be thrown into the ocean!

445
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,360
Prince Ga Ron, Prince Ga Ron!

446
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,720
What is it now?

447
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,610
Officer Ji said

448
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:50,290
Yeon Wol left for the annex in Mt. Seowang to meet Prince Ga Ron.

449
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,330
What?

450
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,050
However,

451
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,890
he lost touch with her.

452
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,470
Why are you-

453
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,260
Gosh, why are you telling me this now?

454
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,800
Why did she go to meet Hwang Ga Ron?

455
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,060
He said she went to get the antidote.

456
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,170
Darn it.

457
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,590
This is all your fault. Okay?

458
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,930
You are the root cause!

459
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,730
What do I do?

460
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,900
Hey.

461
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,910
Hey, I will come over there,

462
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,360
so you pull this out.

463
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,640
Do you think you can do it?

464
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,110
Just think about how you are going to pull it out!

465
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,890
You are stiff all over.

466
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,500
Hey, here I go.

467
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,330
The Minister of General Affairs left for the borders to deliver the news

468
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,370
you have been released, Grand Prince.

469
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,690
Since I sent a messenger to notify them already,

470
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,270
the issues at the border will quiet down soon.

471
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,220
This is so fortunate!

472
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:39,930
Everything will find its place soon now that you are leading us, Grand Prince.

473
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,850
We did deliver the news,

474
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:46,360
but I think it will be beneficial for you to visit the border and

475
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,670
Jinhoi's concessions in person and reassure them.

476
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,770
Of course, that is what I plan to do.

477
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,540
However,

478
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,400
another matter takes priority before doing so.

479
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,880
What is this matter you speak of?

480
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,060
Head Minister,

481
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,510
do you really not know?

482
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,580
Calming down the public is

483
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,490
what a lord must deem his priority, right?

484
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:21,520
You are right, Grand Prince.

485
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,250
It is Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

486
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,990
- The Grand Prince!
- It is the Grand Prince!

487
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,400
My, what happened to his face?

488
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,340
Aigoo, my goodness!

489
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,240
Just how harshly was he interrogated?

490
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,430
I am sure the darn evil spirit did not let him be!

491
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,570
Your Highness Grand Prince!

492
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,010
Your Highness Grand Prince!

493
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,730
- Your Highness Grand Prince!
- We have been waiting for you!

494
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,960
- Were you in pain?
- Yes!

495
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,360
Were you suffering?

496
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Were you hungry?

497
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,070
How painful has it been for you all this time?

498
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:32,990
I, Sajo Yoong, will dare to treat your scars now.

499
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,550
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

500
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,540
First and foremost,

501
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:45,740
I will completely get rid of the plague sweeping Asatae!

502
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,680
This is Chung Ta, Asatae's new high priest.

503
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,330
Almighty gods of heaven and earth!

504
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:26,230
Gods of the sun and the moon who govern all life!

505
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:34,180
I, Chung Ta, seek your forgiveness in the haunted king's place!

506
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,950
Please soothe your wrath and

507
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:43,600
bestow eternal prosperity and wealth on Asatae!

508
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,310
Please save the people who are

509
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:54,800
suffering in pain everywhere!

510
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:25,050
This medicine was sent from the gods of heaven and earth.

511
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:31,040
If you take this medicine, you will be cured of the plague!

512
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,900
Over here!

513
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,480
The haunted king will step down!

514
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,390
It is time to meet your new king!

515
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,590
All hail His Majesty Sajo Yoong!

516
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,040
Hurray!

517
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,020
Be strong, Ak Hee!

518
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,250
I will accept your request, Prince Ga Ron.

519
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,390
- Really?
- However,

520
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,200
let me deliver the antidote to His Majesty in person.

521
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,260
How can I trust you?

522
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,630
This is a treasure as valuable as my life

523
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,120
that I inherited from my late father.

524
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,290
I will leave this here.

525
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,730
Master Yang, Kyera told us never to leave the sick people.

526
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,990
What should we do?

527
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,050
They are getting better now, so we must find Kyera.

528
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,790
We spent too much time tending to the sick.

529
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,650
Oh, Kyera's stuff, too.

530
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,730
What is wrong?

531
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,320
T-The medical book is gone.

532
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,940
Kyera said it was a precious book she got from her grandmother.

533
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,200
I am so thirsty.

534
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,140
I worked so hard.

535
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,820
By the way, will people really get better with that medicine?

536
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,220
It was made according to this medical book.

537
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,100
So they will get better soon.

538
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,780
Kyera gave us a really great gift.

539
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,010
Where is that woman?

540
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,080
I hear she went to meet Prince Ga Ron and went missing.

541
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,020
She might have become fish food or

542
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,350
she might have been taken to Jinhoi if she had been lucky.

543
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,830
All right.

544
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:24,020
There is only one more thing for us to do.

545
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:29,180
- What is it?
- We must get rid of the haunted king taking up space

546
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,230
in the chamber.

547
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,650
Yes, stay strong, Ak Hee.

548
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,720
Just a little more!

549
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,500
You are being so loud, seriously!

550
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,290
Gosh, that hurts.

551
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,750
Hey, Sajo Hyun.

552
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,200
Hey!

553
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,530
Sajo Hyun, stay with me here!

554
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,160
Hey, are you dead?

555
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,850
Hey!

556
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,270
You said I was being too loud.

557
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,650
Gosh, you scared me!

558
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,320
I am coming.

559
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,170
Your Majesty,

560
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,800
how can I ever repay you for releasing Grand Prince?

561
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,140
On top of that, you even restored my position.

562
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,850
So I can only be thankful like this.

563
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,860
Yoong told me to lay low.

564
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,100
Your Majesty!

565
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,290
I demoted you temporarily, Consort Cheong Myeong,

566
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:51,740
because I had no other choice but to do that to straighten up the Inner Court.

567
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,520
I believe you will understand.

568
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,620
Of course I do.

569
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,450
I totally understand your profound intention, Your Majesty.

570
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,390
By the way, Queen, are you unwell?

571
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:12,150
Your fine complexion seems to have roughened up a bit.

572
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,020
Is that so?

573
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,450
Since His Majesty is not in good health right now...

574
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,710
Aigoo!

575
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,150
I know, right?

576
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,080
That is why I brought you a gift to cheer you up.

577
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,120
They are peaches you always loved,

578
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,440
Your Majesty!

579
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,200
All right, please take a bite.

580
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,670
They will drip with...

581
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,100
juice as sweet as honey.

582
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,200
Oh, my.

583
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,360
Queen, what is the matter?

584
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,050
Do you find the smell of peaches nauseating?

585
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,980
It is not like you have morning sickness, so why?

586
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,940
I do not have strength in my hands.

587
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,660
It is a delicious-looking peach.

588
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,970
Right?

589
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,480
Take a big bite.

590
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,560
One big bite.

591
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,940
It is sweet.

592
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,970
Right?

593
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,020
They say there is always hope.

594
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,470
Is this really the antidote?

595
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:17,630
It would be an antidote if you believe it to be one.

596
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,140
Why do you have this on you, Prince Ga Ron?

597
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,970
Make sure to...

598
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,190
keep your promise.

599
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,810
I came too far.

600
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,530
I asked to meet elsewhere, for it would be better that way,

601
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,140
but why here?

602
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,870
I was going to see how His Majesty has been doing.

603
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,640
But I did not know it would be this bad.

604
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,790
Please do not mind me.

605
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,590
What is there to hide between brothers who are the closest?

606
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,110
Do you not agree, Your Majesty?

607
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,890
Sajo Yoong, that bastard is

608
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,870
having the time of his life.

609
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,050
Hurry up, Ak Hee.

610
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,660
I thought about it in many regards.

611
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,630
But for the sake of Asatae, which is in peril,

612
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,320
and for the sake of His Majesty, who is in that state, we should-

613
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,580
What do you say we move

614
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,480
His Majesty to a clean, remote place for rehabilitation temporarily?

615
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,940
Your Majesty-

616
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,180
Is that also what you thought, My Queen?

617
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,770
Yes.

618
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:58,260
Since you took charge of state affairs in His Majesty's place,

619
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,320
it would be wise for His Majesty to focus on recovery in peace.

620
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,890
That is right. You are right.

621
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,240
Just as I expected, Your Majesty.

622
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,210
She is really the wise mother of our nation.

623
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,930
Hey, Geum Hwa has gone mad, has she not?

624
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:33,850
I thought I still treated her quite well.

625
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,250
How can she do that?

626
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,490
How did you treat her well, in what way?

627
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,470
Why do you want to know?

628
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,520
I have always been a sweet man.

629
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:50,030
But she is switching to Sajo Yoong now, huh?

630
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:52,590
Is she getting rid of the used carriage for a flowery one?

631
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,120
Are you saying I am a used carriage?

632
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,580
Of course you are. You think you are the flowery carriage, then?

633
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,460
Hey, Sajo Hyun.

634
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,190
We are done for now.

635
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,880
It is over.

636
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,410
Keep trying to move.

637
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,230
What is the use even if I keep trying to move?

638
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,100
It hurts.

639
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,050
Ak Hee.

640
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,140
Your Majesty,

641
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,180
are you certain you are pregnant?

642
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,810
I trusted your words and

643
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,310
accepted what Sajo Yoong said earlier.

644
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,470
But I am not sure if it was the right decision.

645
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,900
I am sure I am pregnant.

646
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,920
Trust me.

647
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,180
However, until this child

648
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,180
settles down firmly,

649
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,600
we must keep it an absolute secret.

650
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,170
Of course.

651
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,780
It is four years, Father.

652
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,960
We just need to endure four years after this child is born.

653
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,780
Yes, after four years, he will be made the crown prince and

654
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,700
Your Majesty can become his regent.

655
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:21,710
You have to help me a lot then, Father.

656
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:30,130
By the way,

657
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,130
is it really...

658
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,910
His Majesty's child?

659
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,910
You told me to use whatever means I can, Father.

660
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,950
Is there anything...

661
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,890
you want to ask?

662
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,050
None at all.

663
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,080
Please take care of your health.

664
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,310
His Majesty...

665
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,510
Please hang in there a bit longer.

666
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,230
It is me.

667
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,600
Chung Ta.

668
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,480
Where are you headed in such a rush?

669
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,220
To Wind Knife's lodging. Okay, then.

670
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,230
The antidote will not

671
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,480
work on him anyway.

672
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,520
Though I do not have an antidote to give you, either.

673
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,920
What?

674
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,360
Look at it by yourself.

675
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,830
Find a good man and live a good life.

676
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,290
What on Earth did you do this time?

677
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,810
I did not do much! I did not!

678
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,380
What did I do?

679
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,710
I am telling you because I feel a little bad.

680
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,380
Ak Hee has a blade stabbed on his back.

681
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,140
Unless you take that out,

682
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,080
Sajo Hyun will not get up even if you feed him a potful of antidote.

683
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,050
A blade?

684
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,600
All of you, step away and take a break.

685
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,330
Come back after two hours.

686
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,800
Can we really do that?

687
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,350
My, of course.

688
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:51,860
It looks like we will be awake all night again, so let us take turns and rest.

689
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,030
Thank you, Eunuch Neung.

690
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,600
Yes, yes.

691
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,590
You guys go and rest, too. Go on.

692
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:29,140
I am glad Her Majesty had just gone out for a break.

693
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,190
She said she is especially tired today.

694
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,390
Your Majesty.

695
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,770
Her Majesty might come back at any moment.

696
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:43,280
I will stand guard in front and signal you.

697
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,000
Yeon Wol.

698
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,460
Yeon Wol?

699
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,570
Your Majesty.

700
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,680
How worried must you have been?

701
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,770
I am okay.

702
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,650
Yeon Wol, your face is...

703
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,210
There is no time.

704
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,490
I brought the antidote,

705
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,000
but I was told it works only if the blade is removed from Sir Ak Hee.

706
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,130
How did you get this?

707
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:28,790
Did you end up in a mess like this to get this?

708
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:32,230
I am going to try what Sir Ak Hee did last time.

709
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:35,750
I will come into your mind's space and pull out the blade.

710
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:44,890
Please take me to your mind's space.

711
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,440
I will try.

712
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:55,060
Please take me.

713
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,650
Please let me meet Sir Ak Hee.

714
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,950
Please...

715
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,140
Please take me there.

716
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,330
I will.

717
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,250
I will bring you.

718
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,630
Please.

719
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:53,520
It worked! It worked, Your Majesty!

720
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,130
It worked.

721
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,470
Kyera.

722
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,140
Sir Ak Hee!

723
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,220
Sir Ak Hee...

724
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,980
My goodness.

725
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,720
It hurts a lot, right?

726
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,030
Kyera,

727
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,410
did you come to save me?

728
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,830
Are you crying because of me?

729
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,670
Yeon Wol risked her life to come save you.

730
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,890
I know.

731
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,330
I will pull this out.

732
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,210
It will hurt a lot.

733
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,490
Does it hurt?

734
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,360
Does it hurt a lot?

735
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,640
It is okay. I am fine with the pain.

736
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,900
I am even fine with dying,

737
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,770
but it will not be so easy to pull this out.

738
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,640
I am going to pull it out.

739
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,740
I have to.

740
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,460
Your Majesty, you should sleep in your chamber today.

741
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,980
Did you not say you are feeling unwell?

742
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,600
I am feeling unwell, but I have a bad feeling.

743
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,020
Even if I am to rest, I must rest at His Majesty's chamber.

744
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:01,220
I should be the one doing it. Yeon Wol...

745
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,670
Please hang in there, Sir Ak Hee.

746
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,700
What is the matter?

747
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,150
I...

748
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,010
I have something to tell you, Your Majesty.

749
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,120
Y-Yeon Wol.

750
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,330
Yeon Wol, Her Majesty has arrived!

751
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,740
Aigoo, w-what do I do?

752
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,580
Yeon Wol.

753
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,020
Yeon Wol.

754
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,670
This is bad, Yeon Wol.

755
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,540
Yeon Wol!

756
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,420
I was so close to pulling it out.

757
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,540
Gosh, please, please. Please...

758
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:41,010
I am pregnant with your child.

759
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:46,910
Your Majesty, could I see you over there for a moment?

760
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,570
Later.

761
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,100
Y-Your Majesty.

762
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,250
Where did everyone go?

763
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:03,740
I told them to take a break.

764
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,730
How impertinent.

765
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,090
The smell...

766
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,960
Your Majesty, I told the palace ladies to run over here.

767
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,710
Hear ye!

768
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,890
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- There was an intruder.

769
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,340
Hurry up and pursue them!

770
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,710
Yes!

771
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,180
- Over there!
- Follow her!

772
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:58,150
Get her!

773
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:59,630
Get her!

774
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,620
- That way!
- Chase her!

775
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,800
Have you come to?

776
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,120
Master Yang.

777
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,620
Stay in bed.

778
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,590
You should not move.

779
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,460
What happened?

780
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,150
Why am I...

781
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,100
at this place?

782
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:14,210
I saw you passed out by the mountainside and brought you here.

783
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,010
What about His Majesty?

784
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,120
What happened to His Majesty?

785
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,260
Last night, I was at His Majesty's chamber.

786
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,100
It was not last night.

787
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,160
It was three nights ago.

788
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,800
You have been unconscious for that long.

789
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,200
Three days ago?

790
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,990
What about His Majesty?

791
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,060
What happened to His Majesty?

792
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,790
Master Yang.

793
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,060
No way.

794
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,850
Your Majesty?

795
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:33,630
Your Majesty.

796
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,960
You are awake.

797
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,820
Are you okay now?

798
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,760
I am okay.

799
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:08,910
I am glad.

800
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,350
I am so glad.

801
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,880
Thank you.

802
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:18,400
Your Majesty.

803
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,380
By the way,

804
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,350
who might you be?

805
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,690
Your Majesty.

806
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:14,270
♫ The feelings seeped through the hidden opening ♫

807
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:23,750
♫ Closing up and withering away, the sad memory ♫

808
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:30,210
♫ The feelings seeped through ♫

809
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:34,800
[Love Song for Illusion]

810
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:38,270
What is your name, young lady?

811
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:40,260
I had to leave your side anyway.

812
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,190
It is better for him not to know who I am.

813
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,570
Ak Hee disappeared?

814
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,550
He must have perished.

815
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,490
It is racing ever so hard here.

816
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:51,510
Who are you?

817
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,410
I have become pregnant.

818
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:55,310
Find a way to live, one way or the other.

819
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,060
I must let Ji Jeon Seo go.

820
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,750
He will be put to good use.

821
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,880
Could I hug you once, Your Majesty?

822
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,630
Sir Ak Hee, please summon me again.

823
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:10,130
♫ I set afloat my deep feelings onto the moon ♫
