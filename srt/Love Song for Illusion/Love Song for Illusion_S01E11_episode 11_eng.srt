00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,560
What are you all doing?

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,890
Arrest this evil spirit right now!

9
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,010
Sajo Yoong, you scoundrel!

10
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,800
On top of plotting a rebellion, are you mocking the King and the Royal Family?

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,650
How am I an evil spirit?

12
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,540
Everyone, watch clearly!

14
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,980
Your Majesty!

15
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,560
Your Majesty!

16
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,970
Did you see that?

17
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,090
If I am really an evil spirit,

18
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,430
would my blood be red like this?

19
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,250
You still do not believe me?

20
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,360
Fine.

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,960
If I am an evil spirit, I must be immortal and undying.

22
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,570
Sajo Yoong, strike my neck with your sword.

23
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,740
Your Majesty, please calm down.

24
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,680
Why can you not strike me down?

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,620
With everyone watching, kill the king and

26
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,880
hit the peak of your rebellion, Sajo Yoong.

27
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,470
What are the Royal Guards doing?

28
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,380
Arrest the rebels right away!

29
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,710
Lock up the rebels right away!

30
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,980
Officer Ji, tie this man up again.

31
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,630
Tie him up tightly!

32
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,890
Yes, Your Majesty!

33
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,980
Take him.

34
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,470
That man is definitely an evil spirit!

35
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,480
 Cheong Ta, where are you? Cheong Ta! 

36
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,900
 Let go! He is an evil spirit! 

37
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,630
 He is the one you should take! Let me go! 

38
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,100
 You are Ak Hee, huh? 

39
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,220
Please have us lowly ones killed for failing to protect you!

40
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,890
 Please have us killed! 

41
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,250
From this moment on, if anyone dares to refer to me as an evil spirit,

42
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,710
I will slash him with my sword right there and then.

43
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,160
Do you understand?

44
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,020
I shall heed your words to heart, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,880
 We shall heed your words to heart, Your Majesty! 

46
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,230
   

47
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,310
Cheong Ta.

48
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,290
What did you do to His Majesty?

49
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,630
What do you mean?

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,270
I saw you shoot the poison dart.

51
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,060
What kind of poison does it contain?

52
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,890
Poison— What poison dart are you talking about?

53
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,270
Sajo Yoong instigated you. Right?

54
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,370
Why did you side with Sajo Yoong?

55
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,500
My goodness!

56
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,340
Cheong Ta—

57
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,430
Hong Goon, do not move.

58
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,620
Yeon Wol.

59
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,110
It will hurt a lot.

60
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,050
Endure it.

61
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,120
You cannot move for a while.

62
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,090
I will go find herbs in the mountain that help with wounds.

63
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,240
Yeon Wol,

64
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,080
please just kill me.

65
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,370
 Yeon Wol. 

66
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,050
 Yeon Wol. 

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,570
 I am sorry. 

68
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,130
 I am sorry. 

69
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,680
 He said they would sell my sisters, who live outside the palace. 

70
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,970
 I am sorry! 

71
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,570
 Such a thing will not happen. 

72
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,630
 Run away right now. 

73
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,290
I tried to run away,

74
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,320
but I got caught.

75
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,190
It looks like we should bring the physician.

76
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,240
What if it gets infected?

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,640
How fussy. It is fine.

78
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,050
Your Majesty, are you feeling unwell?

79
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,220
No.

80
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,440
Your Majesty, I apologize for asking,

81
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,790
but you are Sir Ak Hee. Right?

82
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,600
I apologize, Your Majesty.

83
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,350
You are right. I am Ak Hee.

84
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,560
Then, what happened to His Majesty?

85
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,200
I heard he suddenly did not seem well on the interrogation grounds.

86
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,790
Right.

87
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,640
Well, I am sure he is not too well.

88
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,980
Goodness, His Majesty.

89
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,180
His Majesty.

90
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,370
Listen carefully.

91
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,550
From now on, you two, Eunuch Neung and Ji Jeon Seo are the only people I can trust.

92
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,760
You know things are rough right now. Right?

93
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,140
You need to get your acts together.

94
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,000
If you fall asleep, will His Majesty come back out, Sir Ak Hee?

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,670
Why? Are you worried Sajo Hyeon will not come out?

96
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,100
Because I might take over this body?

97
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,060
This is unpleasant, Ji Jeon Seo.

98
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,140
For now, secretly check if Kyera is okay.

99
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,470
- Yes. 
 - Even if Sajo Yoong is in prison,

100
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,180
he will be spinning his head to land a big blow. I understand the dynamics well.

101
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,330
- Yes. 
 - We will do that.

102
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,060
And also watch the Head Minister, Jin Mu Dal, and the queen closely.

103
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,550
There are so many people to watch out for.

104
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,100
Kyera.

105
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,020
Master Yang.

106
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,430
I thought something happened because you did not come while I waited.

107
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,280
You came at the perfect time earlier.

108
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,730
It was really close.

109
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,150
By the way, were rumors spreading inside the capital true?

110
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,800
I also saw His Majesty starting to act strange.

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,770
That is His Majesty's deep scar I told you about before.

112
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,310
The day our family was massacred that is what happened to His Majesty.

113
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,430
The one I have been facing so far...

114
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,970
was the evil spirit?

115
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:54,560
No, you always met with His Majesty, except for just now at the interrogation grounds.

116
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,260
And Sir Ak Hee is not an evil spirit.

117
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,370
He is just another personality who resides in His Majesty's body.

118
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,710
Another personality?

119
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,610
Sir Ak Hee is unfortunate, too.

120
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,580
Hey, Sajo Hyeon, you cannot speak here, either?

121
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,060
Man, it looks like that was a tranquilizing dart.

122
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,580
Gosh, Cheong Ta, that son of a bitch.

123
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,150
Right, you can talk to me through your mind.

124
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,120
Try talking in your mind.

125
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,820
 What happened to Yeon Wol? 

126
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,640
You are still worried about Kyera in this situation?

127
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,380
The woman who was shot by an arrow earlier was not Kyera.

128
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,500
It was Hong Goon.

129
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,990
Sajo Yoong, that punk, wanted to force me out,

130
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,970
so he intentionally made it look like Kyera was in danger.

131
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,500
Your body needs to weaken for me to force my way out.

132
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,480
That is why you were shot with a tranquilizing dart.

133
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,280
 I hope Yeon Wol is safe. 

134
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,740
Goodness, even in this state, Kyera is all you think about.

135
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,940
Is the floor not cold, huh?

136
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,020
Your mouth will start drooping.

137
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,130
Hold on a moment.

138
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,400
You are heavier than you look.

139
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,390
 Ak Hee, please check if Yeon Wol is okay. 

140
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,380
Hey, I already told them to check. Would I just do nothing?

141
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,210
Just worry about yourself!

142
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,640
Do you know how scary a tranquilizing dart is?

143
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,700
Tranquilizing darts show different effects according to the dosage you were hit with.

144
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,510
- You— 
  - Your Majesty! 

145
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,040
 Her Majesty and Head Minister have arrived. 

146
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,210
Let them enter.

147
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,580
Your Majesty, I heard Grand Prince Sajo Yoong brought about a bizarre rampage.

148
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,200
Are you okay?

149
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,780
Of course, I am okay.

150
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,370
I got to expose Sajo Yoong's impure intentions.

151
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,120
It is actually for the better.

152
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,350
By the way, according to the palace people,

153
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,200
at the interrogation grounds, you were—

154
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,070
Did they say I displayed questionable behavior?

155
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,610
Looks like they are excited to talk about the king being possessed by an evil spirit.

156
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,120
So, did you come running as well to see for yourself?

157
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,360
Sir Ak Hee.

158
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,900
W-What did you just say?

159
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,570
Head Minister, are you doubting me as well?

160
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,930
Did I look so questionable for getting furious at Sajo Yoong, who plotted treason?

161
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:56,340
Sir Ak Hee, you have to be honest with me and Her Majesty.

162
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:03,990
That is how we can unite and fight off the wicked Sajo Yoong.

163
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,230
What nonsense are you saying, Head Minister?

164
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,360
Father, how could you dare say such a thing to His Majesty?

165
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,560
Apologize right away.

166
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,440
I apologize, Your Majesty.

167
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,990
 Father, the current king is not His Majesty. 

168
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,550
He is clearly the one called Ak Hee.

169
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,540
His gaze looks different.

170
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,950
Yes, this is a serious problem.

171
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,810
Sajo Yoong is wreaking havoc like that, and

172
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,900
His Majesty let everyone find out a significant weakness.

173
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,170
My goodness.

174
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,980
Sajo Yoong is imprisoned, so he will not have his way for a while.

175
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,870
Do you not know Sajo Yoong?

176
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,710
Even if his limbs are tied and put in solitary confinement,

177
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,700
he is wicked enough to manipulate the heavens and earth.

178
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,350
Actually...

179
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,620
a crisis might turn out to be an opportunity.

180
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,540
Your Majesty,

181
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,310
sleep with the one called Ak Hee right away.

182
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,250
He might be easy to win over.

183
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,840
Father, how can you tell me to sleep with an evil spirit?

184
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,420
 Your Majesty, what happened— 

185
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,200
Wait and see.

186
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,020
Fate might be on our side, perhaps.

187
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,040
I wonder if Hong Goon is okay with taking an arrow to her leg?

188
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,990
Yeon Wol!

189
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
Why are you here?

190
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,150
His Majesty's chamber is dangerous right now.

191
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,340
Everyone is looking intensely from everywhere.

192
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,530
Do you know what happened to His Majesty?

193
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,720
No.

194
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,790
I asked Sir Ak Hee, but he only got mad.

195
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,080
I am also worried to death.

196
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,950
Eunuch Neung, I must meet Sir Ak Hee.

197
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,970
Your Majesty?

198
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,680
 I cannot even see you clearly now. 

199
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,720
 But I can still feel it. 

200
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,860
 That you are smiling right now. 

201
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,850
Kyera.

202
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,310
- Sir Ak Hee. 
 - Were you disappointed

203
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,860
because I am not Sajo Hyeon?

204
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,220
How is His Majesty right now?

205
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,430
He is not doing too well.

206
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,960
I think Cheong Ta shot him with a tranquilizing dart.

207
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,800
A tranquilizing dart?

208
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,990
What happens when you get shot by a tranquilizing dart?

209
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,370
I lost my memories because of the sleeping incense.

210
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,690
Tranquilizing darts show different symptoms depending on the dosage.

211
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,160
Losing memories is one.

212
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,690
Shot in the wrong spot, you might lose your speech or

213
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,750
your body stiffens like Sajo Hyeon.

214
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,210
His body stiffened and...

215
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,540
he cannot speak?

216
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,130
How...

217
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,920
How do you treat it?

218
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,380
What do I need to do?

219
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,900
Who knows?

220
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,170
I do not know what to do.

221
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,200
Cheong Ta must know the solution.

222
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,010
He helped me get my memories back, too.

223
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,730
Back then, I think he gave me the antidote.

224
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,110
I ran into him earlier.

225
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,680
I should have held onto him.

226
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,400
Sajo Hyeon was worried sick about you, too.

227
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,450
Whether you got hurt or not and

228
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,040
about what happened to you.

229
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,440
About me?

230
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,440
Tell him I am doing well.

231
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,560
Tell him I will find a way to save him one way or the other.

232
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,660
Tell him he cannot be losing heart now.

233
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,950
Please...

234
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,230
make sure to tell him.

235
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,690
I am sorry, Sir Ak Hee.

236
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,580
I was just worried and confused.

237
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,550
It is upsetting to hear you are sorry.

238
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,800
We are really like strangers now.

239
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,590
People who have nothing to do with each other.

240
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,430
I am—

241
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,990
Sir Ak Hee, are you unwell?

242
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,580
Your eyes are a little...

243
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,920
Do not worry about me.

244
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,640
I will find a way to heal Sajo Hyeon quickly.

245
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,940
Your Majesty!

246
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,790
Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

247
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,400
Something terrible happened.

248
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,580
What is wrong?

249
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,970
They said Prince Ga Ron was spitting blood and suddenly fainted!

250
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,270
Be careful.

251
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,370
I will get going now.

252
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,390
Bring me with you.

253
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,000
I might know what is going on.

254
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,330
Something seemed to have happened to Prince Ga Ron?

255
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,180
Seeing how he is staying inside, he must be ill.

256
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,630
Find out what illness it is.

257
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,790
Yes, I will.

258
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,140
Everyone got imprisoned.

259
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,120
What do we do now since all your men are tied down?

260
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,630
 W-Why did he suddenly lose consciousness and faint? 

261
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,970
 It looks like the flu. 

262
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,340
 He spat blood because bad energies came in from outside, making his lungs heat up. 

263
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,810
 If Jinhoi finds out, they will start making all kinds of assumptions. 

264
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,560
 I will find the cure promptly. 

265
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,640
 It looks strongly contagious. 

266
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,620
 It might be spreading among the people already. 

267
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,750
 You have to make sure it does not spread. 

268
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,050
The people are anxious, and turbulent lies are—

269
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,770
We will need to focus on containing the spread of the illness.

270
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,600
Minister of Medicine, especially the poor people and...

271
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,990
 Ak Hee. 

272
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,610
 Are you causing a curse to be laid on Asatae? 

273
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,530
That's right.

274
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,320
Wind Knives are going around villages and bringing the sick who cannot move.

275
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,280
I knew things were looking unsettling from a few days ago.

276
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,890
And it is spreading like wildfire out of nowhere.

277
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,110
It is the same symptom Hwang Ga Ron has.

278
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,770
Does he also have the plague?

279
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,400
Sir Physician!

280
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,440
Sir, thank you for all your work.

281
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,430
This illness is highly contagious.

282
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,310
You must prevent contagion by making the sick cover their nose and mouths with a towel.

283
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,490
Are you a physician?

284
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,350
I studied medicine since I was young.

285
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,740
I will help out as well.

286
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,600
P-Please be careful.

287
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,920
You must be dead tired

288
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,930
from discussing the measures all night.

289
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,860
If His Majesty wakes up because you go to sleep,

290
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,610
will he still be in that state?

291
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,670
Well...

292
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,510
probably?

293
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,090
So he cannot even talk and move freely?

294
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,860
That is why I cannot even sleep right now.

295
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,980
In this situation we have,

296
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,240
what will happen if Sajo Hyeon comes out unable to speak with a stiff body?

297
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,120
W-What do you think will happen?

298
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,250
Could His Majesty not have gotten better in the meantime?

299
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,120
So I should get lost now?

300
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,690
Oh, okay. I will go.

301
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,960
Gosh! S-Sir Ak Hee! N-No.

302
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,460
You cannot go to sleep, Sir Ak Hee.

303
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,870
You are still calling me "Sir Ak Hee"?

304
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,980
Y-Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

305
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,640
Your Majesty, please do not sleep.

306
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,730
Goodness! Y-Your Majesty, you cannot!

307
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,000
Wait, you cannot—

308
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,480
 Ak Hee, 

309
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,430
 please take care of my people... 

310
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,660
 and Yeon Wol, too. 

311
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,710
 The haunted king will bring forth a plague! 

312
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,760
Hwang Ga Ron caught the plague?

313
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,660
Looks like the heavens are also helping me, Sajo Yoong. Right?

314
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,940
You will soon take the throne, Grand Prince.

315
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,500
All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong!

316
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,650
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

317
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,650
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

318
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,570
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

319
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,610
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

320
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,620
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

321
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,680
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

322
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,770
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

323
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,830
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

324
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,850
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

325
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,800
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

326
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,350
 All hail His Majesty, Sajo Yoong! 

327
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:23,220
"The haunted king will bring forth a plague!"

328
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,150
The posters' contents changed.

329
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,740
What is worse is the fact that there is an actual plague.

330
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,800
That is right.

331
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,060
Would that mean...

332
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,930
it is because the evil spirit is possessing His Majesty?

333
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,140
No matter how I think about it, it is weird.

334
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,400
At the interrogation grounds,

335
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,300
His Majesty clearly seemed to become a different person.

336
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,540
 - You are right. 
 - Oh, right! 

337
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,990
That must be why he locked up Grand Prince Sajo Yoong, do you not think?

338
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,280
Because he knows His Majesty's secret!

339
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,980
 This is troublesome. 

340
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,800
All hail His Majesty!

341
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,040
Hence, as more people are catching the plague all over the country and

342
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,760
the people's resentment grows by the day—

343
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,500
Minister of Finance,

344
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:21,010
do you not know well how plagues came and went as seasons and times changed?

345
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,500
Just what is all this fuss about?

346
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,260
Your Majesty, it is not a fuss. In reality, within the capital,

347
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,750
there— Gosh, Your Majesty— Never mind, Your Majesty.

348
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,530
The rumor that the plague was caused by the haunted king?

349
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,630
Are you not the ones who are actually trembling in fear, Ministers?

350
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,760
Stop feeding into the rumors here and there.

351
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,750
And I hope you will cooperate with the Minister of Medicine.

352
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,920
Answer?

353
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,250
 - Yes, Your Majesty!  
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

354
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,110
 Your Majesty! 

355
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,610
I, Minister of General Affairs, report to you.

356
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:09,200
Jinhoi's messengers arrived at Port Mihwari and requested to meet you.

357
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,930
What do they want to see me about?

358
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,850
Well,

359
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,420
they are demanding Grand Prince Sajo Yoong to be released promptly.

360
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,860
W-What now?

361
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,650
Wait. Who are they to tell me what to do?

362
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,230
You can all leave for today and

363
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,110
I want the Minister of General Affairs and Head Minister to stay.

364
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

365
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,380
They want to meet Prince Ga Ron?

366
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,680
Is that what the messengers asked for?

367
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,360
Yes, they heard a rumor that Prince Ga Ron is currently being detained inside the palace.

368
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,750
So they want to meet Prince Ga Ron quickly and confirm his well-being.

369
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,430
He is detained? How ridiculous.

370
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,860
I will take care of this, so do not let this bother you too much.

371
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,930
I am sure it was here.

372
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:35,460
Gosh! What on Earth are you looking for?

373
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,140
Did you bury some gold around here?

374
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,570
Who am I talking to? Geez!

375
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,130
- Huh? Whoa! 
 - Whoa!

376
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,910
Gosh, we found it!

377
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,150
They're medical books my grandmother gave me.

378
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,690
Your grandmother?

379
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,860
You said she was a royal physician.

380
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,000
I think I read a similar plague going around in the past.

381
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,590
I found it! I found it!

382
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,980
My memory was right!

383
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,700
- It was right! 
 - You were right!

384
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,930
You hit my right arm. Ouch. 
  (Sounds like "You're right" in Korean) 

385
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,790
These are ephedra and licorice.

386
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,400
These are gypsum and apricot kernels.

387
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,680
Ephedra and gypsum only grow deep in the mountains.

388
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,200
If you continue to give ephedra gypsum tea to the patients, it will have an effect on the plague.

389
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,830
And make sure to use needle therapy on dazhui. 
  (Acupuncture point used for fevers) 

390
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,850
I understand.

391
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,230
Are you going to the palace?

392
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,130
Prince Ga Ron needs to be saved.

393
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,300
Jinhoi will be sure to pose it as a problem.

394
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,610
And that is what Grand Prince Sajo Yoong would rejoice over.

395
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,990
Be careful.

396
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,380
Sajo Yoong's henchmen are everywhere.

397
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,500
Yes, Master Yang.

398
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,580
Why is he not regaining consciousness?

399
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,460
Prince Ga Ron was born with weak energy, so it looks like he cannot recover as quickly.

400
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,730
We need him to wake up so he can take the medicine.

401
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Jinhoi is mistakenly thinking we are detaining this man.

402
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,140
They keep requesting to meet him.

403
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,840
Sajo Yoong must have contacted them.

404
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,670
Yes, what a wicked bastard.

405
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:54,520
I did intimidate the messengers, saying how dare they mock our Royal Family.

406
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,880
But their assumptions will only worsen as time goes on.

407
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,470
We will need to make sure he wakes up.

408
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,340
I will keep tending to him here.

409
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,950
Well...

410
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,400
Sajo Hyeon is doing well.

411
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,340
He did not worsen.

412
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,300
It is a relief to hear he did not worsen.

413
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,920
♫  I will come and meet you  ♫

414
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:54,210
♫  I will come to you where you are breathing  ♫

415
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,030
♫  Close your eyes for a moment  ♫

416
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,250
 Your Majesty, how difficult must it be for you? 

417
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,820
 How worried and lonely must you be? 

418
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,730
 I miss you, Your Majesty. 

419
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,380
♫  Please embrace me  ♫

420
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,680
♫  I will reach you now  ♫

421
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,570
 Kyera, you are crying. 

422
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,940
♫  With my breath  ♫

423
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,810
 Your love for Sajo Hyeon is deep enough 

424
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,550
 to shed tears without others knowing. 

425
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:34,730
♫  The moment the flowers bloom again after this winter  ♫

426
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:44,190
♫  I will reach you now  ♫

427
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,100
Prince Ga Ron!

428
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,030
It is you again?

429
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,450
Great job! Thank you for overcoming!

430
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,420
Please drink it all.

431
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,930
Goodness, you drank it so well.

432
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,610
All right, this one, too.

433
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,310
I am sincerely glad you recovered.

434
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,380
You are all at your wits' ends.

435
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,430
You must have been scared that people would find out I got sick.

436
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,270
Of course, we were.

437
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,390
Because we do not know what issue a stronger country may raise against us.

438
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,670
However, aside from all of this,

439
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:43,100
we sincerely wished just for you to recover.

440
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,100
Because a person's life should not be used as a tool,

441
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,060
much like Asatae's women, who were sold off to Jinhoi.

442
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:59,800
I only had compassion as someone who practices medicine as I watched you suffer in pain.

443
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,140
Yeon Wol searched the mountains to bring precious medicinal herbs.

444
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,270
And she nursed you all day, every day.

445
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,360
Thanks.

446
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,040
Messengers from Jinhoi are waiting for you.

447
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,220
If you are truly apologetic to Asatae's women who were sacrificed unjustly,

448
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,030
if you have even an inkling of thanks for this woman who nursed you,

449
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,040
I trust you will be a good mediator.

450
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,400
I went to visit him and

451
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,260
Grand Prince had lost so much weight.

452
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,000
Queen, what if the Grand Prince dies like that?

453
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,220
Please save Grand Prince, Queen.

454
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,250
I will...

455
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,590
beg...

456
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,930
I will beg like this, Queen. Please?

457
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:19,200
As expected, a mother's love is quite sad and beautiful like this.

458
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,530
Of course!

459
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,120
If it is for my son, I am fine with getting ripped apart

460
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,640
and becoming the crows' food.

461
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,110
Queen, please...

462
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,180
If you help me, Consort Cheong Myeong, I will release Grand Prince.

463
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,160
How?

464
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,820
I will do anything. Just say the word.

465
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:50,640
Please announce that the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is not the late king's biological son.

466
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,260
How did you know—

467
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,140
What do you mean, Queen?

468
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,700
You see, my Yoong is...

469
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,880
a long time ago when I was—

470
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,200
So, when the late king was a general,

471
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,370
I secretly had such-and-such happen to give birth to him.

472
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:19,820
Of course, I did have a good-for-nothing husband at the time.

473
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,510
But he is nothing more than a fool.

474
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,270
I only loved His Majesty, so—

475
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,170
Hear ye.

476
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

477
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,890
Demote Consort Cheong Myeong, the mother of the rebel Sajo Yoong, to a court lady

478
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,750
and detain her in her residence.

479
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,040
Yes.

480
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,390
Wait, why?

481
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,060
I only came to beg you, Queen.

482
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:52,480
As the leader of the Inner Court, I was thinking about demoting you to a court lady.

483
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,660
So you came at just the right time.

484
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,730
Be glad you were not kicked out of the palace and

485
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,460
just stay put inside your residence.

486
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,660
Instead of peeking here and there within the palace

487
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,270
like a stray cat to report to your son, Court Lady Gwang.

488
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,950
C-Court Lady Gwang?

489
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,220
Queen, how can you do this to me?

490
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,060
I am more or less your mother-in-law!

491
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,310
Let go, you lowly ones!

492
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,830
I am the late king's best concubine and

493
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,860
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's mother!

494
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,530
Let go of me!

495
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,840
Let go!

496
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,270
I am sure Cheong Ta lived around here.

497
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,620
Cheong Ta?

498
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,420
 Kyera! 

499
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,260
 I got it from a powerful shaman. 

500
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,740
 Put this on one's forehead and 

501
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,520
 they freeze just like that. 

502
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,540
 Would Cheong Ta not be more powerful than that shaman? 

503
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,700
 No, no! Even tigers jump when bitten by a flea. 

504
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,730
 Take it. It is better than nothing. 

505
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,340
Do not move!

506
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,220
Kyera.

507
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,020
Wait! So you would wander the mountains like this?

508
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,530
In the middle of the night? So fearlessly? All alone?

509
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,120
What can I do, then? Cheong Ta is the only one who can fix His Majesty.

510
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,580
Look, and also,

511
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,670
these cheap talismans do not work on Cheong Ta.

512
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,730
Where the heck is this punk, though?

513
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,020
Seeing how he appeared at the interrogation grounds,

514
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,330
I do not think he moved too far away.

515
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,770
Why did he not move far?

516
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,660
 Look at your body. 

517
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,100
 It is fading away. Right? 

518
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,400
 At this rate, you will disappear completely in the end. 

519
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,920
 And I will disappear, too, on top of that. 

520
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,110
He cannot move that far.

521
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,260
Why?

522
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,640
Because Female Cheong Ta is being held hostage.

523
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,340
Female Cheong Ta?

524
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,680
There is a female Cheong Ta?

525
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,700
Two people coexist in his body.

526
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,360
Male Cheong Ta and Female Cheong Ta.

527
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:46,240
Oh, so you are saying Cheong Ta also shares one body like you and His Majesty.

528
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,590
Why must you compare me to them? That is insulting.

529
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:54,350
They are a male-female body.

530
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,510
So Sajo Hyeon and I are...

531
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,790
A man-man body? 
  (Can also mean "modest body") 

532
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,010
Anyhow, something happened to Female Cheong Ta.

533
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,730
That is why Male Cheong Ta is doing as Sajo Yoong orders.

534
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,840
In that case, Female Cheong Ta must be locked up somewhere.

535
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,080
A place where even Male Cheong Ta cannot approach.

536
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,870
I am so hungry.

537
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:35,210
Chicken, a boar's hindleg, pig's feet,

538
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,030
bean rice cakes, honey rice cakes, deep-fried wheat cakes,

539
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,750
large beef intestines, small beef intestines, and beef abomasum.

540
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,740
It is our first time walking together like this.

541
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,550
Why?

542
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:08,050
Because the shadows only show us two.

543
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,320
Kyera and I.

544
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,620
Neither fake nor real, just me.

545
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,440
Your Majesty.

546
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,030
Do you miss Sajo Hyeon that much?

547
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,040
I am sorry.

548
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,360
You said you do not like to hear this.

549
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,300
I will let you meet Sajo Hyeon.

550
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,020
- Sir Ak Hee. 
 - You cannot see him for a long time.

551
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,100
It is only for a moment.

552
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,000
Are you going to fall asleep again? Right here?

553
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,570
You cannot. It is dangerous.

554
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,250
Sir Ak Hee.

555
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,780
Sorry.

556
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,010
I do not know if this will work,

557
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,580
but it might.

558
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,340
Close your eyes and think of Sajo Hyeon.

559
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,130
Trust me.

560
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,970
Trust me fully.

561
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,140
I trust you.

562
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,210
 Will it work? 

563
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:52,900
 Will I be able to take you to the mind's space, Kyera? 

564
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,360
Where is this place?

565
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,330
This is the mind's room.

566
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,270
A place where Sajo Hyeon and I meet.

567
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,110
Your Majesty!

568
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,180
Your Majesty.

569
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,620
 Yeon Wol. 

570
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,010
Your Majesty, even in this place, you are...

571
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,920
 How did you bring Yeon Wol? 

572
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,520
Hey, Sajo Hyeon, do not scold me too much.

573
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,930
Last time, I could have slept if I wanted to,

574
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,490
but taking you out and having you stay the same will be troublesome.

575
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,620
They are already at it about the evil spirit and stuff!

576
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,950
Goodness, I am dizzy.

577
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:09,440
It must have been exhausting to bring me here.

578
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,250
Your Majesty, does it hurt?

579
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,390
Where does it hurt?

580
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,740
Do not worry.

581
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,100
I am going to cure you for sure.

582
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,870
 I am fine. 

583
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,010
 I am worried about you. 

584
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,600
 You have to be careful. 

585
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,720
He said he is fine.

586
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,550
Acting tough, huh.

587
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,710
He said he is worried about you, so you should be careful.

588
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,560
Your Majesty, just think about the good stuff.

589
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,110
The good times we had.

590
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:48,540
The beautiful memories.

591
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,660
 I will. 

592
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,180
He said he will.

593
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,930
Gosh, why am I doing this for them?

594
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,740
♫  I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere  ♫

595
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,530
Your Majesty.

596
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:15,600
♫  The place where you are, even if it'll only be a moment, please take me  ♫

597
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:29,380
♫  Please hold me so I do not waver, I am tired  ♫

598
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:42,210
♫  Please hug me so I can relax  ♫

599
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,920
♫  Because I was you  ♫

600
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,140
We must find Female Cheong Ta.

601
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,900
I mean...

602
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,320
Even Male Cheong Ta is nowhere to be found.

603
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,780
So, how can we find Female Cheong Ta?

604
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:06,260
If Female Cheong Ta is locked up somewhere, it means she is immobile,

605
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,700
which means we can find her.

606
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,700
When on earth?

607
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,100
Rather than to find Female Cheong Ta, I would—

608
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,840
You would rather?

609
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,430
Gosh, so dizzy.

610
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,410
You are exhausted because of me. Right?

611
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,390
It is not because of you.

612
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,800
My nosiness is the problem.

613
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,990
Gosh, so annoying! I need to be able to see to do anything!

614
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:44,650
You cannot see this?

615
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,310
It was figurative speech.

616
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,950
Let me see.

617
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,190
Stop overreacting and hold it for a moment!

618
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,910
No, it hurts when we make contact!

619
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,540
We just made contact.

620
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,540
I am sorry.

621
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:15,580
Sir Ak Hee, your vision is blurry. Right?

622
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:20,350
Nope, I can see just fine.

623
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,340
Officer Ji is over there.

624
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,060
Officer Ji!

625
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,710
Your Majesty, how far have you traveled?

626
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:33,930
Oh, just up to there.

627
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,900
You are going. Right?

628
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,360
Take care, then.

629
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,060
- Sir Ak Hee— 
 - Please be careful!

630
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,420
Oh, I-I am fine.

631
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,590
 Where did a plague suddenly come from? 

632
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,980
 I am about to die. 

633
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,210
You got a lot better. You will be cured soon.

634
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,850
What is the use of just me getting cured?

635
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,400
The entire neighborhood is full of sick people.

636
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,470
Goodness, it is because the king is haunted. We are all going to die.

637
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:28,430
That is not true, ma'am. This is a curable sickness.

638
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,650
It only spreads because it is contagious.

639
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,450
All the rumors about the king being haunted are false.

640
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,480
What are you saying is false?

641
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,780
The fish died in groups, surfacing on the river.

642
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,490
They said healthy trees withered to death.

643
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,800
I saw it, too.

644
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,100
The fish died at once like that.

645
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,590
A 100-year-old white turtle died with its belly showing.

646
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:54,200
This is all because of the haunted king!

647
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,910
 The evil spirit possessed... 

648
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:06,140
We are the only ones dying out because of the haunted king!

649
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,690
They are heading to the government office today, too.

650
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,050
The haunted king should step down!

651
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,880
We are all going to die at this rate!

652
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,710
The haunted king should step down!

653
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,130
Sajo Yoong is manipulating public opinion again.

654
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,100
The people are being swayed.

655
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,040
It is because the plague is spreading.

656
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,400
You distributed the medicine I made. Right?

657
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,960
Wind Knives are visiting each village to hand them out, but it is not enough.

658
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,260
I heard the border situation is looking dangerous, too.

659
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,290
Gosh, this is terrible.

660
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:47,300
 The haunted king should step down! 

661
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,480
The public opinion is worsening.

662
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,630
You have to step forward, Sir Ak Hee.

663
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,060
What? Should I step forward and

664
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,200
tell them I am not an evil spirit but the king?

665
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,310
That seems to be the best we can do for now.

666
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,490
I do not want to.

667
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,840
You promised me you would help His Majesty.

668
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,520
When did I?

669
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,400
You made that promise on your own, Kyera.

670
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,950
Letting you meet Sajo Hyeon was not enough?

671
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,840
Are you not asking too much from me?

672
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,360
- Sir Ak Hee! 
 - Also,

673
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,840
I am an evil spirit.

674
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,530
You want me to stand in front of the people and say I am not an evil spirit?

675
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:26,980
What if a tranquilizing dart comes my way?

676
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,810
Are you going to take it in my place?

677
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,630
I apologize. I was feeling too desperate.

678
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,600
I brought you medicine for your eyes.

679
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,600
I will tell Eunuch Neung to brew it for you.

680
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,100
I get such great treatment, thanks to Sajo Hyeon.

681
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,380
Do you think these medicines will work on an evil spirit?

682
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,770
Take them back, and stop teasing me.

683
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,130
Sir Ak Hee, why are you so angry at me?

684
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:15,000
It is because of how I met His Majesty last time. Right?

685
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,540
Yes, you are right!

686
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,630
I regret having helped you two meet!

687
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:25,170
Why do I need to help your romance, huh?

688
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,830
Go.

689
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,470
Go and never come to me again.

690
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:31,800
- Sir Ak Hee. 
 - This is a royal decree.

691
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,120
Get lost.

692
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,050
Is Cheong Ta looking right now?

693
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,550
I hope he is looking.

694
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,800
Ak Hee, are you quite pissed now?

695
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,920
 Why did you drive away Yeon Wol so harshly? 

696
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,890
Do you not know Kyera?

697
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,040
No matter how harsh I am with her, she is not even fazed.

698
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,000
It is not like she will not come back just because I kicked her out.

699
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,980
 Are you saying you did it on purpose? 

700
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,990
Gosh, I do not know.

701
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,970
 What will you do with your worsening vision? 

702
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,400
 Is there no way for you to get better? 

703
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:41,130
There is.

704
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,600
If I seal you away with bonghamsal,

705
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,010
my eyes will probably get better again. Should I do that?

706
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:52,810
I am already annoyed seeing you and Kyera getting all lovey-dovey.

707
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,150
 Do as you wish. 

708
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,280
 If I am to live on like this, 

709
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,300
 it will be better for you to take over this body. 

710
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,010
Wait, really?

711
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:08,120
What about Kyera, then?

712
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,590
 She will forget me one day. 

713
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:16,990
 It will be better than living in pain while watching me live in this state. 

714
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,250
Even if that happens,

715
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,690
will you not regret it?

716
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,290
 I will not regret it. 

717
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,260
Consort Cheong Myeong was?

718
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,760
Yes.

719
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,970
She was demoted to a court lady overnight.

720
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,240
Her Majesty...

721
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,960
is really scary.

722
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,620
Where is Consort Cheong Myeong right now?

723
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,230
 Your Highness Consort Cheong Myeong. 

724
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,360
 Your Highness, what happened to you? 

725
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,570
 Why did you come here? 

726
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,700
 Did you come to kill me? 

727
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,490
 No, I came to give you Grand Prince's message. 

728
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:28,470
 Are you not... 

729
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,130
 like this with Yoong? 

730
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:33,210
 It seems that way in other people's eyes. 

731
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:37,060
 He took care of me since I was young. 

732
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:44,210
 Grand Prince told me to tell you not to be too worried 

733
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,600
 and to cheer up. 

734
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,480
 My Yoong did? 

735
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,050
 Yoong. 

736
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:05,670
 Also, the Grand Prince asked if the one locked up at that time was doing okay. 

737
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,460
 Locked up? 

738
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,770
 Oh, right! 

739
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,920
 The shaman he locked up in the warehouse in Dabutgol. 

740
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,280
 Yes. 

741
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,240
 I am sure she is doing okay. 

742
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,880
 No one knows she is there. 

743
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,420
 Dabutgol is not far from the capital. 

744
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,490
 I hope Female Cheong Ta is there. 

745
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,750
   

746
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,850
Well, it is about time for Cheong Ta to show up.

747
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,600
Hey.

748
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,900
Long time no see.

749
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,610
Have you decided now?

750
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:11,310
Yes, I am going to seal Sajo Hyeon with bonghamsal.

751
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,590
So I can take over this body.

752
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:17,550
What will you do with Grand Prince Sajo Yoong?

753
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,440
I will release him.

754
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,100
I am also going to give him the crown at the proper time.

755
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,650
You should have done so from the beginning.

756
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,540
You are so right.

757
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:34,410
Watching Sajo Hyeon and Kyera, I had a soft spot for them out of pity for a while.

758
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,140
But it was pointless.

759
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,590
They are only happy by themselves.

760
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:43,050
Gosh, I am losing my vision every day.

761
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:45,560
What is all this for?

762
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:56,050
Do you really want bonghamsal?

763
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,100
Of course! By the way, can you really do it?

764
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,740
The full moon passed already.

765
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,280
- Cheong Ta, you know me, right? 
 - Yes, yes.

766
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,320
Please take off this talisman on my forehead

767
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,270
and all the other talismans!

768
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:31,190
Yes, I will take it off.

769
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:33,510
Yes, yes, hurry now!

770
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,350
Before that,

771
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,470
give me the antidote.

772
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,760
- Antidote? 
 - Do you not know?

773
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,160
Male Cheong Ta tranquilized His Majesty so he could not move or speak.

774
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,290
That was ordered by Sajo Yoong.

775
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,270
Sajo Yoong, that evil bastard.

776
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,510
Give me the antidote, please, Cheong Ta.

777
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,270
Things are chaotic inside the capital right now because of a plague and

778
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,980
even Jinhoi is taunting us.

779
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,940
His Majesty needs to wake up soon.

780
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,940
Sajo Yoong will not let me be.

781
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,370
I will protect you.

782
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,940
No, you cannot.

783
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,620
Cheong Ta, then, instead,

784
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,570
make my body stiffen and let His Majesty wake up.

785
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:22,540
I cannot see him wither away powerlessly like that.

786
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:28,430
Make me like him instead or take my life, even. Do whatever. Instead...

787
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,770
Instead, please save His Majesty, Cheong Ta.

788
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:36,820
Please.

789
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:42,210
Oh, my, your love is

790
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:45,010
really so romantic.

791
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,810
Can I really take your life?

792
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:53,080
Yes.

793
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,050
You cannot disappear if I do this. Right?

794
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:18,310
I said I would expose your doings to the shaman association if you keep acting up. Did I or did I not?

795
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:21,930
How are you going to report me?

796
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,110
Jinhoi's shaman, Tan Ya.

797
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:27,240
Jinhoi's prince, Hwang Ga Ron, is best friends with Shaman Tan Ya.

798
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,350
So?

799
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:30,490
I will expose everything you did.

800
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:31,740
I got the evidence, too.

801
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,110
D-Darn!

802
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,200
So make Sajo Hyeon wake up.

803
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,430
Right now!

804
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:41,420
You were lying about getting bonghamsal.

805
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,220
I am sure you did not come here to do bonghamsal, either.

806
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,580
The full moon passed already.

807
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,130
You catch on fast, Ak Hee.

808
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:53,300
That is right. I did not come to do bonghamsal.

809
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,490
I came to do geuminsal.

810
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:59,720
G-Geuminsal? What is that?

811
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,440
That would be...

812
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,930
This is it!

813
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,520
If I hold you down with that blade,

814
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,960
how are you going to report us?

815
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:32,320
You and Sajo Hyeon both need to be eliminated

816
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,800
in order for us to survive.

817
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,910
Sorry, Ak Hee.

818
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,360
 Ak Hee, what is wrong? 

819
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,120
 Ak Hee! 

820
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:30,530
 Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 

821
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:39,080
Sir Ak Hee, did you enjoy your walk?

822
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,740
 Eunuch Neung. 

823
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:46,100
Your Majesty?

824
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,140
Your Majesty!

825
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,630
Why are you so slow?

826
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,810
- Seriously. 
 - Yeon Wol.

827
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:05,560
- Cheong Ta! 
 - Gosh.

828
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,220
- Give me the antidote. 
 - What?

829
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,510
Cure His Majesty. Please give me the antidote!

830
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,180
Please give me the antidote!

831
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,910
Let me go! Let go!

832
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,430
Female Cheong Ta, you said you would give me the antidote, and that is why I saved you!

833
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,980
You trusted her words?

834
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:40,900
I am sorry!

835
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,080
Let us hurry!

836
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,100
Cheong Ta! Hey!

837
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,180
 Yeon Wol. 

838
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:58,610
Kyera.

839
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:05,800

846
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:35,250
 Ak Hee, open your eyes. Are you dead? 

847
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:40,240
 I think it is time we make our stance clear. 

848
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,400
 I need the antidote for a tranquilizing dart. 

849
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,520
 Are you ready? 

850
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,470
 All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong! 

851
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:49,480
 Is it not actually an opportunity for me? 

852
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,500
 I will come over there, so you pull this out. 

853
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,410
 We must get rid of the haunted king taking up space in the chamber. 

854
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:58,660
 I will come. 

855
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,600
 I will come into your mind's space and pull out the blade. 

856
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,410
 Yeon Wol.
