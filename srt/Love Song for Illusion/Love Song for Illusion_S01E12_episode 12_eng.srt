1
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,340
   

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,210
   

3
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,750
   

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,170
   

5
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,200
   

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,910
   

7
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,070
Your Majesty! Goodness, what do I do?

8
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,060
Did Sir Ak Hee fall asleep?

9
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,430
Good grief!

10
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,830
Gosh, how frustrating.

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,170
You cannot even write to communicate because your body is so stiff.

12
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,000
Where did Ji Jeon go?

13
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,760
 What is this? 

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,990
 The bag used to carry sleeping incense. 

15
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,270
 It is proof Cheong Ta sold me sleeping incense. 

16
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,200
 I am going to meet Cheong Ta at the Hall of Spirits tonight. 

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,820
 Officer Ji, stand guard at the door, and if I am 

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,270
 nowhere to be seen, but Cheong Ta leaves the Hall of Spirits all alone, 

19
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:46,780
 then take these two things and go to Prince Ga Ron right away. 

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,180
 If Cheong Ta leaves the Hall of Spirits alone, 

21
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,880
 it means your plan failed, does it not? 

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,280
 I must catch Cheong Ta first and— 

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,390
 There is no use attacking him. 

24
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,010
 It would be too late by then already. 

25
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,880
 So, if you want to help me and Sajo Hyeon, 

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,590
 go meet Prince Ga Ron as quickly as you can. Got it? 

27
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,790
    
 Your Majesty, it is uncomfortable. Right?

28
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,530
I apologize, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,840
I cannot tell the palace maids to help.

30
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,540
Your water.

31
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,730
Oh my god! I am really sorry, Your Majesty!

32
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,090
Goodness, p-please have some water.

33
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,560
There, there.

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,910
 Her Majesty has arrived. 

35
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,340
 No. 

36
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,390
A-Ask her to wait a moment!

37
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:52,060
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Troubled HeartsTeam @ Viki.com 

38
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,770
Eunuch Neung, what are you doing?

39
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,400
Well... t-the thing is...

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,050
Your Majesty?

41
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,540
Everyone, step back now!

42
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,340
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,890
How did this happen?

44
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,630
Where did Ak Hee go?

45
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,080
Well, I-I do not really know, either.

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,000
Around early evening, Sir Ak Hee went out alone for a walk and...

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,210
 Sleep with the one called Ak Hee right away. 

48
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,890
 He might be easy to win over. 

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,730
Your Majesty, you cannot stay like this.

50
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,610
You must entrust everything to Ak Hee for a while.

51
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,140
What are you doing? Help His Majesty lie down and let him go to sleep. Hurry.

52
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,470
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,550
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

54
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,760
Your Majesty, the times are looking turbulent.

55
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,720
Your officials may barge in at any given moment and ask to see you.

56
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,200
You cannot let them see you like this.

57
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,550
Go to sleep right now.

58
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,780
 My goodness, she is about to slap me if I do not go to sleep. 

59
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,820
All right, have peaceful thoughts.

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,700
 Is it not actually an opportunity for me? 

61
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,880
Your Majesty, this humble one will be by His Majesty's side tonight, so you can—

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,430
I will be by His Majesty's side tonight.

63
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,330
- Sorry? 
 - It is a natural thing to do as the queen.

64
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,630
Eunuch Neung, you can take your leave.

65
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,380
- But still— 
 - What are you waiting for? Hurry up and go.

66
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,260
 Eunuch Neung. 

68
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,340
 Eunuch Neung! 

69
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,750
All right, please close your eyes, Your Majesty.

70
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,580
 Gosh, it will be better to close my eyes. 

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,370
Huh?

72
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,120
Wait.

73
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,000
What will she do to His Majesty, who is already unwell?

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,860
 Ak Hee, what is going on? 

75
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,720
 Open your eyes. 

76
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
 Are you dead? 

77
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,440
If I were dead,

78
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,330
would you have been summoned here?

79
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,240
However,

80
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,470
it does feel like I am in the process of dying.

81
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,190
 Did Cheong Ta do this to you? 

82
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,180
 Cheong Ta talked you into taking over this body, did he not? 

83
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,780
 But why did he do this to you? 

84
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,770
It means he does not need either of us now.

85
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,850
It means he is head over heels for Sajo Yoong.

86
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,600
 Did you upset Cheong Ta? 

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,050
 I told you to treat him well! 

88
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,640
Gosh, you are nagging again.

89
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,230
Will I miss this, too?

90
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,700
If I am erased...

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,770
 Stay with me, Ak Hee. 

92
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,450
 You cannot die, Ak Hee! 

93
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,090
So noisy.

94
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,120
 We did not switch. 

95
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,380
Sir Ak Hee?

96
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,100
Your Majesty.

97
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,090
What should we do about this?

98
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,040
I thought he would switch with Ak Hee today if he sleeps.

99
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,180
Where is the man called Ak Hee?

100
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,350
Do you know, Eunuch Neung?

101
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,810
I-I do not really know.

102
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,610
Eunuch Neung does not know, either. No one knows.

103
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,800
Could it not be the evil spirit is gone for good?

104
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,970
So the evil spirit is gone, and the half-witted—

105
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,600
And only His Majesty remains in this state?

106
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,610
 Are they thinking I became an idiot who cannot even understand what is going on? 

107
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,380
More so, we must remain calm.

108
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,200
 First off, please lead today's assembly, Father. 

109
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,700
 Yeon Wol, where are you? 

110
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,110
 I hope you did not catch the plague while tending to the sick. 

111
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,070
 I am sure she is working hard for me wherever she is. 

112
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,970
 Looks like something is going on in his chamber. 

113
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,870
This is a serious problem.

114
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,140
 Did the Queen spend the night in his chamber? 

115
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,410
 With Sir Ak Hee? 

116
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,360
Eunuch Neung!

117
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,080
His Majesty switched back?

118
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,250
Yes. Wait—

119
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,490
You cannot.

120
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,720
Her Majesty has been sticking around right by his side since last night.

121
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,520
His Majesty and Her Majesty spent the night together, then?

122
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,490
Yes.

123
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:32,010
Oh, t-the thing is, t-they could not really do much...

124
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,090
Well, anyhow.

125
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,760
His Majesty still cannot move or speak.

126
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,410
Sir Ak Hee promised so confidently he would help until His Majesty got better.

127
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,190
I know.

128
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,270
Ak Hee, that flip-flopper, must have been ticked off by something again

129
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,180
or something happened to him.

130
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,610
And Ji Jeon is nowhere to be seen, either.

131
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,800
Officer Ji?

132
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,970
You want me to introduce you to Shaman Tan Ya?

133
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,480
For what business?

134
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,720
I do not know the details, either.

135
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,520
However, if you will grant me this request,

136
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,830
His Majesty said he will continue to help you, Prince Ga Ron.

137
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,140
I am indeed close to Tan Ya.

138
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,520
It is an urgent matter.

139
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,930
Please help.

140
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,450
These things will not do.

141
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,810
Perhaps, if Yeon Wol were to come in person...

142
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,960
- Prince Ga Ron— 
 - I do not have time, either.

143
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,780
Because I am going back to Jinhoi today.

144
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,870
His Majesty is feeling unwell,

145
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,950
so I will lead today's assembly.

146
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,090
How exactly is His Majesty feeling unwell?

147
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,430
His Majesty was just concerned about the plethora of current governing issues,

148
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,920
which made him rather lethargic.

149
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,880
So, do not make unnecessary guesses.

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,860
Minister of General Affairs.

151
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,010
How did the issue with Jinhoi go?

152
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:18,070
They have been calling into question our military actions at Port Mihwari ever since.

153
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,510
Alas, my goodness!

154
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,880
It looks like our relationship with Jinhoi, which took a long time to build,

155
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,860
will crumble overnight.

156
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,760
That is exactly so.

157
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,320
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong had to work so hard with the late king to

158
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,680
build our relationship with Jinhoi, did he not?

159
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,470
Thanks to him, we were able to fend off neighboring tribes' invasions, too.

160
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,530
That is correct.

161
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,680
His Majesty could not even

162
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,680
come to the assembly at the Royal Council Hall?

163
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,020
I had gone to His Majesty's chamber,

164
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,600
but Her Majesty strictly forbade us from meeting him.

165
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,540
What do you fear about a mere queen that you could not even see His Majesty?

166
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,500
You must pull on the rein even more at a time like this.

167
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,280
Tell Jinhoi's messengers to come forth more strongly.

168
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,640
I can tell now.

169
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,970
Cheong Ta must have done something to Sir Ak Hee.

170
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,540
That is why His Majesty came back.

171
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,880
I do not know what to do.

172
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,600
Prince Ga Ron said he would go back to Jinhoi today.

173
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,890
He must have said that to make us more anxious.

174
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,110
I will go to him.

175
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,220
I apologize.

176
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,750
Gosh, I feel so weak.

177
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,400
 Cheong Ta. 

178
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,840
 Make my body stiffen and let His Majesty wake up. 

179
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,140
 Make me like him instead or take my life, even. Do whatever. Instead... 

180
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,430
 Instead, please save His Majesty, Cheong Ta. 

181
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,330
Even risking her life for love...

182
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,230
That dear love...

183
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,730
It is so romantic.

184
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,600
I wanted to help.

185
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,480
Gosh, seriously!

186
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,440
I am the one who risked my life to save you.

187
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,250
Does love feed you?

188
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,880
Wake up now.

189
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,540
You have not starved enough.

190
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,930
What is this?

191
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,080
Who is it?

192
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,180
I need to move locations or something, seriously.

193
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,620
The Heavenly Shaman Association. Long time no see.

194
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,450
There must be a meeting.

195
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,790
It has been a while.

196
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,420
What is wrong? What is it?

197
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,230
Expelled from the Shaman Association?

198
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,810
W-What do we do?

199
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,830
It is Tan Ya's doing.

200
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,170
Jinhoi's Tan Ya must have reported.

201
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,090
Who the hell ratted us out to Tan Ya?

202
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,570
 I said I would expose your doings to 

203
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,000
 the shaman association if you keep acting up. Did I or did I not? 

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,810
 How are you going to report me? 

205
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,180
 Jinhoi's shaman, Tan Ya. 

206
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,250
 Jinhoi's prince, Hwang Ga Ron, is best friends with Shaman Tan Ya. 

207
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,780
 I will expose everything you did. 

208
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,320
Ak Hee!

209
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,540
This bastard.

210
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,200
Cheong Ta, that bastard.

211
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,330
He should have heard the news by now.

212
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,440
Ak Hee will not go down alone.

213
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,670
I want to see Kyera.

214
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,780
Kyera.

215
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,760
I said he left just now.

216
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,830
Prince Ga Ron, please wait!

217
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,220
I have something to tell you—

218
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,430
Prince Ga Ron!

219
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,630
Prince Ga Ron!

220
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,780
Go back.

221
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,170
One moment—

222
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,180
Prince Ga Ron!

223
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,110
Prince Ga Ron—

224
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,550
Prince Ga Ron, one moment!

225
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,330
Prince Ga Ron—

226
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,390
Kyera.

227
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,130
W-What is wrong?

228
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,420
Kyera.

229
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,710
 Yeon Wol. 

230
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,740
Your Majesty, how are you feeling?

231
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,330
Are you able to speak?

232
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,230
 Why am I so anxious? 

233
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,000
 Why is it so suffocating? 

234
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,770
 Yeon Wol. 

235
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,940
Where is Kyera? Where did she go?

236
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,170
She went to meet Prince Ga Ron.

237
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,740
Did you dare to instigate Kyera?

238
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,370
How dare you!

239
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,910
- I only asked for her advice— 
 - I know

240
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,520
you knew Kyera would help you.

241
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,170
Do you not care what happens to Kyera if it is for His Majesty's sake?

242
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,990
Did you not ever feel the same way, Master Yang?

243
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,620
Did you ever have someone you could willingly give up your life for?

244
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,200
Shut your mouth, Ji Jeon Seo.

245
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,420
Lady Yeon Wol is the only one for me.

246
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,740
If I were ever to give up my life,

247
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,520
it would be for Lady Yeon Wol.

248
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,080
If anything happens to Kyera,

249
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,120
I will take your life.

250
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,910
The queen is so vicious, is she not?

251
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,600
How dare she demote me to a court lady like this?

252
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,390
I was barely allowed to visit you here, too.

253
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,970
The Minister of Finance helped out.

254
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,310
Grand Prince, do I have to let her step all over me like this?

255
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,820
You have to.

256
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,020
You have a long way to go.

257
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,780
Crawl even lower on the ground.

258
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,100
Lay low in front of the queen and kiss her feet if you can.

259
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,000
That is how you will let me live.

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,340
Do you understand?

261
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,300
Grand Prince, you really will not wither away like this. Right?

262
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,740
You have a plan in mind. Right?

263
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,450
Right?

264
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,630
Goodness, what is going on?

265
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,950
My gosh, what is this? Goodness!

266
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,110
Gosh, what is going on here?

267
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,800
H-How can chickens freeze to death in this hot weather?

268
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,820
The fish also died in great numbers last time! Geez!

269
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,200
This is all because of the haunted king!

270
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,070
That evil spirit is causing a plague to go around, too.

271
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,850
This country will be doomed at this rate!

272
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,130
That is why Grand Prince Sajo Yoong must become the king.

273
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,650
He was imprisoned for saying the right thing to the king!

274
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,280
- Wait! What? 
 - W-What do you mean? What are you saying?

275
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,050
- Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is in prison? 
 - Yes.

276
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,010
He said Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is in prison.

277
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,580
Does it make sense for a good man like him to be in prison?

278
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,320
Are you all ready?

279
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,150
 Yes, Grand Prince! 

280
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,340
For Asatae's sake!

281
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,440
 For Asatae's sake! 

282
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,490
He is still like this, no matter how many times he goes to sleep during the day.

283
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,200
Ak Hee will not come out.

284
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,560
This is terrible.

285
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,050
This is a serious problem.

286
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,890
Jinhoi keeps causing trouble, too.

287
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,920
Father, what should we do?

288
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,890
My Queen,

289
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,080
I think it is time we make our stance clear.

290
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Our stance?

291
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,210
Your Majesty!

292
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,280
Sir Head Minister! Your Majesty—

293
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,930
Your Majesty— Sir Head Minister!

294
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,550
Eunuch Neung, what is the matter?

295
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,320
Ji Jeon, this is bad.

296
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,770
Your Majesty, this is Eunuch Neung!

297
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,050
Why so noisy first thing in the morning?

298
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:05,640
Your Majesty, t-the ministers are headed this way right now.

299
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,840
What?

300
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,920
I will take care of this.

301
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,700
Please do not step forward, Your Majesty.

302
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,580
This is an impertinent act, showing up without even a word.

303
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,270
Head Minister,

304
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:29,140
we, ministers, will no longer ignore the perilous crisis we are in.

305
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,950
Let us meet His Majesty!

306
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,300
We will report the current situation to His Majesty in person and—

307
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,760
Did I not say His Majesty is currently unwell?

308
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,630
You should be the ones to care about His Majesty's health and—

309
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,980
In that case, we must see him in person

310
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,370
to know how unwell His Majesty really is.

311
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:56,040
If His Majesty is still in the condition he was at the interrogation grounds and not able to perform his duties,

312
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,510
should we not find a different solution quickly?

313
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,780
Head Minister, Jinhoi has started its invasion and

314
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,530
each village's people are rising up, too.

315
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,250
Please understand us.

316
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,160
Before we meet His Majesty,

317
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,170
all the ministers will not move an inch from here.

318
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,810
Please allow us to meet His Majesty!

319
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,960
 Please allow us to meet His Majesty! 

320
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,170
 Ak Hee, do something about this. 

321
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,740
 Where did all your confident bravado go? 

322
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,200
What can I do in this state?

323
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,750
 What do I need to do? 

324
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,820
 What do you need me to do? 

325
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,460
It is simple.

326
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,740
You can come over here and

327
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,770
take out the blade from my back.

328
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,750
Do it if you think you can.

329
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,760
 Head Minister! 

330
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,900
 If His Majesty is unable to move... 

331
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,780
 In that case, at least until His Majesty recovers, 

332
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,450
you should let Grand Prince Sajo Yoong govern our country.

333
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,740
Minister of Justice!

334
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,010
How dare you mention a rebel who is imprisoned for plotting treason!

335
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,350
Technically speaking, he is not a rebel.

336
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,850
Minister of Finance!

337
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,650
I am sure it was a decision for Asatae's sake.

338
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,580
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is the late king's son and

339
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,290
remember that he is the only royal descendant along with His Majesty, Sir Head Minister!

340
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,840
 The late king's son? 

341
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,950
 The only royal descendant? 

342
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,160
In addition,

343
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,690
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is the only one who can appease Jinhoi.

344
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,530
Your Majesty and Head Minister, please make a wise decision.

345
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,120
Sir Head Minister!

346
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,030
Our border has collapsed!

347
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,680
- What? 
 - Moreover,

348
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,800
even Jinhoi's subject states joined in to invade us!

349
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,990
Minister of General Affairs, leave for the borders promptly.

350
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,330
Yes.

351
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,540
Let us go.

352
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,880
Head Minister, will you still not come to a decision?

353
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,680
If His Majesty's reign is at stake,

354
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,880
do you really not know your position is also at risk, Head Minister?

355
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,600
Minister of Finance!

356
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,000
Are you daring to threaten me right now?

357
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,190
I will do as you said.

358
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,490
Release Grand Prince Sajo Yoong and

359
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,880
he shall manage the governing affairs temporarily.

360
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,240
Your Majesty.

361
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,010
I just discussed it with His Majesty.

362
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,250
And His Majesty allowed it as well.

363
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,160
 Thank you for your grace! 

364
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,330
 I allowed it? 

365
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,790
 When did I allow it? 

366
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,110
 Ak Hee. Ak Hee! 

367
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,300
What?

368
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,760
 Did you say I need to pull out that blade? 

369
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,270
Are you going to pull it out?

370
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,370
Come here and try, then.

371
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,650
 Since I cannot move, 

372
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,450
 do you think you can come here? 

373
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,240
How can I move in this state?

374
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,810
 You can. 

375
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,240
 You have a blade in your back, but you are not paralyzed. 

376
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,110
 Try moving now. 

377
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,630
 Hurry! 

378
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,450
Gosh, seriously.

379
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,470
 Does it hurt? 

380
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,800
"Does it hurt?"

381
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,340
Gosh, seriously.

382
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,890
The smell of the sun is so sweet.

383
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,340
My time has finally come in full swing.

384
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,660
All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

385
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,170
 All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong! 

386
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,500
 All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong! 

387
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,890
 All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong! 

388
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,270
 All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong! 

389
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,830
 All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong! 

390
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,330
 All hail Grand Prince Sajo Yoong! 

391
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,780
You are too caring.

392
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,650
Let us stop seeing each other from now on.

393
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,560
I am going to leave far away.

394
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,760
I heard the Shaman Association expelled you.

395
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,490
You know a lot.

396
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,230
In that case, you should enjoy the riches of the world now.

397
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,330
Help Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

398
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,000
Rather...

399
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,900
- help His Majesty Sajo Yoong. 
 - His Majesty?

400
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,090
Excuse me.

401
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,320
I have no interest in such—

402
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,110
 Why would you not? Tell him you will! 

403
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,630
Actually, I do.

404
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,450
Have you come to?

405
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,110
Where am I?

406
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,590
Could it be the ship?

407
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,670
Is it the ship to Jinhoi?

408
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,360
I saved you from drowning to death.

409
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,260
Thankful. Right?

410
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,180
Go on and tell me now.

411
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,340
What is it you want to tell me?

412
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,380
Please let me meet the shaman named Tan Ya.

413
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,730
You want Tan Ya, too?

414
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,660
Did someone else want to meet Tan Ya?

415
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,340
Who did?

416
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,330
Your king.

417
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,420
 Sir Ak Hee was working hard to save His Majesty. 

418
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,110
I need the antidote for a tranquilizing dart.

419
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,390
Your king got hit by a tranquilizing dart, huh?

420
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,450
By whom? It was Cheong Ta, huh.

421
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,290
Yes.

422
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,460
Cheong Ta would not give the antidote,

423
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,470
so I must ask Tan Ya for help.

424
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,610
Please help.

425
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,340
I also have the antidote, you know.

426
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,730
Really? Please give me the antidote, then.

427
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,280
I beg of you.

428
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,760
If I give you the antidote,

429
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,160
how will you repay me?

430
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,960
What do you want from me?

431
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,730
Come to Jinhoi with me and

432
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,000
become my wife.

433
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,620
You know His Majesty and I love each other.

434
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,170
So, how can you say such a thing?

435
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,280
This is to save His Majesty you love.

436
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,590
- Should you not do this much, at least? 
 - Prince Ga Ron,

437
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,650
I saved your life.

438
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,510
Technically speaking, is that not enough as a payment?

439
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,760
Forget it if you do not want to.

440
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,810
I will tell them to drop you off on some island on the way.

441
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,260
Or you could be thrown into the ocean!

442
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,460
Prince Ga Ron. Prince Ga Ron!

443
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,520
What is it now?

444
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,410
 Officer Ji said 

445
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,390
 Yeon Wol left for the annex in Mt. Seowang to meet Prince Ga Ron. 

446
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,230
What?

447
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,150
 However, 

448
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,690
 he lost touch with her. 

449
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,770
Why are you—

450
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,860
Gosh, why are you telling me this now?

451
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,700
Why did she go to meet Hwang Ga Ron?

452
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,160
 He said she went to get the antidote. 

453
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,390
This is all your fault. Okay?

454
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,730
You are the root cause!

455
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,730
What do I do?

456
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,400
Hey.

457
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,810
Hey, I will come over there,

458
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,160
so you pull this out.

459
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,440
 Do you think you can do it? 

460
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,910
Just think about how you are going to pull it out!

461
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,690
You are stiff all over.

462
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,600
Hey, here I go.

463
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,130
The Minister of General Affairs left for the borders to deliver the news

464
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,570
you have been released, Grand Prince.

465
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,690
Since I sent a messenger to notify them already,

466
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,070
the issues at the border will quiet down soon.

467
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,020
This is so fortunate!

468
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,730
Everything will find its place soon now that you are leading us, Grand Prince.

469
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,650
We did deliver the news,

470
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,160
but I think it will be beneficial for you to visit the border and

471
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,470
Jinhoi's concessions in person and reassure them.

472
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,570
Of course, that is what I plan to do.

473
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,440
However,

474
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,200
another matter takes priority before doing so.

475
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,980
What is this matter you speak of?

476
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,960
Head Minister,

477
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,710
do you really not know?

478
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,380
Calming down the public is

479
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:17,390
what a lord must deem his priority. Right?

480
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:21,320
 You are right, Grand Prince. 

481
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,370
It is Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

482
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,390
 - The Grand Prince! 
 - It is the Grand Prince! 

483
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,300
My, what happened to his face?

484
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,240
Aigoo, my goodness!

485
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,140
Just how harshly was he interrogated?

486
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,530
I am sure the darn evil spirit did not let him be!

487
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,070
 Your Highness Grand Prince! 

488
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,710
 Your Highness Grand Prince! 

489
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,230
 - Your Highness Grand Prince! 
 - We have been waiting for you! 

490
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,760
- Were you in pain? 
  - Yes! 

491
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,160
Were you suffering?

492
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Were you hungry?

493
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,670
How painful has it been for you all this time?

494
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:32,890
I, Sajo Yoong, will dare to treat your scars now.

495
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,450
 - Hurray! 
 - Hurray! 

496
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,740
First and foremost,

497
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:45,840
I will completely get rid of the plague sweeping Asatae!

498
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,880
This is Cheong Ta, Asatae's new high priest.

499
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:20,230
Almighty gods of Heaven and Earth!

500
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:26,030
Gods of the sun and the moon who govern all life!

501
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:33,980
I, Cheong Ta, seek your forgiveness in the haunted king's place!

502
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,750
Please soothe your wrath and

503
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:42,900
bestow eternal prosperity and wealth on Asatae!

504
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,110
Please save the people who are

505
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:53,800
suffering in pain everywhere!

506
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,950
This medicine was sent from the gods of Heaven and Earth.

507
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:31,140
If you take this medicine, you will be cured of the plague!

508
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,700
 Over here! 

509
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,380
The haunted king will step down!

510
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,150
It is time to meet your new king!

511
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,590
All hail His Majesty Sajo Yoong!

512
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,640
 Hurray! 

513
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,320
 Be strong, Ak Hee! 

514
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,050
I will accept your request, Prince Ga Ron.

515
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,190
- Really? 
 - However,

516
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,000
let me deliver the antidote to His Majesty in person.

517
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,360
How can I trust you?

518
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,530
This is a treasure as valuable as my life

519
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,920
that I inherited from my late father.

520
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,490
I will leave this here.

521
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,530
Master Yang, Kyera told us never to leave the sick people.

522
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,790
What should we do?

523
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,850
They are getting better now, so we must find Kyera.

524
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,990
We spent too much time tending to the sick.

525
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,650
Oh, Kyera's stuff, too.

526
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,530
What is wrong?

527
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,220
T-The medical book is gone.

528
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,040
Kyera said it was a precious book she got from her grandmother.

529
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,300
I am so thirsty.

530
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,040
I worked so hard.

531
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,620
By the way, will people really get better with that medicine?

532
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,120
It was made according to this medical book.

533
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,000
So they will get better soon.

534
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,880
Kyera gave us a really great gift.

535
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,910
Where is that woman?

536
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:11,880
I hear she went to meet Prince Ga Ron and went missing.

537
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,820
She might have become fish food or

538
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,550
she might have been taken to Jinhoi if she had been lucky.

539
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,730
All right.

540
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,820
There is only one more thing for us to do.

541
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:29,380
- What is it? 
 - We must get rid of the haunted king taking up space...

542
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,330
in the chamber.

543
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,450
 Yes, stay strong, Ak Hee. 

544
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,620
 Just a little more! 

545
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,300
You are being so loud, seriously!

546
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,490
Gosh, that hurts.

547
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,550
Hey, Sajo Hyeon.

548
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,100
Hey!

549
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,330
Sajo Hyeon, stay with me here!

550
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:03,860
Hey, are you dead?

551
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,750
Hey!

552
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,170
 You said I was being too loud. 

553
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,750
Gosh, you scared me!

554
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,420
I am coming.

555
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,970
Your Majesty,

556
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:28,600
how can I ever repay you for releasing Grand Prince?

557
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,040
On top of that, you even restored my position.

558
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,650
So I can only be thankful like this.

559
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,460
 Yoong told me to lay low. 

560
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,000
Your Majesty!

561
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,090
I demoted you temporarily, Consort Cheong Myeong,

562
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,640
because I had no other choice but to do that to straighten up the Inner Court.

563
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,420
I believe you will understand.

564
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,520
Of course I do.

565
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,450
I totally understand your profound intention, Your Majesty.

566
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,190
By the way, Queen, are you unwell?

567
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:12,250
Your fine complexion seems to have roughened up a bit.

568
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,620
Is that so?

569
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:19,650
Since His Majesty is not in good health right now...

570
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,950
I know, right?

571
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:28,680
That is why I brought you a gift to cheer you up.

572
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,020
They are peaches you always loved,

573
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,340
Your Majesty!

574
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,100
All right, please take a bite.

575
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,570
They will drip with...

576
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,800
juice as sweet as honey.

577
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,260
Queen, what is the matter?

578
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,950
Do you find the smell of peaches nauseating?

579
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,880
It is not like you have morning sickness, so why?

580
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,040
I do not have strength in my hands.

581
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,460
It is a delicious-looking peach.

582
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,870
Right?

583
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,380
Take a big bite.

584
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,760
One big bite.

585
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,140
It is sweet.

586
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,070
Right?

587
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,020
They say there is always hope.

588
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,570
 Is this really the antidote? 

589
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:17,430
 It will be an antidote if you believe it to be one. 

590
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,440
 Why do you have this on you, Prince Ga Ron? 

591
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,170
 Make sure to... 

592
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,290
 keep your promise. 

593
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:38,010
I came too far.

594
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,330
I asked to meet elsewhere, for it would be better that way,

595
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,740
but why here?

596
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,770
I was going to see how His Majesty has been doing.

597
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,540
But I did not know it would be this bad.

598
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,690
Please do not mind me.

599
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,790
What is there to hide between brothers who are the closest?

600
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,210
Do you not agree, Your Majesty?

601
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,390
Sajo Yoong, that bastard is

602
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,670
having the time of his life.

603
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,250
 Hurry up, Ak Hee. 

604
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,760
I thought about it in many regards.

605
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,630
But for the sake of Asatae, which is in peril,

606
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,120
and for the sake of His Majesty, who is in that state, we should—

607
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,480
What do you say we move

608
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,280
His Majesty to a clean, remote place for rehabilitation temporarily?

609
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,840
Your Majesty—

610
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,980
Is that also what you thought, My Queen?

611
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,670
Yes.

612
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,060
Since you took charge of state affairs in His Majesty's place,

613
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:03,220
it would be wise for His Majesty to focus on recovery in peace.

614
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,690
That is right. You are right.

615
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,040
Just as I expected, Your Majesty.

616
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,310
She is really the wise mother of our nation.

617
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,730
Hey, Geum Hwa has gone mad, has she not?

618
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,650
I thought I still treated her quite well.

619
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,050
How can she do that?

620
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,290
 How did you treat her well, in what way? 

621
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,570
Why do you want to know?

622
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:44,420
I have always been a sweet man.

623
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,930
But she is switching to Sajo Yoong now, huh?

624
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,490
Is she getting rid of the used carriage for a flowery one?

625
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,020
 Are you saying I am a used carriage? 

626
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,480
Of course you are. You think you are the flowery carriage, then?

627
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,560
Hey, Sajo Hyeon.

628
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,990
We are done for now.

629
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,480
It is over.

630
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,210
 Keep trying to move. 

631
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,930
What is the use even if I keep trying to move?

632
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,300
It hurts.

633
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,150
 Ak Hee. 

634
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,040
Your Majesty,

635
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,980
are you certain you are pregnant?

636
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,610
I trusted your words and

637
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:39,410
accepted what Sajo Yoong said earlier.

638
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,270
But I am not sure if it was the right decision.

639
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,700
I am sure I am pregnant.

640
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,120
Trust me.

641
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,780
However, until this child

642
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,780
settles down firmly,

643
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,800
we must keep it an absolute secret.

644
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,070
Of course.

645
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,680
It is four years, Father.

646
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,860
We just need to endure four years after this child is born.

647
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:12,680
Yes, after four years, he will be made the crown prince and

648
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,600
Your Majesty can become his regent.

649
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,810
You have to help me a lot then, Father.

650
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,030
By the way,

651
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,030
is it really...

652
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:35,110
 His Majesty's child? 

653
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:41,710
 You told me to use whatever means I can, Father. 

654
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,750
Is there anything...

655
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,990
you want to ask?

656
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,250
None at all.

657
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,280
Please take care of your health.

658
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,210
His Majesty...

659
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,610
Please hang in there a bit longer.

660
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:20,330
It is me.

661
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,400
Cheong Ta.

662
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,380
Where are you headed in such a rush?

663
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,020
To Wind Knives' lodging. Okay, then.

664
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,030
The antidote will not

665
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,280
work on him anyway.

666
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,320
Though I do not have an antidote to give you, either.

667
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,020
What?

668
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,160
Look at it by yourself.

669
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,030
Find a good man and live a good life.

670
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,190
What on Earth did you do this time?

671
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,710
I did not do much! I did not!

672
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,580
What did I do?

673
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,610
 I am telling you because I feel a little bad. 

674
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:08,180
 Ak Hee has a blade stabbed on his back. 

675
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,040
 Unless you take that out, 

676
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,880
 Sajo Hyeon will not get up even if you feed him a potful of antidote. 

677
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,150
A blade?

678
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,400
All of you, step away and take a break.

679
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,230
Come back after two hours.

680
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,600
Can we really do that?

681
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,250
My, of course.

682
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:51,660
It looks like we will be awake all night again, so let us take turns and rest.

683
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,930
Thank you, Eunuch Neung.

684
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,200
Yes, yes.

685
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,890
You guys go and rest, too. Go on.

686
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,940
I am glad Her Majesty had just gone out for a break.

687
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,390
She said she is especially tired today.

688
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,090
Your Majesty.

689
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,570
Her Majesty might come back at any moment.

690
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:43,380
I will stand guard in front and signal you.

691
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,800
 Yeon Wol. 

692
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,960
 Yeon Wol? 

693
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,670
Your Majesty.

694
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,980
How worried must you have been?

695
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,570
 I am okay. 

696
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,850
 Yeon Wol, your face is... 

697
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,410
There is no time.

698
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,290
I brought the antidote,

699
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,800
but I was told it works only if the blade is removed from Sir Ak Hee.

700
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,730
 How did you get this? 

701
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:28,590
 Did you end up in a mess like this to get this? 

702
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:32,030
I am going to try what Sir Ak Hee did last time.

703
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,750
I will come into your mind's space and pull out the blade.

704
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,490
Please take me to your mind's space.

705
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,640
 I will try. 

706
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,860
Please take me.

707
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,550
Please let me meet Sir Ak Hee.

708
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,850
Please...

709
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,740
Please take me there.

710
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,130
 I will. 

711
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,850
 I will bring you. 

712
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,830
Please.

713
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,320
It worked! It worked, Your Majesty!

714
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,330
 It worked. 

715
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,670
Kyera.

716
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,340
Sir Ak Hee!

717
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,820
Sir Ak Hee...

718
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,880
My goodness.

719
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,620
It hurts a lot. Right?

720
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,530
Kyera,

721
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:20,310
did you come to save me?

722
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,730
Are you crying because of me?

723
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:26,770
 Yeon Wol risked her life to come save you. 

724
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,990
I know.

725
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,830
I will pull this out.

726
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:38,410
It will hurt a lot.

727
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,390
Does it hurt?

728
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,560
Does it hurt a lot?

729
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,440
It is okay. I am fine with the pain.

730
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,000
I am even fine with dying,

731
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,570
but it will not be so easy to pull this out.

732
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,640
I am going to pull it out.

733
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,940
I have to.

734
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,260
Your Majesty, you should sleep in your chamber today.

735
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,880
Did you not say you are feeling unwell?

736
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,500
I am feeling unwell, but I have a bad feeling.

737
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,220
Even if I am to rest, I must rest at His Majesty's chamber.

738
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,120
 I should be the one doing it. Yeon Wol... 

739
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,770
Please hang in there, Sir Ak Hee.

740
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,500
What is the matter?

741
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,250
I...

742
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,110
I have something to tell you, Your Majesty.

743
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:45,020
Y-Yeon Wol.

744
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,930
Yeon Wol, Her Majesty has arrived!

745
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,840
Goodness, w-what do I do?

746
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,680
Yeon Wol.

747
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,920
 Yeon Wol. 

748
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,770
 This is bad, Yeon Wol. 

749
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,640
 Yeon Wol! 

750
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,620
I was so close to pulling it out.

751
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,640
Gosh, please, please. Please...

752
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:41,110
 I am pregnant with your child. 

753
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:47,110
Your Majesty, could I see you over there for a moment?

754
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,770
Later.

755
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,000
Y-Your Majesty.

756
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,450
Where did everyone go?

757
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,640
I told them to take a break.

758
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,930
How impertinent.

759
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,390
The smell...

760
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,570
Your Majesty, I told the palace ladies to run over here.

761
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,510
Hear ye!

762
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,690
- Yes, Your Majesty. 
 - There was an intruder.

763
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,240
Hurry up and pursue them!

764
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,910
Yes!

765
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,480
 - Over there! 
 - Follow her! 

766
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,050
 Get her! 

767
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:59,730
 Get her! 

768
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,620
 - That way! 
 - Chase her! 

769
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:45,900
Have you come to?

770
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:49,320
Master Yang.

771
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,520
Stay in bed.

772
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,590
You should not move.

773
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,260
What happened?

774
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,350
Why am I...

775
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:08,900
at this place?

776
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:14,010
I saw you passed out by the mountainside and brought you here.

777
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,810
What about His Majesty?

778
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,020
What happened to His Majesty?

779
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:22,060
Last night, I was at His Majesty's chamber.

780
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,900
It was not last night.

781
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,160
It was three nights ago.

782
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,700
You have been unconscious for that long.

783
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,400
Three days ago?

784
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,990
What about His Majesty?

785
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,160
What happened to His Majesty?

786
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,890
Master Yang.

787
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:59,160
No way.

788
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,050
Your Majesty?

789
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,830
Your Majesty.

790
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:57,160
You are awake.

791
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,920
Are you okay now?

792
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,860
I am okay.

793
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:09,110
I am glad.

794
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:12,350
I am so glad.

795
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,180
Thank you.

796
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:18,600
Your Majesty.

797
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,580
By the way,

798
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,350
who might you be?

799
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:49,790
Your Majesty.
