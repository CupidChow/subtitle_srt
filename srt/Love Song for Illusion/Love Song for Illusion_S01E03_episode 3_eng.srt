10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Crown Prince, why did you not tell me?

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,540
You did not tell me, although I asked you so many times, but why—

12
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,680
Your Majesty, please. Please hear me out.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,000
I will tell you my current condition, Your Majesty!

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,950
Halt.

15
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,990
Do you not hear the crown prince's order? Halt!

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ...Team @ Viki.com 

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,550
Crown Prince, what are you doing right now?

18
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,010
Your Majesty, Consort Hyo is indeed an assassin.

19
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,920
Since she was dressed as an assassin that day,

20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,170
that woman would see her as an assassin. However,

21
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,080
I am the one who...

22
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,370
told her to dress up that way.

23
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,250
What did you say?

24
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,320
On the night of Your Majesty's birthday banquet, Consort Hyo and—

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,080
No.

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,190
 Kyera, you are still here? 

27
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,660
Her name before she became Consort Hyo was Kyera.

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,750
I had promised to spend a romantic time with Kyera outside the palace.

29
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,090
So, I told her to wear these clothes.

30
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,300
Does that mean you knew Consort Hyo from before?

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,620
That is correct.

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,890
It was my mistake that I thought Kyera was the dancer you chose that night.

33
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,680
 What in the world. 

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,380
 I want to take the dancer you chose tonight, Your Majesty. 

35
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,800
Is that why you were in such a hurry?

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,760
I apologize.

37
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,120
So, you were in a romantic relationship with her?

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,320
Is that true?

39
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,570
I asked if that was true!

40
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,960
That is true, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,870
I have...

42
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,540
a hobby of making clothes, as you know.

43
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:21,960
I acquainted Consort Hyo at the drapery outside the palace where I work from time to time.

44
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,610
That is the hand-drawn clothing design this woman requested from me long ago.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,000
Write down what I say, Consort Hyo.

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,600
Do not make the chest too revealing.

47
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,860
Make the armhole wide enough for the shoulders to rotate freely.

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,620
Draw the clothing that fits the said requirements.

49
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,680
As you can see, you can tell they were written and drawn by the same person.

50
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,580
Also, this clothing is what I made according to the design.

51
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,230
 As expected, your body remembers. 

52
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,710
 It is just as I had believed. 

53
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,520
 Kyera, what are you thinking? 

54
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,270
 What are you planning? 

55
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,380
Hong Goon, I can walk alone. I'm okay.

56
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,070
It is fine, Your Highness.

57
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,880
You were scared earlier. Right?

58
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,720
But I am glad the misunderstanding was cleared, thanks to the crown prince.

59
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,660
It is so gorgeous.

60
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,940
I cannot believe it was handmade by the crown prince.

61
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,090
Crepe myrtle flowers.

62
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,640
How pretty.

63
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,060
Oh, Eunuch Neung said

64
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,310
crepe myrtle flowers are the crown prince's favorite flowers.

65
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,980
Really?

66
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,120
Your Highness, what are you doing?

67
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,930
Let me see.

68
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,390
Grand Prince.

69
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,400
I was on my way to see Mother, and I run into you like this, Your Highness Consort Hyo.

70
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,290
Let me congratulate you one more time on getting installed as Consort Hyo.

71
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,570
Thank you.

72
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,130
He is my bodyguard.

73
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,900
I see.

74
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,830
I am sure Kyera lost her memories.

75
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,700
Could it have been an accident or...

76
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,130
Who knows? It could be someone's trap.

77
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,760
There is no way.

78
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,270
Kyera would never go down that easily.

79
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,620
Could you not tell from seeing her?

80
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,780
This will not do. Since things ended up this way, I must make a move quickly.

81
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,750
What kind of move do you mean?

82
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,950
We will have to cut off the tail.

83
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,170
Before someone steps on it.

84
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,520
Why on Earth did you frame Consort Hyo?

85
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,750
What do you mean by frame?

86
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,890
They said this was found near Consort Hyo's pavilion.

87
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,160
So I was just worried for Your Majesty.

88
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,450
Who is it? Who instigated you?

89
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,360
Was it Yoong?

90
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,670
No! Why mention our Yoong?

91
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,170
Who was it, then?

92
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,220
Was it the crown princess?

93
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,620
Well, maybe.

94
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,480
 Your Majesty, Crown Princess has arrived. 

95
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,630
Apparently, that dancer testified falsely because she was jealous of

96
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,280
Consort Hyo for being chosen by the crown prince.

97
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,740
I ordered her to be punished severely for lying under oath.

98
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,320
Great job, Crown Princess.

99
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,600
This must have also been done by those who envy Consort Hyo.

100
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,380
She is the crown prince's concubine and might even become the queen of Asatae. How dare they...

101
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,960
I am already anxious every day because of those who are after my life.

102
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,100
Hear ye! Bring the alcohol and the food quickly!

103
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,280
Bring in the amusement troupe, too!

104
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,960
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

105
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,340
Why would you do something like that?

106
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,950
Why? You did not even consult me.

107
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,010
I mean...

108
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,910
They said one of the dancers disappeared.

109
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,080
So, I thought it would be perfect to make it into an assassin incident.

110
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,220
If he is found to have kept quiet about the assassin incident,

111
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,920
the crown prince would be cornered.

112
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,610
And if they start saying things about his madness again,

113
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,250
it might even lead to the revocation of the crown prince.

114
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,010
Did you think such a big matter would be achieved so easily?

115
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,970
Is that why you were played by Crown Princess again?

116
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,830
Crown Princess?

117
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,040
- That means, again— 
 - Yes.

118
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,560
Crown Princess only tested you with a rotten bait,

119
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,170
which you went ahead and bit.

120
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,310
Geum Hwa, that white fox!

121
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,570
Gosh, I hate her!

122
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,540
Crown Prince, I am really glad Consort Hyo's name was cleared.

123
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,040
I was so concerned.

124
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,830
It is all thanks to your wise efforts, Crown Prince.

125
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,950
Is that what you think?

126
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,680
Of course.

127
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,910
If you do,

128
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,340
why did you do it?

129
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,120
Did you think you could kick Consort Hyo out of the palace?

130
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,950
Your Highness, what do you mean?

131
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,410
The dancer you brought to the interrogation grounds as a witness, Head Minister.

132
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,000
She is fake, is she not?

133
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,320
Crown Prince, that is utter nonsense.

134
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,370
I am sure it was for my sake.

135
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,990
Because neither of you would gain anything from cornering me.

136
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,830
Crown Prince, you misunderstood.

137
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,570
How could Father and I do such a thing?

138
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,500
The dancer from the birthday banquet...

139
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,240
I am the one keeping her safe.

140
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,990
Should I bring her here and check the facts?

141
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,160
 The dancer His Majesty chose is being kept safe somewhere. Right? 

142
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,150
I am sorry to say, but that is what Ak Hee ordered.

143
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,110
 Ak Hee is indeed quite clever. 

144
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:13,320
I took such a measure in fear of unfortunate events like this one.

145
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,380
But why do bad feelings never prove to be otherwise?

146
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,000
His Majesty would not remember a lowly dancer's face.

147
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,470
And I am sure it was not hard to make the dancers

148
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,290
from the birthday banquet provide the same testimony.

149
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,890
Your Highness, Crown Princess is innocent.

150
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,230
It was all planned by this humble one.

151
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,330
Crown Prince, how distraught must I have been to do something like this?

152
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,110
I was just sad and sympathetic for my daughter

153
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,280
who gets ignored by her husband.

154
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,600
Please punish me as you see fit.

155
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,080
- I will accept anything you say. 
 - Father...

156
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,870
Crown Prince, it was just a misunderstanding.

157
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,470
That dancer envied Consort Hyo to lie under oath—

158
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,750
Goodness, Crown Princess...

159
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,820
you are really working too hard.

160
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,120
Punishment? There is no need.

161
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,240
I envy Crown Princess.

162
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,240
For she has such an affectionate father.

163
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,610
Do not worry. I will keep quiet about this matter.

164
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,920
Still, it was quite fun, thanks to you two.

165
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,190
I was also able to check the ambitions of those in the western annex.

166
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,560
 What is your identity? 

167
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,620
 That is what I want to know, too. 

168
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,770
  - You are a dancer? 
 - You said I am a dancer. 

169
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,570
 You fell for me while making my clothes. Right? 

170
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,840
 Your Majesty, please. Please hear me out. 

171
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,670
 I will tell you my current condition, Your Majesty! 

172
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,080
 Who are you, really? 

173
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,680
 Why did you seduce Ak Hee, and why are you here? 

174
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,610
 Are you really an assassin? 

175
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,670
Your Highness.

176
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,610
What brings you here?

177
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:42,740
♫  The feelings seeped through the hidden opening  ♫

178
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,930
Hey, Sajo Hyeon, take a shot.

179
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,710
Try killing my woman if you dare.

180
00:15:51,710 --> 00:16:01,270
♫  The feelings seeped through the fallen leaves  ♫

181
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:10,730
♫  That's how the feelings are knocking at my heart  ♫

182
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:20,140
♫  Fall more on this lotus tonight and shine on this night more  ♫

183
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:30,060
♫  The dawn is lingering around my ears quietly, making me sad  ♫

184
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,730
T-Take your leave.

185
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,520
Well. Thank you for what you did on the interrogation grounds.

186
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,180
I came to tell you this.

187
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,510
How arrogant.

188
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,370
You think I did it for Consort—

189
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,860
You think I did it for your sake?

190
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,470
I did it to prevent any unnecessary trouble within the palace.

191
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,490
But still, thank you.

192
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,550
Do not let me ever see you again.

193
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,510
I could not help but install you as my concubine.

194
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,860
But this is it for my good gesture.

195
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,740
Sajo Hyeon, you are feeling sleepy right now.

196
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,120
You are very sleepy.

197
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,650
Your eyelids start feeling heavy.

198
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,250
You are falling asleep.

199
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,590
You are sleepy.

200
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,480
You are sleepy.

201
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,070
Gosh, why is this guy not sleeping?

202
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,820
 Do not try anything funny, Ak Hee. 

203
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,780
 I will not lose to the likes of you. 

204
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,000
Your Highness,

205
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,950
you need to get some rest.

206
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,250
You cannot avoid sleep for this long.

207
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,470
I will not fall asleep.

208
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,950
I will not let Ak Hee take over this body.

209
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,950
Goodness, Your Highness...

210
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,830
 If I am to live like this, I would rather... 

211
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,870
 I would rather... 

212
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,560
You are...

213
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,530
You wench!

214
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,510
 I will not forget this moment! 

215
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,340
 I will pay you back without fail! 

216
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,160
 I will also take away everything you have! 

217
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
You wench, that is my seat. Move!

218
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,790
Do not come.

219
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,840
Do not come closer! Go away!

220
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,950
Your Majesty!

221
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,080
Your Majesty, I will bring the physician.

222
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,250
It is fine! Just bring some more alcohol.

223
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,930
What are you all doing? Hurry up and dance!

224
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,300
And play some music, too!

225
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,090
Hurry up and dance!

226
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,530
You wicked bastard!

227
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,960
You said nothing to me when you knew the crown prince hid the dancer?

228
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,880
How can you do this to me? How could you?

229
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,760
You will get hurt.

230
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,630
Ji Jeon Seo, whose side are you on? Huh?

231
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,470
I am the crown prince's man.

232
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,540
Traitor. I should not have placed you by the crown prince's side.

233
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,580
Please do not call me anymore.

234
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,510
Even if you do,

235
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,380
I will not come out.

236
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,810
Even if I die?

237
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,790
 Get out of the palace quickly. 

238
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,280
 Your life is in danger. 

239
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,200
 We made this for you because you went through so much. 

240
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,730
 I do not know what to say... 

241
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,640
 You really went through a lot. 

242
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,280
Crown Prince said no one was to go inside.

243
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,020
Really?

244
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,410
Give it to me. That court lady will at least deliver it if you give it to her.

245
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,540
 Absolutely do not let Consort Hyo in from now on. 

246
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,620
 Yes, Your Highness. 

247
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,250
Your Highness.

248
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,130
You...

249
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,790
W-What—

250
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,720
I apologize. I was only going to leave the dye and go.

251
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,340
 Open your eyes wide and watch. 

252
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,400
 This is the king's path! 

253
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,460
Your Highness, did I startle you?

254
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,390
Your Highness, are you unwell?

255
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,790
I will call Eunuch Neung.

256
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,190
You...

257
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,130
Who are you?

258
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,590
You are an assassin. Right?

259
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,960
How could I be? I am not.

260
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,800
I know you are an assassin.

261
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,870
Although I knew you were an assassin, I could not leave you to die.

262
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,430
Because...

263
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,930
...of those eyes.

264
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,480
 From the first moment I saw you, 

265
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,240
 why do you make me feel endlessly guilty? 

266
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,120
 Why do you make me feel unreasonably afraid? 

267
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,740
Please do not be afraid.

268
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,200
I will be by your side.

269
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,030
You are the cause.

270
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,570
You are the cause!

271
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,570
I lost my way because of you.

272
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,410
My future became hopeless because of you.

273
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,890
Because of you, I was...

274
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,570
 I-I am sorry. 

275
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,330
Be gone.

276
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,810
Along with Ak Hee!

277
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,570
 Stop right there, Sajo Hyeon! 

278
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,060
Eunuch Neung!

279
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,400
No!

280
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,980
- One moment. 
 - Let go!

281
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,830
Help me.

282
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,880
 Let her go, Sajo Hyeon. 

283
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,970
You evil spirit, let go!

284
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,910
 Let go! 

285
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,350
Ak Hee, what is the meaning of this?

286
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,290
How dare you force your way out of my body?

287
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,810
Surprised?

288
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,130
You and I switch places only if one of us sleeps.

289
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,540
But I can still force my way out.

290
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,020
I did not know I was capable of such things.

291
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,830
What kind of nonsense is that?

292
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,720
Come on, you cannot win me in a fight.

293
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
You know it.

294
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,000
Your Highness.

295
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,970
Your Highness, brace your heart. I am right here.

296
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,770
Your Highness, this is Eunuch Neung!

297
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,560
 What is the matter? 

298
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,130
 I am going in, Your Highness! 

299
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,820
Eunuch Neung, hold on!

300
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,490
Your Highness.

301
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,180
Kyera.

302
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,230
 His eyes look different. 

303
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,980
Your Highness. Your Highness!

304
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,650
Your Highness!

305
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,690
What is the problem? Your Highness!

306
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,580
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

307
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,530
Your Highness!

308
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,440
 He feels hot now. 

309
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,810
 He used to be ice cold. 

310
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,590
 But he is hot like fire now. 

311
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,640
Your Highness! Your Highness—

312
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,530
Your Highness.

313
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,590
His pulse is normal.

314
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,810
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

315
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:08,040
His fever will come down since I gave him acupuncture.

316
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,310
But he is still hot.

317
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,260
It will go down in about an hour.

318
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,200
It is more of an internal problem, not an external one. Because his spirit is weak, is it not?

319
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,000
Crown Prince has experienced some discouraging things.

320
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,330
Your Highness Consort Hyo, did you study medicine?

321
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,140
Well, that is not it.

322
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,120
It is because Consort Hyo is...

323
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,040
knowledgeable in many aspects.

324
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,620
She is like a walking library.

325
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,970
Your Highness, are you okay?

326
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,780
Your Highness.

327
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,640
What if I am not?

328
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,010
You even called the physician. How fussy are you?

329
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,340
Thank you. You may go now.

330
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,540
It is an honor.

331
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,570
Consort Hyo, you may go now as well.

332
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,640
I want to rest.

333
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,420
Your Highness, can I see you for a moment?

334
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,860
- I have something to ask. 
 - Well...

335
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,340
Could...

336
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,760
Could you ask me later?

337
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,610
Consort Hyo, I think you should do that.

338
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,240
 Crown Prince, Crown Princess has arrived. 

339
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,330
Let her in.

340
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
Crown Prince!

341
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,970
I rushed over after hearing the physician was here.

342
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,380
Are you all right?

343
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,560
I am fine, as you can see.

344
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,930
I am glad. I was so scared.

345
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:57,680
Goodness, Crown Princess, looks like you were very shocked.

346
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,120
How weird.

347
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,040
It felt like he had become a different person.

348
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:43,450
Gosh, she put so much effort into this.

349
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,050
"These are the dyes I made.

350
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,790
I hope you will like them.

351
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,240
- Also, thank you for—"
 - Saving me. 

352
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,100
 I was so scared at the interrogation grounds, 

353
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,990
 but I was able to endure because you were there. 

354
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,020
 I will leave tonight. 

355
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,540
 No matter how much I think about it, I do not think I belong here. 

356
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,930
 Since you already permitted it, I will replace my farewell with this letter. 

357
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,020
 Thank you for everything. 

358
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,750
Leave?

359
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,550
Sajo Hyeon, who are you to tell her to leave?

360
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,550
What a headache.

361
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,430
Crown Prince.

362
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,370
Crown Prince!

363
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,840
Your Highness!

364
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,400
Are you sleeping?

365
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,480
Resting.

366
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,890
Goodness, I see.

367
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,310
You can rest all you want, but you cannot sleep.

368
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,660
- You know, right? 
 - Yes, I know.

369
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,240
O-Oh, Ji Jeon and I will

370
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,810
go to Cheong Ta and beg one more time.

371
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,650
For what?

372
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,210
For a way to get rid of Ak Hee, that scum for good!

373
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,620
What a scoundrel.

374
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,280
In my opinion, I think Cheong Ta knows the method.

375
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,780
I see. I wish you luck.

376
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,400
Yes, Your Highness.

377
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,550
Just trust me, and rest assured.

378
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,590
Eunuch Neung, are you serious?

379
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,120
Sorry?

380
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,340
You dared to fool me and use sleeping incense

381
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,980
with Ji Jeon Seo as your accomplice?

382
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,890
Well, you complimented me back then—

383
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,930
Sir Ak Hee?

384
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,390
"Sir"? Not a scum, but "Sir"?

385
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,970
W-Why are you calling me "Sir"?

386
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,690
Just call me scum.

387
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,370
That is not it. My mouth is wretched.

388
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,190
Ji Jeon Seo, are you there?

389
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,410
 Yes, Your Highness! 

390
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:26,430
Eunuch Neung is demoted to the laundry starting today.

391
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,300
- Sorry? 
 - Your Highness,

392
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,200
a demotion to the laundry is unjust.

393
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,790
Oh, it is unjust, is it not?

394
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,660
It is unjust. We cannot very well have that.

395
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,690
Hear ye! Take this arrogant and disloyal Ji Jeon Seo to prison right now!

396
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,010
Ji Jeon.

397
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,550
I am going that way.

398
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,970
I wish you...

399
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,250
good health, Eunuch Neung.

400
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,780
What do we do about His Highness now?

401
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,970
I know...

402
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,960
Do not skip your meals!

403
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,120
I will come and visit!

404
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,010
- Your Highness. 
 - What is this?

405
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,630
You are leaving?

406
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,770
Does that mean this is a farewell gift?

407
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,420
Huh?

408
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,340
I will be seriously upset.

409
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,740
You even saw me faint earlier.

410
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,930
But leaving is all you can think of?

411
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,090
Oh, are you okay?

412
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,420
No, I am not okay.

413
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,600
Because...

414
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,870
all of this stemmed from here.

415
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,200
You heard the rumors, right? About my madness.

416
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,740
I do not know the cause,

417
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,170
but I think it is because your heart is suffering.

418
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,740
It could also be because of a bad memory.

419
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,920
A bad memory?

420
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,540
 What is this? Does she feel sorry for Sajo Hyeon? 

421
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,340
 Did they become close already? 

422
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,380
 What do I do? 

423
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,790
She must have been so scared.

424
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,330
Why am I worried about Consort Hyo?

425
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,170
She is Ak Hee's woman.

426
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,790
To be honest with you,

427
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,420
there is an evil spirit inside my body.

428
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,140
- An evil spirit? 
 - Yes.

429
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,990
I have quite the wicked one.

430
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,310
I am sure Ak Hee, this bastard,

431
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,010
is planning something right now.

432
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,830
It was soon after His Majesty took the throne.

433
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,420
 Go away! Go away! 

434
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,410
An evil spirit entered my body one day and

435
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:04,400
I have been sharing my body with the evil spirit since then.

436
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,850
Is such a thing really possible?

437
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,610
I cannot believe it.

438
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,290
It surely is unbelievable.

439
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:25,890
That is why I was mean to you sometimes as if I were a different person.

440
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,670
I see.

441
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:33,150
Then the one who was mean to me is the evil spirit?

442
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,000
However...

443
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,070
 why did I not dislike... 

444
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,920
H-However?

445
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,420
Never mind.

446
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:05,340
I am going to get rid of the evil spirit now.

447
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,610
How?

448
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,520
You could not get rid of him until now.

449
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,230
I can get rid of him now.

450
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,510
As long as you are by my side,

451
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,530
I think I can ward off the evil spirit somehow.

452
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,530
Will you help?

453
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,960
Thank you.

454
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,840
 Crown Prince, are you unwell? 

455
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,330
That man is an evil spirit?

456
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,430
Who is it?

457
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,100
Do not turn around.

458
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,340
Do you not remember my voice?

459
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,060
Are you the one who shot a letter into my room a few days ago?

460
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,230
Yes.

461
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,090
Who am I?

462
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,200
Realizing it will bring you pain.

463
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,000
Tell me.

464
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:25,350
Kyera, come with me.

465
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,760
Why would I trust you?

466
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,320
Trust me. Let us go.

467
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,760
I do not trust anyone.

468
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,570
Until your memories come back.

469
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,950
 Consort Hyo? 

470
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,940
Be careful. Someone will come to kill you.

471
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,960
You forgot this.

472
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,610
It must be because it would be a waste to get dirty blood on it.

473
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,890
Consort Hyo, when did you come out?

474
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,120
I-I just had a short walk.

475
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,970
 Kyera, you will need this when your memories come back. 

476
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:59,950
Ak Hee, what did you do this time?

477
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,740
I did not do anything yet.

478
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,620
Is Consort Hyo...

479
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,170
Is she doing okay?

480
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,240
Of course, she is.

481
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,410
She was very glad to see me.

482
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,370
Because I am not mean.

483
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:17,700
Well, I guess she was talking about you.

484
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,850
No, wait a moment. Are you...

485
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,910
Are you worried about my woman right now?

486
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,600
Worried?

487
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,820
- You think I am like you? 
 - That is right!

488
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,970
You are not me.

489
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,940
Kyera is not your woman, either.

490
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,140
And this body will not be yours anymore.

491
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:45,390
Ak Hee, what are you planning this time?

492
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,110
Guess what I am planning.

493
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,150
Ak Hee.

494
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,380
Ak Hee!

495
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,920
I am going to take everything.

496
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,480
Sajo Hyeon,

497
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,550
you are...

498
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,560
going to be gone now.

499
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,190
Goodness, the dirt won't come out if you do it like this.

500
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,340
Thank you.

501
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:53,730
C-Consort Hyo—

502
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,080
I borrowed it from Hong Goon.

503
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,960
Why did you get transferred to work here?

504
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,530
I was so surprised after hearing it from Hong Goon.

505
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:10,670
Could it be the evil spirit's doing?

506
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,840
You know?

507
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,520
I heard from Crown Prince last night.

508
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,530
Last night?

509
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,610
That man is not the crown prince!

510
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,580
He is the evil spirit! Oh, my.

511
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:32,340
Sorry? The current crown prince is an evil spirit?

512
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,680
You cannot believe it. Right?

513
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,530
You do not believe me, huh.

514
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,820
Are you also an evil spirit, Eunuch Neung?

515
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,010
You are with him. Right?

516
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,500
Goodness, I-I am sorry.

517
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,360
Gosh, I do not know who to trust.

518
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,550
I do not even know if what Crown Prince said about the evil spirit is true.

519
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,720
I understand you, Your Highness.

520
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,910
It also took Ji Jeon and me a long time to understand this.

521
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:06,500
Your Highness Consort Hyo, please help us.

522
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,280
 Including Ji Jeon, all our hands are tied. 

523
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,810
I am so anxious that I could die.

524
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,360
E.C.

525
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,390
Eating Cheong Ta.

526
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,330
Yes?

527
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:32,090
Yes!

528
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,540
Yes!

529
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,160
Who is—

530
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,850
O-Oh! Oh my, A-Ak Hee!

531
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,580
What brings you here?

532
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,360
Back to original form.

533
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,950
This is my original form—

534
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,820
Easy now.

535
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,470
Seriously? You put me to sleep?

536
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:54,260
No, the thing is, Eunuch Neung and Ji Jeon Seo bothered me so much.

537
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:58,180
They were harassing me every day.

538
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,130
So, it was just a small amount of sleeping incense.

539
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,660
It was also the lowest quality, on top of that.

540
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:07,440
I did not know you could put someone to sleep with that.

541
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,300
- You were bad. Right? 
 - I was bad.

542
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,700
- You should recover your credibility. Right? 
 - I will.

543
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:21,030
Let us lock him up. Sajo Hyeon.

544
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,100
Wait. Lock him up?

545
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:30,800
Bonghamsal. Let us lock up Sajo Hyeon.

546
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,350
Okay?

547
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,310
Wait, I cannot do it.

548
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,690
You cannot do it? You cannot?

549
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:46,530
In that case, should I tell everyone you sell sleeping incense,

550
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,710
including your leader?

551
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,850
You cannot even do business here, then.

552
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,820
Goodness, seriously.

553
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,630
 Bonghamsal is... 

554
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:24,830
 where you crash an evil spirit with divine power 

555
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,090
 to seal him away. 

556
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,480
 Evil spirit. 

557
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,200
 N-No. 

558
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,590
 However, the Crown Prince Sajo Hyeon is not 

559
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,590
 technically an evil spirit— 

560
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,220
 Just do it and lock him up! 

561
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,450
 Just do it? 

562
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,720
 What do you need for the preparation, huh? 

563
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,780
 Hurry up and get Sajo Hyeon locked up. 

564
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,960
 I am exhausted right now. 

565
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,930
 In that case, 

566
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:56,530
 prepare an object that harbors Crown Prince Sajo Hyeon's energy 

567
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,440
 and then... 

568
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,640
 write his name here... 

569
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,400
 and then call for me. 

570
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,740
 Got it. 

571
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,140
 - Come tonight. 
 - Tonight is too soon. 

572
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,700
 I have a lot of things to prepare, too. 

573
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,030
 - And I also have to take a bath to relax— 
 - Tonight, it is. 

574
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:19,130
 T-Tonight— Yes. Got it. 

575
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,710
 However! 

576
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,300
 Until bonghamsal is complete, 

577
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:33,280
 you absolutely cannot meet Her Highness Consort Hyo. 

578
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,360
 Why? 

579
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,180
 If personal feelings of love seep into you, 

580
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,870
 your energy will weaken. 

581
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:46,170
 If you want to crash Crown Prince Sajo Hyeon with bonghamsal, 

582
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,310
 you have to save your power. 

583
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,710
It cannot be helped.

584
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,830
I will have to endure.

585
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,890
 If you go straight past the bamboo forest, 

586
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,630
 this is where Shaman Cheong Ta lives. 

587
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:53,670
 If you go here and beg, we might be able to get help. 

588
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:57,820
 Please beg her to save the crown prince. 

589
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,820
 Okay. 

590
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,300
 By the way, Ak Hee might have gone there, too. 

591
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,140
 The evil spirit. 

592
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,450
 The evil spirit's name is Ak Hee? 

593
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,010
So annoying!

594
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,140
Did you forget something?

595
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,940
Seriously!

596
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,180
What is this? Seriously.

597
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,760
How do you do?

598
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,810
Who are you?

599
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:51,040
I am Consort—

600
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,730
 These eyes are of one who lost her memories from breathing in too much sleeping incense. 

601
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,140
 She is afraid of me. 

602
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,830
- G-Gosh! 
 - W-Wait—

603
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,360
Excuse me, Cheong Ta!

604
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,860
 I am Consort Hyo, the crown prince's concubine, for now. 

605
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,550
I knew this would happen! I knew it!

606
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:13,140
 I am losing it! Seriously! 

607
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,340
I heard from Eunuch Neung before coming

608
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,100
that you can help us, Cheong Ta.

609
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,540
Cheong Ta!

610
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,240
I do not know anything.

611
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,090
I know nothing.

612
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:27,030
Why are you asking me about your memory loss?

613
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,140
 She knows I lost my memories? 

614
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,680
 Go away, g-go! 

615
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,140
No sound.

616
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,260
Did she leave?

617
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,870
She left.

618
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,180
Cheong Ta, please help me out.

619
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,520
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

620
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,100
Since you know about my memory loss,

621
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,890
- it means you are linked to it or— 
 - Nothing.

622
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:12,730
I have nothing to do with it, nothing at all.

623
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:17,820
Or it means you can help me to get my memories back.

624
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,670
Cheong Ta, I feel really hopeless right now.

625
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,200
Inside my head is a complete blank,

626
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:37,670
but my feelings keep growing deeper for something without a plan.

627
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:43,170
Well, that is what people usually call love.

628
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,430
No, there is no way.

629
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:49,440
There is always a way.

630
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,400
I feel like there is an absurd reason why my memories are gone and

631
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,170
because I feel like I will face the truth,

632
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:01,380
I cannot handle if my memories come back one day...

633
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,030
I live each and every day in fear.

634
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:13,630
Please help me out, Cheong Ta. Please?

635
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:25,060
My goodness.

636
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,910
Right, he liked to wear this thing a lot.

637
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,410
D-Do you put it on like this?

638
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:42,120
Gosh, that's his preference.

639
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,980
Sajo Hyeon.

640
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,930
A great calligrapher.

641
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,260
There you go.

642
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,910
Sajo Hyeon, sorry.

643
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,680
Gosh, why is Cheong Ta not coming?

644
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,310
I am so sleepy.

645
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,650
Your Highness! Your Highness!

646
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,720
Hey, Cheong—

647
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,420
Your Highness, C-Consort Hyo is coming.

648
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,850
What?

649
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,850
 Until bonghamsal is complete, 

650
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:53,210
 you absolutely cannot meet Her Highness Consort Hyo. 

651
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,650
She told me not to meet her.

652
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,010
Your Highness!

653
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,870
Your Highness! Your Highness Crown Prince!

654
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:06,060
Y-Your Highness Consort Hyo!

655
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,060
Your Highness Consort Hyo! Y-Your Highness—

656
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,290
Y-Your Highness Consort Hyo!

657
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:17,240
Crown Prince has a business to take care of, so he cannot meet you.

658
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,820
Again? He said the same thing earlier.

659
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,610
Crown Prince is avoiding me. Right?

660
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,270
I need to see him to confirm

661
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,790
whether he is the evil spirit or not.

662
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:43,080
Gosh, Cheong Ta sounded like he was going to help!

663
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,820
 Go back to the palace for now. 

664
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:54,030
 Y-You are going to help me. Right? 

665
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,570
 W-Wait, Cheong Ta. 

666
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,110
 I will give it some thought. 

667
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,550
Should I have begged more?

668
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,730
Cheong Ta?

669
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,440
Are you here?

670
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:49,160
 Be careful. Someone will come to kill you. 

671
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,630
Who are you?

672
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,230
Yes, that's it.

673
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,720
I hope the medicine works well for her.

674
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,570
Well, I guess it will.

675
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,770
Gosh, he is so heavy!

676
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,140
Right, he cannot.

677
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:33,400
Damn it. You lost your touch, Cheong Ta!

678
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:47,100
Your Highness!

679
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:52,300
Your Highness, Shaman Cheong Ta has arrived at the Hall of Spirits.

680
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,700
This is Sajo Hyeon's favorite ornament and the paper with his name on it.

681
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,000
   

682
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,820
Yes.

683
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,700
Let me tell you one more time.

684
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:26,320
After bonghamsal is done, you might also suffer from bad side effects.

685
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,050
Including losing your strength suddenly,

686
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:35,470
you might also feel extreme pain that feels like being poked with a needle day and night.

687
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:39,550
Or like a senile old man, you might eat a lot—

688
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,440
Gosh, that is fine.

689
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,380
Anyhow, Sajo Hyeon will never be able to come out of this body once bonghamsal is done. Right?

690
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,770
- You are sure. Right? 
 - Yes.

691
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,590
Great. Begin.

692
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:53,750
Well, what do I do?

693
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,600
Oh, yes. I will begin.

694
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,200
First, put your hands together.

695
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,570
Get on your knees.

696
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,640
Kneel down.

697
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:16,580
You are showing your respect for the gods who rule the universe.

698
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:19,740
Straighten your body and mind.

699
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:23,400
There must not be any talking.

700
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,290
Now.

701
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,640
   

702
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,460
Water...

703
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,630
 Get it together, Yeon Wol! 

704
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,030
 I do not trust anyone. 

705
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:48,270
 Not until your memories come back. 

706
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,210
Master Yang.

707
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:55,810
What am I doing right now?

708
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:01,690
 Sajo Seung is the last person who would do that. 

709
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:06,940
 Burn down everything that belongs to the damned Royal Family of Yeon! 

710
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:14,770
Father...

711
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,720
Mother...

712
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:22,280
 Sajo Seung, I have been waiting for this day. 

713
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,270
 You are not fit to be an assassin. 

714
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,890
 Who are you? 

715
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:29,050
 I am your man. 

716
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,610
My memories...

717
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,010
came back.

718
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:56,880
 Are you the one who erased my memories? 

719
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:15,580
 You knew I would come. 

720
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,500
 How? 

721
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:20,000
Consort Hyo.

722
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,970
Crown Prince.

723
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:46,870
I was worried because you avoided me earlier.

724
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:55,980
I had my reasons.

725
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,030
I am sorry.

726
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:00,020
Not at all.

727
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:16,880
 Did you make me lose my memories? 

728
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,770
 Why? 

729
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:20,460
 Why? 

730
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:28,970
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ...Team @ Viki.com 

731
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:35,650
   

732
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:43,610
♫  Never lost, I will never lose you  ♫

733
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:50,600
♫  Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self  ♫

734
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:58,030
♫  Never lost, when this darkness ends  ♫

735
01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:01,750
 Kyera, pull yourself together. 

736
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:05,600
 Who do you think is standing in front of you, Consort Hyo? 

737
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,820
 No one can escape bonghamsal once they are locked up. 

738
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:12,270
 I knew you seemed familiar. 

739
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,080
 I could not save her. 

740
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,130
 Her eyes are still vivid in my mind. 

741
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,270
 My memories came back. 

742
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,350
 Search Consort Hyo's pavilion right this moment! 

743
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,610
 She looks a lot like somebody. 

744
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:29,670
 Right, I remember now.
