Consort Hyo!

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,340
You were alive?

10
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,690
W-What is going on here?

11
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,930
W-What happened to me?

12
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,550
He changed.

13
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,440
Crown Prince?

14
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,800
Did you run away safely?

15
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,530
Are you the Crown Prince?

16
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,150
If I am not the Crown Prince, would I be the evil spirit?

17
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,660
Is anyone out there?

W-What are you doing?

20
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,650
He is cold. But he was warm up until just now.

21
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,910
Where did he go?

22
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,280
Who?

23
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,470
Sir Ak Hee.

24
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,010
I finally came back to my body,

25
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,280
yet you are only looking for Ak Hee?

26
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,260
Ji Jeon Seo!

27
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,310
Ji Jeon Seo!

28
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,290
No one is here. It was only Sir Ak Hee-

29
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,830
I mean...

30
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,440
because you and I fell off the cliff while trying to run away.

31
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,050
The cliff?

32
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,740
Are you having chills?

33
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,960
I must pull myself together.

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,110
I will not let Ak Hee take over this body again.

35
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,350
A-Are you injured?

36
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,220
D-Does it hurt a lot?

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,260
How unbelievable.

38
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,840
How can there be two people in one body?

39
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,950
Ak Hee is not a person, to be exact.

40
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,850
He is only a fake.

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,650
A fake?

42
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,160
This thing. And this thing does not fit.

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,430
You seem fake for some reason.

44
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,440
Not at all.

45
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,350
A fake is fake forever.

46
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,390
Apologize. I am really not a fake, okay?

47
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,850
That was why he did not like being called a fake.

48
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,150
Ak Hee hates being called a fake more than anything.

49
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,360
Is Sir Ak Hee not human, then?

50
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,390
Is he something like a goblin or a ghost?

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,670
I do not know, either.

52
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,420
He barged in one day out of nowhere and started living in this body.

53
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,340
Whether he is a goblin or an apparition, he is a lowly being with no sense of conscience.

54
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,370
I heard you gave him your heart,

55
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,060
not knowing what he is like. How naïve.

56
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,370
I mean-

57
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,060
The sun will set soon.

58
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,950
We must hurry.

59
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,200
Get on my back.

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,060
I am fine.

61
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,810
Come on.

62
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,920
How long are we going to circle around here?

63
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,460
I think your chills are getting worse.

64
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,370
I am okay.

65
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,380
It seems to be even worse because your body is always cold.

66
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,110
You said Ak Hee felt warm, right?

67
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,670
Yes.

68
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,950
It must have been nice since he was warm.

69
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,500
He would have kept you warm even when you are soaked like this.

70
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,170
I do not know if he would keep me warm, but he would be in much pain.

71
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,750
He would be in pain?

72
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,960
He seemed to feel pain when he got in contact with my body.

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,870
Pain, huh?

74
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,640
I guess he could not even lay a finger on you because of the pain.

75
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,370
Poor bastard.

76
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,450
But he seemed to endure as much as he could.

77
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,300
As much as he can?

78
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,350
Does that mean he endured as much as he could to brush past you?

79
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,400
Did he only brush past or

80
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,560
d-did he actually touch you?

81
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,110
You should hurry.

82
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,100
The sun is setting.

83
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,130
Are you ordering me around while you are riding on my back?

84
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,020
I apologize.

85
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,260
Wait, w-why am I suddenly here? Why?

86
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,030
W-Why on Earth did I come back here? Why?

87
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,660
Gosh, the mood was great.

88
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,270
I am sure Kyera liked it, too!

89
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,350
W-Why am I back here?

90
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,260
If personal feelings of love seep into you,

91
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,160
your energy will weaken.

92
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,720
If you want to crash the Crown Prince Sajo Hyun with bonghamsal,

93
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,860
you have to save your power.

94
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,110
Alas!

95
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,300
The moment your love for Consort Hyo

96
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,100
turns...

97
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,960
into a man's...

98
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,590
l-lust for a woman,

99
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:18,110
you will be dragged into the heart's space far, far away.

100
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,310
W-Wait, hold on.

101
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,580
I cannot love or lust. How come I cannot do so many things?

102
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,090
Well, should we call it quits, then?

103
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,910
H-Huh? No, do it.

104
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,320
I should be satisfied with being by her side.

105
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,610
That was why!

106
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,690
Sajo Hyun, come here! Huh?

107
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,690
Come over here for a moment!

108
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,190
Are your chills getting worse?

109
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,330
No, I am fine.

110
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,580
Hey!

111
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:35,680
He was summoned right away when I called him before. Why is he not coming now?

112
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,770
Is it because I was sealed by bomhamsal once?

113
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,360
Chung Ta, you...

114
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,970
T-There is a village here.

115
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,650
Are you able to tell where this is?

116
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,690
I think it is about 30 ri* away from the palace.
(1 ri = 400 m)

117
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,040
3-30 ri?

118
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,410
Aigoo, I need to get back to the palace quickly.

119
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,380
Why did Ak Hee come all the way here?

120
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,620
It was not this far.

121
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,780
After we fell off the cliff to evade the killers,

122
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,420
we ended up here because of the current.

123
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,500
They were killers sent by the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

124
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,900
Yes, I am sure they were.

125
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,400
I know who murdered His Majesty.

126
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,870
Who was it?

127
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,670
Who was the one who murdered His Majesty?

128
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,720
You want to know, right?

129
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,980
Then...

130
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,950
Then, release me from here first.

131
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,310
Do not try to play petty tricks on me, Ak Hee.

132
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,900
Your hyung!

133
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,290
It was your hyung!

134
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,950
Sajo Yoong.

135
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,840
Why?

136
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,460
Why would Hyungnim...

137
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,620
Even if he was blinded by the throne, no way...

138
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,350
No way would he kill his father?

139
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,710
Sajo Yoong could do worse things.

140
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,980
He is not even his biological father. What is there to hesitate?

141
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,310
Hyungnim is not a biological son?

142
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,150
You really have no interest in your family matters.

143
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,640
Right, do you even know Sajo Yoong is raising a secret army?

144
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,210
A secret army?

145
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,200
This is seriously bad.

146
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,510
Anyhow, I will take care of everything.

147
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,360
So, release me from here first, okay?

148
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,000
You already know about Grand Prince Sajo Yoong?

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Do you think there are things I do not know? I only pretended not to know.

150
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,960
Ak Hee was talking big, but he got what he deserved.

151
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,920
Oh, you already talked about it with Sir Ak Hee.

152
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,540
So I can run away.

153
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,230
It is not that we talked about it.

154
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,510
I was the one who ordered Ak Hee to do so.

155
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,190
From what I heard, Sir Ak Hee is the one who convinced you.

156
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,150
Are you defending Ak Hee again?

157
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,500
Also, it bothers me to hear "Sir Ak Hee."

158
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,900
I cannot just call him Ak Hee.

159
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,540
He is someone who resides in your body, Crown Prince.

160
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,160
Did you disagree with Ak Hee on everything like this, too?

161
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,810
Sir Ak Hee does not argue on every matter like this.

162
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,990
Gosh, I am getting the chills.

163
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,670
Your clothes are almost dry.

164
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,710
We will be able to find a way to get back to the capital in this village.

165
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,990
Please travel safely.

166
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,690
I never told you...

167
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,870
to leave.

168
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,810
You said you ordered to have me escape.

169
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,690
Am I not supposed to leave?

170
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,140
You cannot.

171
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,830
Why-

172
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,400
You must still think I am a criminal.

173
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,550
Now that I think about it, I am still skeptical about some aspects.

174
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,510
If so, please arrest me again.

175
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,530
Gosh, how fickle.

176
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,950
Fickle-

177
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,590
Why do you think I went so far as to take the chance of releasing Ak Hee from bonghamsal?

178
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,670
This was all for your-

179
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,960
Sure, I will arrest you from now on.

180
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,070
You may not travel freely without my permission from hereon.

181
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,540
Sure thing, Your Highness.

182
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,520
Would you like to tie my hands, too?

183
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,560
That is fine.

184
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,520
You just need to stay by my side and...

185
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,300
It seems the local dogs are alarmed by strange scents.

186
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,630
Lower your knees quietly and look away-

187
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,880
What?

188
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,870
Goodness...

189
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,270
Consort Hyo jumped into the river?

190
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,580
Was she with the Crown Prince?

191
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,240
He did not seem to be the Crown Prince because he was good at martial arts.

192
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,280
I am not sure who it was,

193
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,330
but he was wearing a mask.

194
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,920
It was found at a river bank, miles away from the cliff.

195
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,830
You must find and bring me the corpse.

196
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,320
Search every river and mountain and bring me the corpse.

197
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,900
Yes, Grand Prince.

198
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,750
My goodness.

199
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,160
Even you are in this state, so that wretched Ak Hee-

200
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,900
I wonder if the Crown Prince is all right.

201
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,140
How did you realize Sir Ak Hee had switched with him?

202
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,260
It is so obvious!

203
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,530
I served His Highness since he was this tall.

204
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,770
Right when he grabbed the Crown Princess's wrist and said,

205
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,940
"Your pretty wrist will get hurt, Crown Princess..."

206
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,650
I knew something was off since then.

207
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,270
Could bonghamsal have been lifted?

208
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,170
That is what I am saying!

209
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,990
Chung Ta, that fraud of a shaman, the next time I see her, I will-

210
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,340
M-My goodness!

211
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,070
How did you come in here?

212
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,000
Are you a ghost or something? My heart dropped.

213
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,950
It stings a lot, right?

214
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,740
Let me rub it on you.

215
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,940
E-Eunuch Neung-

216
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,420
[Ak Hee]

217
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,830
[Ak Hee]

218
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you redoing bonghamsal?

219
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,510
We need to lock him up again.

220
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,430
Gosh, this is so ridiculous.

221
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,290
What, "that fraud"?

222
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,540
I will have you know clearly.

223
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:37,240
Sir Ak Hee did not break free from bonghamsal because I am a fraud.

224
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,760
I am sure His Highness Sajo Hyun released him.

225
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,520
Aigoo, it is not like His Highness lost his mind.

226
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,160
Why would he bother to wake up Ak Hee from his slumber?

227
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,170
No one knows.

228
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:03,090
Perhaps he lost control over something here, not his mind.

229
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,310
When love seeps deep into your heart,

230
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,840
your judgment becomes blinded.

231
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,630
That is what love is.

232
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,200
I will go stand guard outside.

233
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,260
It will be done soon-

234
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,180
- Let me come with you-
- Show your respect!

235
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,980
And kneel down.

236
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,340
Did it work?

237
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,460
It worked, right? Aigoo, how great!

238
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,980
It is not working.

239
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,480
It will not work.

240
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,350
It must be because the target is not here.

241
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,530
What do we do about this?

242
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,560
You really had to-

243
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,020
This is the only way.

244
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,420
If we go around in this getup, we will be spotted in no time.

245
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,260
Wait-

246
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,490
I do not wish to become a thief.

247
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,350
Then, I will be the only one wearing it.

248
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,400
What now?

249
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,500
I-I do not want to become a thief.

250
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,640
Did you have to make me look like this?

251
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,590
You still shine dressed like this.

252
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,530
You even joke now.

253
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,370
You are hungry, right?

254
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,080
I do not think that sound was from me.

255
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,280
I heard it all-

256
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,900
Was that really your last ring?

257
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,410
- That was the last one.
- You should have told me early on.

258
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,220
That ring would have been enough for 100 bowls of soup and rice.

259
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:06,230
Are you saying we should have stolen these clothes-

260
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,200
I am traveling with that man there, but I am...

261
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
- Come have a seat this way.
- Thank you.

262
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,150
I put more in there just for you.

263
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,490
Thank you.

264
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,170
Aigoo, thank you so much.

265
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,450
You look fine outside, but starve your wife and child?

266
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,660
I am treating you because your wife said she is due very soon.

267
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,050
So, eat this to cheer up and do your job as a man starting tomorrow.

268
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,450
W-What job are you talking about?

269
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,670
I am telling you to earn a living!

270
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,530
If you go over there, you can easily get hired as a farmhand.

271
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,460
Aigoo!

272
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,940
Wait, is she-

273
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,980
Let us eat.

274
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,290
Did you lie because you could not steal?

275
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,240
How dare you turn me into a punk who starves his wife and child?

276
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,300
My, my!

277
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,740
Aigoo! See what I mean?

278
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,620
Incompetent husbands always get loud in front of their wives!

279
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,950
- Should I take it away?
- N-No, this is...

280
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,470
Be good to your wife.

281
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,150
How nice is it? Since Sajo Seung, the tyrant, is off to the afterlife,

282
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,080
a peaceful time is bound to start now.

283
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,150
Gosh, ahjumma, it is too early to feel rest assured.

284
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,950
His son is still there.

285
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,390
Once that punk becomes the king,

286
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,790
it will be the same shit because he is just like his dad.

287
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,990
Do you think so?

288
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,430
It would be great if his son would also die suddenly like him.

289
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,720
Come on, the Crown Prince cannot become the king.

290
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,350
I heard he is a half-wit,

291
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,190
who lost his mind from madness.

292
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,660
No, that is all a false rumor-

293
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:10,080
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong would be the perfect king.

294
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,350
Seriously.

295
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,740
I heard the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is ever so great.

296
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,460
And righteous.

297
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,910
Aigoo, even my youngest son is all for Grand Prince Sajo Yoong,

298
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,260
saying he is the hero we need.

299
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,080
How do you know about the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong so well?

300
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,740
Whoa, how are you so unaware, Young Lady?

301
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,030
The Grand Prince gave food to the poor and

302
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,100
treatment for the ill.

303
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,460
He has been helping all this time.

304
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,400
Are there a lot of people who received help? You, too, ahjumma?

305
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,890
Huh? No, not me.

306
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,080
The rumors are widespread.

307
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,970
That is why people gathered at the capital to make the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong the king.

308
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,760
Right, I heard your youngest son went there, too.

309
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,270
He did go because his friends in the neighborhood wanted to go.

310
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:09,040
Aigoo, I just cannot sleep these days because I am so worried-

311
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,620
- Oh, no, what is wrong?
- Aigoo, aigoo, what is wrong with me?

312
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,910
Aigoo, ahjumma, what is wrong?

313
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:19,040
What is wrong? What is the matter? Ahjumma, what is wrong?

314
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,000
Let me take a look.

315
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,410
Aigoo...

316
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,240
Thank you, Young Lady.

317
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,640
I did not even realize I had indigestion.

318
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,190
It feels much better now.

319
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,780
You have indigestion, and your circulation is not good, either.

320
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,750
Looks like you had a lot of worries all this time.

321
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,640
Of course, I did.

322
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,470
My husband was executed during Sajo Seung's rebellion and

323
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:56,060
my older son died after he was taken to build the king's castle.

324
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:02,420
Now, even my youngest son went to the capital like that, so I cannot-

325
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,680
You cannot keep crying like this.

326
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,530
Please ease your heart and sleep.

327
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,420
Among the herbs you got me, I took out the ones that are good for you.

328
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,410
Make sure to drink them as tea.

329
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,720
We will take our leave now.

330
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,410
Huh? Aigoo, where are you going this late at night?

331
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,040
- Spend the night here.
- Goodness...

332
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,250
we have a long way to go.

333
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,210
Aigoo, seriously!

334
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,400
Your wife is bearing a child!

335
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,570
You two can sleep here and go on when dawn breaks.

336
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,350
Wait, how can two people-

337
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,120
I am going to sleep in my youngest son's room.

338
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,520
No, it is okay.

339
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,460
H-How can the two of us sleep here by ourselves?

340
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,060
What now? Do you want me to sleep with you two or something?

341
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,940
A married couple does not have to stay apart, so what is the matter?

342
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,880
N-No, it is okay. We are too busy to stay.

343
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,450
The dingoes are everywhere right now because it is nighttime.

344
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,540
What are you going to do? Aigoo.

345
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,940
Gosh, he is more stubborn than a mule.

346
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,220
He only has his handsome face to show for it.

347
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,480
Treat yourself to the warm floor and get some sleep.

348
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,280
Ahjumma...

349
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,480
You should get some rest.

350
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,750
Do not let what the villagers said earlier bother you too much.

351
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,560
They say people talk about even the king behind his back.

352
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,310
Is that supposed to console me?

353
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:58,150
When that king treated you the worst?

354
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,300
Maybe you are not consoling me.

355
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,300
It might be satisfying for you.

356
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,120
I will do it.

357
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,460
How can I rest if you keep making a noise like this next to me?

358
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,250
You are quite good.

359
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,250
It looks like you forgot that I make clothes.

360
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,610
I did not know Yoong hyungnim was so trusted by the people.

361
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,110
In my opinion, they are only saying these things after hearing the rumors.

362
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:10,540
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong must have manipulated public opinion to go after the throne.

363
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,480
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong has been sponsoring Wind Knife for a long time.

364
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,790
The one I was a part of.

365
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,260
The group of assassins?

366
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,740
Building a secret army,

367
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,500
sponsoring assassins and manipulating the public, too?

368
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,270
Sajo Seung, the tyrant, is finally gone!

369
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,750
We cannot let Sajo Seung's half-witted son take this country!

370
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,210
Let us rise with courage!

371
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,030
Rise with courage!

372
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,730
Half-witted Crown Prince, step down!

373
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,340
Step down!

374
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,800
Sajo Hyun, step down!

375
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,040
Step down!

376
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,150
Let us serve the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong as our king!

377
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,300
Let us serve him!

378
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,400
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is the only righteous lord who cares for his people!

379
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,210
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong, hurray!

380
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,640
Hurray!

381
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,680
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

382
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,990
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong will become the king?

383
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,390
Master Yang, what is going on?

384
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,080
Sajo Yoong's henchmen are instigating the people.

385
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,160
They are trying to make Sajo Yoong the king by fishing in the troubled waters.

386
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,560
What?

387
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,250
I, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong, would like to inform the ministers.

388
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,630
After His Majesty passed away, our country of Asatae is infested with rebels and

389
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,180
our people are becoming more turbulent by the day.

390
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,880
Half-witted Crown Prince, step down!

391
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,320
Step down! Step down!

392
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,990
The Crown Prince Sajo Hyun is only indulging in a woman,

393
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,490
wandering outside the capital with no care for national affairs.

394
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,270
Though I am only a bastard child,

395
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:59,700
I advised the Crown Prince many times as I am still his hyung.

396
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,620
But my words only fell on deaf ears.

397
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,560
I cannot stand by and watch this country's fate worsen by the day.

398
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,500
So, I resorted to writing my sorrow out like this.

399
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,460
Dear Ministers, let us gather strength.

400
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,680
Let us rid of the Crown Prince, who is prodigal and fragile.

401
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,380
Let us bring Asatae's kingship to its rightful state.

402
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:25,010
Please lend me, Sajo Yoong, your strength.

403
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,500
How bold of you to even dare to come before me.

404
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,100
Why did you fool us all this time?

405
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,710
While pretending to help restore the Royal Family of Yeon,

406
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,740
were you trying to take

407
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,080
the throne by using us, Wind Knife?

408
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,710
The Royal Family of Yeon is hopeless, is it not?

409
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:17,240
I am now the only person who can lead Asatae to success.

410
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,390
Shut your mouth, Grand Prince.

411
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,510
Grand Prince, what is the matter?

412
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,160
No need to come in.

413
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,000
Is someone with you?

414
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,040
A dear friend came to visit from far away.

415
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,500
I had to risk my life to bring Kyera to safety.

416
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,700
- But this is all I get in return?
- Stop lying.

417
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,480
You tried to kill Kyera.

418
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,440
How bad must it have been for me to try to kill Kyera, whom I considered my flesh and blood?

419
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,710
How can I let her be when she betrayed her duties because she was crazy for a man?

420
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,820
Shut your mouth, Sajo Yoong.

421
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,120
How dare you try to drive a wedge between Lady Yeon Wol and me?

422
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,690
- Grand Prince-
- I told you not to come in!

423
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,800
Yang Jae Yi, I will give you one last chance.

424
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,180
Be my subordinate.

425
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,920
I will also give you one last chance.

426
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,470
Forsake your vain greed.

427
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,320
How unfortunate.

428
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,680
You are a man of unparalleled ability.

429
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,520
This will be the last time I let you go.

430
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,280
Do not forget that.

431
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,720
If I fall asleep, Ak Hee might come out again.

432
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:20,970
♫ Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment ♫

433
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:28,520
♫ Your warmth remains in my heart ♫

434
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,770
♫ Even if you become wind and cannot hold you ♫

435
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:40,550
♫ We will always feel each other, the two of us ♫

436
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,090
♫ So that you will not get far, so that we will not be apart even for a moment ♫

437
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:55,000
♫ Even if I grasp, you become blurry ♫

438
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,900
♫ I'll stay here and wait for you ♫

439
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:12,520
♫ Even if you disappear again tomorrow, I will wait ♫

440
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:20,760
♫ So that I can feel the faint sound of you breathing ♫

441
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,370
Will you sit up straight?

442
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,400
My shoulder is sore.

443
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,660
I saw you wake up already.

444
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,670
Did you stay awake because Sir Ak Hee might come out?

445
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,370
Are you upset?

446
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,430
Because I did not let Ak Hee take over?

447
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,000
The dawn has arrived. Let us depart.

448
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
If you want,

449
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,710
you may go your own way, Consort Hyo.

450
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,000
Did you not arrest me?

451
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,160
I will release you.

452
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,430
All right, then.

453
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,290
Are you not feeling well?

454
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,230
No, I am fine.

455
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,480
Let me take a look.

456
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,760
What are you doing?

457
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,070
You endured all this time until it got this bad?

458
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,540
Gosh, Ak Hee, that punk. How dare he do this to my body.

459
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,410
If we put this on, it will get better.

460
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,180
I-It is okay.

461
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,420
I-I will do it.

462
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,970
We need to treat it right away.

463
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,590
If the inflammation worsens, you will not make it to the capital.

464
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,940
I did not put it on yet.

465
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,470
All right, then.

466
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,090
You take care.

467
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,350
Please take care of yourself as well, Your Highness.

468
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,830
Do you plan to go back to Wind Knife?

469
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:32,490
In that case, you might aim your sword at me again one day.

470
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,230
I will wander as my footsteps take me.

471
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,920
Perhaps I will find my use somewhere one day.

472
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,740
You asked why I kept quiet

473
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,670
about getting my memories back to you, right?

474
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,930
Did you also keep quiet about getting your memories back

475
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,920
for the purpose of killing His Majesty?

476
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,810
Tell me it is not true.

477
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,570
Say it is not true.

478
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,530
You deceived me.

479
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,000
But I showed my sincerity.

480
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,090
Why?

481
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,920
Why?

482
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,850
I was afraid.

483
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:40,640
Afraid you will also find out the truth behind everything like I did.

484
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,470
I had thought Your Highness, and I had become quite good friends,

485
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,780
so I was afraid.

486
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,840
Please be safe.

487
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,440
- Well-
- Please also tell Sir Ak Hee

488
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,860
that I am thankful.

489
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,000
Are you upset that you did not get to say bye to Ak Hee?

490
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,620
Rather than that-

491
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,570
I do not think I can grant your request...

492
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,640
because I do not think I will see him again.

493
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,530
Go ahead and announce.

494
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,100
I apologize for making you come this early in the morning.

495
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,060
Since this gathering was to discuss important national affairs related to the Crown Prince,

496
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:40,600
I intentionally did not communicate with the Head Minister, who is his father-in-law.

497
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,250
I hear the Crown Prince is currently enjoying his honeymoon outside the palace

498
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,130
with Her Highness Consort Hyo right now.

499
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,900
What do you mean, honeymoon? That is absurd.

500
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,600
The Crown Prince only went out for a short while to soothe his sadness.

501
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,010
I heard the Consort Hyo was the daughter of Yeon Poong Hak, who was exterminated

502
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,590
10 years ago, while plotting a treason.

503
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,740
Were you aware of this?

504
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:13,050
Crown Princess, we can no longer sit idly by as this country is heading toward destruction,

505
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:17,030
so we have decided to take special measures.

506
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,910
I am informing you of this since

507
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,510
I have decided to conduct government affairs on behalf of

508
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,330
the Crown Prince until he returns to the palace.

509
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,810
Such insolence.

510
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,850
The Crown Prince who will inherit the throne is clearly alive.

511
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:37,380
How can the Grand Prince and the Ministers decide who will run government affairs?

512
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,420
Well, I have relayed my message.

513
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,050
Now, shall we discuss current national affairs?

514
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,580
Too many problems have piled up, so there is no time.

515
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,780
The Crown Princess is taking her leave. Quickly escort her.

516
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,300
Yes!

517
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,470
What should we do with the rebels who are imprisoned?

518
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,080
We shall follow your will, Grand Prince.

519
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,570
Young Lady, how will I ever repay you?

520
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,610
Wait, where did that pretty husband of yours go?

521
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,860
That man, I ought to-

522
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,780
Please take the medicine I gave you and feel better soon.

523
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,110
Thank you.

524
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,640
Mother!

525
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,690
My son!

526
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,920
Look at you! What in the world happened?

527
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,770
I was fighting the government troops.

528
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,870
I barely escaped.

529
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,310
Young Lady, please take a look at my youngest son, too.

530
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,780
Okay.

531
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,650
I will take a look.

532
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,220
Fortunately, the wound is not deep.

533
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,950
This is the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong's...

534
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,410
You recognize this?

535
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,180
I finally received one, too.

536
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,930
Whoever has this tile could be in a government troop when the

537
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,820
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong becomes the king.

538
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,680
The Grand Prince Sajo Yoong will become the king?

539
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,430
How is that possible when the Crown Prince is alive?

540
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,680
The assassins said they would kill the Crown Prince soon.

541
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,510
A half-wit cannot become king!

542
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:16,670
Aigoo, watch your mouth, you scoundrel.

543
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,760
Look over here!

544
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,970
Are you headed to the capital?

545
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,070
I am. Why?

546
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,450
I see you are on your way to join the uprising.

547
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,310
Let us kick out that half-wit Crown Prince. Am I right?

548
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,630
Yes, I guess.

549
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,360
Ride my daughter's horse.

550
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,600
We shall ride one together.

551
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,010
Get on.

552
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,430
This is the least we can do to help a young man doing righteous work.

553
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,560
It is because of Sajo Seung, the wicked king.

554
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,430
She was trying to run away to avoid becoming his amusement troupe.

555
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,900
But they caught her and did this to her.

556
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,390
I heard the capital is full of girls who are just like her. Gosh.

557
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:14,880
Let us go.

558
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,880
I heard the capital is full of girls who are just like her. Gosh.

559
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,350
Arrest every single one who joined the riot!

560
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,110
How dare you!

561
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,780
Run away.

562
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,360
Once that punk becomes the king,

563
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,660
it will be the same shit because he is just like his dad.

564
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,050
Come on, the Crown Prince cannot become the king.

565
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:17,420
I heard he is a half-wit who lost his mind from madness.

566
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,540
Your Highness...

567
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,100
I am sorry!

568
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,730
Consort Hyo!

569
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,090
Kyera, you were alive.

570
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,900
Sajo Yoong's henchmen are instigating the people.

571
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,740
I am aware.

572
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,140
Countless people were locked up because of that.

573
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,290
Was it the Grand Prince's order?

574
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,350
I heard they will all be executed.

575
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,720
Go on.

576
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,300
Did you come running because you were worried about me?

577
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,580
I will escort you to the palace.

578
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,430
There is no need.

579
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:51,180
I will not be going back to the palace.

580
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,500
What do you mean?

581
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,870
What can I even do when I am the half-witted son

582
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:00,300
of Sajo Seung, the tyrant?

583
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,880
So, you are just going to leave your people to suffer like this?

584
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,680
If Sajo Yoong becomes the king, he will not let you be.

585
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,100
It cannot be helped even if I get killed!

586
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,270
I do not wish to save my useless life.

587
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,180
Why did you come back if you were going to say that?

588
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,080
Let Ak Hee take over if you will be like this.

589
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,280
Ak Hee, Ak Hee!

590
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,920
Is Ak Hee the only one you think of, Consort Hyo?

591
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,520
Yes, that is right!

592
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,330
Sir Ak Hee is not weak like you.

593
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:32,010
If it was Ak Hee, he would not have run away like this.

594
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,590
What?

595
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,680
Crown Prince,

596
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,610
I am truly disappointed.

597
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,550
Disappointed, huh?

598
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,730
Just like you,

599
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,210
I am also ashamed of you.

600
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:09,760
- Where are you going?
- I have to fight against Sajo Yoong's henchmen.

601
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,910
I will expose the true nature of Sajo Yoong, who is deceiving the people and bringing chaos,

602
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,140
pretending to care for them.

603
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,840
The assassins will take you down.

604
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,240
If I get taken down, all that will happen is get killed.

605
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,260
Just like you, who has lost all will.

606
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,280
You cannot, Consort Hyo!

607
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,690
I cannot let you die.

608
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,130
What is all this?

609
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:45,040
They seem to be preparing for the coronation.

610
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,780
Is this a dream or a reality?

611
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,640
Grand Prince, are you really becoming the king of Asatae?

612
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,040
Mother, how many times will you ask?

613
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,050
Yes, your son is now the king of Asatae.

614
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,010
This day has finally come.

615
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:24,640
The Crown Prince would not come back, right?

616
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,990
The Crown Prince has no interest in becoming the king.

617
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:33,510
He probably ran away to a place far from here by now.

618
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,500
With Consort Hyo?

619
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,380
Gosh, those were the days.

620
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,770
Yes, that is what befits the half-witted crown prince.

621
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,450
Poor Crown Princess.

622
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:50,810
Looks like she will die a grass widow inside the palace.

623
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,430
Here you are.

624
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,830
You said you would conduct government affairs temporarily.

625
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,730
But you are taking the crown?

626
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,620
Please consider this a government affair as well.

627
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,360
A ceremony like this would be needed to correct

628
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,300
a country's discipline, right?

629
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:17,580
Your Highness Consort Cheong Myeong, you enjoy needle therapy, right?

630
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:23,490
Well, I am quite a cultured person.

631
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,350
It was proven that the long needle Her Highness uses

632
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:37,970
and the long needle used to murder His Majesty are the same ones.

633
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:42,160
Also, it is different from the one Consort Hyo used.

634
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:48,680
Are you saying I murdered His Majesty?

635
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,110
That is nonsense.

636
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:53,290
There are palace maids who saw Your Highness' servant coming out of

637
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:55,610
His Majesty's chamber right before his death.

638
00:52:55,610 --> 00:53:01,050
I have always been doing that to keep a watch on his chamber.

639
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:08,070
Is there evidence Her Highness' long needle was used to murder His Majesty?

640
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:13,110
Physician Jeong, please come in.

641
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:24,670
I heard Physician Jeong is Your Highness' uncle.

642
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:27,310
What do you say, Physician Jeong?

643
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:32,320
It is indeed Her Highness Consort Cheong Myeong's

644
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,310
long needle.

645
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,600
Oh, my, my. Uncle!

646
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,630
Mother.

647
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:43,370
No, no, it is not true.

648
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,280
The Head Minister must have bought out Physician Jeong.

649
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,300
I treated you so well, you old fart.

650
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,360
But you sided with them?

651
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,060
Is that long needle really yours, Mother?

652
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:03,730
It is true that the needle is mine,

653
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:06,720
but no. I really did not do anything.

654
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,670
Mother!

655
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,490
What do you say, Grand Prince?

656
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:24,690
Must you really watch Her Highness Cheong Myeong get locked up or

657
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:30,120
would you like to let the bygones be bygones?

658
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,560
Since His Majesty was already announced to have died

659
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,430
from an unknown cause rather than murder.

660
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,010
Hear ye.

661
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,040
Lock up Consort Cheong Myeong

662
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,360
in the prison right now.

663
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,420
Grand Prince.

664
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,140
What are you all doing?

665
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,000
Arrest Consort Choeng Myeong and

666
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,100
investigate thoroughly to confirm Physician Jeong's testimony!

667
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,670
Y-Yoong, i-it was not me, I did nothing. I am not crazy!

668
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,310
Yoong, Yoong- Grand Prince!

669
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:09,020
Let go, let go of me!

670
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,790
Grand Prince Yoong,

671
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,290
you are very manly.

672
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:20,290
All right, shall we commence the coronation now?

673
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:25,270
I am told the man of the hour has arrived as well.

674
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:36,170
His Majesty the Emperor enters!

675
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:31,510
Now, His Majesty will now pray for endless prosperity of Asatae

676
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,970
before the heavens and the earth.

677
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,600
Halt.

678
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,510
There is something I must say before the ceremony.

679
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:43,710
I heard countless rioters are locked up right now.

680
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:48,400
Their provocative actions of planning to take over the throne and

681
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,700
causing chaos deserve to be punished severely.

682
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,920
Though their method was wrong,

683
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:58,040
I reckon their love for this country, Asatae, is not any different than mine.

684
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,690
On this meaningful day of my crowning,

685
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:04,510
I will pardon all of them.

686
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,870
Also, the amusement troupe that stayed in the palace

687
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:13,600
during the previous king's reign will be dismissed.

688
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,240
So everyone, go back to your hometown.

689
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,250
Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty!

690
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,820
Are you looking for Consort Hyo?

691
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,220
Consort Hyo is not on that side.

692
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,500
She is over there.

693
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,110
What is the meaning of this?

694
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,940
She is still a concubine,

695
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,370
but she will live as a court lady without any ranks.

696
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,900
I am the leader of the Inner Court.

697
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,830
You will allow me at least this much authority, right, Your Majesty?

698
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,330
Hong Gun.

699
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,690
Your Highness, Your Highness!

700
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,210
This is for putting the Crown Prince in trouble.

701
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,980
This is for mocking me and Inner Court.

702
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,100
You shameless bitch.

703
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:56,780
This is not where you belong.

704
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,370
That girl also accepted it willingly.

705
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,800
She said she would feel more comfortable living as a court lady

706
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,760
than to be locked up in Consort Hyo's pavilion.

707
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,210
You cannot, Consort Hyo!

708
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,580
I will not let you die.

709
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,590
Come back to your pavilion.

710
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,230
Are you telling me to go back to being your concubine?

711
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:46,090
I will not do that.

712
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,990
I came running...

713
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,730
only because I was worried about you.

714
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:54,100
Okay, then.

715
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,050
To be honest,

716
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,070
I am terribly scared.

717
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:01,720
And anxious.

718
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:08,320
I am afraid this anxiety will turn me into a monstrosity.

719
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,080
I would like you to...

720
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,360
keep me strong, Consort Hyo.

721
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:20,220
So that I will not become a monster like my father,

722
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,690
please help me.

723
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,160
I will protect you.

724
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:43,110
But if you end up a monster like your father,

725
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,550
my sword will come your way.

726
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:06,670
Kyera, how could you?

727
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,490
Was it you?

728
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,720
Tell them I ordered the execution of Consort Hyo and

729
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,040
take her to the execution grounds behind the palace.

730
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,940
Someone will come to rescue Consort Hyo there.

731
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,480
The one who took Kyera.

732
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,800
However, the current you are...

733
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,250
Who knows? I might give this to you.

734
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:53,060
The one who takes this becomes the king of this country, right?

735
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:56,820
Hyungnim, as long as you help me.

736
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,240
That is not him.

737
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,560
He is a different man.

738
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,300
Which one is Sajo Hyun?

739
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,870
♫ Never lost ♫

740
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,880
♫ I will never lose you ♫

741
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:24,700
♫ Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self ♫

742
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,620
♫ Never lost ♫

743
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,730
♫ When this darkness ends ♫

744

[Love Song for Illusion]

745
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:40,010
I will do my best to help you from where I am.

746
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:44,060
So, please do your best to set this country right.

747
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,770
Father.

748
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,960
Tell them to keep giving her work so she cannot rest even a moment.

749
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,920
When will you keep the promise you made to me?

750
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,810
You think I sat you there so you can do as you please?

751
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,080
What did you say?

752
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:07,410
You have to spend the night with Her Highness the Queen tonight.
