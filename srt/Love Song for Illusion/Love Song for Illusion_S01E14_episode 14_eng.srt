1
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,310
   

2
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,370
   

3
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,610
   

4
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,150
   

5
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,280
   

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,950
   

7
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:03,610

8
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,930
I missed you, Kyera.

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,820
Sir Ak Hee?

10
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,250
Sir Ak Hee, your blade was removed.

11
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,400
I am glad.

12
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,280
I was very worried since I could not confirm before leaving.

13
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
You were worried?

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,170
Of course, you were not waking up as Sir Ak Hee. I was so worried.

15
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,910
You were worried, huh?

16
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,570
I guess you are still unwell.

17
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,400
It still hurts a lot here, does it not?

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,150
Yes, there is a little bit of bleeding.

19
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,820
It kind of— A little— No, it hurts a lot.

20
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,180
Still? Let me see. I will try treating it.

21
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,490
N-No, it is okay.

22
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,280
I-It is not that bad.

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,100
Kyera!

24
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,410
   

25
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,250
Master Yang. Ha Rang.

26
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,720
Are you okay?

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,710
How can you leave without even telling us?

28
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,710
Sorry. I made you worry, right?

29
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,510
Why did you do such a reckless thing?

30
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,550
I am sorry, Master Yang.

31
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,460
How did you know I was here?

32
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,120
His Majesty sought us out.

33
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,610
I have something to talk about with Kyera.

34
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,360
How did you know where to find Master Yang?

35
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,020
I-It was not me. It was Sajo Hyeon.

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,080
 Did Yeon Wol get this for me? To save my life? 

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,110
 That is correct. 

38
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,460
 But why did she leave without a word? 

39
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,840
 Why? 

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,160
 I know. Why would she suddenly leave? 

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,010
 Your Majesty! 

42
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,370
 Your Majesty, Your Majesty! 

43
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,550
 Where are you going? 

44
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,100
 Yeon Wol might be in danger! I must save her. 

45
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,200
 You do not even know where she went! 

46
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,480
 You cannot. This is dangerous. 

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,640
 Move aside. 

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,700
 Let me come with you. 

49
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,800
 It would be better than going on your own. 

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,340
 Let go of— 

51
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,420
 Sajo Hyeon. 

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,540
 Let me see you for a moment. 

53
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,850
 Your Majesty. 

54
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,860
 What is the matter? 

55
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,980
 Are you feeling unwell again? 

56
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,380
 Come to your room right now. 

57
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,780
 Your Majesty, you are not going. Right? 

58
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,150
 Tell Eunuch Neung to leave. 

59
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,650
 Take your leave. 

60
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,640
 You cannot go anywhere! 

61
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,870
 I am going to be standing guard right here. 

62
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,820
 Close your eyes now. 

63
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,740
 Eunuch Neung! 

64
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,600
 Eunuch Neung, are you there? 

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,720
 Did it work? 

66
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,630
 It worked. It did. 

67
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,160
 It finally worked. 

68
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,690
 Who is there? 

69
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,020
 You are— How... 

70
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,740
 How do you have my face? 

71
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,340
 Look at this. I guess you really lost all your memories. 

72
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,910
 Hey, I could not even go out because you lost your memories. 

73
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,910
 W-Who are you? 

74
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,880
 And where is this place? 

75
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,180
 Oh, this place? 

76
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,850
 I guess you can say this place is 

77
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,180
 our mind's space where we have our friendly meetings. 

78
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,620
 Me? I am you. 

79
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,210
 Me? 

80
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,420
 What a heinous evil spirit. 

81
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,930
 This is still the same even though you have lost your memories. 

82
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,550
 Evil spirit? 

83
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,550
 Wow, it is unpleasant but amazing at the same time. 

84
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,890
 How impertinent, you scum! 

85
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,040
 Hey... 

86
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,300
 Stop yelling and... 

87
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,010
 come. Come take a seat here. 

88
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,610
 Answer me. I asked who you are. 

89
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,600
 I said I will answer you, so come take a seat. 

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,880
 It has not been long since I got that removed, so I cannot really move. 

91
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,190
I explained the situation to Sajo Hyeon in a hurry.

92
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,130
The urgent matters first for now.

93
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,530
He is smart because he takes after me.

94
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,540
He sure understood quickly.

95
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,880
 Two personalities? 

96
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,640
 Confusing, right? 

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,660
 But you do not have the time to be doing this. 

98
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,770
 I got it. I must go save Yeon Wol first. 

99
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,620
 On your own? You do not even have Ji Jeon Seo with you. 

100
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,240
 I know where to find the man you called Master Yang. 

101
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,790
 By the way, how do I get out? 

102
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,110
 Is there anyone here who knows Yeon Wol? 

103
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,560
 If you do, show yourself! I have to say something. 

104
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,320
 Hey, Sajo Hyeon, absolutely do not be kind to Hwang Ga Ron. 

105
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,340
 Get the drop on him, no matter what. Okay? 

106
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,690
 Act like you saw through everything. 

107
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,780
 Absolutely do not let him know you lost your memories. 

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,860
By the way, why did you suddenly come out?

109
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,350
You are disappointed I came out.

110
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,940
Should I go back inside?

111
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,980
That is not it.

112
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,410
You could have come out after we got back—

113
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,740
I wanted to see you.

114
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,050
I wanted to see you as soon as possible, so I asked Sajo Hyeon.

115
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,380
For telling him how to save you, I asked him to allow me to meet you quickly.

116
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,420
Sir Ak Hee, your eyes are worse than before. Right?

117
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,270
N-No.

118
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,010
I-I can see just fine.

119
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,160
That cannot be. Your focus is not right.

120
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,570
We are done talking. Let us go.

121
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,070
Thank you for helping me today.

122
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,450
Please help so His Majesty's memories can return soon.

123
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,670
You knew I was not Sajo Hyeon?

124
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,590
D-Do I not look like a king?

125
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,890
We must rush to go back before sunset.

126
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,600
Those two are looking down on me. Right?

127
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,780
Your eyes did get worse. You are misunderstanding them.

128
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,620
No, I can see just fine.

129
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,900
Did Sajo Hyeon's memories come back?

130
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,550
I do not know that,

131
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,070
but he told off Prince Ga Ron and took Kyera back.

132
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,870
That man is not Sajo Hyeon.

133
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,480
He is Ak Hee.

134
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,320
No way.

135
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,680
There is no way the blade was removed.

136
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,650
Even if it was removed, His Majesty has lost his memories,

137
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,310
so Ak Hee cannot come out.

138
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,620
Incorrect. Even if the one who took Kyera was Sajo Hyeon,

139
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,250
he could not have done it alone.

140
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,940
One way or another, Ak Hee is influencing him.

141
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,930
It means Ak Hee survived.

142
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,960
Oh, my. This is such a letdown for you.

143
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,950
You thought Ak Hee had died.

144
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,300
If he survived, I just need to make use of him alive,

145
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,400
manipulating his boiling obsession and ambition.

146
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:52,140
 I realized it clearly after nearly perishing for good. 

147
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,830
 I... 

148
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,810
 do not want to let you go. 

149
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,350
 I do not want to lose you to Sajo Hyeon. 

150
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,930
I have been sharing my body with such an untidy person?

151
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,180
He still survived even after being stabbed with something like this?

152
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,390
My goodness.

153
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,660
 Wait a moment. 

154
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,190
 Anyhow, you want to save Kyera, 

155
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,980
 although you do not remember her. 

156
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,600
 That is right. 

157
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
 You were having a great time yesterday, being all lovey-dovey. 

158
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,370
 Wait! How would you know that? 

159
00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:00,270
 Sir Ak Hee can read everything you experience and think. 

160
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,030
 You get to read me, but why can I not read you? 

161
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,680
 That is the difference between you and me. 

162
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,820
 The proof that I am way greater than you are. 

163
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,410
Ak Hee gets to read my mind and my memories.

164
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,520
But why can I not do the same?

165
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,400
I can also read Ak Hee's mind.

166
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,410
I can read it.

167
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,610
Gosh, it is not working.

168
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,470
Goodness, I was looking elsewhere.

169
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,280
W-What is this?

170
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,160
Wait! He came to such a rundown place?

171
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,340
Exactly.

172
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,780
Yeon Wol!

173
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,440
Gosh, Yeon Wol!

174
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,410
You left without even a word. Do you know how shocked I was?

175
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,040
I am sorry, Eunuch Neung. I made you worried sick. Right?

176
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,920
Gosh, seriously.

177
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,320
Your Majesty, you, too.

178
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,380
I was guarding you all day, and you left the moment I went to take a leak.

179
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,720
Well, I apologize.

180
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,760
Sorry?

181
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,600
Sir Ak Hee?

182
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,910
You are Sir Ak Hee. Right?

183
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,140
Goodness, Sir Ak Hee!

184
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,600
What in the world? I never thought I would be so glad to see Sir Ak Hee.

185
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,560
What makes you think I am Ak Hee?

186
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,330
Come on, Sir Ak Hee.

187
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,400
I can tell with one glance.

188
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,060
What about His Majesty?

189
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,550
He is doing well. Right?

190
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,540
He does not even have his memories. Would this not confuse him more?

191
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,170
Sir Ak Hee, as for your memories...

192
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,830
You recognize me, so you are fine. Right?

193
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,650
Goodness, His Majesty is the only troubled one.

194
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,340
Gosh, what do I do?

195
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,060
Gosh, everyone is only worried about Sajo Hyeon.

196
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,520
Yeon Wol, you will not go anywhere now. Right?

197
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,930
For a while.

198
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,460
Huh? Where are you trying to go now?

199
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,510
Even if I go, I will make sure to tell you, Eunuch Neung.

200
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,540
I promise.

201
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,920
Yes, you must do that.

202
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,150
Sir Ak Hee, you will have dinner. Right?

203
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,880
What? Why?

204
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,090
Should I just skip dinner and go inside?

205
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,950
So you can see Sajo Hyeon sooner?

206
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,540
Gosh, why are you saying that, Sir Ak Hee?

207
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,260
Let me treat your wound. We have the medicinal herbs, too.

208
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,950
What wound?

209
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,660
I will treat your wound.

210
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,300
And let us have dinner together, too.

211
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,310
She said she would treat me.

212
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,620
She wants to eat with me.

213
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,030
C-Cheong Ta?

214
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,370
Why you little...

215
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,560
W-Wait! What is the matter with you?

216
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,490
Stop it!

217
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,540
H-Hey, hold on. Stay right there.

218
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,330
Wait—

219
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,320
You bastard, how dare you stick the blade in me?

220
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,730
You tried to kill me!

221
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,490
So, you should have listened to me from the beginning.

222
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,620
I gave you a chance, but you did not even budge.

223
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,040
Oh, really? You should try getting stabbed, too.

224
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,320
See how much it hurts. Okay?

225
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,600
Kyera!

226
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,470
You need to have Kyera.

227
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,370
You can have her.

228
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,890
You just need to get rid of Sajo Hyeon.

229
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,020
Once Sajo Hyeon is gone,

230
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,590
you can take over that body

231
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,400
and Kyera will have no choice.

232
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,830
That talk is already over.

233
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,430
You are going to disappear soon! You know that!

234
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,270
See? You are more or less blind now, are you not?

235
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,140
You forced your way out earlier. So even your power must have weakened more.

236
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,340
And Sajo Hyeon became stronger!

237
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,790
Sajo Hyeon lost his memories anyway.

238
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,380
That is why this is a chance for you.

239
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,190
Sajo Hyeon fully trusts you right now.

240
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,360
He does not know who you really are.

241
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,580
Perform geuminsal on Sajo Hyeon. 
  (Killing with a metal) 

242
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,830
You will stick the blade in him.

243
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,870
How about it?

244
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,040
Are you sure the queen is pregnant?

245
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:33,450
Yes! You told me to confirm it, so I went to her chamber again.

246
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,500
 Queen, guess what I brought. 

247
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:45,600
 They are the highest quality silk I got from the country of Jinhoi. 

248
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,730
 Take a look. 

249
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,600
I rubbed peach skins all over the silk before taking them with me.

250
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,670
 Hold on. 

251
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,640
 Wait. Why? 

252
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,550
She cannot fool my eyes.

253
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,490
She is pregnant, for sure.

254
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,710
Grand Prince, I did well. Right?

255
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,490
Grand Prince. Grand Prince!

256
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,680
Grand Prince, you must be busy with state affairs.

257
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,760
What brings you here?

258
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,440
No matter how much I think about it,

259
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,390
I reckoned it cannot be overlooked. So I came running.

260
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,510
Did another problem break out?

261
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,140
It did.

262
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,060
And it is a serious matter.

263
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,760
I had a dream last night.

264
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,530
A large dragon was embracing the queen's pavilion.

265
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,810
I had a weird feeling and asked High Priest Cheong Ta.

266
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,060
She said it must be a highly fortunate conception dream.

267
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,050
Now that I see, Your Majesty, your complexion looks quite rough.

268
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,190
My dream is a conception dream. Right?

269
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,440
Grand Prince, that is total nonsense—

270
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,530
It is.

271
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,510
I did not tell anyone because I was being cautious.

272
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,690
But as expected, you are special because you are the uncle.

273
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,470
What great news!

274
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,580
Your Majesty,

275
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,680
I sincerely congratulate you.

276
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,270
Head Minister, congratulations.

277
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,470
You will now become a grandfather.

278
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,280
Father did not know, either.

279
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,360
I apologize for not having told you.

280
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,050
Oh, yes, Queen.

281
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:48,510
His Majesty should be a part of this joyful news.

282
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,590
But he is fighting an illness, and it makes me sad.

283
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,780
Exactly so.

284
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:05,790
But still, I feel so reassured to have you here, Grand Prince.

285
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,390
Yes, I will protect the baby

286
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,560
in your womb without fail as his uncle.

287
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,780
As expected, I was right to bring that person.

288
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,970
Pardon?

289
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,450
To serve Your Majesty, the precious one, with even more care,

290
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,220
I brought a trustworthy bodyguard.

291
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,350
Come in.

292
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,510
What are you waiting for?

293
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,440
Come in and offer your greetings.

294
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,670
Officer Ji will protect you starting today, Your Majesty.

295
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,320
Grand Prince, this man is His Majesty's bodyguard.

296
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,830
Since you are pardoning him anyway, why not send him to His Majesty—

297
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:10,360
My subordinates are protecting His Majesty rigorously, so do not worry.

298
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,740
I heard Officer Ji was taken in by Your Majesty's family.

299
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,510
The baby in the womb will also be at ease

300
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,020
if Her Majesty is served by someone she used to know.

301
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,790
Goodness, now that I think about it,

302
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,950
this man also found out about Her Majesty's pregnancy.

303
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,010
Officer Ji, you must protect Her Majesty with your life.

304
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,360
Do you understand?

305
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,800
I might as well use your room.

306
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,240
Did you meet Yeon Wol?

307
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,110
How was your talk with her?

308
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,030
Was she not surprised to see you?

309
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,660
What took you so long?

310
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,000
Gosh, ask me one thing at a time.

311
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,650
Could it be that Yeon Wol left soon after?

312
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,800
Yes, she sends her regards to you.

313
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,240
She left.

314
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,820
Without even a farewell.

315
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,160
I am kidding.

316
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,650
She is at the villa right now.

317
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,200
R-Really?

318
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,220
I stopped her from leaving and told her to be with me.

319
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,560
Thank you, Ak Hee.

320
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,780
H-Hey, I am not fully healed here.

321
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,230
Anyhow, thank you.

322
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,070
Why thank me? I only told my woman—

323
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,400
What were you going to say?

324
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,990
You can go now.

325
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,770
Can I really do that?

326
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,220
 Help the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong. 

327
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,610
 If you do, I will stick the blade in Sajo Hyeon's body. 

328
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,420
Will Sir Ak Hee yield tomorrow?

329
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,370
I told him the wound needs to be disinfected again tomorrow. Right?

330
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,440
Should I not have said that?

331
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,020
Sir Ak Hee.

332
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,130
You are trying not to fall asleep. Right?

333
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,830
Your Majesty?

334
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,360
It is Your Majesty. Right?

335
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,800
Your Majesty.

336
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,470
Your Majesty.

337
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,330
I mean...

338
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,740
how did you recognize me when it is this dark?

339
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,150
Just a feeling.

340
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:20,330
♫  Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment  ♫

341
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,680
I was too harsh on you at Prince Ga Ron's royal villa.

342
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,290
I was too shocked.

343
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,260
It is okay. I understand.

344
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:35,380
But still, I was able to save you because Ak Hee could read my mind.

345
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,440
I am really glad Sir Ak Hee did not lose his memories.

346
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,060
However, that is really...

347
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,520
Ak Hee can see my memories, but I cannot see his.

348
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,980
I heard that is how it was from the beginning.

349
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:00,370
Could it be because you thought you could not do it from the beginning?

350
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,440
It is because I never tried to do it?

351
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,300
I did try earlier.

352
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,890
Try harder until your brain starts sweating.

353
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,870
Until it sweats?

354
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:23,990
♫  So that I can feel the faint sound of you breathing  ♫

355
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,050
Yes.

356
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,160
Focus your strength right here.

357
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:43,010
♫  Even if the memories become more and more blurry  ♫

358
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:49,310
♫  Your warmth remains in my heart  ♫

359
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:58,230
♫  Even if you become wind and cannot hold you  ♫

360
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,150
Your brain must be sweaty.

361
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,330
♫  I'll stay here and wait for you  ♫

362
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,590
♫  Even if you disappear again tomorrow  ♫

363
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,200
Is it refreshing?

364
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,710
It is refreshing, and it is cold.

365
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:28,070
♫  So that I can feel the faint sound of you breathing  ♫

366
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,120
How is it? Is it refreshing?

367
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,180
It is very refreshing.

368
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,520
Have some more.

369
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,010
They are having the time of their lives.

370
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:54,350
 Just let the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong deal with the bothersome throne. 

371
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,930
 Go far away with Kyera and 

372
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,910
 live happily ever after, Sir Ak Hee. 

373
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,460
Is this also an herb?

374
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,060
Oh, this is a medicinal herb good for the eyes.

375
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,100
Sir Ak Hee's eyes keep getting worse.

376
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,400
Did something get in your eye?

377
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,400
I think my eyes keep getting blurry as well.

378
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,350
I will give you some as well, Your Majesty.

379
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,300
Gosh, I will give you a lot.

380
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,350
I think dirt got in for real.

381
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,360
Let me see.

382
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,210
Open your eye.

383
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,350
Gosh, stop overreacting and bear it.

384
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
I am sorry.

385
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,780
For what?

386
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,760
 I am sorry for liking you this much when I have the queen. 

387
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,330
I am sorry—

388
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,440
I would like to come pick greens again tomorrow.

389
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,380
Tomorrow is Sir Ak Hee's turn to wake up.

390
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:33,580
Oh, in that case, the day after tomorrow?

391
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:38,150
S-Sure thing.

392
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,800
And also, it will be dangerous for Ak Hee to come

393
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,680
pick greens because his eyes are bad.

394
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,790
I reckon it would be better for Ak Hee to just stay in bed.

395
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,540
Yes!

396
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,820
I will make sure Sir Ak Hee stays in bed all day.

397
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,600
I thought you were taken by a tiger while picking greens.

398
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,820
You did not even gather that much greens, either.

399
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,540
What were you two doing?

400
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,310
So, where are you coming from?

401
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,530
The market, so I can make a delicious dinner later.

402
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,720
Ji Jeon!

403
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,500
Gosh, Ji Jeon, you were released, huh?

404
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,400
You went through so much. Look how much you waned.

405
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,010
Your Majesty.

406
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,910
He is Officer Ji, who used to guard you, Your Majesty.

407
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,930
Ji Jeon, you did not come alone?

408
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,440
Her Majesty has arrived.

409
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,830
What?

410
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,820
The queen?

411
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,420
Your Majesty, where have you been?

412
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,360
I was coming to meet you because I was worried.

413
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,750
What brings you here, My Queen?

414
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,690
What do you mean?

415
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,420
Would there be a reason for a wife to come see her husband?

416
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,720
Who do we have here? Are you not Yeon Wol?

417
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,380
Have you been doing well?

418
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

419
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,190
Your Majesty, the wind is cold.

420
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,580
It is.

421
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,010
I should go inside.

422
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,270
My Queen, are you unwell?

423
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,010
Yes, I am a little unwell.

424
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,180
I will do it.

425
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,410
Is she sick?

426
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:39,050
In fact, I came to deliver joyful news to you, Your Majesty.

427
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,410
I have...

428
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,440
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

429
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,620
Her Majesty is with child.

430
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,190
With child?

431
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,160
S-Sajo Yoong, you scum.

432
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,850
W-With child?

433
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,340
I found out a while ago.

434
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,910
But I get to tell you now because I kept quiet since it is an important and cautious matter.

435
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,570
I am sorry I could not inform you sooner, Your Majesty.

436
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,560
Yeon Wol, why are you standing there?

437
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,640
The sun is hot. Come on up here.

438
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,670
Yeon Wol, will you congratulate me on my pregnancy?

439
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:59,470
You were once my servant.

440
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,120
I heard you used to be a palace maid in the royal kitchen.

441
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,940
Did you also serve the queen?

442
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,940
Yes, she did. Only very briefly.

443
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:21,130
Congratulations on your pregnancy, Your Majesty.

444
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,040
Thank you.

445
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,590
Thank you for making this long trip.

446
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,480
Rest comfortably in the master bedroom.

447
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,420
Yes, I made this long trip because I missed you so much.

448
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,580
But I am actually quite tired.

449
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,090
Let Her Majesty rest in my bed.

450
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,630
- Yes, Your Majesty. 
 - No.

451
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,650
Could you do it, Yeon Wol?

452
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,600
I am glad to see you in a long time.

453
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

454
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,290
Eunuch Neung.

455
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

456
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:36,600
Eunuch Neung, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong said to remember the promise.

457
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,710
I am sorry, Eunuch Neung.

458
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,220
Your Majesty.

459
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,040
Why are you still lingering around His Majesty?

460
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,110
Did you really...

461
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,650
bear His Majesty's child?

462
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,340
What?

463
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,710
You wicked wench!

464
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,830
Be careful.

465
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,120
You will get hurt.

466
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,540
It is His Majesty's child I conceived from sleeping with His Majesty.

467
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,320
What an idiot.

468
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,340
Did you think your behavior with His Majesty was love?

469
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,740
Did you mistake him to be sincere?

470
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,490
Do you think His Majesty really loved you, you lowly wench?

471
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,220
Get lost, you wench.

472
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,110
Do not ever come near His Majesty again.

473
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,060
If I see you one more time,

474
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,110
I will rip you into pieces alive!

475
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,220
If your pregnancy is true, consider your baby in the womb.

476
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,060
Such harsh language is bad for prenatal care.

477
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,990
What?

478
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,200
Eunuch Neung, did I really...

479
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,850
Did I really have a good relationship with the queen?

480
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,950
You were kind to everyone, Your Majesty.

481
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,650
Are you saying I turned my eyes to another woman

482
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,120
when I had a good relationship with the queen?

483
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,510
Answer me, Eunuch Neung.

484
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,580
You are the only one I can trust right now.

485
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,060
Your Majesty, the thing is...

486
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,000
 The moment you spout nonsense, 

487
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,840
 your old mother, your brother couple, and your young nieces and nephews 

488
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,180
 will all be torn apart limb from limb. 

489
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,400
I do not really know, either.

490
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,710
Did you used to be my bodyguard?

491
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

492
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,250
Is Yeon Wol still serving her?

493
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,000
She left just now.

494
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,880
 Her Majesty is with child. 

495
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,320
 W-With child? 

496
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,570
There is no way.

497
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,490
There is no way.

498
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,000
 What an idiot. 

499
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,770
 Did you think your behavior with His Majesty was love? 

500
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,620
 Did you mistake him to be sincere? 

501
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,820
Master Yang.

502
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,820
Have you realized everything now?

503
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,580
Everyone is conspiring to mock His Majesty.

504
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,650
We cannot let things be.

505
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,390
Why did you become so foolish?

506
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,390
Did your love for His Majesty do this to you?

507
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,040
What can you do by going back to that house?

508
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,040
What will you do with His Majesty, who lost his memories?

509
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,060
The queen even became pregnant.

510
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,970
What are you even going to do?

511
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,170
I will not stand by and watch anymore.

512
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,200
If you will not forsake everything and follow me,

513
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,680
this will be the end of our connection.

514
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,360
Master—

515
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,660
 What am I going to do by meeting her? 

516
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,780
 What excuse am I trying to give? 

517
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,460
 I do not have the right. 

518
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,700
Sajo Hyeon would never do that.

519
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,090
 Once she loses all feelings of love for Sajo Hyeon, 

520
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,590
 Kyera will not have any other choice. 

521
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,870
 H-How will she lose all feelings of love? 

522
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,150
 She is bound to end up that way. 

523
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,150
 This is really your final chance, Ak Hee. 

524
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,380
That was why.

525
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,330
 I am standing at the edge of a cliff right now. 

526
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,730
 And all my memories are gone. 

527
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,280
 What should I do? 

528
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,920
 Who should I trust? 

529
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,570
 Ak Hee, let us have a talk. 

530
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,020
 Please summon me. 

531
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,840
 Ak Hee, summon me to that room. 

532
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,050
 I cannot go there on my own yet. 

533
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,480
Gosh, if I face this bastard right now,

534
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,020
I will have to lie to him.

535
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:49,680
Hey, come to your senses.

536
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,250
You are an evil spirit.

537
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,110
Guilt does not suit you.

538
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:57,420
 Ak Hee! Ak Hee! 

539
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,790
If there is no way to regain my memories,

540
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,810
I need to read Ak Hee's mind, at least.

541
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,440
I will be able to read it.

542
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,100
I will be able to read it.

543
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:29,090
 Sir Ak Hee. 

544
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,060
I must tell His Majesty the honest truth.

545
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,840
Mother, I am sorry.

546
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,920
I am sorry, Eunuch Neung.

547
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:36,420
 Ak Hee, I have to meet you this way since you will not summon me. 

548
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,230
Looks like Officer Ji delivered my words properly.

549
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,430
Is it to your liking?

550
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,000
The current situation I prepared for you, Sir Ak Hee.

551
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,110
Everything exists for your sake, Sir Ak Hee.

552
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,600
Are you even human?

553
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,190
I may not be human!

554
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,130
I may be an evil spirit like you.

555
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,300
You are doing all this to become the king. Right?

556
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,590
Wow, you are really something else.

557
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,230
It is natural for me to become the king.

558
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,930
The method is what matters.

559
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,610
I want a peaceful passing of the crown.

560
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,410
Peaceful passing of the crown?

561
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,970
You are scared because people are saying you are the most wicked of them all.

562
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,680
Those who yearn for the restoration of the Royal Family of Yeon.

563
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,180
Those who support Sajo Hyeon.

564
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,710
There are even those who doubt my legitimacy to the throne.

565
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,950
In order to silence them at once,

566
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,190
peaceful passing of the crown will be best.

567
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,360
Will Sajo Hyeon just watch, huh?

568
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,230
Though he lost his memories, he is very smart.

569
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,760
That is why I am saying I need your help.

570
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,100
The day you allow the passing of the crown,

571
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,260
Cheong Ta will perform geuminsal on Sajo Hyeon.

572
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:28,640
I heard it from Cheong Ta.

573
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,900
That you will disappear soon.

574
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:36,510
So, this is really a trade that is good for you, me, and everyone else.

575
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,260
Use honorifics.

576
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,520
I am the king.

577
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:48,170
Would this not be what you call the best trade, Your Majesty?

578
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,950
How would I know if you will keep your promise or not?

579
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,520
That is the same for me as well.

580
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:01,170
Would it not also be quite fun to doubt and suspect each other

581
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:05,900
until the very last moment, Your Majesty?

582
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,790
I will not disappear.

583
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,150
You were avoiding me. So what brings you here?

584
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,940
I am going back to the palace tomorrow.

585
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,640
Did you already come to an agreement?

586
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,650
Since I recovered, I cannot very well stay here forever.

587
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,850
Ak Hee, regarding the queen, did you—

588
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,070
Am I the one who impregnated the queen?

589
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,270
Tell me honestly.

590
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,340
Why would I?

591
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:38,840
I have a woman I love. So, why would I?

592
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,940
You have a woman you love?

593
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,000
Who is it?

594
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,380
Hey, Sajo Hyeon.

595
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,950
There is something you are mistaken about.

596
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,640
Kyera— No.

597
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,050
Yeon Wol...

598
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:04,600
is in a relationship with me.

599
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,690
What?

600
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:10,790
I got to know her while roaming outside the palace and came to like her.

601
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:15,110
Back then, you had your queen...

602
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,430
Kyera and I liked each other so much that I took her in as a concubine.

603
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:20,120
Kyera and I liked each other so much that I took her in as a concubine.

604
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,180
A concubine?

605
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,230
Did I just sit back?

606
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,460
I did nothing when you took in a concubine—

607
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,130
Would you have done nothing, you ask?

608
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,760
You made such a scene.

609
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,270
You and I fought a lot.

610
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:37,310
Gosh, when I think about back then...

611
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,890
There is no way.

612
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,340
- Yeon Wol— 
 - Would not have liked me instead of you?

613
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,870
There is no way since she was so kind to you?

614
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:52,180
Hey, she did all that because

615
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,270
you need to recover and get your memories back for me to live.

616
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:58,280
You cannot mistake such things.

617
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,750
Why are you telling me this only now?

618
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,840
You kept quiet all this time, so why now—

619
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,890
Well, it has been chaotic and...

620
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,930
you seemed to like Kyera.

621
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,240
So, I did not know how to bring this up.

622
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,200
But the queen suddenly came.

623
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,380
So, I cannot help but tell you the truth.

624
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:27,130
 I am sorry— 

625
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,110
Well, what? What is it?

626
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,220
Well...

627
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,880
Nothing happened between you two already. Right?

628
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,330
I have been sick for a while, so I could not look into the world.

629
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,060
I see.

630
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:00,610
 Gosh, you are too kind. 

631
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,630
Anyhow, I am sorry.

632
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,310
Things became complicated because of me.

633
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,250
Be good to the queen.

634
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,290
The queen went through a lot because I brought Kyera as my concubine.

635
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,610
 More tightly. 

636
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:04,410
 It was all a misunderstanding? 

637
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,880
 Yeon Wol was Ak Hee's woman? 

638
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,750
 Her Majesty is with a child. 

639
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,590
Will you be able to leave tomorrow like this?

640
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,280
I will leave.

641
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,170
Go back to Sajo Hyeon.

642
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,450
Go tell him everything, honestly

643
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:56,790
and become Sajo Hyeon's concubine again.

644
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:59,560
Master Yang, how can you say that?

645
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,150
I do not wish to see you like this anymore.

646
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:05,300
Have you no shame to face the people wishing for the restoration of the Royal Family of Yeon?

647
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,500
What would they say if they found out about this?

648
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,210
Master Yang, I know I cannot repay you for saving my life and

649
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:16,320
taking care of me thus far, even with my death. However,

650
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,980
I do not want any more violence or killing.

651
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,900
In that case,

652
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,950
we will have to part ways now.

653
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:25,990
Master Yang.

654
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,370
Do not think you are indebted to me.

655
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,920
I only did my duty as a vassal of the Yeon Family.

656
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,110
I will no longer live for your sake now that you have changed like this.

657
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:43,050
Let us go our own ways tomorrow morning.

658
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,690
Master Yang.

659
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:21,710
 This is a treasure as valuable as my life that I inherited from my late father. 

660
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,730
 I will leave this here. 

661
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,730
 Make sure to... 

662
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,580
 keep your promise. 

663
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,650
Master Yang?

664
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,520
Master Yang, are we parting ways with Kyera like this?

665
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,170
You are really too harsh!

666
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:01,770
Ha Rang, go and bring the Wind Knives from the western valley.

667
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,620
Right now.

668
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,120
Yes.

669
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,530
Master Yang.

670
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,590
Please be careful.

671
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:45,620
 It would be great if I could read Ak Hee's mind. 

672
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,860
Do not waste your energy, Sajo Hyeon.

673
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,400
You are making me feel worse.

674
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,040
 I can read it. 

675
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,790
 I can read Ak Hee's memory. 

676
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,390
 I will take your life today. 

677
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:16,330
 You seem fake for some reason— I am sorry. 

678
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,650
 Please take care, Your Majesty. 

679
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,550
Master Yang?

680
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,480
Master Yang, what is the matter?

681
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,290
- Master Yang. 
 - Your Majesty.

682
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:01,800
Have you forgotten...

683
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,340
the promise you made to me?

684
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,200
 Can you give me a chance, please? 

685
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:17,180
 Can you watch me take care of the wicked doings of the previous king 

686
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:22,550
 and build a country where the despaired people live with hope yet again? 

687
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,540
 Kill me with this sword. 

688
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,910
 - Your Majesty— 
 - If I do not keep my promise or 

689
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:38,260
 if I follow the previous king's footsteps, 

690
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,920
 do not hesitate to kill me with this sword, then. 

691
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,500
 - That is— 
 - It has to be you, Yang Jae Yi. 

692
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,120
 It has to be you and 

693
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,130
 no one else who will slash my neck. 

694
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:53,700
What promise did I make to you? Tell me.

695
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,800
You told me to strike you with this sword if you go down the wrong path.

696
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,190
You are going down the wrong path right now, Your Majesty.

697
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:02,900
- Shut up, Master Yang! 
 - Officer Ji!

698
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:07,060
You only loved Lady Yeon Wol, Your Majesty.

699
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,860
Lady Yeon Wol offered her everything for your sake.

700
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,960
Please realize this fact and

701
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,370
do not let the queen and Sajo Yoong deceive you.

702
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,080
- Master Yang! 
 - Master Yang!

703
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,720
Your Majesty, it is dangerous.

704
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,720
Please escape!

705
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,050
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

706
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,310
Please protect Lady Yeon Wol!

707
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:37,360
You are the only one for My Lady!

708
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,580
Your Majesty!

709
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:46,920
Master Yang!

710
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,880
Do not come. Kyera!

711
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,190
Master Yang.

712
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:39,560
Please do not move.

713
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,340
Lady Yeon Wol,

714
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,550
I am sorry I could not do as you wished.

715
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,160
Please...

716
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,410
Master Yang.

717
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,830
Master Yang.

718
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,140
Master Yang! Master Yang!

719
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,670
Master Yang!

720
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,970
 A fake is fake forever. As expected, there is no sincerity. 

721
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:00,520
 You seem fake for some reason. 

722
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,800
 I know you like me, Kyera. 

723
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,400
 I clearly felt it. 

724
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:13,050
 That must be because I thought you were His Majesty, Sir Ak Hee. 

725
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:16,740
 - I am sorry. 
 - That is not true. 

726
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,900
 T-That cannot be. 

727
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,820
 Ak Hee, perform geuminsal on Sajo Hyeon. 

728
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:36,220
 Would this not be what you call the best trade, Your Majesty? 

729
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,240
Ak Hee.

730
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,720
He was lying.

731
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:50,290

732
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,220
Yeon Wol! Yeon Wol!

733
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,440
♫  Because I was always you  ♫

734
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,900
♫  And you were always me  ♫

735
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:07,750
♫  I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere  ♫

736
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:14,870
♫  The place where you are, even if it'll only be a moment  ♫

737
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:20,430
♫  Please take me anywhere  ♫

738
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:25,310
   

739
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,810
 We were never meant to be. 

740
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:31,000
 I must not look into my mind carelessly. 

741
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,070
 Who is it? 

742
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:34,470
 The father of the baby in your womb. 

743
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,270
 What you think is right, Grand Prince. 

744
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,610
 My memories came back. 

745
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:41,020
 Do whatever it takes and get rid of Sajo Hyeon. 

746
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:44,810
 I am going to read all of Ak Hee's memories while I am here. 

747
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:49,700
 I will put the seal on this after I confirm Sajo Hyeon is gone. 

748
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,320
 What did you do to His Majesty? 

749
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,430
 What did you do? 

750
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,750
 I am sorry, Kyera.
