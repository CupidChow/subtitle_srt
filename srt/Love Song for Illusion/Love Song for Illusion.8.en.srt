Gosh, why blow out all the lights?

9
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,960
Because I am quite embarrassed.

10
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,980
I think having all the lights out makes me more embarrassed.

11
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,940
You are embarrassed because you took off all your clothes.

I have never really done much sewing.

41
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,360
Is it because you became an assassin at a young age?

That is one reason.

43

Nothing happened with the Queen.

123
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,050

124
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,770
That is not good.

125
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,120

127
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,430
You wished for something to happen between the Queen and me?

128
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,230
Are you okay with me, the one you love, embracing another woman?

129
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,700
Wait, you even came to the drapery because you were concerned.

130
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,650
You said you were glad I refused to sleep with her,

131
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,660
but that I still shouldn't have done so, not making any sense.

132

133
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,940
You are hot.

134
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,760

What do you mean?

139
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,990
His body is not hot like this.

140
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,060
It is very cold.

141
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,510
He does not call me Kyera.

Now, I realize you came to prepare your heart, Kyera.

143
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,010
Most of all, he would not sleep with the Queen just to hurt my feelings.

144
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,600
Kyera, are you saying I can just embrace other women

145
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,830
when I am not Sajo Hyun, huh?

146
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:36,440
Because it is me, huh? It does not matter because I am just Ak Hee?

147
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,090
That was why you were there as the Queen's palace lady? To mock me?

148
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,980
I did not volunteer to be there. It was Her Majesty's order.

149
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,470
Are you someone who would willingly obey just because you were ordered to do so?

150
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,450
Sir Ak Hee, this is not the time to be doing this.

151
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,210
You must unite with His Majesty.

152
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,850
You know Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is always looking for a chance to take the throne.

153

I have no interest in such things!

154

Half-wit is taking my woman from me.

155
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,830
Would I have the mind to care for such things?

156
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,330
I liked the woman first before Sajo Hyun did.

157
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,720
It is the woman who liked me first before liking Sajo Hyun!

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,140
Where did Yeon Wol go?

188
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,210
His Majesty ordered her to get back to laundry duty.

189
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,430
What did you say? Bring her back here right now!

190
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,610
T-The thing is...

191
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,140
What are you waiting for?

192
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,460
His Majesty ordered her not to be brought back.

193
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,540
He said it was a royal decree. So that is that.

194
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,020
What did you say?

195
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,770
Get out, get out!

196
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,190
Get out!

197
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,700
- Get out, get out!
- My apologies, Your Majesty.

198
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,620
- Noh Ri Sa.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

199
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,340
Did you not see a golden dagger that was here?

200
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,670
Pardon?

201
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,770
Did His Majesty take it?

202
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,880
Your Majesty, please give your order.

203
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,560
You know, right?

204
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,470
- Sorry?
- Gosh, I know you realized I am Ak Hee.

205
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,260
I-Is that so?

206
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,280
"Is that so?"

207
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,600
Sajo Hyun lasted about five days, right?

208
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,860
At least for 10 days,

209
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,080
I am not going to sleep.

210
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,260
So, keep that in mind and behave accordingly.

211
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

212
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,910
In that case, when you slept with the Queen last night...

213
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,970
which one of you was...

214
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,760
You want to know?

215
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,170
I am not telling you.

216
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,140
Ji Jeon Seo, bring me Chung Ta right now.

217
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,480
Chung Ta keeps changing her location, avoiding me.

218
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,720
Find a way.

219
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,090
Do whatever it takes and bring Chung Ta in front of me, okay?

220
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,510
I have more than a couple of things to discuss.

221
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

222
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,290
Ji Jeon, be careful and come back quickly.

223
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,820
Yes.

224
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,990
All hail His Majesty!

225
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,540
T-That hurts.

226
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,010
All right, good morning.

227
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,590
Your Majesty, I heard there is something to celebrate from last night.

228
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,610
Congratulations on spending the night with Her Majesty the Queen.

229
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,350
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

230
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,760
Gosh. What a fuss.

231
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,400
W-Where did we get to last time?

232
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,220
- It is this one.
- I see.

233
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,660
He did not bring his personal notebook?

234
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,980
Your Majesty, your loyal subjects quarreled to no end regarding the issue of tax,

235
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,310
but it looks like we will need to take our time-

236
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,350
- Your Majesty!
- You really do not listen, huh?

237
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,860
Your Majesty!

238
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,460
This is a royal decree.

239
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,980
Everything I ordered the last few days, start enforcing them right away!

240
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,100
Your Majesty, I beg you to reconsider one more time.

241
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,680
Reconsider my foot!

242
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,110
Those who do not listen to my orders, I will behead-

243
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,780
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

244
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,180
Sir Ak Hee, this is not the time to be doing this.

245
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,890
You must unite with His Majesty.

246
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,790
W-Well, not to that extent.

247
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,370
Here.

248
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,920
T-Thank you for your grace.

249
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,430
You will be severely rebuked, so keep that in mind.

250
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,840
All right?

251
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,840
Oh, and also, you can take care of the rest, Head Minister.

252
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,530
Your Majesty, this humble one advised you so many times, did I not?

253
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,230
There is nothing to be gained from getting on the ministers' bad side.

254
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,960
I am sure the ministers also have nothing to gain from getting on my bad side.

255
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,940
Your Majesty, you must adhere to this humble one's loyal advice.

256
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,750
Within the Palace, this humble one and the Queen

257
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,740
are the only people you can trust and rely on.

258
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,380
Trust and rely on?

259
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,210
Based on what?

260
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,030
Do you think I am oblivious to your hidden intention to manipulate me

261
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:32,820
from behind the scenes to wield unmatched power and authority?

262
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,070
- Your Majesty-
- Also,

263
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,320
please stop asking to see me separately from now on.

264
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,990
You nag at everything and

265
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,980
I am getting sick of it.

266
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,180
Aigoo, I get dizzy from it. I also get a runny nose.

267
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,930
He is different.

268
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,720
He is different from yesterday's Sajo Hyun.

269
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,780
Palace Lady Yeon!

270
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,950
Thanks to you, I got the sweetest sleep last night.

271
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,110
Oh, and also, this part does not twitch anymore.

272
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:57,040
After getting needle therapy from Palace Lady Yeon, I am full of yang energy all of a sudden!

273
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,270
Oh, right. Looks like all the women in amusement troupe left the palace?

274
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,420
There was a girl who was close to me, but I have not seen her at all these days.

275
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,450
They must have left for their hometowns.

276
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,180
Because His Majesty ordered their release.

277
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,100
Some are still staying here, though.

278
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,210
I am sure about ten will be leaving the night after tomorrow.

279
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,290
I happened to be on night watch that day.

280
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,690
Why do they always send them out at night instead of during the day??

281
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,730
I really do not understand!

282
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,380
How weird.

283
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,870
Why are the amusement troupe's women sent out at night?

284
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,500
His Majesty permitted it already.

285
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,030
There must be a reason to send them out secretly.

286
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,630
Hong Gun.

287
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,600
You can send a word as I told you, right?

288
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,540
To Master Yang?

289
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,860
Why do you spend all day doing the laundry?

290
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,220
Court Lady.

291
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,940
Go to the Queen's pavilion right now. She is looking for you.

292
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,520
Unni was told to work at the laundry from now-

293
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,940
She is just looking for her! That is all!

294
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,680
Hurry up and go!

295
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,830
My Queen.

296
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,280
Is it because you spent the night with His Majesty last night?

297
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,440
You are shining brightly today.

298
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,360
Just look at your glowing skin.

299
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,160
Is that so?

300
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,290
Should we be expecting some good news?

301
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,020
Who knows?

302
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,540
It does feel quite different today.

303
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,090
Aigoo, that cannot be!

304
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,500
You cannot tell right away like that.

305
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,680
I know well because I experienced it-

306
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,040
Did you call for me?

307
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,150
Oh, my, Consort Hyo!

308
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,860
How did you end up upside down like this?

309
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,840
Foolish ones who mess up their own lives are hopeless.

310
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,570
Come here and massage me.

311
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,820
I am sore all over.

312
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
All over?

313
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,920
How rough was it for you last night?

314
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,940
That was why you said it feels different, huh?

315
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,310
Huh? Is it Sir?

316
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,580
Wait.

317
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,940
Why is he so angry?

318
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,580
Yoong, you are here?

319
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,100
Oh, okay.

320
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,880
- This is the last time.
- Yes, thank you so much. Take care-

321
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,870
- T-Take care, Yoong. I will pay you back!
- That old man

322
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,110
looks a lot like Sir.

323
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,510
Is it his father?

324
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,030
But his appearance is too...

325
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,880
Could it be his hyung, then?

326
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,710
It feels refreshing just to watch you do that.

327
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,180
It feels like my own bones are melting away.

328
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,060
Consort Cheong Myeong, you should also call this girl from time to time for a massage.

329
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,830
Aigoo, am I allowed to do that, Queen?

330
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,610
Where on Earth did Ak Hee go this time?

331
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,030
Gosh.

332
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,940
Huh?

333
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,350
- Gosh, g-get out of the way, please.
- Huh?

334
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,810
W-Why are there so many leaves?

335
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,370
Huh?

336
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,000
Gosh, seriously! My goodness.

337
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,640
Sir Ak Hee!

338
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,890
What are you doing here?

339
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,340
H-Hey, what is it?

340
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,790
I got the word from Ji Jeon.

341
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,430
He said he would come to the Palace with Chung Ta as soon as the sunset.

342
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,460
Go redo them!

343
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,510
Oh, okay.

344
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,730
Also, Her Majesty has taken back Yeon Wol!

345
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,030
Gosh, seriously, I said okay-

346
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,040
Why are you telling me this now?

347
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,620
B-Be careful, careful!

348
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,620
C-Careful, be careful-

349
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,020
Gosh, I did not even know that and was waiting here forever!

350
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,210
I thought you ordered her not to be taken to the Queen's pavilion.

351
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,020
How come Her Majesty defied a royal decree and did that?

352
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,170
Gosh, the Queen, seriously.

353
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,950
P-Please be careful, careful.

354
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,200
You never had feelings for me?

355
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,840
I am sorry.

356
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,210
It cannot be helped, then.

357
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,330
I should not keep interfering with the Inner Court's matter.

358
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,900
Let her be.

359
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,940
Sorry?

360
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,670
Yeon Wol is working without a break all day!

361
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,420
She even chops firewood on top of cleaning and laundry!

362
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,910
It is fine, okay?

363
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,530
Kyera has always been physically strong.

364
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,390
She will do well.

365
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,860
Gosh, I am so hungry and want some wheat porridge.

366
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,650
Along with some boiled potatoes.

367
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,240
W-Wait, wheat porridge, and potatoes-

368
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,800
Y-Your Majesty-

369
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,810
You were really born for this, huh?

370
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,380
Forget it, and go get some water now.

371
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,590
It is for Her Majesty's evening bath.

372
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,720
Her Majesty baths three times a day?

373
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,190
Yes.

374
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,670
And you are the one getting the water for all three.

375
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,000
My Lady, I got your letter.

376
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,730
Aigoo, what do I do? Where did she go?

377
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,580
A woman disappeared from the village of Honjeomi.

378
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,100
Four days ago as well.

379
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,040
They say she must have gone missing

380
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,790
in the mountains or was devoured by a beast.

381
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,350
Similar things are happening in other villages.

382
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,290
Something is not right.

383
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,950
Wait, please spare me.

384
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,910
Give it to me.

385
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,110
So why would you-

386
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,950
Oh, sorry.

387
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,200
Wait, I am really sorry. I was only trying to help.

388
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,400
Please go back now. Somebody might see us.

389
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,210
I told Eunuch Neung to keep a watch.

390
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,700
Sir Ak Hee!

391
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,380
As always, a person needs to know how to use their brain.

392
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,120
Look right here.

393
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,060
One, two, three.

394
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,150
We are carrying three whole buckets.

395
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,660
You cannot say anything because I am laughing like this, right?

396
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,940
I am different from Sajo Hyun, who is always grumpy, right?

397
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,380
Oh, the village of Imsoba we went to before.

398
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,270
We went there before?

399
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,140
The tavern-

400
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,520
You are confusing me for Sajo Hyun right now?

401
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,300
It could happen.

402
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,090
I will not take it personally.

403
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,460
Look.

404
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,270
S-Sajo Hyun and I are not much different, right?

405
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,450
A few women from that village were taken as amusement troupes.

406
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,140
But they did not come back yet.

407
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,900
And two women disappeared recently.

408
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,650
In my opinion, I think these events are related.

409
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,040
This is how you discussed things with Sajo Hyun, huh?

410
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,870
Sir Ak Hee, I feel something else is going on.

411
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,700
And they seem to be related to Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

412
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,240
Right.

413
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,940
That is why...

414
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,570
Let us leave together.

415
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,460
Sorry?

416
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,290
Sajo Yoong and this damn Palace are getting on my nerves.

417
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,180
So let us get away from here, okay?

418
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,210
You know I have no interest in being a king.

419
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,280
I will take care of Sajo Hyun on my end.

420
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,020
Sir Ak Hee!

421
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,720
How can you-

422
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,360
Even if you are not the owner of this body, how can you say that?

423
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,140
What is the reason I came back here?

424
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,560
What is the reason I am going through all this?

425
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,320
To help His Majesty set this country right and-

426
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,730
You mean you want to be by Sajo Hyun's side.

427
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,820
Even going through all this trouble.

428
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,600
I had forgotten about that fact.

429
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,520
Sir Ak Hee, someone is coming.

430
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,490
Come back.

431
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,780
Sir Ak Hee.

432
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,160
Please help His Majesty.

433
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,300
I am begging you.

434
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,010
I do not want to.

435
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,970
Sir Ak Hee!

436
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,480
I came to give this to her and...

437
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,610
I am sure Kyera is hungry.

438
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,400
Aigoo, you took off all your clothes.

439
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,200
Your room has a draft. Say, "ah."

440
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,410
It was different...

441
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,800
to call it madness.

442
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,880
You still could not find a way to seal Sajo Hyun?

443
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,850
Why are you so incompetent?

444
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,940
Gosh, I need to find a new shaman or something.

445
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,520
Finding a needle in the desert.

446
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:49,890
In this world, there are as many shamans as grains of sand.

447
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:53,790
But I must say a powerful shaman

448
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,670
like myself does not exist anywhere else, in my opinion.

449
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,140
Why would they not exist?

450
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,350
I heard there is a couple in Jinhoi up north from here!

451
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,150
I cannot go there right now because I am busy.

452
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,580
Sir Ak Hee.

453
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,410
Even so, thanks to His Majesty Sajo Hyun having broken bonghamsal,

454
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,200
you got to come back to the world like this.

455
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,920
Too much greed always calls for trouble.

456
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,960
You should get on good terms like before and share the body-

457
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,030
Sajo Hyun and I cannot be on good terms!

458
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,390
He took my woman from me!

459
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,400
How can I just watch them being all lovey-dovey?

460
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,680
I see...

461
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,560
There is something.

462
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,210
What do you mean?

463
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,050
Huh?

464
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,370
Is there something on my face?

465
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,700
Stay still.

466
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,010
This is too close-

467
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,340
Gosh, there is nothing!

468
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,510
Well, I will be off now.

469
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,060
Gosh, poor Sir Ak Hee.

470
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,150
Try to hang in there as long as you can

471
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,230
until the full moon rises again.

472
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,870
Gosh, seriously!

473
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,950
- Until it-
- We need to go now!

474
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,890
Chung Ta, come-

475
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,830
Until the full moon rises?

476
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,830
Gosh, that idiot, seriously!

477
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,220
You idiot, why would you suddenly come out at that moment?

478
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,390
Should I do something to this mouth-

479
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,100
Sir Ak Hee is so pitiful!

480
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,820
My goodness.

481
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,550
You feel sorry for everyone!

482
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,810
I am the most pitiful one.

483
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,160
I need to hurry along.

484
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,380
Wait, what is going on?

485
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,860
Huh? What is it now?

486
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,750
My Ji Jeon Seo.

487
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:40,210
I am going to see him before I go, even if it is from afar.

488
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,110
Pardon my intrusion.

489
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,530
I am Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

490
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,530
I hear you provide wise advice to His Majesty.

491
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,560
Could I invite you for some tea?

492
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,730
I went through a lot to get this tea when I visited Jinhoi as an ambassador.

493
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,620
I hear it helps women cultivate pure energy.

494
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,860
Oh, my.

495
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,160
Looks like this tea will do you no good, Ms. Chung Ta.

496
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,720
Because you are already this beautiful.

497
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,240
Ms. Chung Ta.

498
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,320
Could you share your wisdom with me as well?

499
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,100
Wisdom?

500
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,410
Please become my strategist.

501
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,910
I-I am...

502
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,180
Oh, my.

503
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,360
How beautiful.

504
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,520
I am pleading with you.

505
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,950
Your Majesty!

506
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,040
Your Majesty! Aigoo-

507
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,680
Your Majesty, this is terrible!

508
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,740
Your Majesty! Oh, my goodness-

509
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,560
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

510
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,200
This is terrible!

511
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,210
The ministers- The ministers have...

512
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,160
Your Majesty.

513
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,540
This has ended up happening in the end.

514
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,350
What shall we do now?

515
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,640
They are going to protest until I take back the royal decree?

516
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,480
It is not just the ministers.

517
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,850
Other officials are also showing signs of collective action.

518
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,110
Your Majesty, you should first console them calmly-

519
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,600
- Your Majesty!
- Oh?

520
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,910
You want to test me out, right?

521
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,900
Your Majesty!

522
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,990
You must be trying to tame me like this,

523
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,430
but it will not work.

524
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,650
All right, let us start the countdown.

525
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,780
The last one kneeling wins!

526
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,200
Your Majesty, I am worried it will affect your health!

527
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,850
What are you all doing?

528
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,350
Will you be so disloyal to His Majesty?

529
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,080
Do you people truly not fear the heavens?

530
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,080
Your Majesty.

531
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,460
What are you all doing?

532
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,180
Escort His Majesty right now!

533
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,710
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

534
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,760
Do not come close to me!

535
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,240
I will take down whoever comes close to me right there and then.

536
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,850
Your Majesty, please forgive us!

537
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:13,100
- Please take back your decree, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

538
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,810
Please take it back!

539
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,100
- Your Majesty!
- Please mind your health, Your Majesty!

540
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,550
- Your Majesty!
- Please forgive our disloyal acts!

541
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,270
Your Majesty!

542
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,900
What is this? You are leaving already?

543
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,510
What can you even protest against this way?

544
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,070
Please dry yourself.

545
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,510
Gosh, I said I was fine!

546
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,050
Kyera.

547
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,420
What do you think? I am cool, right?

548
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,400
Sir Ak Hee, this is not the way.

549
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,230
Why? They all tucked their tails and went back.

550
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,510
The ministers went back like that today,

551
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,470
but they will never back down so easily.

552
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,890
Because their concessions are at stake.

553
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,650
I know.

554
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,220
I will never back down, either.

555
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,120
Please use a different method.

556
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,230
You need to be wise, especially at a time like this.

557
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:32,060
Are you saying Sajo Hyun would have dealt with them wisely or something?

558
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,920
- Sir Ak Hee-
- It is Your Majesty for you.

559
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,680
You are only a palace lady, so how dare you call my name.

560
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,310
This method is bad, and that method is bad as well.

561
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:21,830
"This is not the way. Please help His Majesty."

562
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,580
Why is it Sajo Hyun and not me?

563
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,670
Why, why?

564
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,360
That feels great, so great.

565
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,700
How can your fingertips be so sweet?

566
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,490
For Grand Prince Yoong, someone like Consort Hyo-

567
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,520
That is incorrect.

568
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:51,290
He needs to find a woman with sweet fingertips like you.

569
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,110
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is a generous person, so he will find a good spouse.

570
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:01,180
Do you know about Grand Prince Yoong?

571
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,350
A little bit.

572
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,300
He helped me, who was raised an orphan, in many ways.

573
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,210
I am thankful to him.

574
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,140
My Yoong is a great person.

575
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,950
He helps people a lot here and there.

576
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,290
Yes.

577
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,110
His uncle was very handsome, too.

578
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,540
His uncle?

579
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,310
I saw the two of them meet up a few times long ago.

580
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,750
They looked so much alike, so I thought he was his father back then.

581
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,270
Not knowing Grand Prince Yoong was such a prestigious person.

582
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:45,510
Yoong has been in touch with his biological father?

583
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,640
Look over here...

584
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,440
Yeon Wol.

585
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,170
You better not talk about this anywhere else.

586
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,480
I will not let you be.

587
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,750
Do you understand?

588
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,910
I will keep that in mind.

589
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,220
What brings you here?

590
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,700
Her Highness Consort Cheong Myeong called for me.

591
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,290
I am on my way back after taking care of her discomfort.

592
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:29,040
Serves you right.

593
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,560
What made you end up in this state?

594
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,040
Is it love for Sajo Hyun or

595
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,900
is it self-blame for failing to exact your revenge?

596
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,400
What made you end up this way, Grand Prince?

597
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,700
Is it greed for power or...

598
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,300
- is it feeling of inferiority?
- What did you say?

599
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,770
This is how you repay me for raising and taking care of you after you became an orphan?

600
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,440
I had thought I was indebted.

601
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,220
Until I found out you sponsored Wind Knife with an impure motive, that is.

602
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,120
Until I realized you tried to kill me, that is.

603
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,220
Kyera,

604
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,490
I do not wish to hurt you.

605
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:13,580
However, as long as you are here,

606
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,970
I cannot help but eliminate you.

607
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,990
Leave.

608
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,970
I am not afraid.

609
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,040
Mother.

610
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,160
Do not call for that girl ever again.

611
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,070
Do not even talk to her, either.

612
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:31,520
Do you understand?

613
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,190
I understand.

614
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:39,490
You have not come to see your mother for a long time, but here you go, scolding me again.

615
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,480
You are really mean, Grand Prince Yoong.

616
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,240
B-Because of you, Mother,

617
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,240
I am always on my toes.

618
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,940
I will be careful.

619
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,640
By the way, Yoong,

620
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:11,520
that girl knows your father.

621
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:18,460
Of course, she thinks he is your uncle.

622
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,500
Kyera, I cannot keep you alive anymore.

623
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,440
Hurry up and come!

624
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,630
Some are still staying here, though.

625
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,970
I am sure about 10 will be leaving the night after tomorrow.

626
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,030
You have to hurry up and go!

627
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,490
- Bye!
- Take care.

628
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,880
Why are they being sent out in groups?

629
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,560
All right, take care and be happy.

630
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,460
- Please take care, Sir.
- Yes.

631
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,300
Kyera, I am sorry about earlier.

632
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,700
Kyera, I am sorry, okay?

633
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,210
How lame.

634
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,420
Just go, all right?

635
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,130
Just go to her.

636
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,170
It was my fault.

637
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,860
I am sorry, I-

638
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,800
Kyera?

639
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,190
Hall of Spirits.

640
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:44,730
Since the old times, it has been a place where begrudged palace ladies come to an end their lives.

641
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,950
Kyera,

642
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:52,900
it is the perfect place for you to end this life.

643
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,130
This is not how I wished to end our relationship.

644
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,030
I am sorry.

645
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,640
Aigoo, why would you do something you are sorry for?

646
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,100
Kyera.

647
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:21,340
Gosh, seriously, you are really a hassle.

648
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,680
Sajo Hyun.

649
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,150
I can tell clearly now.

650
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,970
You are not Sajo Hyun.

651
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,520
What bullshit. Are you not Sajo Yoong, then?

652
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,540
You are the evil spirit.

653
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,460
The parasitic evil spirit in Sajo Hyun's body.

654
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:19,510
Ak Hee, be gone with Sajo Hyun!

655
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,180
You cannot!

656
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,200
It is not the time yet.

657
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,930
Not yet.

658
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,810
The soldiers are on their way,

659
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:09,240
so get lost before matters get worse.

660
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,760
Kyera.

661
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,880
Your Majesty?

662
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,470
Yeon Wol!

663
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,220
I missed you.

664
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,400
I missed you, too.

665
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,500
Your Majesty?

666
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,490
Your Majesty.

667
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,370
How mean.

668
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,090
Where is Sajo Yoong?

669
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,130
You told me not to kill him.

670
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,950
I sent him back in one piece.

671
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,580
I was going to move you to your room as well,

672
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:38,210
but it seemed safer for you to be there.

673
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,910
Are you okay-

674
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,450
Kyera.

675
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,120
Leave right now.

676
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,950
I cannot do that.

677
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:54,110
How can I leave after seeing Grand Prince Sajo Yoong go ham like that?

678
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,640
I cannot stand it anymore.

679
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,560
I cannot bear to watch you

680
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,670
risk your life trying to save Sajo Hyun anymore.

681
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:03,870
Leave.

682
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,380
I cannot leave, at least not now.

683
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,700
If you will leave,

684
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,710
I will unite with Sajo Hyun and do my best.

685
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,000
You said your wish is to set this country right.

686
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,460
I will help Sajo Hyun to make your wish come true. Instead,

687
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:23,360
leave.

688
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:29,050
I cannot watch you and Sajo Hyun getting closer and loving anymore.

689
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,770
Can you promise me?

690
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,330
I promise you.

691
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,490
Just leave, please just go!

692
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,360
Well, then.

693
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,690
I will leave after I see His Majesty come back.

694
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,000
I will not go to him and be friendly.

695
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,340
I will only see him come back from afar and go my way.

696
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,540
You are going to see Sajo Hyun's face before you leave?

697
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,660
Even to the end, seriously.

698
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:10,250
How moving.

699
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,880
Do not go, then.

700
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,220
Just stay here and watch how I interfere with Sajo Hyun.

701
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:25,040
Because I am going to foil every single one of his plans.

702
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:35,990
I will leave.

703
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:39,290
Please tell His Majesty farewell.

704
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,800
Hold on.

705
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,770
It is yours.

706
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,820
Thank you.

707
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,120
I claimed this first.

708
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,530
I ordered it first.

709
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,210
♫ I will come and meet you ♫

710
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,500
I know how you feel.

711
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,250
Just how much you miss Sajo Hyun.

712
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,140
Because I was the same.

713
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,750
Because I missed you so much, too.

714
00:59:55,750 --> 01:00:02,900
♫ When I am reminded of you in my white dream ♫

715
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:08,170
♫ Please embrace me in your arms ♫

716
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:12,750
♫ I will reach for you ♫

717
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,190
Although...

718
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:19,100
it is a great pain for me that

719
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,810
you love Sajo Hyun, not me,

720
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:26,890
it is more painful to see your heart suffer.

721
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:33,610
♫ The moment flowers bloom again, I will come to you ♫

722
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:37,110
I will let you meet that punk.

723
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:40,560
♫ Just for a moment ♫

724
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:47,570
♫ If time will stop like this forever ♫

725
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:53,150
♫ Tears keep rolling down ♫

726
01:00:53,150 --> 01:01:01,560
♫ Are you also like me? My feelings will not change ♫

727
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:08,900
♫ I will now reach for you ♫

728
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,990
Sir Ak Hee.

729
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,180
Yeon Wol.

730
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,490
Your Majesty?

731
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,150
Yeon Wol!

732
01:01:55,310 --> 01:02:02,710
♫ Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment ♫

733
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:10,200
♫ Your warmth remains in my heart ♫

734
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:16,430
♫ Even if you become wind and cannot hold you ♫

735
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:22,310
♫ We will always feel each other, the two of us ♫

736
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:30,740
♫ So that you will not get far, so that we will not be apart even for a moment ♫

737
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:36,730
♫ Even if I grasp, you become blurry ♫

738
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,800
♫ I'll stay here and wait for you ♫

739
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:54,220
♫ Even if you disappear again tomorrow, I will wait ♫

740
01:02:54,220 --> 01:03:01,220
♫ So that I can feel the faint sound of you breathing ♫

741
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,860
Kyera.

742
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:06,330
Farewell.

743
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,240
Be happy.

744
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:24,020
♫ The memories become more and more blurry ♫

745
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:31,440
♫ Your warm breath remains in my heart ♫

746
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:37,400
♫ Even if you become wind and cannot hold you ♫

747
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:43,180
♫ Keep breathing inside me ♫

748
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:50,760
♫ So that we will not falter, so that we will not shake ♫

749
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,510
[Love Song for Illusion]

750
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:58,360
I will only look for a way to help and protect you, Your Majesty.

751
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,740
I will set everything right without fail.

752
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:04,010
After that, let us be together for sure.

753
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:08,550
I cannot serve you anymore, My Lady, for you have abandoned all your duties and

754
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,870
grew feelings for your sworn enemy's son.

755
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:14,600
Women kidnapped from all over the country are being sold off to Jinhoi.

756
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,760
Order the women in this warehouse to be released right now.

757
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,560
I will save my people and

758
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,850
punish the wicked who sold them off.

759
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:22,510
Burn everything down!

760
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:25,790
- Kyera!
- What the hell are you doing, Sajo Hyun?
