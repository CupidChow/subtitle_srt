1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,410
   

2
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,260
   

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,620
   

4
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,150
   

5
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,300
   

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,180
   

7
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:06,920

8
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,350
Wait...

9
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,080
Gosh, why blow out all the lights?

10
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,160
Because I am quite embarrassed.

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,880
I think having all the lights out makes me more embarrassed.

12
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,840
You are embarrassed because you took off all your clothes.

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,130
My goodness...

14
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,380
All right.

15
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,440
   

16
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,110
What is going on?

17
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,790
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,130
It feels like a ghost will come out if all the lights are out.

19
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,650
Goodness, you took off all your clothes.

20
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,500
Your room has a draft.

21
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,030
Come here, come here.

22
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,130
Come on, hurry up and come here!

23
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,840
Whoa, they prepared a feast here.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,060
Is a different chef in charge of the queen's pavilion?

25
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,140
What do you say to some alcohol?

26
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,600
How many tables is that?

27
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,980
His Majesty must be craving alcohol.

28
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,630
What if he gets too drunk and falls asleep?

29
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,660
What do we do?

30
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,170
Why the long face?

31
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,840
Do you want a drink, too?

32
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,730
Yes.

33
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,580
I want to drink until I cannot drink anymore.

34
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,290
You do?

35
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,150
You are serious, huh?

36
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,140
You do not even like drinking. What is wrong?

37
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,600
You need alcohol to heat up the mood.

38
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:23,940
♫  The feelings seeped through the hidden opening  ♫

39
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,130
♫  Closing up and withering away  ♫

40
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,200
 How can one be so clumsy? 

41
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,650
 I have never really done much sewing. 

42
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,160
 Is it because you became an assassin at a young age? 

43
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,970
 That is one reason. 

44
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,920
 It is because I do not like sewing. 

45
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,800
 Even if you do not like it, 

46
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,600
 are you saying you went around 

47
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,110
 like a daredevil when your clothes got a tear? 

48
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,160
 No way. 

49
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,750
 I have a close friend named Ha Rang. 

50
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,310
 He liked sewing so he always fixed my clothes, too. 

51
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,560
Is it sewing that he likes, or is it you, Yeon—

52
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,620
♫  Making me sad  ♫

53
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,430
Are you jealous right now?

54
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,060
Does that hurt?

55
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,860
Gosh, what is so funny?

56
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,450
I am not sure.

57
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,830
I just feel like laughing.

58
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,840
Whoa, My Queen, you are a good drinker.

59
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
We should drink together like this more often.

60
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,210
There. Take a shot.

61
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,540
Your Majesty.

62
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,410
It has been a year since I came to the palace.

63
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,100
Do you know today is the first day ever...

64
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,190
you sat with me to drink like this?

65
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,450
During all this time,

66
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,360
I spent every night in loneliness and...

67
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,410
it only got better at drinking.

68
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,120
I am sorry. Okay?

69
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,210
We will drink like this more often and stuff. Okay?

70
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,910
I am really...

71
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,520
My life is really...

72
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,810
full of sadness.

73
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,500
After burying the person I miss...

74
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,490
in my heart like this...

75
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,370
I am really...

76
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,540
Look, Queen.

77
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,800
If living is such a pain,

78
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,940
what do you think about just leaving now?

79
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,820
Along with the person you miss.

80
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,410
By the way, Your Majesty.

81
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,830
Yes.

82
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,280
You kind of seem...

83
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,240
quite different today.

84
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,000
I do?

85
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,840
Well, I am sure I am cooler than I was the past few days.

86
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,000
That must be why I look different.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,270
That is not exactly the case.

88
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,730
That is not the case?

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,240
A little...

90
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,880
No, a lot.

91
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,270
You look a lot different.

92
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,400
Something is...

93
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,380
Something is...

94
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,090
Something is?

95
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,290
Your Majesty.

96
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,480
You see, I am...

97
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,890
I am really sorrowful.

98
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,810
I am...

99
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,460
I am really...

100
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,100
really...

101
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,230
R-Really?

102
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,220
Really...

103
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,080
Q-Queen— Oh, goodness!

104
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,920
Queen.

105
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,510
 - How dare you, Ak Hee!  
 - Gosh.

106
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,370
Seriously.

107
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,490
Ak Hee, come here right now.

108
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,800
Ak Hee! Ak Hee!

109
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,300
I don't want to.

110
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,610
Hold on.

111
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,430
I am sure it is here somewhere.

112
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,250
Ak Hee, did he really sleep with the queen?

113
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,720
Yeon Wol, how are you doing?

114
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,450
Are you really thinking Ak Hee is me?

115
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,780
Oh, well...

116
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,660
The queen fell asleep.

117
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,400
Nothing happened, though. Right?

118
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,570
Nothing happened, I said.

119
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,900
I-I need to have a word with you.

120
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,660
Let me say it one more time.

121
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,810
Nothing happened with the queen.

122
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,850
The queen got too drunk and fell asleep early.

123
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,570
That is not good.

124
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,420
You should have slept with her.

125
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,390
A-Are you serious?

126
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,330
You wished for something to happen between the queen and me?

127
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,030
Are you okay with me, the one you love, embracing another woman?

128
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,500
Wait!  You even came to the drapery because you were concerned.

129
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,550
You said you were glad I refused to sleep with her,

130
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,460
but that I still shouldn't have done so, not making any sense.

131
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,800
But how could you—

132
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,140
You are hot.

133
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,860
You are hot enough to burn me.

134
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,300
You are not His Majesty.

135
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,510
You are Sir Ak Hee.

136
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,530
Wait.

137
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,510
What do you mean?

138
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,890
His body is not hot like this.

139
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,860
It is very cold.

140
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,310
He does not call me Kyera.

141
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,600
 Now, I realize you came to prepare your heart, Kyera. 

142
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,810
Most of all, he would not sleep with the queen just to hurt my feelings.

143
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,400
Kyera, are you saying I can just embrace other women

144
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,630
when I am not Sajo Hyeon, huh?

145
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:36,340
Because it is me, huh? It does not matter because I am just Ak Hee?

146
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,990
That was why you were there as the queen's palace lady? To mock me?

147
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,880
I did not volunteer to be there. It was Her Majesty's order.

148
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,370
Are you someone who would willingly obey just because you were ordered to do so?

149
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,350
Sir Ak Hee, this is not the time to be doing this.

150
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,110
You must unite with His Majesty.

151
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,750
You know Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is always looking for a chance to take the throne.

152
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,200
I have no interest in such things!

153
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,370
Half-wit is taking my woman from me.

154
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,730
Would I have the mind to care for such things?

155
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,130
I liked the woman first before Sajo Hyeon did.

156
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,520
It is the woman who liked me first before liking Sajo Hyeon!

157
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,610
Everything is up to you, Kyera, so...

158
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,380
like me and me only, please.

159
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,030
Look my way only. Please come back to me like before!

160
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,510
 Excuse me, Sir Ak Hee. 

161
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,300
 I know you help me and treat me well. 

162
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,060
 I am thankful for that. However... 

163
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,500
 But the thing is... 

164
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,590
 You never had feelings for me... 

165
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,120
 ...as your lover? 

166
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,470
 Right? 

167
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,300
 I am sorry. 

168
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,500
 That is not true. 

169
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,100
 That cannot be. 

170
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,900
 I know it. 

171
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,630
 Fill this up first, please. 

172
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:19,940
♫  The moment the flowers bloom again after this winter  ♫

173
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,540
 I know you like me, Kyera. 

174
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,760
 I clearly felt it. 

175
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,600
 That must be because I thought you were His Majesty, Sir Ak Hee. 

176
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,870
 I am sorry. 

177
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,740
You never had feelings for me?

178
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,900
Never?

179
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,900
Never.

180
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,230
Your Majesty!

181
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,330
- Your Majesty. 
 - Your Majesty.

182
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,280
When did His Majesty leave?

183
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,950
T-The thing is, I fell asleep by accident—

184
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,270
How foolish!

185
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,080
My apologies, Your Majesty.

186
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,940
Where did Yeon Wol go?

187
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,010
His Majesty ordered her to get back to laundry duty.

188
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,430
What did you say? Bring her back here right now!

189
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,510
T-The thing is...

190
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,040
What are you waiting for?

191
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,260
His Majesty ordered her not to be brought back.

192
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,340
He said it was a royal decree. So that is that.

193
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,920
What did you say?

194
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,570
Get out! Get out!

195
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,090
Get out!

196
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,200
- Get out! Get out! 
 - My apologies, Your Majesty.

197
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,520
- Noh Ri Sa. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,140
Did you not see a golden dagger that was here?

199
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,770
Pardon?

200
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,970
Did His Majesty take it?

201
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,980
Your Majesty, please give your order.

202
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,360
You know, right?

203
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,570
- Sorry? 
 - Gosh, I know you realized I am Ak Hee.

204
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,860
I-Is that so?

205
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,580
"Is that so?"

206
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,400
Sajo Hyeon lasted about five days. Right?

207
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,060
At least for 10 days,

208
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,980
I am not going to sleep.

209
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,060
So, keep that in mind and behave accordingly.

210
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

211
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,710
In that case, when you slept with the queen last night...

212
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,170
which one of you was...

213
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,060
You want to know?

214
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,370
I am not telling you.

215
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,940
Ji Jeon Seo, bring me Cheong Ta right now.

216
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,280
Cheong Ta keeps changing her location, avoiding me.

217
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,520
Find a way.

218
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,890
Do whatever it takes and bring Cheong Ta in front of me. Okay?

219
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,310
I have more than a couple of things to discuss.

220
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

221
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,090
Ji Jeon, be careful and come back quickly.

222
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,020
Yes.

223
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,190
All hail His Majesty!

224
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,740
T-That hurts.

225
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,210
All right, good morning.

226
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,490
Your Majesty, I heard there is something to celebrate from last night.

227
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,410
Congratulations on spending the night with Her Majesty the Queen.

228
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,250
 Congratulations, Your Majesty! 

229
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,160
Gosh. What a fuss.

230
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,300
W-Where did we get to last time?

231
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,120
- It is this one. 
 - I see.

232
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,460
 He did not bring his personal notebook? 

233
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:31,780
Your Majesty, your loyal subjects quarreled to no end regarding the issue of tax,

234
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,110
but it looks like we will need to take our time—

235
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,150
- Your Majesty! 
 - You really do not listen, huh?

236
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,060
Your Majesty!

237
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,260
This is a royal decree.

238
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,880
Everything I ordered the last few days, start enforcing them right away!

239
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,900
Your Majesty, I beg you to reconsider one more time.

240
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,480
Reconsider my foot!

241
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,910
Those who do not listen to my orders, I will behead—

242
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,380
- Your Majesty! 
  - Your Majesty! 

243
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,980
 Sir Ak Hee, this is not the time to be doing this. 

244
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,990
 You must unite with His Majesty. 

245
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,890
W-Well, not to that extent.

246
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,070
Here.

247
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,820
T-Thank you for your grace.

248
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,330
You will be severely rebuked, so keep that in mind.

249
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,140
All right?

250
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:42,540
Oh, and also, you can take care of the rest, Head Minister.

251
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,430
Your Majesty, this humble one advised you so many times, did I not?

252
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,030
There is nothing to be gained from getting on the ministers' bad side.

253
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,060
I am sure the ministers also have nothing to gain from getting on my bad side.

254
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,740
Your Majesty, you must adhere to this humble one's loyal advice.

255
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,550
Within the palace, this humble one and the queen

256
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,540
are the only people you can trust and rely on.

257
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,180
Trust and rely on?

258
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,810
Based on what?

259
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,930
Do you think I am oblivious to your hidden intention to manipulate me

260
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,720
from behind the scenes to wield unmatched power and authority?

261
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,870
- Your Majesty— 
 - Also,

262
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,120
please stop asking to see me separately from now on.

263
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,790
You nag at everything and

264
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,880
I am getting sick of it.

265
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,380
Goodness, I get dizzy from it. I also get a runny nose.

266
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,830
 He is different. 

267
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,020
 He is different from yesterday's Sajo Hyeon. 

268
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,980
Palace Lady Yeon!

269
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,750
Thanks to you, I got the sweetest sleep last night.

270
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,410
Oh, and also, this part does not twitch anymore.

271
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:57,240
After getting needle therapy from Palace Lady Yeon, I am full of yang energy all of a sudden!

272
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:05,170
Oh, right. Looks like all the women in the amusement troupe left the palace?

273
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,220
There was a girl who was close to me, but I have not seen her at all these days.

274
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,350
They must have left for their hometowns.

275
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,980
Because His Majesty ordered their release.

276
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,000
Some are still staying here, though.

277
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,110
I am sure about ten will be leaving the night after tomorrow.

278
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,090
I happened to be on night watch that day.

279
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,490
Why do they always send them out at night instead of during the day??

280
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,030
I really do not understand!

281
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,280
How weird.

282
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,770
Why are the amusement troupe's women sent out at night?

283
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,400
His Majesty permitted it already.

284
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,330
There must be a reason to send them out secretly.

285
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,830
Hong Goon.

286
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,400
You can send a word as I told you. Right?

287
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,740
To Master Yang?

288
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,660
Why do you spend all day doing the laundry?

289
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,120
Court Lady.

290
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,740
Go to the queen's pavilion right now. She is looking for you.

291
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,420
Unni was told to work at the laundry from now—

292
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,840
She is just looking for her! That is all!

293
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,880
Hurry up and go!

294
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,630
My Queen.

295
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,180
Is it because you spent the night with His Majesty last night?

296
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,340
You are shining brightly today.

297
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,360
Just look at your glowing skin.

298
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,960
Is that so?

299
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,290
Should we be expecting some good news?

300
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,720
Who knows?

301
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,340
It does feel quite different today.

302
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,890
Gosh, that cannot be!

303
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,400
You cannot tell right away like that.

304
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,780
I know well because I experienced it—

305
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,240
Did you call for me?

306
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,050
Oh, my, Consort Hyo!

307
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,660
How did you end up upside down like this?

308
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,640
Foolish ones who mess up their own lives are hopeless.

309
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,370
Come here and massage me.

310
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,020
I am sore all over.

311
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,680
All over?

312
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,820
How rough was it for you last night?

313
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,540
That was why you said it feels different, huh?

314
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,510
 Huh? Is it Sir? 

315
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,080
 Wait. 

316
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,740
 Why is he so angry? 

317
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,480
 Yoong, you are here? 

318
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,100
 Oh, okay. 

319
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,380
 - This is the last time. 
 - Yes, thank you so much. Take care— 

320
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,770
 - T-Take care, Yoong. I will pay you back! 
 - That old man 

321
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,010
 looks a lot like Sir. 

322
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,410
 Is it his father? 

323
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,930
 But his appearance is too... 

324
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,180
 Could it be his brother, then? 

325
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,610
It feels refreshing just to watch you do that.

326
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,980
It feels like my own bones are melting away.

327
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,860
Consort Cheong Myeong, you should also call this girl from time to time for a massage.

328
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,830
Gosh, am I allowed to do that, Queen?

329
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,410
Where on Earth did Ak Hee go this time?

330
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,440
Huh?

331
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,250
- Gosh, g-get out of the way, please. 
 - Huh?

332
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,710
W-Why are there so many leaves?

333
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,170
Huh?

334
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,900
Gosh, seriously! My goodness.

335
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,840
Sir Ak Hee!

336
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,690
What are you doing here?

337
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,240
H-Hey, what is it?

338
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,690
I got the word from Ji Jeon.

339
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,330
He said he would come to the palace with Cheong Ta as soon as the sunset.

340
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,360
 Go redo them! 

341
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,710
Oh, okay.

342
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,630
Also, Her Majesty has taken back Yeon Wol!

343
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,630
Gosh, seriously, I said okay—

344
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,240
Why are you telling me this now?

345
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,520
B-Be careful, careful!

346
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,920
C-Careful, be careful—

347
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,920
Gosh, I did not even know that and was waiting here forever!

348
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,110
I thought you ordered her not to be taken to the queen's pavilion.

349
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,920
How come Her Majesty defied a royal decree and did that?

350
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,370
Gosh, the queen, seriously.

351
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,150
P-Please be careful, careful.

352
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,900
 You never had feelings for me? 

353
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,140
 I am sorry. 

354
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,010
It cannot be helped, then.

355
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,130
I should not keep interfering with the Inner Court's matter.

356
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,700
Let her be.

357
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,840
Sorry?

358
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,570
Yeon Wol is working without a break all day!

359
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,620
She even chops firewood on top of cleaning and laundry!

360
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,810
It is fine, okay?

361
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,330
Kyera has always been physically strong.

362
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,190
She will do well.

363
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,760
Gosh, I am so hungry and want some wheat porridge.

364
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,850
Along with some boiled potatoes.

365
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,140
W-Wait, wheat porridge, and potatoes—

366
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,900
Y-Your Majesty—

367
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,010
You were really born for this, huh?

368
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,180
Forget it, and go get some water now.

369
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,790
It is for Her Majesty's evening bath.

370
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,420
Her Majesty baths three times a day?

371
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,090
Yes.

372
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,770
And you are the one getting the water for all three.

373
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,200
 My Lady, I got your letter. 

374
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,030
Gosh, what do I do? Where did she go?

375
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,380
 A woman disappeared from the village of Honjeomi. 

376
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,800
 Four days ago as well. 

377
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,940
 They say she must have gone missing 

378
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,090
 in the mountains or was devoured by a beast. 

379
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,550
 Similar things are happening in other villages. 

380
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,590
 Something is not right. 

381
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,150
Wait, please spare me.

382
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,010
Give it to me.

383
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,010
So why would you—

384
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,150
Oh, sorry.

385
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,100
Wait! I am really sorry. I was only trying to help.

386
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,200
Please go back now. Somebody might see us.

387
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,410
I told Eunuch Neung to keep a watch.

388
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,900
Sir Ak Hee!

389
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,180
As always, a person needs to know how to use their brain.

390
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,020
Look right here.

391
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,960
One, two, three.

392
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,350
We are carrying three whole buckets.

393
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,560
You cannot say anything because I am laughing like this. Right?

394
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:43,140
I am different from Sajo Hyeon, who is always grumpy. Right?

395
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,180
Oh, the village of Imsoba we went to before.

396
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,070
We went there before?

397
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,340
The tavern—

398
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,620
You are confusing me for Sajo Hyeon right now?

399
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,100
It could happen.

400
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,290
I will not take it personally.

401
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,260
Look.

402
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,470
S-Sajo Hyeon and I are not much different. Right?

403
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,250
A few women from that village were taken as amusement troupe members.

404
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,040
But they did not come back yet.

405
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,700
And two women disappeared recently.

406
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,950
In my opinion, I think these events are related.

407
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,940
This is how you discussed things with Sajo Hyeon, huh?

408
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,770
Sir Ak Hee, I feel something else is going on.

409
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,500
And they seem to be related to Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

410
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,340
Right.

411
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,840
That is why...

412
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,470
Let us leave together.

413
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,360
Sorry?

414
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,190
Sajo Yoong and this damn palace are getting on my nerves.

415
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,080
So let us get away from here. Okay?

416
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,110
You know I have no interest in being a king.

417
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,280
I will take care of Sajo Hyeon on my end.

418
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,920
Sir Ak Hee!

419
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
How can you—

420
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,260
Even if you are not the owner of this body, how can you say that?

421
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,040
What is the reason I came back here?

422
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,360
What is the reason I am going through all this?

423
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,320
To help His Majesty set this country right and—

424
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,630
You mean you want to be by Sajo Hyeon's side.

425
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,720
Even going through all this trouble.

426
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,700
I had forgotten about that fact.

427
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,420
 (Sir Ak Hee, someone is coming.) 

428
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,590
 (Come back.) 

429
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,980
Sir Ak Hee.

430
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,260
Please help His Majesty.

431
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,400
I am begging you.

432
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,310
I do not want to.

433
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,170
Sir Ak Hee!

434
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,680
I came to give this to her and...

435
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,810
I am sure Kyera is hungry.

436
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,300
 Goodness, you took off all your clothes. 

437
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,900
 Your room has a draft. Say, "ah." 

438
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,410
It was different...

439
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,900
to call it madness.

440
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,680
You still could not find a way to seal Sajo Hyeon?

441
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,650
Why are you so incompetent?

442
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:37,040
Gosh, I need to find a new shaman or something.

443
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,620
Finding a needle in the desert.

444
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:49,890
In this world, there are as many shamans as grains of sand.

445
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:53,690
But I must say a powerful shaman

446
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,570
like myself does not exist anywhere else, in my opinion.

447
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,940
Why would they not exist?

448
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,250
I heard there is a couple in Jinhoi up north from here!

449
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,350
I cannot go there right now because I am busy.

450
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,380
Sir Ak Hee,

451
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:15,310
even so, thanks to His Majesty Sajo Hyeon having broken bonghamsal,

452
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,100
you got to come back to the world like this.

453
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,820
Too much greed always calls for trouble.

454
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,860
You should get on good terms like before and share the body—

455
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,930
Sajo Hyeon and I cannot be on good terms!

456
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,290
He took my woman from me!

457
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:40,600
How can I just watch them being all lovey-dovey?

458
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,580
I see...

459
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,360
There is something.

460
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,410
What do you mean?

461
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,550
Huh?

462
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,270
Is there something on my face?

463
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,600
Stay still.

464
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,410
This is too close—

465
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,540
Gosh, there is nothing!

466
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,110
Well, I will be off now.

467
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,960
Gosh, poor Sir Ak Hee.

468
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,050
Try to hang in there as long as you can

469
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,130
until the full moon rises again.

470
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,570
Gosh, seriously!

471
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,150
- Until it— 
 - We need to go now!

472
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,190
Cheong Ta, come—

473
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,830
Until the full moon rises?

474
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,730
Gosh, that idiot, seriously!

475
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,120
You idiot, why would you suddenly come out at that moment?

476
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,590
Should I do something to this mouth—

477
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,000
Sir Ak Hee is so pitiful!

478
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,720
My goodness.

479
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,350
You feel sorry for everyone!

480
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,710
I am the most pitiful one.

481
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,960
I need to hurry along.

482
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,280
Wait! What is going on?

483
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,760
Huh? What is it now?

484
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,350
My Ji Jeon Seo.

485
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:40,410
I am going to see him before I go, even if it is from afar.

486
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,410
Pardon my intrusion.

487
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,330
I am Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

488
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,330
I hear you provide wise advice to His Majesty.

489
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:01,760
Could I invite you for some tea?

490
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,530
I went through a lot to get this tea when I visited Jinhoi as an ambassador.

491
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,720
I hear it helps women cultivate pure energy.

492
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,760
Oh, my.

493
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,960
Looks like this tea will do you no good, Ms. Cheong Ta.

494
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,920
Because you are already this beautiful.

495
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,040
Ms. Cheong Ta,

496
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,120
could you share your wisdom with me as well?

497
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,200
Wisdom?

498
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,110
Please become my strategist.

499
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,310
I-I am...

500
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,460
How beautiful.

501
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,620
I am pleading with you.

502
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,850
Your Majesty!

503
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,340
Your Majesty! Oops...

504
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,780
Your Majesty, this is terrible!

505
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,640
Your Majesty! Oh, my goodness-

506
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,460
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

507
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,000
This is terrible!

508
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,410
The ministers... The ministers have...

509
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,060
Your Majesty.

510
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,340
This has ended up happening in the end.

511
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,250
What shall we do now?

512
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,440
They are going to protest until I take back the royal decree?

513
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,280
It is not just the ministers.

514
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,950
Other officials are also showing signs of collective action.

515
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,410
Your Majesty, you should first console them calmly—

516
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,500
- Your Majesty! 
 - Oh?

517
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,110
You want to test me out. Right?

518
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,800
 Your Majesty! 

519
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,890
You must be trying to tame me like this,

520
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,330
but it will not work.

521
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,550
All right, let us start the countdown.

522
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,500
The last one kneeling wins!

523
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,400
Your Majesty, I am worried it will affect your health!

524
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,650
What are you all doing?

525
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,150
Will you be so disloyal to His Majesty?

526
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,180
Do you people truly not fear the heavens?

527
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,880
Your Majesty.

528
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,360
What are you all doing?

529
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,980
Escort His Majesty right now!

530
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,610
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

531
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,960
Do not come close to me!

532
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,140
I will take down whoever comes close to me right there and then.

533
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,750
Your Majesty, please forgive us!

534
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:13,100
- Please take back your decree, Your Majesty! 
  - Your Majesty! 

535
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,810
 Please take it back! 

536
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,000
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Please mind your health, Your Majesty! 

537
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,450
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Please forgive our disloyal acts! 

538
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,370
 Your Majesty! 

539
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,000
What is this? You are leaving already?

540
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,410
What can you even protest against this way?

541
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,970
Please dry yourself.

542
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,410
Gosh, I said I was fine!

543
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,250
Kyera.

544
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,520
What do you think? I am cool. Right?

545
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,000
Sir Ak Hee, this is not the way.

546
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,130
Why? They all tucked their tails and went back.

547
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,410
The ministers went back like that today,

548
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,270
but they will never back down so easily.

549
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,690
Because their concessions are at stake.

550
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,550
I know.

551
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,020
I will never back down, either.

552
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,920
Please use a different method.

553
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,330
You need to be wise, especially at a time like this.

554
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:31,960
Are you saying Sajo Hyeon would have dealt with them wisely or something?

555
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,820
- Sir Ak Hee— 
 - It is Your Majesty to you.

556
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,780
You are only a palace lady, so how dare you call my name.

557
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,210
This method is bad, and that method is bad as well.

558
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:21,730
"This is not the way. Please help His Majesty."

559
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,480
Why is it Sajo Hyeon and not me?

560
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,470
Why? Why?

561
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,560
That feels great, so great.

562
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,600
How can your fingertips be so sweet?

563
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,590
For Grand Prince Yoong, someone like Consort Hyo—

564
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,820
That is incorrect.

565
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:51,590
He needs to find a woman with sweet fingertips like you.

566
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:58,010
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is a generous person, so he will find a good spouse.

567
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,980
Do you know about Grand Prince Yoong?

568
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,250
A little bit.

569
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,100
He helped me, who was raised an orphan, in many ways.

570
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,410
I am thankful to him.

571
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,940
My Yoong is a great person.

572
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,550
He helps people a lot here and there.

573
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,390
Yes.

574
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,910
His uncle was very handsome, too.

575
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,340
His uncle?

576
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:31,110
I saw the two of them meet up a few times long ago.

577
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,550
They looked so much alike, so I thought he was his father back then.

578
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,470
Not knowing Grand Prince Yoong was such a prestigious person.

579
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:45,310
 Yoong has been in touch with his biological father? 

580
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,540
Look over here...

581
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,540
Yeon Wol.

582
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,970
You better not talk about this anywhere else.

583
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,380
I will not let you be.

584
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,550
Do you understand?

585
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,310
I will keep that in mind.

586
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,120
What brings you here?

587
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,500
Her Highness Consort Cheong Myeong called for me.

588
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,190
I am on my way back after taking care of her discomfort.

589
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,640
Serves you right.

590
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,360
What made you end up in this state?

591
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,840
Is it love for Sajo Hyeon or

592
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,800
is it self-blame for failing to exact your revenge?

593
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,200
What made you end up this way, Grand Prince?

594
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,500
Is it greed for power or...

595
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,100
- is it feeling of inferiority? 
 - What did you say?

596
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:53,970
This is how you repay me for raising and taking care of you after you became an orphan?

597
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,340
I had thought I was indebted.

598
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,020
Until I found out you sponsored the Wind Knives with an impure motive, that is.

599
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,020
Until I realized you tried to kill me, that is.

600
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,120
Kyera,

601
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,290
I do not wish to hurt you.

602
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,680
However, as long as you are here,

603
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,770
I cannot help but eliminate you.

604
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,790
Leave.

605
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,170
I am not afraid.

606
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,940
Mother,

607
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,960
do not call for that girl ever again.

608
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,870
Do not even talk to her, either.

609
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,420
Do you understand?

610
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,090
I understand.

611
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:39,290
You have not come to see your mother for a long time, but here you go, scolding me again.

612
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,380
You are really mean, Grand Prince Yoong.

613
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,440
B-Because of you, Mother...

614
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,140
I am always on my toes.

615
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,540
I will be careful.

616
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,740
By the way, Yoong,

617
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:11,620
that girl knows your father.

618
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,460
Of course, she thinks he is your uncle.

619
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,700
 Kyera, I cannot keep you alive anymore. 

620
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,540
 Hurry up and come! 

621
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,530
 Some are still staying here, though. 

622
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,870
 I am sure about 10 will be leaving the night after tomorrow. 

623
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,330
 You have to hurry up and go! 

624
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,590
 - Bye! 
 - Take care. 

625
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,080
 Why are they being sent out in groups? 

626
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,460
All right, take care and be happy.

627
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,060
 - Please take care, Sir.  
 - Yes.

628
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,100
Kyera, I am sorry about earlier.

629
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,900
Kyera, I am sorry. Okay?

630
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,910
How lame.

631
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,320
Just go, all right?

632
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,430
Just go to her.

633
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,070
It was my fault.

634
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,960
I am sorry, I—

635
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,000
Kyera?

636
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,890
Hall of Spirits.

637
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:44,930
Since the old times, it has been a place where begrudged palace ladies come to end their lives.

638
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,750
Kyera,

639
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:53,100
it is the perfect place for you to end this life.

640
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,330
This is not how I wished to end our relationship.

641
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,130
I am sorry.

642
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,840
Gosh, why would you do something you are sorry for?

643
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,200
Kyera.

644
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,640
Gosh, seriously, you are really a hassle.

645
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,980
Sajo Hyeon.

646
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,050
I can tell clearly now.

647
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,770
You are not Sajo Hyeon.

648
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,620
What bullshit. Are you not Sajo Yoong, then?

649
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,440
You are an evil spirit.

650
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,260
The parasitic evil spirit in Sajo Hyeon's body.

651
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,610
Ak Hee, be gone with Sajo Hyeon!

652
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,380
You cannot!

653
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,100
It is not the time yet.

654
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,230
Not yet.

655
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,610
The soldiers are on their way,

656
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:09,340
so get lost before matters get worse.

657
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,960
Kyera.

658
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,180
Your Majesty?

659
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,670
Yeon Wol!

660
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,820
I missed you.

661
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,600
I missed you, too.

662
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,700
Your Majesty?

663
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,590
Your Majesty.

664
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,170
How mean.

665
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,890
Where is Sajo Yoong?

666
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,930
You told me not to kill him.

667
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,850
I sent him back in one piece.

668
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,480
I was going to move you to your room as well,

669
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,410
but it seemed safer for you to be there.

670
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,710
Are you okay—

671
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,550
Kyera.

672
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,020
Leave right now.

673
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,850
I cannot do that.

674
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:54,010
How can I leave after seeing Grand Prince Sajo Yoong go crazy like that?

675
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,540
I cannot stand it anymore.

676
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,360
I cannot bear to watch you

677
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,470
risk your life trying to save Sajo Hyeon anymore.

678
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,570
Leave.

679
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,580
I cannot leave, at least not now.

680
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,500
If you will leave,

681
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,610
I will unite with Sajo Hyeon and do my best.

682
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,800
You said your wish is to set this country right.

683
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,660
I will help Sajo Hyeon to make your wish come true. Instead,

684
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,160
leave.

685
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:29,250
I cannot watch you and Sajo Hyeon getting closer and loving anymore.

686
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,870
Can you promise me?

687
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,630
I promise you.

688
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,390
Just leave, please just go!

689
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,160
Well, then.

690
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,590
I will leave after I see His Majesty come back.

691
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:52,900
I will not go to him and be friendly.

692
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:58,540
I will only see him come back from afar and go my way.

693
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,440
You are going to see Sajo Hyeon's face before you leave?

694
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,860
Even to the end, seriously.

695
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,350
How moving.

696
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,680
Do not go, then.

697
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,120
Just stay here and watch how I interfere with Sajo Hyeon.

698
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,140
Because I am going to foil every single one of his plans.

699
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,190
I will leave.

700
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:39,390
Please tell His Majesty farewell.

701
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,000
Hold on.

702
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,870
It is yours.

703
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,020
Thank you.

704
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,920
 I claimed this first. 

705
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,630
 I ordered it first. 

706
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:44,010
♫  I will come and meet you  ♫

707
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,400
 I know how you feel. 

708
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,150
 Just how much you miss Sajo Hyeon. 

709
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:54,040
 Because I was the same. 

710
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,650
 Because I missed you so much, too. 

711
00:59:55,650 --> 01:00:02,800
♫  When I am reminded of you in my white dream  ♫

712
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:08,070
♫  Please embrace me in your arms  ♫

713
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:12,550
♫  I will reach for you  ♫

714
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,990
 Although... 

715
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:18,900
 it is a great pain for me that 

716
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,610
 you love Sajo Hyeon, not me, 

717
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:26,790
 it is more painful to see your heart suffer. 

718
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:33,510
♫  The moment flowers bloom again, I will come to you  ♫

719
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:37,010
 I will let you meet that punk. 

720
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,460
♫  Just for a moment  ♫

721
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:47,470
♫  If time will stop like this forever  ♫

722
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:52,950
♫  Tears keep rolling down  ♫

723
01:00:52,950 --> 01:01:01,360
♫  Are you also like me? My feelings will not change  ♫

724
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:08,800
♫  I will now reach for you  ♫

725
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:26,090
Sir Ak Hee.

726
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,380
Yeon Wol.

727
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,690
Your Majesty?

728
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,350
Yeon Wol!

729
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:55,210

730
01:01:55,210 --> 01:02:02,610
♫  Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment  ♫

731
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:08,910
♫  Your warmth remains in my heart  ♫

732
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:16,330
♫  Even if you become wind and cannot hold you  ♫

733
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:21,910
♫  We will always feel each other, the two of us  ♫

734
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:30,540
♫  So that you will not get far, so that we will not be apart even for a moment  ♫

735
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:36,330
♫  Even if I grasp, you become blurry  ♫

736
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:44,600
♫  I'll stay here and wait for you  ♫

737
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:52,960
♫  Even if you disappear again tomorrow, I will wait  ♫

738
01:02:54,020 --> 01:03:01,020
♫  So that I can feel the faint sound of you breathing  ♫

739
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,260
Kyera,

740
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:08,030
farewell.

741
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,340
Be happy.

742
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:23,920
♫  The memories become more and more blurry  ♫

743
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:30,210
♫  Your warm breath remains in my heart  ♫

744
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:37,300
♫  Even if you become wind and cannot hold you  ♫

745
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:43,080
♫  You will keep on living inside me  ♫

746
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:50,760
♫  So that we will not falter, so that we will not shake  ♫

747
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,410
   

748
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:58,260
 I will only look for a way to help and protect you, Your Majesty. 

749
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,640
 I will set everything right without fail. 

750
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,810
 After that, let us be together for sure. 

751
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:08,250
 I cannot serve you anymore, My Lady, for you have abandoned all your duties and 

752
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,770
 grew feelings for your sworn enemy's son. 

753
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:14,400
 Women kidnapped from all over the country are being sold off to Jinhoi. 

754
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,660
 Order the women in this warehouse to be released right now. 

755
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,460
 I will save my people and 

756
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,750
 punish the wicked who sold them off. 

757
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,410
 Burn everything down! 

758
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:25,690
 - Kyera!  
 - What the hell are you doing, Sajo Hyeon?
