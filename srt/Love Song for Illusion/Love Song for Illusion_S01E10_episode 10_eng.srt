 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Troubled HeartsTeam @ Viki.com 

8
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,110
You were alive.

9
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,430
You were alive.

10
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,180
Thank you for staying alive.

11
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,750
Kyera.

12
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,350
You were alive.

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,800
Thank you.

14
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,400
Precious lives were lost because of me.

15
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,540
All of them could have been saved.

16
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,120
But because of their half-witted king...

17
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,180
It is not your fault, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,210
You did your best.

19
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,000
No.

20
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,770
It is my fault.

21
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,680
 If you wear it, you and I will be matching. 

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,730
Nu Ru.

23
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,950
Take this and...

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,940
go to a good place.

25
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,080
In our next lives,

26
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,130
let us really meet as father and daughter.

27
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,340
Nu Ru. Nu Ru.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,030
- You poor thing. 
 - Eunuch Neung.

29
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,280
You poor thing.

30
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,110
Nu Ru!

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,900
Nu Ru!

32
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,730
   

33
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,710
The rescued women were taken to a safe place.

34
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,120
Well done.

35
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,120
I will order them to be taken care of until they can return home.

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
What will you do with the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong?

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,900
He will feign ignorance for sure.

38
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,270
I am sure he will.

39
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,070
It is only right to interrogate him and punish him.

40
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,250
But I will watch closely for a while and look for an opportunity.

41
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,190
It must be because he is closely related to Jinhoi.

42
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,550
Border disputes with Jinhoi are frequent as of now.

43
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,270
So, the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong will surely use it to his advantage.

44
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,490
Did the Defense Minister depart?

45
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,730
Yes, he departed in a hurry.

46
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,660
You will be with the Wind Knives now. Right?

47
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,610
Yes, I will be at a distance where you can call for me.

48
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,510
Thank you.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,510
Everything is meaningless to me if I do not have you.

50
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,010
I cannot live.

51
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,810
It is also the same for me.

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
Please be careful.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,570
You, too, Your Majesty.

54
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,500
Everything is meaningless.

55
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,560
How insignificant.

56
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,940
Since you are not looking my way, Kyera.

57
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,460
K-Kids, help yourselves! There.

58
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,250
You have some, and you have some, too.

59
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,870
 I could not see them before. 

60
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,370
 When I went to and from the drapery just to do what I love, 

61
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,640
 I did not know how painful my people's lives were. 

62
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,380
 I can see them now, my people. 

63
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,460
 I will not forget yesterday. 

64
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,040
 I will never lose my people again. 

65
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,220
 Geez, seriously. 

66
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,090
 Eat! Eat! 

67
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,870
Is it the announcement?

68
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,380
I will go take a look.

69
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,470
This is breaking news!

70
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,790
Terrible news!

71
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,850
They said the king was possessed by an evil spirit!

72
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,030
This is breaking news!

73
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,160
They said the king is possessed by an evil spirit! 
    

74
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,420
Your Majesty, please forgive me for saying—

75
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,660
Did you see it?

76
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,170
Is this what is posted there?

77
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,370
Yes.

78
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,850
Who on Earth could have...

79
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,140
The king is possessed by an evil spirit?

80
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,970
What is this saying?

81
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,020
I will be damned.

82
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,740
- Take them all away! 
  - Yes! 

83
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,050
Search everywhere!

84
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,020
You fool! You half-wit!

85
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,780
You are less than a bug!

86
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:50,720
You did not notice anything until Sajo Hyeon arrived at the port with the Royal Guards?

87
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,170
Are your eyes and ears of no use?

88
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,910
Please have us killed, Grand Prince!

89
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,990
Please have us killed!

90
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,900
Sure.

91
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,920
 Hurry up! 

92
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,460
Was he really...

93
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,100
Sajo Hyeon?

94
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,930
Grand Prince, the Minister of Defense and the Royal Guards attacked our secret fort.

95
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,800
Is that so?

96
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,020
Bring out the criminals in the prison to the interrogation grounds right now.

97
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,310
Yes, Grand Prince.

98
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,370
Follow me!

99
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,830
You, scoundrels, confess the truth!

100
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,200
How could we have sold off the amusement troupe's women?

101
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,300
I have never heard of this!

102
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,660
Everyone, beat them until they confess the truth!

103
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,610
 Yes! 

104
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,000
All hail His Majesty!

105
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,440
Have you arrived, Your Majesty?

106
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,680
What is the meaning of all this?

107
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,870
I am quite sorry to inform you,

108
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,910
but I found out they sold the amusement troupe's women to Jinhoi.

109
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,050
Hence, I arrested all the relevant individuals for interrogation.

110
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,420
These men are innocent.

111
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:50,900
You also know well who led the trafficking of our women. Do you not, Grand Prince?

112
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,270
Who might this person be?

113
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,560
Halt the interrogations right away and let these men go!

114
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,110
Do you not hear the king's order?

115
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,900
Will you come to your senses only after getting the same beating?

116
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,420
Hurry up and release them!

117
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,300
 In that case, 

118
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,590
are you saying you have nothing to do with this incident, Grand Prince?

119
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,670
I apologize, Your Majesty.

120
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,040
My crime for not having realized until matters got this bad does deserve death,

121
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,790
but I did not partake in selling those women off to Jinhoi.

122
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,710
Grand Prince,

123
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,770
you are seriously shameless.

124
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,700
How can you get rid of the evidence like this and

125
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,410
lie even in front of me?

126
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,190
Could you be...

127
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,530
talking about what the late king did?

128
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,270
Yes, I could not help but partake in that matter.

129
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:14,100
You also know how I had to take all the blame for the late king's wrongdoings.

130
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,310
- Grand Prince Sajo Yoong— 
 - Your Majesty.

131
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:22,400
If you continue to mention this matter, you are insulting the late king and

132
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,320
only amplify the hatred of the people, in my opinion.

133
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:33,410
Not to mention, the people are feeling unsettled because of a wicked rumor about you currently.

134
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,650
A rumor?

135
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,150
Are you talking about this?

136
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,750
   

137
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,220
You ended up seeing it, too, Your Majesty.

138
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Gosh! What kind of a wicked person could have done this?

139
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,980
It is a seriously big trouble, Your Majesty.

140
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,500
That is right.

141
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,150
This is a really big trouble.

142
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:09,580
Because there is a fool who thinks the people can be swayed by something like this.

143
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,760
I will revoke your right to interrogate from this moment.

144
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,430
Take your hands off of all matters you are involved in.

145
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,960
Why are you giving me such orders, Your Majesty?

146
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,350
I cannot entrust the government matters to a delusional liar.

147
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,750
This is unfair, Your Majesty!

148
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,960
Unfair, you say?

149
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,430
What is truly unfair are the innocent people who lost their lives at the port.

150
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,260
Sajo Yoong,

151
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,350
how do you plan to pay for all those sins in the future?

152
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,290
Your Majesty.

153
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,050
I will help you lose all interest in gambling!

154
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,550
Leave your right hand and get lost!

155
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,660
No, no— Please, please!

156
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,200
H-Hold on.

157
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,100
T-Take this hand instead.

158
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,410
Because you cannot gamble without this hand?

159
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,460
That will not work, you idiot!

160
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,360
Clench your teeth tight!

161
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,420
Will this be enough?

162
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,570
How can I ever repay you for this?

163
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,510
T-Though I look like this, I am quite good with my hands.

164
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,200
Please tell me if your roof or chimney ever needs a repair.

165
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,710
I will come right away and—

166
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,360
Huh?

167
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,130
Your son told me to deliver it to you.

168
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,480
My Yoong did?

169
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,850
Yes.

170
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,220
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong did.

171
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,820
His Majesty ordered you not to enter, Grand Prince.

172
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,240
Please wait here.

173
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,610
Move aside.

174
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,610
I apologize.

175
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,720
I know yesterday's atrocity stemmed from the late king's wrongful judgment.

176
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,610
As the late king's son,

177
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,060
I strongly feel the responsibility.

178
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,920
I will cooperate as well so such an incident will never happen again.

179
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,860
So I hope our ministers will also work together.

180
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,120
 Your order has been heard, Your Majesty. 

181
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,870
In addition,

182
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,330
starting today, the Grand Prince Sajo Yoong has been...

183
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,860
resigned from public office.

184
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,390
If there is any minister who made secret dealings with the Grand Prince,

185
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,060
he will surely know the reason.

186
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,560
Once all the truths are uncovered,

187
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,170
I will also rebuke any ministers who are linked.

188
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:15,180
However, if you regret your wrongdoings now and cooperate with me,

189
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,970
I will lighten your sentence, so give it some thought.

190
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,400
 Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty! 

191
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,840
Go on and tell me.

192
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,490
Is the one on the throne really Sajo Hyeon?

193
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,480
He is Sajo Hyeon.

194
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,910
No, no, there is no way.

195
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,270
Sajo Hyeon, the half-wit, cannot be that confident!

196
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,070
But I am sure he is!

197
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,720
Summon the evil spirit right now.

198
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,950
Get rid of Sajo Hyeon.

199
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,650
If you cannot do so,

200
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,010
I will shove this down your throat.

201
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,360
Stop!

202
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,650
 After that day from 10 years ago, 

203
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,590
 I was able to feel the sound of the wind. 

204
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,160
 Is it a gift the pain gave me? 

205
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,310
 I can feel the wind. 

206
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,000
 The trapped wind that stayed in an empty space. 

207
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,090
Break this wall down.

208
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

209
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,630
There is space inside.

210
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,180
You are coming to the palace tomorrow?

211
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,600
His Majesty invited me.

212
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,390
He told me to come right away.

213
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,610
But I said I will come tomorrow because I am tired today.

214
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,720
Prince Ga Ron, there is a trust you and I have built so far.

215
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,480
You accepted His Majesty's invitation without even consulting me?

216
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,300
How can I reject an invitation from Asatae's king?

217
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,080
Do you not know the relationship between Sajo Hyeon and me?

218
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,350
But how could you?

219
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,750
If it is trust you want to build,

220
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,810
you can find this woman for me.

221
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,990
 Kyera. 

222
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,560
I fell for her at first sight.

223
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,290
I just could not forget her, so I told a painter to draw her face.

224
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:37,100
Judging by her beauty, she might have been in the amusement troupe.

225
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,560
Kyera, you even approached Prince Ga Ron?

226
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,170
Find Kyera quickly.

227
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,280
Yes, Grand Prince.

228
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,360
Looks like Hwang Ga Ron is looking for you.

229
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,760
So, what happened?

230
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,600
I only gave him an unforgettable memory.

231
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,530
I know what you are thinking.

232
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,110
You must not do that.

233
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,920
If you want to catch the tiger, you have to run into its den.

234
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,290
Please allow me, Master Yang.

235
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,130
Kyera.

236
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,270
Gosh, seriously.

237
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,440
 The haunted king will 

238
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,160
 be the doom of Asatae! 

239
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,680
   

240
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,570
It is a big problem these rumors keep circulating.

241
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,530
I thought it was only a rumor,

242
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,840
but it was true.

243
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,260
You confirmed it?

244
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,900
Yes.

245
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,700
I saw and heard it with my own eyes and ears.

246
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,570
 By the way, Your Majesty, 

247
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,140
 you kind of seem quite different today. 

248
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,120
 Ak Hee told you to leave. Right? 

249
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,560
 Because he cannot stand us loving each other. 

250
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,850
Were you aware of this already?

251
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,670
 Wait, Sir Ak Hee, when did you come out? 

252
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,480
 Surprised? 

253
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,520
 Because Sajo Hyeon and I switched in broad daylight? 

254
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,330
 Oh, my goodness. 

255
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,610
 This is because His Highness took cold medicine just now. 

256
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,910
 So, you should not have given him cold medicine. 

257
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,870
 Sajo Hyeon fell asleep after taking it, 

258
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,100
 so I came out again. 

259
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,630
 You have been wanting to come out in the morning. Right? 

260
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,950
 Idiot, we switch whenever one sleeps. 

261
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,000
 Also, 

262
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,210
 stop bringing these things! 

263
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,120
 I said I am different from Sajo Hyeon, the half-wit! 

264
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,900
 Gosh, please calm down! 

265
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,470
 Someone will see you! 

266
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,120
 S-Sir Ak Hee! 

267
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,090
Are you saying you already knew about it for a long time, Father?

268
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,120
And you still married me to His Majesty?

269
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,840
To a man possessed by an evil spirit?

270
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,310
Did you forget?

271
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,490
It was what you wanted, Your Majesty.

272
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,080
You said you wanted to become the most powerful woman in Asatae.

273
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,530
You said you do not fear anything to achieve that purpose.

274
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:32,950
Was it just to let me achieve my ambition?

275
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,730
Was it not because of your greed, Father?

276
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,440
Should I have left you be?

277
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,750
Should I have let you fool around with Ji Jeon Seo, who became our servant

278
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,060
after wandering as a vagrant?

279
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,430
Do you see me as such a person?

280
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,480
I am Jin Chae Ryeon, Father.

281
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,260
I am not swayed by mere emotions.

282
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,510
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

283
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,390
If you can really do anything,

284
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:06,620
how are you still unable to win over His Majesty?

285
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,300
Do you really not know you have become a mockery for women inside the palace

286
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,840
after failing to sleep with him last time?

287
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,020
How impertinent, Head Minister!

288
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,770
How dare you speak that way

289
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:26,010
This humble one made you the queen, did I not?

290
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:32,390
You should also repay your father, Queen.

291
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,160
Hurry up and give birth to a son.

292
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,980
That is our only way to survive.

293
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,710
 If something happens to His Majesty before you bear his child, 

294
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:58,440
 you will also not escape a fate similar to that of the 

295
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,520
 forgotten Consort Cheong Myeong. 

296
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,900
Your Majesty.

297
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,520
You said you would not come even if I called for you again.

298
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,880
But you do come.

299
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,590
Please go back to the palace.

300
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,640
I will escort you.

301
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,550
Ji Jeon Seo,

302
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,420
I need you to help me out.

303
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,590
Is something wrong?

304
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:52,150
Help me bear a child.

305
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,840
Y-Your Majesty, how can you say such—

306
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,740
I will take my leave first.

307
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,640
I am going to scream.

308
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,140
The moment you leave this room,

309
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,180
I will say you called me out and tried to rape me.

310
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,130
Do as you please.

311
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,700
I would rather die an unfair death than follow your order.

312
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,890
I apologize, Your Majesty.

313
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,140
Ji Jeon Seo!

314
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,080
Please help me out.

315
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,810
You said you can do anything if it is for my sake.

316
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,340
Please.

317
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,210
Do not do this, My Lady.

318
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,720
I cannot bear to watch you end up in misery.

319
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,230
I apologize.

320
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,320
No, do not do it.

321
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,430
Do not do this.

322
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,600
I will leave.

323
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,460
Hey, Cheong Ta, you can do something like this, too?

324
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,040
Gosh, this is tiring.

325
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,190
I used my last resort.

326
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:20,640
How bad must it be for me to come in like this?

327
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,860
Sir Ak Hee.

328
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:31,610
Can you see the full moon over there?

329
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:42,650
Ten years ago, when you possessed Crown Prince Sajo Hyeon,

330
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,570
that same moon was there.

331
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,860
If we do bonghamsal today,

332
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:55,360
we can seal His Majesty for good, forever.

333
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,710
 You never had feelings for me... 

334
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,000
 as your lover? 

335
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,130
 Right? 

336
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,410
 I am sorry. 

337
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,350
Forget it. I am not doing it.

338
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,830
Come on, Sir Ak Hee.

339
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,210
Look at your body.

340
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,330
It is fading away. Right?

341
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,940
At this rate, you will disappear completely in the end.

342
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,220
And I will disappear, too, on top of that.

343
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,530
I am not doing it.

344
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,220
Let us just disappear. Okay?

345
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,970
Hand in hand, let us disappear together.

346
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,510
We need to survive together.

347
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,700
Right.

348
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,100
You know, yesterday, Kyera was in a really dangerous situation.

349
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,900
So I tried to force my way out to save her.

350
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,290
But why could I not go out?

351
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,380
It worked last time. Right?

352
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,310
Do you really not know the reason?

353
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,960
It is because His Majesty's energy strengthened!

354
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,970
So, you cannot even force your way out anymore.

355
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,850
Oh, is that so?

356
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,820
I guess this is it for me, huh?

357
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,860
Let us go.

358
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,630
I will do bonghamsal for you.

359
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,000
- I am not doing it. 
 - Let us do it.

360
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,500
I am not! I said I am not doing it!

361
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,380
My goodness.

362
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,280
I will wait at the Hall of Spirits.

363
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,950
I trust you will come out.

364
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,600
 Precious lives were lost because of me. 

365
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,080
 All of them could have been saved. 

366
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,510
 But because of their half-witted king... 

367
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,590
 How painful must it be for him? 

368
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,070
♫  I will come and meet you  ♫

369
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,840
♫  I will come to you where you are breathing  ♫

370
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,920
 Your Majesty. 

371
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,500
♫  When I am reminded of you in my white dream  ♫

372
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:15,980
 Your Majesty, I just miss you for no reason tonight. 

373
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:22,060
 Even though I know I cannot meet you just because I go there running, 

374
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,500
 I just want to be near where you are for a moment. 

375
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:33,580
 For no reason. Nothing at all. 

376
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,390
Yeon Wol.

377
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,870
How did you c-come here?

378
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,510
I missed you too much.

379
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,760
I just came without a second thought.

380
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,320
I also missed you too much,

381
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,180
so I just came outside without a second thought.

382
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,150
Yeon Wol.

383
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,900
Your Majesty.

384
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,100
Your heart was heavy. Right?

385
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,200
It was painful, was it not?

386
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,410
I need to overcome it.

387
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,080
I need to endure it and

388
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,580
set right those who hurt us.

389
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,400
You will do that for sure.

390
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,300
You are a beautiful person.

391
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,600
A precious person.

392
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,500
I love you.

393
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,200
I love you.

394
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:17,300
♫  I will reach for you, where you are  ♫

395
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:26,170
♫  With my breath, I will send myself to you  ♫

396
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:33,370
♫  The moment the flowers bloom again after this winter  ♫

397
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:42,330
♫  Embraced in your arms, just for a moment  ♫

398
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:49,410
♫  If time will stop like this forever  ♫

399
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,840
♫  Tears keep rolling down  ♫

400
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,010
I also think of you all the time,

401
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,300
knowing I do not have the right to.

402
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:11,340
♫  My feelings will not change, I will now reach for you  ♫

403
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,970
   

404
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:25,600
And the j-jar next to me, too.

405
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,450
Did Ak Hee say he will come?

406
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,970
He will come.

407
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,260
I am sure.

408
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,630
Your Majesty.

409
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,100
Ak Hee, are you really never going to come outside again?

410
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,860
I need to take a break today, too.

411
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,380
Go outside for a moment and get some air.

412
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,280
And come back if you want. Do as you please.

413
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Do as you please.

414
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,090
I am not going to take your body even if you fall asleep.

415
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,410
So you can rest easy and get a good night's sleep.

416
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,800
What is the matter with you?

417
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,160
You are the one who always said so to me!

418
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,920
That the fake should disappear.

419
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,040
Things ended up the way you wanted.

420
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,990
Why? Did I grow on you or something?

421
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,640
Who knows? I am sure you did grow on me.

422
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,200
I am sorry, but not for me.

423
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,270
Even now, whenever I see you,

424
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,430
I just want to— Gosh.

425
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,700
Is it because of Yeon Wol? I am sorry.

426
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,220
I do not hear you. I cannot hear you.

427
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:36,760
Never say that name with your mouth in front of me again.

428
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,690
Leave.

429
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,900
Ak Hee.

430
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,420
Gosh, I said I was fine! Get lost!

431
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,530
 Sir Ak Hee, this is your last chance. 

432
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,800
 If today passes, 

433
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,910
 your existence will get erased gradually. 

434
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,760
 Come out to the Hall of Spirits. 

435
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,500
 - Your Majesty, what happened— 
 - You may not speak of 

436
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,650
 what happened tonight, even in the afterlife. 

437
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,500
 Forget it. 

438
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,500
 Your Majesty— 

439
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,710
I could not help it.

440
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,210
Because I need to survive.

441
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,940
Because I have to stay alive.

442
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,860
Please...

443
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,690
What is the meaning of this? Why did Ak Hee not come?

444
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,710
W-Well... H-He should. Why is he not coming?

445
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,550
His Majesty went to sleep.

446
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,590
How weird.

447
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,450
Is there no other way besides bonghamsal?

448
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,070
There is none. Not anymore.

449
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,810
I have no more use for you, then.

450
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,530
Open your mouth right now!

451
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,020
There is one! There is one more!

452
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,500
There is one last method.

453
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,000
What is it? Tell me.

454
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,400
To force his way out.

455
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,060
Force his way out?

456
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,980
What do you mean?

457
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,400
That woman, Yeon Wol.

458
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,300
Are you talking about Kyera?

459
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,870
Yes.

460
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:13,270
If that woman is about to lose her life and

461
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,660
if even His Majesty Sajo Hyeon cannot save her,

462
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,180
he might force his way out.

463
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,600
Last time, he—

464
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,000
That is what he did.

465
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,180
To draw Ak Hee out, I need Kyera?

466
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,260
Are you still looking for Kyera?

467
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,700
We are still looking.

468
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,980
Kyera.

469
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,740
Wait.

470
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,980
Ak Hee, you did not...

471
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,330
Move aside!

472
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,700
He is the fourth prince of Jinhoi.

473
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,110
- The fourth prince? 
 - Why did he come?

474
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,460
 Sir, please spare me some change! 

475
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,130
 - Move aside! 
 - Move aside! 

476
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,760
 - Please spare some change!  
 - Get lost!

477
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,690
Let them be!

478
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,660
It is entertaining.

479
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,780
All right, here comes money!

480
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,750
Hey, you!

481
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,300
Do you think we are beggars?

482
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,650
Which one of you? How dare you!

483
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,520
Let him be!

484
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,490
Sir, please spare me some change.

485
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,680
 Please spare me some change. 

486
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,420
There, it is money!

487
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,740
Move aside!

488
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,400
Blood?

489
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,500
G-Goodness, lady.

490
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,700
- Lady, y-you are bleeding. 
 - Blood...

491
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,470
I apologize for asking to see you when you must be busy.

492
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,820
You must be at ease now, Grand Prince.

493
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,970
Since you were relieved of cumbersome governing affairs.

494
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:55,110
It is all thanks to His Majesty's consideration.

495
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,320
Head Minister, do you remember General Yeon Poong Hak?

496
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,010
What do you think caused General Yeon Poong Hak's downfall

497
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,800
when he was reaching new heights every day?

498
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,070
It was his foolishness for failing to recognize the real hero.

499
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:21,400
It is because he could not grab the late king's hand, who was a general at the time.

500
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,250
What are you trying to say?

501
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,610
Right now, it is exactly the same as that time.

502
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,970
I am the late king from that time and

503
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,900
you are General Yeon Poong Hak from that time.

504
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,310
It is still not too late.

505
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,410
You should take my hand.

506
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:43,620
If you do so, even after I take the throne,

507
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:48,720
your daughter will stay as the queen.

508
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,230
Are you saying you will take the queen as your wife,

509
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,400
when she used to be His Majesty's wife?

510
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,640
Of course.

511
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,370
You will continue to stay as the king's father-in-law.

512
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,580
This is so funny that it is making me tear up.

513
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,610
What do you say, Head Minister?

514
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:27,160
I have someone to introduce you to, Grand Prince.

515
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,610
You may come in.

516
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,880
You can recognize who he is, right?

517
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,500
Who is that man?

518
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,270
I have no idea.

519
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:05,180
You cannot recognize him?

520
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,650
You two are so much alike. How could you not recognize him?

521
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,090
You two almost look like a father and a son.

522
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,510
That is a bizarre thing to say, Head Minister.

523
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,290
To have you insult me like this, Head Minister...

524
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,950
I will not forget this.

525
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,570
 Consort Cheong Myeong is coming in. 

526
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,150
Why did you want to see me, Head Minister?

527
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,820
My, Hon—

528
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,590
Grand Prince.

529
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,410
Your family got to reunite after a long time.

530
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,760
So I will go now.

531
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,780
Head Minister!

532
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,020
Grand Prince, you should be the one giving it some thought

533
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,250
about which way to kneel.

534
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,510
However...

535
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,250
do you even qualify to be a grand prince?

536
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,200
Of course, I am—

537
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,050
Jin Mu Dal—

538
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:00,270
Hear ye. Is no one out there?

539
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,720
Yoong, please!

540
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,450
Honey, hurry up and run.

541
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,590
I am sorry!

542
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,960
Y-Yoong, please!

543
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,130
Please spare him for my sake.

544
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,380
- Move aside. 
 - Yoong!

545
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,170
Yoong, he is your father!

546
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,410
Who are you saying is my father?

547
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,150
Who are you saying is my father?

548
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:42,220
That man, who drags me down like a burden! Why is—

549
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,550
Why is he my father?

550
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,360
Why?

551
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,030
I will... I will keep him in check.

552
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:58,290
I will manage him so he does not cause any trouble.

553
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:04,390
If something happens, I will die with him right away.

554
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,400
Just this once. Please ignore him just this once.

555
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,610
Please, Yoong.

556
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,550
Yoong!

557
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,500
Officer Jin, is something wrong?

558
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,910
You are not looking too well.

559
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:35,670
No, Your Majesty.

560
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,390
Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

561
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,860
Prince Ga Ron of Jinhoi has arrived.

562
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,360
Really? I must get changed.

563
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,570
By the way, you will be glad to see who is at your chamber, Your Majesty.

564
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,770
Y-Yeon Wol.

565
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,620
It is great to see you again, Your Majesty.

566
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,560
Yeon Wol.

567
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,340
Wait! You want to meet Hwang Ga Ron?

568
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,680
You cannot.

569
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,350
I cannot use you just to convince him.

570
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,450
I am not being used.

571
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,040
We are joining forces.

572
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,870
Hwang Ga Ron wants to meet me badly, so I will be of use to convince him.

573
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,300
He is after you as a woman, Yeon Wol.

574
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,470
I will not treat him as a woman.

575
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:01,790
More importantly, I have dependable you by my side, Your Majesty.

576
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,310
I am not afraid.

577
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,510
Prince Ga Ron, thank you for accepting my invitation.

578
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,900
I am thankful.

579
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,580
Your palace is gorgeous.

580
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:24,980
I prepared this meeting to have a serious conversation with you.

581
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,640
But I am not sure how you find it.

582
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,700
I like it.

583
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:35,100
First off, I wanted to meet you to tell you two things.

584
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:40,810
Firstly, do not take Asatae's women to Jinhoi ever again.

585
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:44,530
I apologize for what happened at Port Mihwari.

586
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:49,320
Secondly, the border dispute between Asatae and Jinhoi is endless right now.

587
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,490
Please help our two countries sign a peace treaty.

588
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,120
Diplomatic matters are not for me to meddle with.

589
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,590
Innocent women of Asatae lost their lives because of the recent incident.

590
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:08,410
I hope you will feel the responsibility as Jinhoi's prince who is involved in this incident.

591
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:14,530
It looks like you keep connecting that incident and me.

592
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:17,140
But do you even have proof?

593
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,160
 Yes, he does. 

594
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,910
You are—

595
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,730
You live here?

596
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,360
The amusement troupe?

597
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,470
Prince Ga Ron, be careful what you say.

598
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,080
She is someone I love.

599
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,210
Is the back of your neck okay?

600
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,310
 Hurry up and order them. 

601
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,970
 It is hard to take them off with one hand. 

602
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,600
 Hear ye! 

603
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,860
 Yes, Your Highness. 

604
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,280
 Release the women locked up in the basement right now. 

605
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,290
 - Sorry? 
 - Hurry up and let them go right now! 

606
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,030
 Yes, Your Highness, as you command. 

607
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,280
 Hear ye! 

608
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,980
 Happy now? 

609
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,860
 Good job. 

610
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,630
 You like these plays? 

611
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,720
 I like them, too. 

612
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:26,350
Thanks to the back of your neck, the women locked up in the basement were rescued.

613
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,780
These women are the witnesses.

614
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,540
Prince Ga Ron, I plan to officially object to Jinhoi's Royal Family about this matter.

615
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,080
Depending on how well you cooperate with us,

616
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,320
the weight of your responsibility will vary.

617
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:52,990
You see, I only came to have fun sometimes because Grand Prince Sajo Yoong invited me,

618
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,780
and to lend him the warehouse by my villa.

619
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,300
The truth will be uncovered and

620
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,120
other princes who are competing with you

621
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,860
will be very glad to hear this.

622
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:21,180
Kyera, you dared to come into this place.

623
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:28,790
I think the negotiation with Prince Ga Ron went well.

624
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,380
It is thanks to you.

625
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,400
Thank you.

626
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:41,750
I will get going now.

627
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,770
Wind Knives are waiting outside.

628
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,150
We are parting again.

629
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,610
We will meet again.

630
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:58,600
Will you come running again like this, then?

631
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,600
Probably. After holding back as much as I can.

632
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,600
I'll take my leave, now.

633
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,320
Officer Ji, summon Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

634
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

635
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,950
Yeon Wol!

636
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,500
Hong Goon!

637
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,800
Yeon Wol, I could not thank you properly at Port Mihwari.

638
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,940
Thank you so much.

639
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,330
It was really scary, was it not?

640
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:26,560
What about your injury? Is it better now?

641
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,060
Yes.

642
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,550
Yeon Wol!

643
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,510
Yeon Wol.

644
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,980
I am sorry.

645
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,500
Did you want to see me, Your Majesty?

646
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,920
Grand Prince, everything is over now.

647
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,660
The fact you built an army at a secret hideout and

648
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:14,120
kidnapped women from the villages to sell them off to Jinhoi with

649
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,500
the amusement troupe's women as well.

650
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,250
You worked hard to disguise your secret hideout as a warehouse for food supplies.

651
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:26,630
The secret army was made to protect you during an unforeseen event.

652
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:30,390
For confidentiality, it was normally disguised as a food warehouse.

653
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,760
Also, I have no idea about selling the women off to Jinhoi,

654
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,860
as I already told you.

655
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,050
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong!

656
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,100
Do you not fear the heavens?

657
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,590
This is injustice, Your Majesty.

658
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,310
Though I am the son of a concubine,

659
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:57,670
I am still your brother and the late king's oldest son, so how can you be so harsh—

660
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,170
My brother and the oldest son?

661
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:07,160
Are you really of the late king's bloodline?

662
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,120
Your biological father is a man called Pal Cheon, is he not?

663
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:20,240
I gave you a chance to confess for our old times' sake.

664
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,300
Hear ye! Bring Sajo Yoong, the criminal, to the interrogation grounds!

665
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,520
Yes, Your Majesty! Take away the criminal.

666
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,270
 - Yes!  
 - Your Majesty.

667
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,840
Your Majesty, this is unjust.

668
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,070
None of this is true.

669
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:37,590
Your Majesty, please hear me out!

670
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,620
Your Majesty!

671
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,500
Sajo Yoong.

672
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,890
You were clearly found to have plotted a rebellion

673
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:52,040
by building a secret army and organizing the human trafficking of women.

674
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,160
But are you still denying your crimes?

675
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,410
I told you already.

676
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:00,440
All of it is an entrapment!

677
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,100
What a shameless man.

678
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:10,800
Your Majesty, please order the guilty to be interrogated through torture.

679
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,400
Tie down the guilty for torture.

680
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,700
Tie him down!

681
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,440
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

682
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,500
I-I will speak!

683
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,000
I will confess everything!

684
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,270
Your Majesty, I will now confess all the truth.

685
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,600
So, please give me some time.

686
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,960
Your Majesty, there is no need to listen to his pathetic excuses.

687
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,490
It is right to tie him down and interrogate—

688
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:42,240
I am begging you, Your Majesty!

689
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,600
Go ahead.

690
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,290
Thank you for your grace.

691
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,010
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

692
00:57:52,700 --> 00:58:01,200
This humble one, Sajo Yoong, will tell all the ministers here, including the Head Minister,

693
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,520
a very shocking fact!

694
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:09,940
His Majesty, who is sitting there, is...

695
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,230
possessed by an evil spirit.

696
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,700
Sajo Yoong!

697
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,700
How impertinent!

698
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,300
Your Majesty, I have told you already.

699
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,420
There is no need to show mercy for that wicked criminal!

700
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,100
Sajo Yoong.

701
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:43,810
How can you be such a shameless human being?

702
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:46,720
I gave you your last chance,

703
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,140
but how do you still...

704
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:59,060
dare to say I am possessed by...

705
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,700
a-an evil spirit—

706
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,700
 What is going on? 

707
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,900
Your Majesty!

708
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:14,650
Your Majesty, are you feeling unwell?

709
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,760
 I cannot speak. 

710
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:26,850
Did you all see it?

711
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:29,960
Because His Majesty's body is possessed by an evil spirit,

712
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,430
he is acting like that suddenly.

713
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:37,100
The evil spirit is coming alive with the energy from the moon!

714
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,400
You scoundrel! Shut your mouth!

715
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,290
The king will turn into an evil spirit now.

716
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:50,490
I hope all of you will watch closely and witness it.

717
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,900
Do not move!

718
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,700
His Majesty's life will be at risk.

719
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,670
This is truly a rebellion!

720
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:16,500
Hear ye, take all those rebels right now—

721
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,530
Bring me Kyera.

722
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,440
 Yeon Wol? 

723
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,880
K-Kyera?

724
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,130
They caught Kyera?

725
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,130
 Darn you. 

726
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:41,590
 How dare you. 

727
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,420
 Yeon Wol. 

728
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,000
 I cannot move. 

729
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,570
Your Majesty, please watch closely.

730
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,400
 Yeon Wol. 

731
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,310
 Kyera! 

732
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:59,830
Everyone, watch closely

733
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:03,060
what is about to unfold from this moment.

734
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,300
Stop there, Sajo Yoong!

735
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:54,990
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Troubled HeartsTeam @ Viki.com 

736
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,510
Kyera. Kyera. Kyera.

737
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,330
Kyera.

738
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:13,790
That is not me, Your Majesty! Your Majesty—

739
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,590
Kyera.

740
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,230
Did you all see it?

741
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,800
This man is not His Majesty.

742
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,220
He is an evil spirit.

743
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,200
The king is possessed by an evil spirit!

744
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,450
Your Majesty.

745
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,420
Bring it on, Evil Spirit.

746
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,660
Come on.

747
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:00,150
Sajo Yoong.

748
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:04,010
Sajo Yoong!

749
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:20,680
♫  Never lost, I will not lose you  ♫

750
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:27,500
♫  Within the darkness, open the door and look at my inner self  ♫

751
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:34,400
♫  Never lost, when this darkness ends  ♫

752
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,770
   

753
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:41,970
 What happened to Yeon Wol? 

754
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:43,930
 You are still worried about Kyera in this situation? 

755
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:48,090
 Ak Hee, I leave my people and Yeon Wol in your hands. 

756
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:52,910
 The haunted king will bring forth a plague! 

757
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:56,150
 Looks like the heavens are also helping me, Sajo Yoong. 

758
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:59,580
 They said Prince Ga Ron suddenly fainted! 

759
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,800
 His Majesty needs to come back quickly. 

760
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,200
 Make my body stiffen and let His Majesty wake up. 

761
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,750
 Would I be able to take you to the mind's space, Kyera?
