9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,120
How...

10
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,400
How could you...

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,930
How could you!

12
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,190
I did not do it.

13
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:28,000
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Troubled HeartsTeam @ Viki.com 

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,420
That is not the long needle I use.

15
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
It was someone else's doing.

16
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,570
Close the doors.

17
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,630
Do not let anyone besides the physician enter!

18
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,270
Yes!

19
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,240
His Majesty has passed away!

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,880
- His Majesty has passed away! 
  - Your Majesty! 

21
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,640
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty! 

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,330
Mourn his death!

23
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,280
Mourn his death!

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,460
Mourn his death!

25
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,800
   

26
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,630
Open the doors.

27
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,830
Crown Prince said not to let anyone enter—

28
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,820
Your Majesty!

29
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,440
Crown Princess.

30
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,260
Did His Majesty pass away?

31
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,710
Wait outside for one moment—

32
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,390
Is that long needle his cause of death?

33
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,110
It seems so.

34
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,070
That long needle is...

35
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,110
Search Consort Hyo's body!

36
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,970
Consort Hyo is still a concubine.

37
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,720
She should be interrogated according to the rules of the Inner Court—

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,400
Your Highness, we must find the evidence before the guilty gets rid of it.

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,650
Here and now.

40
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,930
What are you all doing?

41
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,390
Confirm it.

42
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,690
They seem to be from the same set of needles.

43
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,300
How dare this wench...

44
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,090
Lock up this wench right away.

45
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,300
Yes!

46
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,850
Your Highness, it is not true.

47
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,650
Hold on.

48
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,020
Your Highness, this matter should not get leaked outside of the chamber.

49
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,170
Those who are waiting to prey on your weakness will not stay quiet.

50
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,870
We cannot jump to conclusions as to why His Majesty passed away yet.

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,560
Until his cause of death becomes clear, you all must not speak of this matter.

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,040
Do you understand?

53
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,530
 Yes, Your Highness. 

54
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,810
Lock up the guilty in the secret prison.

55
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,240
Do it in secret.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,830
Yes!

57
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,080
Crown Princess, what is going on?

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,110
His Majesty passed—

59
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,860
It is not true, right, Crown Princess?

60
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,430
Goodness, Your Majesty!

61
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,940
Goodness, Your Majesty!

62
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,320
Goodness, Yoong, why did you have to go hunt at a time like this?

63
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,470
Grand Prince went on a hunt?

64
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,130
When did he leave?

65
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,360
He left early yesterday morning.

66
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,970
You are the oldest son! Goodness, Yoong...

67
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,700
Goodness, Your Majesty!

68
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,500
- Goodness, Your Majesty! 
 - The king is dead! 

69
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,110
 The king is dead! 

70
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,200
 Our prayers finally reached the heavens! 

71
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,750
 They said Sajo Seung suddenly died! 

72
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,160
 The king is dead! 

73
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,510
 The king is dead? 

74
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,350
 The damned king is dead! 

75
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,060
 He was punished by the heavens! 

76
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,350
Did Kyera succeed in assassinating him?

77
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,780
The thing is, they said he died suddenly. Not murdered.

78
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,410
His over drinking and indulgent lifestyle are still thought to be the cause.

79
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,820
 The heaven punished him! 

80
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,220
I am sure that is the rumor the palace spread

81
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,780
so the people are not agitated.

82
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,780
I must find out what situation Kyera is in.

83
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,260
 The king is dead! 

84
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,420
Crown Prince, I am sorry to tell you this,

85
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,570
but the washing and shrouding ritual must take place promptly.

86
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,470
 Who do you work for? 

87
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,630
I would like a moment alone with His Majesty.

88
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,350
Yes.

89
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,360
You, too, Crown Princess.

90
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,230
I would like to atone for being a bad son.

91
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,790
Would you please understand?

92
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,120
Please go ahead.

93
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,720
 Half-wit... 

94
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,900
 Just like you, 

95
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,690
 I am also ashamed of you. 

96
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,270
 Set the entire house on fire! 

97
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,600
 Burn down everything that belongs to the damned Royal Family of Yeon! 

98
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,270
Is it karma, Father?

99
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,380
Investigate His Majesty's cause of death thoroughly.

100
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,700
Yes, Your Highness.

101
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,510
Young physicians stopped by?

102
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,420
Yes, they are physicians His Highness kept close by his side.

103
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,420
He kept close by his side?

104
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,980
Do not miss a thing about the situation in the chamber and report to me.

105
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,010
Yes, Your Highness.

106
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,580
 I am sorry. 

107
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,670
 The young girl who was there. 

108
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,350
 I am sure she died. 

109
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,090
 I could not save her. 

110
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,040
 Her eyes are still vivid in my mind. 

111
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,090
 That is why I was punished by the heavens. 

112
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,590
 That is why an evil spirit possessed me. 

113
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,780
 I am sorry, Father. 

114
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,980
 Please have me punished by the heavens. 

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,610
 Who could have killed the king? 

116
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,490
 Wind Knives? 

117
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,190
 No. 

118
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,870
 It is obvious that I would be framed for sure. So, why at that hour? 

119
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,930
Sajo Yoong?

120
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,550
How could he kill his own father?

121
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,660
Do you still deny your crime?

122
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,030
I am not denying it.

123
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,000
Because I did not do that.

124
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,590
After your memories came back,

125
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,540
how did you feel looking at me?

126
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,910
You must have thought I got what I deserved.

127
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,090
A crown prince who is called half-wit...

128
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,090
by his father because of his madness.

129
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,240
I am sure you kept quiet about getting your memories back

130
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,140
and belittled me all you wanted.

131
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,120
I did not belittle you.

132
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,540
I only resented you.

133
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,440
Because you erased my memories.

134
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,680
I am not the one who erased your memories.

135
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,980
It was Ak Hee's doing.

136
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,910
Ak Hee twisted everything.

137
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,510
The one who twisted everything in the first place is His Majesty Sajo Seung.

138
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,990
That is why you murdered...

139
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,740
His Majesty, my father.

140
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,350
 I could not bring myself to do it. 

141
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,590
 Because of you. 

142
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,070
It will be very hard on you from now on.

143
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,790
You might die, or rather

144
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,150
you will end up dying.

145
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,990
But I cannot stop it from happening.

146
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,530
I do not fear dying.

147
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,090
I am only sad you are mistaken about me.

148
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,970
However,

149
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,000
why would that matter?

150
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,570
It is true...

151
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,990
I did come here to have His Majesty end up that way.

152
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,840
We just...

153
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,450
should not have met in the first place.

154
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,060
I had...

155
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,520
 let you have my heart, though only for a moment. 

156
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,760
I cannot forgive you.

157
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,870
Your Highness.

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,350
Please be careful.

159
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,130
You must be wary of your surroundings at all times.

160
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,350
My surroundings?

161
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,100
I was betrayed by the one who was closest to me.

162
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,450
Who would I need to be wary of?

163
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,280
W-What is the matter?

164
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,950
Take her out of here!

165
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,310
What is the matter?

166
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,370
Lock up all these wenches!

167
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,020
 Yes! 

168
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,640
Chief.

169
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,570
Do you really wish to lose your neck?

170
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,670
Hurry up and confess the truth!

171
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,890
I have told you many times now.

172
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,700
I did not kill His Majesty.

173
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,760
You are saying the same thing again!

174
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,560
Do you still claim innocence when your long needle was found as the weapon of murder?

175
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,370
I have already told you about that many times, too.

176
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,150
That long needle is not mine.

177
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,610
How dare you!

178
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,130
Does that mean...

179
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,550
you had no interest at all in murdering His Majesty?

180
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,330
What is this?

181
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,760
Why was this found in your chamber?

182
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,710
This is the short knife that represents one being a direct descendant of the Royal Family of Yeon.

183
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:13,350
Do you think I do not know you are Yeon Wol, the daughter of Yeon Poong Hak,

184
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,860
who was executed 10 years ago for treason?

185
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,210
You came into the palace by seducing the crown prince,

186
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,050
in order to murder His Majesty.

187
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,080
Who is behind you?

188
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,650
Whose order was it?

189
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,390
I did not take...

190
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,360
any orders from anyone.

191
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,590
You wretched wench.

192
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,130
Bring me that girl.

193
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,570
Hong Goon!

194
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,730
Your Highness!

195
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,020
This girl is innocent. She does not know anything!

196
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,950
Let her go free.

197
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,840
Who is the one who colluded with this woman?

198
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,840
Who secretly frequented Consort Hyo's pavilion?

199
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,510
No such thing happened.

200
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,430
No one frequented the pavilion!

201
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,050
Beat them harder until they speak the truth!

202
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,750
 - Yes!  
 - Y-Your Highness!

203
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,880
Y-Your Highness! Your Highness!

204
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,170
It cannot be helped.

205
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,600
I cannot help you.

206
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,640
It must hurt.

207
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,530
It must be extremely painful.

208
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,100
 I did not do it. 

209
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,880
Did you find out the cause of death?

210
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,110
He did pass away from the poisoned needle.

211
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,010
Just kill me instead! Just kill me!

212
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,560
Do it harder.

213
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,200
Harder!

214
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,240
Harder!

215
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,400
Kyera!

216
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,660
I cannot leave her like that.

217
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,450
I cannot leave Consort Hyo like that.

218
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,600
 Sajo Hyeon! 

219
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,490
 Sajo Hyeon, do you hear me? 

220
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,800
 Sajo Hyeon! 

221
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,060
 Sajo Hyeon! 

222
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,440
Ak Hee?

223
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,130
Sajo Hyeon, are you happy to have me this way from bonghamsal?

224
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,170
Are you happy you made Kyera end up like that?

225
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,330
Why did you call for me?

226
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,300
How are you still alive?

227
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,340
Kyera!

228
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,420
Ak Hee, how could you still be...

229
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,470
Why did you not disappear?

230
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,650
Because Kyera is in pain.

231
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,360
I cannot disappear because Kyera is having a hard time.

232
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,120
I cannot go away when Kyera is in that state!

233
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,880
Sajo Hyeon, please save Kyera.

234
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,720
You know Kyera was not the one who did it.

235
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,140
We have evidence Consort Hyo murdered His Majesty.

236
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,020
Damn the evidence.

237
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,420
Do you believe it?

238
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,340
You also think Kyera did not do it!

239
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,530
I do not trust the woman who betrayed me.

240
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,150
What is your problem? You do trust Kyera!

241
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,030
I do not trust her.

242
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,190
Be gone, Ak Hee.

243
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,030
H-Hold on! Hold on!

244
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,030
Then, release me, please.

245
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,890
Release me from bonghamsal.

246
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,090
I can save Kyera.

247
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,690
I know you want to save Kyera, too.

248
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,800
I know you are in pain, too!

249
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,330
I know you cannot do it because of your damn reputation.

250
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,280
I have a great plan.

251
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,500
So please release me.

252
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,370
I cannot do that.

253
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:13,010
I cannot forgive you either for bringing Consort Hyo into the palace when you knew who she was.

254
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,510
Be gone, Ak Hee.

255
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,910
Ak Hee!

256
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,080
Hold on! Hold on!

257
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,860
I know who murdered His Majesty.

258
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,930
Who is it?

259
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,050
Who is the one who murdered His Majesty?

260
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,130
You want to know, right?

261
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,950
Then, release me from here first.

262
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,980
Do not even try to fool me, Ak Hee.

263
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,170
Hong Goon.

264
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,000
Hong Goon.

265
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,270
They should not remember they fell asleep.

266
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,620
I mixed it with bleeding-heart flowers.

267
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,220
Looks like bleeding-heart flowers are in the market again.

268
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,470
Let us go. Wind Knives are waiting for us outside.

269
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,280
I am not going.

270
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,700
- Will you die like this? 
 - Master Yang,

271
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,470
I did not kill Sajo Seung.

272
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,340
Then, who did it?

273
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,120
Let us leave first.

274
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,510
Right now is not the time. Please go back.

275
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,150
You think I will leave you to die like this?

276
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,490
Listen to me, Yang Jae Yi.

277
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,150
This is an order from the royal descendant of Yeon.

278
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,310
Please do not worry about me, and keep an eye on Sajo Yoong.

279
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,080
I find Sajo Yoong suspicious.

280
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,910
I am keeping a close watch,

281
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,010
Lady Yeon Wol.

282
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,120
Please stay strong.

283
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,010
 - Goodness! 
 - Your Majesty! 

284
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,440
Goodness, Your Majesty!

285
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,810
Goodness, Your Majesty!

286
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,920
Goodness, Your Majesty.

287
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,790
W-What is going on here?

288
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,730
What on Earth has...

289
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,720
Your Majesty!

290
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,090
Father!

291
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:43,120
Please let the heavens punish me for being a terrible son, Your Majesty!

292
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,130
Goodness, Your Majesty!

293
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,510
Goodness, Your Majesty—

294
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,150
Who did it?

295
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,310
Who was the one who...

296
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,380
Who was it?

297
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,230
It was not that someone harmed him. He just suddenly...

298
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,620
There is no way.

299
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:12,100
There is no way His Majesty would suddenly end up like this when he was in good health.

300
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,720
Your Majesty!

301
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,670
Father!

302
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,470
Your Majesty!

303
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,770
Goodness, Your Majesty!

304
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,620
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Goodness, Your Majesty! 

305
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,770
 Goodness, Your Majesty! 

306
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,460
 I did all kinds of things to gain your recognition. 

307
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,980
 I crawled like a dog. 

308
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,550
 But what? I am only a catalyst to provoke your son? 

309
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,810
 Let me show you the consequences of using and mocking me. 

310
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,760
 Go to hell, Sajo Seung. 

311
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,340
 I will take your place. 

312
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,400
Sajo Hyeon, it is your turn.

313
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,030
Brother, what is the matter?

314
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,510
Sajo Hyeon, you are taking your own life tonight.

315
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,990
Crown Prince hung himself out of severe sadness,

316
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,300
blaming himself for failing to save His Majesty.

317
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,800
A half-wit who succumbed to his madness in the end and escaped from this world for eternity.

318
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,310
Farewell, Sajo Hyeon.

319
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,800
Gosh, what is the matter, Brother?

320
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,990
Why are you lashing out your anger at me for being sad about His Majesty's death?

321
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,850
Huh?

322
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,450
What is the matter with you?

323
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,810
People would say you are trying to kill me to take the throne if they saw us!

324
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,140
But I know that is not the case.

325
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,480
You are only resenting your brother for being a bad son.

326
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,540
Because you are a good son.

327
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,740
I have no interest in becoming the king.

328
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,550
Someone like you would qualify.

329
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,370
Brother, calm down for now and...

330
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,300
please help me out.

331
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,500
What do you need?

332
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,360
The guilty was ordered to be transferred.

333
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,980
Where am I going?

334
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,370
Was it the crown prince's order?

335
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,930
Your Highness?

336
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,060
Your Highness!

337
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,860
Where are you taking Her Highness?

338
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,820
Hong Goon.

339
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,700
Your Highness, no matter what the world says and points fingers at you, I believe you!

340
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,790
 I know you would never do such a thing! 

341
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,050
 Your Highness! 

342
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,240
Where am I going? Which prison is it?

343
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,460
Lower your voice.

344
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,160
You will be executed soon.

345
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,120
Your Highness, Consort Hyo is being transferred in secret.

346
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,370
They are transferring Consort Hyo in secret?

347
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,520
Is it the prison at Castle Sewoon?

348
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,650
Since they are headed to the north of the palace, it seems they are headed to the execution grounds.

349
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,580
The execution grounds?

350
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,360
Crown Princess, what brings you here at this late hour?

351
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,180
Grand Prince, what is the meaning of this?

352
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,880
Where did you send Consort Hyo?

353
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,610
Crown Prince had ordered the execution of the guilty tonight.

354
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,760
Crown Prince did?

355
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,590
Did he find clear evidence to prove Consort Hyo's crime?

356
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,670
The evidence is not the issue.

357
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,740
The coronation will soon take place.

358
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:13,230
It would be beneficial for everyone to get rid of any problems as soon as possible.

359
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,960
Did His Highness really order this?

360
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,870
 To you, of all people? 

361
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,100
To me, Sajo Yoong, of all people.

362
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,750
I must meet the crown prince.

363
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,610
Crown Prince has gone to bed.

364
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:42,570
His body and mind were extremely fatigued due to His Majesty's sudden death.

365
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,390
Your Highness the Crown Princess!

366
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,190
Crown Prince has ordered us not to let anyone enter.

367
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,830
It seems he finally got to fall asleep just now.

368
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,500
 What are you trying to do? 

369
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,950
 What are you thinking? 

370
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,480
 Father. Mother. 

371
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,870
 I am coming to meet you two soon. 

372
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,750
 Who are you? 

373
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,770
Wind Knives?

374
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,990
Are you a new recruit?

375
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,510
Where is Master Yang?

376
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,290
You are not a Wind Knife, huh?

377
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,290
Your Highness?

378
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,160
Did you leave evidence that Wind Knives were there?

379
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,960
Yes, Grand Prince. The rest are pursuing the guilty.

380
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,640
Who is the one who took Consort Hyo?

381
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,940
Was he from the Wind Knives?

382
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,500
His attire was different.

383
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,410
He was wearing half of a mask.

384
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,190
A mask?

385
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,180
 Brother, calm down first and... 

386
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,340
 please help me out. 

387
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,670
 With what? 

388
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,250
 Tell them I ordered the execution of Consort Hyo and 

389
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,520
 take her to the execution grounds behind the palace. 

390
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,800
 Someone will come to rescue Consort Hyo there. 

391
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,010
 The soldiers will not sit still. 

392
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,650
 You have to help me with taking down the soldiers. 

393
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,500
Make sure to catch the guilty.

394
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,950
As soon as you do, check the identity of the one who took her and kill him.

395
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,530
And as for Consort Hyo...

396
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,620
 Gosh, I really have no interest in the throne! 

397
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:32,930
 I dream of living happily with Consort Hyo in a faraway place. That is my dream. 

398
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,740
As for Consort Hyo,

399
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,370
bring her alive.

400
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,750
Yes.

401
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,240
 Also, 

402
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
 I really don't usually take this out. 

403
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,780
 It is something I really cherish. 

404
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,480
 Who knows? I might give this to you. 

405
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,390
 The one who takes this becomes the king of this country. Right? 

406
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,020
 Brother, 

407
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,040
 as long as you help me. 

408
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:11,100
Sajo Hyeon, you are a fool.

409
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,130
Crown Prince is still in his chamber. Right?

410
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,080
Yes, Grand Prince.

411
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,140
Why does it hurt whenever I touch Kyera?

412
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,810
Hang in there a moment.

413
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,580
What do I do?

414
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,900
It was my fault.

415
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,140
I am sorry.

416
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,590
Kyera!

417
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,900
N-No, you need to stay down.

418
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,950
Where is this place?

419
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,270
Huh? Oh, this place.

420
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,890
This is a cabin in the mountains.

421
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,130
You stayed up all night?

422
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,660
How fortunate. Your fever went down a lot.

423
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,910
 - Your Highness? 
 - I am Ak Hee, not Sajo Hyeon. 

424
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,440
 The real one, not the fake. 

425
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,460
You are really not Crown Prince, huh?

426
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,540
No. Glad to see me. Right?

427
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,720
It hurts a lot. Right?

428
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,310
I did do first aid,

429
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,340
but I did not know how to use these herbs.

430
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,260
I brought them from the palace.

431
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,680
I can make a healing salve with that.

432
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,630
Help me up, please.

433
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,180
Okay.

434
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,460
Are you injured?

435
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,180
H-Huh? N-No, I am not.

436
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,170
O-Oh, right.

437
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,520
A change of clothes.

438
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,460
Right here.

439
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,620
You lost her?

440
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,180
They said he disappeared suddenly in front of their eyes.

441
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,750
Disappeared suddenly?

442
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,470
You idiots. All of you could not handle one man?

443
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,210
I am sorry, Grand Prince.

444
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,260
I will make sure to find him and kill him.

445
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,280
Is Crown Prince still in his chamber?

446
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:28,320
It seems so as tables of food and drinks were taken in and out all night.

447
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,610
 I have no interest in becoming the king. 

448
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,470
 Someone like you would qualify. 

449
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,950
 Please help me out. 

450
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,060
Crown Prince...

451
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,900
what are you thinking?

452
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,300
Huh?

453
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,560
Give it to me here.

454
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,350
He said not to let anyone enter.

455
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,340
Your Highness, I am bringing your food and drinks.

456
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:14,030
Crown Prince, how can you drink so much? Goodness!

457
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,940
I am so nervous. It is killing me.

458
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,720
Your Highness, please stop drinking!

459
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,050
Oh, by the way,

460
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,680
I did not lift your clothes above your knees earlier, either.

461
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,950
B-Because...

462
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,170
I mean, the thing is—

463
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:22,490
No, only the urgent wounds were taken care of...

464
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,170
It is fine now.

465
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,520
Oh, okay. Can I turn around now?

466
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,020
Yes.

467
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,050
It must hurt more since you put the medicine on.

468
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,720
I will be fine in a bit.

469
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,730
You are hungry, right? I will make some porridge.

470
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,010
By the way,

471
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,240
if you change into the other personality like this...

472
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,740
Ak Hee.

473
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,910
I would like you to call me Ak Hee, not Crown Prince.

474
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,700
How can I call you that?

475
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,870
So what?

476
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,450
You already know I share this body with Sajo Hyeon.

477
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:17,300
Sajo Hyeon might enjoy acting arrogant and prefer being put on a pedestal by others.

478
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,560
But not me. Because I am the real one.

479
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,280
Were you going to ask me something?

480
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:40,240
After he is switched as you, Ak Hee, where is that Crown Prince?

481
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,550
Are you worried about Sajo Hyeon?

482
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,610
Who knows? I am sure he is scrunched up somewhere.

483
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,000
You did not look for me like this, did you?

484
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,350
Sajo Hyeon locked me up tight with bonghamsal, and I was so cold and hungry—

485
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:56,650
Right.

486
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,510
 The evil spirit is no more. 

487
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,840
 A shaman called Cheong Ta sealed him away. 

488
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,760
What now? What is it?

489
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,130
I heard it, too. Ak—

490
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,760
He said a shaman called Cheong Ta sealed you away.

491
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,220
How did you get back out?

492
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,600
See?

493
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,600
You remember I was sealed only now!

494
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,600
- You did not worry about me at all and only now... 
 - I did...

495
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,100
worry about you.

496
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,370
I see.

497
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,090
So, I got scared, too.

498
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:43,060
Cheong Ta that traitor used bonghamsal on me,

499
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,800
after which my entire body was starting to freeze.

500
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,590
But hearing the sound of you being tortured was driving me nuts.

501
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:52,130
You can hear my voice?

502
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:57,450
Yes. It felt like I had ants all over my body, and I was losing my mind.

503
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,900
 Sajo Hyeon! 

504
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,190
 - Ak Hee?  
 - And...

505
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,380
I broke through and came out.

506
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,270
Amazing, right?

507
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,460
You are hungry, huh?

508
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,590
Wait...

509
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,870
It is so cold.

510
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,320
I wonder if Ak Hee is doing his job right.

511
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,760
 Remember the ornament used for bonghamsal? 

512
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,930
 Find it and burn it. That is how you undo bonghamsal. 

513
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,590
 I will listen to you and stop causing trouble. 

514
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,590
 So let us save Kyera first. Okay? 

515
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:51,470
 I cannot trust you. 

516
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,630
 What about Kyera, then? 

517
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,940
 Just let her die like this when she did nothing wrong? 

518
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,110
 Is that what you want? 

519
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,950
 That woman brought it upon herself. 

520
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,880
 It is not my business. 

521
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,160
 I said Kyera will die! 

522
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,740
 Save Kyera first and decide whether you will kill me or not. 

523
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,360
 It was so hard to meet Kyera, my love, again. 

524
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,580
 Kyera and I were so close and in love! 

525
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,530
 Consort Hyo liked you as well? 

526
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,500
 Did she consider you her lover? 

527
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,870
 Of course. 

528
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,630
Consort Hyo had feelings for Ak Hee?

529
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:43,290
Why am I trying to save a woman like her?

530
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,690
Gosh, I said I will feed you.

531
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,600
It is okay.

532
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,830
Right.

533
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,600
I-I was worried you would burn your mouth.

534
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:26,310
S-So, how is it?

535
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,280
Not good?

536
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,420
It is good.

537
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,950
It tastes good?

538
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,390
You need to go back to the palace now.

539
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,120
They must be mourning for His Majesty.

540
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:55,970
How could I be absent as I am in the Crown Prince's body?

541
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,570
And since I also disappeared, the entire palace is probably...

542
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,960
I took the measures so that would not happen.

543
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,300
Also, you are not even guilty.

544
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,390
Do you believe I did not do it?

545
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,030
Of course, I believe you.

546
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,660
I told you I am not Sajo Hyeon.

547
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,190
 I cannot forgive you. 

548
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,550
You have to watch out for Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

549
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,820
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong is building a secret army.

550
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:36,770
You also know he is a sly serpent.

551
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:41,270
But he still cannot handle Ak Hee.

552
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,570
Consort Hyo murdered His Majesty?

553
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:47,030
I think that is the case.

554
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,950
And those Wind Knives bastards took Consort Hyo?

555
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:59,060
I found it odd that the crown prince suddenly ordered the execution of Consort Hyo.

556
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:04,680
I presume he must have colluded with them.

557
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,990
How can Crown Prince collude with rebels?

558
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,410
I am sincerely concerned.

559
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:18,410
Crown Prince lost his mind because of a woman when he was to take the throne soon.

560
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:22,870
What will the fate of Asatae be from now on?

561
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,020
I am telling only you because I was too concerned, Minister of Finance.

562
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,410
So, please keep quiet about this.

563
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,780
Yes, Grand Prince.

564
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,540
It looks like Consort Hyo murdered His Majesty.

565
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,420
Come on, that is nonsense.

566
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,540
That is why Wind Knives rescued Consort Hyo.

567
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,900
Now, now. Watch what you say.

568
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,650
- I am saying Crown Prince— 
 - My goodness.

569
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,700
Goodness, what a headache!

570
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,190
Crown Princess, you have come again.

571
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,870
How is the Crown Prince doing?

572
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,370
I apologize. He still wants to rest alone—

573
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,670
I know he is not in there.

574
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,560
Where is he?

575
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,080
I apologize, but I do not know, either.

576
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,360
How wicked. There is no way you would not know when you are his closest aide.

577
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,160
His Majesty's funeral will begin soon. What is he going to do?

578
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,730
Where is it? Is it the drapery in the marketplace?

579
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,820
Your Highness, this humble one really does not know!

580
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,360
Do you really wish to be beaten before speaking?

581
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,600
Your Highness.

582
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,090
Your pretty wrist will get hurt, Crown Princess.

583
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,690
Your Highness, what are you going to do?

584
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,400
People are saying you released Consort Hyo secretly

585
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,470
and are helping a group of people plotting rebellion.

586
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:17,730
Crown Princess, do you have no faith in me?

587
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,970
Although I suffer from madness,

588
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,830
would I really help a group of rebels?

589
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,890
In that case, what about Consort Hyo?

590
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:31,250
I sent Consort Hyo into exile for now.

591
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:35,640
The physicians who analyzed His Majesty's dead body proved Consort Hyo to be innocent,

592
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,560
so it is clear she is not guilty, but you never know.

593
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,660
 It was not Consort Hyo's doing? 

594
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,380
 Are you certain? 

595
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:49,740
 Yes, I heard from the physicians who analyzed His Majesty's dead body. 

596
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:55,330
 Of course, they told Crown Prince it was Consort Hyo's doing. 

597
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:57,080
Did the physicians really say it was not—

598
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,190
Since Consort Hyo is gone,

599
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,090
it is good news for you, is it not, Crown Princess?

600
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:05,620
Your Highness, you know your sudden decisions like these

601
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:10,220
are the best weak spots for Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

602
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,840
Grand Prince Sajo Yoong dares to take your place, Your Highness.

603
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,320
He is trying to become the king.

604
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:21,350
Oh, that is why you are anxious right now.

605
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,530
Because you might not become the queen because of Grand Prince Yoong.

606
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:26,680
- Your Highness. 
 - All right.

607
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,360
Let all your worries rest for now and

608
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,440
take a deep breath.

609
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,880
Let us get done with the funeral first. Okay?

610
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,810
Your Highness,

611
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:43,990
I am going to become the queen, no matter what.

612
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:50,980
I will not let anyone stand in my way and stop me.

613
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,500
Crown Princess, you are really...

614
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,150
 Just wait and see, Your Majesty. 

615
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:36,480
 See whose country Asatae becomes. 

616
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,390
Father.

617
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,320
Father.

618
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:20,320
Your Majesty, I will escort you.

619
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,330
Officer Ji, stay here and protect Crown Princess.

620
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,570
Crown Princess is severely anxious,

621
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:33,870
so would it not help if you were by her side?

622
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,200
- Eunuch Neung! 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

623
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,170
Do you happen to know Cheong Ta's whereabouts?

624
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,820
It seems she has relocated again.

625
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,520
Is that so?

626
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,630
I do not know, either.

627
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:51,900
By the way, why are you looking for Cheong Ta again?

628
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,630
Huh?

629
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,430
I have something to discuss.

630
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,090
I will be back.

631
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:05,530
Please take care, Your Highness.

632
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,590
Ji Jeon.

633
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:11,860
Yes.

634
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,620
It looks like bonghamsal did not work.

635
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,600
 Here. I steamed some potatoes. 

636
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,160
 Have some when you are hungry. 

637
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,320
 Also... 

638
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,190
 Here is water for you, so drink it. 

639
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:55,120
 I can take care of myself. 

640
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,570
 Lastly... 

641
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:04,050
 You absolutely cannot move around yet. Okay? 

642
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,010
 I will go to the palace and be right back. 

643
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,220
 Also... 

644
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:36,740
If you h-have to...

645
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,360
like g-go...

646
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,860
I am here!

647
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,550
Gosh, I told her not to move around.

648
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,960
 I am leaving because I have a place to be urgently. 

649
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,400
 Thank you for everything. 

650
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,570
Did Sajo Yoong send you?

651
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,600
Are you okay?

652
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,370
I told you not to follow me.

653
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,850
I came to protect you, Your Highness.

654
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:44,200
I will stop them, so escape in the meantime.

655

01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:48,860
 What is going on, Ak Hee? Ak Hee! 

665
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,110
♫  I'll stay here and wait for you  ♫

666
01:02:54,900 --> 01:03:03,280
♫  Even if you disappear again tomorrow, I will wait  ♫

667
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:15,090
♫  So that I can feel the faint sound of you breathing  ♫

668
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:20,330

 Do you plan to go back?

01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:27,100
 In that case, you might aim your sword at me again one day. 

671
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,940
 I intend to wander as far as my footsteps take me.

 Take care. 

673
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,730
 Please take care as well, Your Highness.

 Grand Prince Sajo Yoong will become the king? 

675
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:39,110
 The assassins said they would kill the crown prince soon. 

676
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:41,180
 Is no one there? 

677
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,300
 I will give you one last chance. 

678
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,650
 Be my subordinate. 

679
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:49,340
 Your son is now the king of Asatae.
