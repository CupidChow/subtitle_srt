1
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,400
   

2
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,080
   

3
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,400
   

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,240
   

5
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,310
   

6
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,530
   

7
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,940
   

8
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,480
   

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,120
   

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,080
   

11
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,580
   

12
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,390
All right, the tax report from two years ago.

13
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

14
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,730
From two years ago...

15
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,140
Here you go.

16
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,980
Okay.

17
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:37,590
What have you been smiling about since earlier?

18
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,530
Seeing you working hard to prepare for the meeting

19
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,500
makes this humble one so proud.

20
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,170
You were such a tiny little genius with brilliant eyes.

21
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,350
And now you have become a stately king like this,

22
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,640
looking after national affairs.

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,360
I would not be hungry even if I were to starve.

24
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,670
It does not seem you starved.

25
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,530
Well, it was figurative speech.

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,960

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,770
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

28
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,060
Your Majesty.

29
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,570
His Majesty the Emperor enters!

30
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,790
I will now...

31
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,690
begin the meeting.

32
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,620
First off, I would like to discuss increasing the amount of rice for the poor.

33
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,540
According to...

34
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,390
According to what I have researched—

35
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,470
Your Majesty!

36
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,210
Please allow me, Minister of Finance Hae Chan, to speak.

37
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,100
I am sorry to inform you,

38
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,840
but increasing the amount of rice for the poor is difficult in many ways.

39
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,800
- Most of all— 
 - I read the report you all submitted.

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,670
You are saying it is difficult because the landowners and the officials will have to pay more tax.

41
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,740
Your Majesty, I reckon you should not take the root of the problem so lightly.

42
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,280
How did I take it lightly?

43
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,080
I have been researching the issue of tax collection for many years.

44
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,350
According to what I researched—

45
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,820
 Half-wit. 

46
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,150
 What a king we have here. 

47
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,250
 What research could a half-wit do? 

48
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,420
 Do we have to keep serving such a half-wit as our king? 

49
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,080
The warehouse for our people becomes emptier each year,

50
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,870
but the ministers are building more warehouses each year, based on what I know.

51
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,220
 What is the matter with you? 

52
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,260
 People would say you are trying to kill me to take the throne if they saw us! 

53
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,310
 Are you not him? 

54
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,530
As such, the Minister of Finance built a new warehouse last fall and—

55
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,330
Your Majesty!

56
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,260
It is true this humble one built a new warehouse last fall.

57
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,200
But that was all to provide for the people.

58
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,130
 Gosh, what a half-wit. 

59
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,040
 I will end up a half-wit like him. 

60
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,980
 Half-wit, half-wit. 

61
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,590
 Half-wit. 

62
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,400
 Half-wit. 

63
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,480
 He is a half-wit who has no interest in managing a nation. 

64
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,850
Your Majesty!

65
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,010
As the Minister of Defense, in order to bolster Asatae's strong army—

66
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,690
Shut your mouth, all of you!

67
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,980
Father.

68
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,010
Your Majesty.

69
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,930
Your Majesty!

70
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,850
Did you see His Majesty's face?

71
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,510
Of course, I did.

72
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:19,090
I was really worried he might start crying.

73
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,630
Anyhow, what shall we do about raising the tax on the officials?

74
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,240
Gosh, I know!

75
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,470
I am sure His Majesty will mention it again at the next meeting. My goodness.

76
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,330
What are you all so worried about?

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,130
Jo-sam-mo-sa. 
    

78
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:45,100
We only need to give a sweet gift of trickery to the half-wit.

79
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,330
Are you telling me to stay quiet in front of the ministers?

80
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,510
Your Majesty, it has only been three days since you took the throne.

81
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:03,360
There is no need to touch on the tax issue this soon, which the ministers are most sensitive about.

82
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,890
Let Grand Prince Sajo Yoong do the tough job of dealing with the officials.

83
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,800
Do you really believe Grand Prince Yoong is doing a tough job?

84
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,670
Grand Prince Yoong is manipulating the officials and instigating the public for an unjust cause.

85
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,460
Were you aware already?

86
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,330
Were you also aware, Head Minister?

87
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,510
In that case, you must become even more flexible.

88
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,530
You need to coax those who have been tamed by Grand Prince Sajo Yoong

89
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,790
and turn them into your own men.

90
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,910
This humble one will help you,

91
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:43,040
so please trust me and follow suit.

92
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,680
Your Majesty, you are walking fast to stay awake. Right?

93
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,860
- No. 
 - Gosh.

94
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,060
You have not slept for three days now.

95
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,700
Is Ji Jeon Seo still not done?

96
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,950
Yes.

97
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,070
He said he would send a carrier pigeon as soon as he found Cheong Ta's location.

98
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,480
But it still has not come.

99
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,140
Cheong Ta is clearly avoiding me.

100
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,600
How strange.

101
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,870
Cheong Ta would avoid Ak Hee that—

102
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,620
I can understand her avoiding Sir Ak Hee, but why would she avoid you?

103
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,580
She even came to the palace to redo bonghamsal.

104
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,990
That is my question.

105
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,740
Gosh, I just cannot understand.

106
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,190
Whoa, Your Majesty!

107
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,540
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

108
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,330
Cheong Ta!

109
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,010
Where are you, Cheong Ta?

110
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,950
Cheong Ta!

111
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,900
He is desperately looking for me, my Ji Jeon—

112
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,950
Cheong Ta!

113
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,770
I am here—

114
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,270
Please come to your senses, Cheong Ta!

115
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,400
Please!

116
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,660
Cheong Ta! Cheong Ta!

117
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,350
Jeon Seo—

118
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,120
Stop! Do not do it!

119
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,720
I am sorry, Jeon Seo.

120
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,110
Your Majesty, are you waiting for someone?

121
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,990
No.

122
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,120
To the Royal Council Hall.

123
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

124
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,130
I-It is His Majesty.

125
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,070
Her Highness Consort Hyo?

126
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,730
Gosh, how unfortunate.

127
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,030
Working at the laundry is really hard.

128
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,480
 I am sorry. 

129
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,050
 I will have her make you Consort Hyo right now. 

130
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,560
 Please do not. 

131
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,170
 I can stay here only by following Her Majesty's order. 

132
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,750
 It is also easier to spy within the palace as a palace lady. 

133
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,120
 Still... 

134
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,070
 I was ready for this. 

135
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,020
 I will do my best to help you from where I am. 

136
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,090
 So, please do your best to set this country right. 

137
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:42,610
Your Majesty, you came here to see Her Highness Consort Hyo.

138
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,110
Your Majesty, there are too many eyes around us.

139
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,350
Oh, my, His Majesty?

140
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,590
He is looking at us. Right?

141
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,910
Is it me?

142
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,140
You really think so? My goodness...

143
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,820
Your Highness.

144
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,840
Your Highness.

145
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,590
Wash them again.

146
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,650
Court Lady, we have washed them three times now.

147
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,150
Are you her servant?

148
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,450
Wake up!

149
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,330
She is a palace lady now, just like you!

150
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,390
Having been the crown prince's concubine at one time?

151
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,610
I had also once been graced by the late king!

152
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,740
That is not the reason—

153
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,590
These!

154
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,990
And these!

155
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,730
Go and wash all of them again!

156
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,090
Court Lady, I can wash them again as many times as you want.

157
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:02,080
However, if you are trying to tame me, giving me some other work would be better.

158
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,190
What? How dare you!

159
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,310
I heard Her Majesty cherishes this blanket cover.

160
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,750
It is made up of thinly woven hemp fiber,

161
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:18,250
so it will be damaged and lose its embroidery when washed too many times.

162
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,440
Really?

163
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,690
Rinse all of them again and hang them up.

164
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,940
The moment you come back, get to work in the sewing room!

165
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,480
You just let me see you helping her.

166
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,290
I will hand you over to the Palace Supervisory for a beating!

167
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,150
What are you all doing? Get to work!

168
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,910
She talked back?

169
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,600
How impertinent.

170
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,920
Should I order a severe punishment?

171
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,430
No, I must see how much she can take.

172
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,450
Tell them to keep giving her work so she cannot rest even for a moment.

173
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

174
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,540
How is Consort Cheong Myeong doing in prison?

175
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,560
I hear she is adapting fine.

176
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,600
Is Grand Prince Sajo Yoong still not visiting her?

177
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,080
That is what I heard.

178
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,600
Keep giving her food in larger portions.

179
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,040
So, Consort Cheong Myeong's face will become nice and fat.

180
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

181
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,610
So delicious.

182
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:53,070
Gosh, how is my appetite so ravenous when my heart

183
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,530
is endlessly disturbed?

184
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,660
Is it because I have nothing to do?

185
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,610
Hello.

186
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,450
You are not Yoong.

187
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,920
Gosh, Grand Prince is being too harsh on me.

188
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,970
His mother is withering away behind bars,

189
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,760
yet he has not visited once!

190
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,170
What are you looking at?

191
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,510
Tell the Grand Prince that his mother is nearing death!

192
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,350
Huh? Are you really going?

193
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,140
Look! Hey! Look here!

194
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,730
When will Grand Prince Yoong get me out?

195
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,560
Please get me out of here!

196
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,610
I am itchy all over! It is driving me crazy!

197
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,560
 Your Majesty, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong has arrived. 

198
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,890
Let him in.

199
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,940
Have you called for me, Your Majesty?

200
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,600
Are you feeling unwell?

201
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,080
You have been looking pale ever since I saw you this morning.

202
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,370
 Sajo Hyeon is... 

203
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,120
 not getting any sleep? 

204
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,740
 Yes, his chamber's lights go out only after dawn arrives. 

205
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,480
 Because there is no need for lights at dawn. 

206
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,640
 This means he has not slept in three days. 

207
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,730
 He could not sleep for three days... 

208
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,610
 He will not sleep? 

209
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,340
I am fine.

210
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,550
I ordered Consort Cheong Myeong to be released.

211
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,440
Why are you keeping her there?

212
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,140
Was Consort Cheong Myeong not found innocent?

213
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,060
She was, but...

214
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,450
she is guilty of daring to frame Consort Hyo

215
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,110
which should not be easily forgiven.

216
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,880
She must be placed on probation.

217
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,430
Consort Cheong Myeong is quite pitiful.

218
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,440
She has such a cold-hearted son.

219
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,430
I am the pitiful one.

220
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,640
I have a mother who is unworthy to be a mother.

221
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,650
I still received more than enough love from Father,

222
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,170
so I guess I should call myself fortunate.

223
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,790
You did.

224
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:12,210
The late king did favor you a lot.

225
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:18,330
By the way, do we still not have the one who killed Father?

226
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,480
 I know who murdered His Majesty. 

227
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,530
 It was your brother! 

228
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,220
 Sajo Yoong. 

229
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,680
 Sajo Yoong could do worse things. 

230
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,210
 He is not even his biological father. What is there to hesitate? 

231
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,870
It is being investigated discreetly,

232
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,580
so it will be revealed soon enough.

233
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,060
Of course, it will.

234
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,630
By the way, when will you fulfill your promise to me?

235
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,720
Promise...

236
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,600
 That Ak Hee. What did he promise Grand Prince? 

237
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,810
Do you not remember?

238
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,910
 Who knows? I might give this to you. 

239
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,310
 The one who takes this becomes the king of this country. Right? 

240
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,120
 Brother, 

241
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,080
 as long as you help me. 

242
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,600
Sajo Yoong that bastard is persistent.

243
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,700
Hey, Sajo Hyeon, tell him you know.

244
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,630
Tell him to wait.

245
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,380
Yes, right!

246
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,460
Say, "Wait, Grand Prince."

247
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,360
"Wait, Grand Prince."

248
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,350
Wait, Grand Prince.

249
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,880
That is right!

250
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,690
What do you mean, wait?

251
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,970
Was our promise a matter of waiting or not?

252
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:05,250
You said we would go hunting together once you become the emperor.

253
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,160
Sounds like you are joking with me, Your Majesty.

254
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,760
Gosh, Sajo Yoong, that bastard.

255
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,930
No, no! That was not it.

256
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,190
That was not it!

257
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,450
How could it be a joke?

258
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,420
I remember there was a different promise I made to you.

259
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,630
Whoa! Sajo Hyeon, you are quite perceptive.

260
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,800
This is nerve-racking.

261
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,290
I need to hurry and get out of here.

262
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,850
Wait.

263
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,240
And release Consort Cheong Myeong immediately.

264
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
Did I not tell you?

265
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,320
Consort Cheong Myeong must reflect in prison for—

266
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,600
It is a royal decree, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

267
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,110
Bonghamsal will not work anymore?

268
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,670
That is what Cheong Ta said?

269
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

270
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,180
Wait...

271
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,580
Did you not say she came to the palace a few days ago?

272
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,060
She did.

273
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,420
Back then, she said bonghamsal would not work because you were not here.

274
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,360
Why is Cheong Ta changing her words now?

275
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,160
The thing is...

276
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,310
This is a book of laws that is handed down each generation in our shaman association.

277
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:21,590
But I did not know there was such a condition.

278
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,400
Where was it again? Just give me a moment.

279
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,370
There.

280
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,720
One who was released from bonghamsal

281
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,380
cannot be put under bonghamsal again.

282
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,670
Right?

283
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:50,440
But I heard His Majesty was the one who released Ak Hee.

284
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,690
Then he cannot be put under bonghamsal again. It will not work.

285
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,360
It is written here. Cannot be put—

286
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,540
You did not know such an important fact?

287
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,530
Yeah.

288
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,740
To be honest, I do not really like to read.

289
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,120
I read and forget everything.

290
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,240
When do I have the time to read all of this?

291
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,840
When there are so many things to see.

292
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,450
Wow, that Cheong Ta is such a quack.

293
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,170
How can such a person be a shaman who travels to and from the afterlife?

294
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,250
 Remember the ornament used for bonghamsal? 

295
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,450
 Find it and burn it. That is how you undo bonghamsal. 

296
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,070
 I will listen to you and stop causing trouble. 

297
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,080
 So let us save Kyera first. Okay? 

298
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,100
In that case, is there no other way?

299
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,400
So, Ak Hee will come out again once I fall asleep?

300
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,690
About that...

301
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,730
- A-About that? 
 - A-About that?

302
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,400
Cheong Ta said she needs to...

303
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,760
read the said book to the end to find out.

304
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,220
That wretched shaman!

305
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,350
Cheong Ta, you little!

306
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,110
Gosh, I am sure she saw it.

307
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,300
"Lock up Sajo Hyeon.

308
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,610
If you do not lock him up,

309
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,360
 I will tell your shaman association all your crimes. 

310
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,570
 You know what will happen to you, right? 

311
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,740
 Your shaman life is over. 

312
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,720
 You can never return to the heavens." 

313
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,760
This is all because of you, Female Cheong Ta!

314
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,030
Only if you did not fall head over heels for Ak Hee back then!

315
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,390
Gosh, you little wench!

316
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,260
I will just die! I cannot live because of you!

317
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,360
- It is your fault! 
  - Gosh, it hurts! 

318
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,950
Not the face!

319
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,640
Yes, I am blind for love!

320
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,300
Is it a sin to love?

321
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,950
Also,

322
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,210
I like someone else now.

323
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,690
My dear Ji Jeon Seo.

324
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,170
I am serious this time.

325
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,890
What do I do about her?

326
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,580
Master Yang.

327
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,950
I have been to the village you mentioned.

328
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,020
Already?

329
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,530
What you said was true.

330
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,040
Sajo Yoong's henchmen have kept the location hidden for a long time.

331
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,940
He is also only rumored to have helped the poor.

332
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,060
But he never actually helped anyone.

333
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,980
Just as I expected.

334
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,480
I am sure other things are not any different.

335
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,990
The Wind Knives are looking into the other rumors.

336
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,680
Even at the village I visited, a woman was taken in as an amusement troupe member.

337
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,800
However, she has not come back yet.

338
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,710
But His Majesty ordered all of them to go home.

339
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,250
I heard they all left the palace after that day.

340
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,960
Could it be that they have not arrived yet?

341
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,840
The village close to the palace was just the same.

342
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,430
No one had come back.

343
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,080
Amusement troupe's women have not returned home yet?

344
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,860
- Lower. 
 - No, no, below there.

345
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,100
No, not there.

346
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,400
Come on! Seriously...

347
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,890
- Do it properly! 
 - You can try it yourself, then!

348
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,290
Sir, are you unwell?

349
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,330
I have worked in the Royal Clinic before.

350
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,820
I think I can take a look.

351
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,300
Really?

352
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,550
I think I got indigestion from lunch.

353
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,900
It is not getting better even after bleeding all 10 fingers.

354
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,010
Gosh, is that so?

355
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,470
Let me take a look.

356
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,530
All right...

357
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,820
It is not indigestion.

358
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,590
Sir, you get anxious easily, and your nails break often, do they not?

359
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,520
I do! How did you know?

360
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,970
That is because all your energy is stuck in your liver.

361
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,680
Since it is urgent, take this off first.

362
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,600
- What? 
 - Your foot.

363
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,420
How is it?

364
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,840
My indigestion is gone right away.

365
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,440
H-How amazing.

366
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,980
Take a look at me, too.

367
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,280
My skin right here always twitches.

368
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,910
I am farting a lot these days.

369
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,160
It is so bad.

370
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,100
You seriously want to talk about that?

371
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,650
I am glad Ji Jeon was able to get this, at least.

372
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,700
Is this the medicine Cheong Ta gave me?

373
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,040
Yes. If you take this medicine, you can stay awake for about two more days.

374
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,350
All right, in one go.

375
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,540
Cheong Ta is hiding something.

376
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,970
Did she agree on something with Ak Hee?

377
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,210
That is what I think as well.

378
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,340
I am sure there is something.

379
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,350
All right, in one go.

380
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,900
I need to find out what it is.

381
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,350
How will I find out?

382
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:38,830
In my opinion, we should put Ji Jeon Seo in the lead.

383
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,490
I do not know if it is him or her,

384
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,310
but Cheong Ta loves Ji Jeon Seo—

385
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,680
 - This is Ji Jeon Seo.  
 - My goodness.

386
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,220
Oh, come in.

387
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,980
So, did you take a look?

388
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,780
Yes, they are looking at your chamber from five points.

389
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,520
Five points?

390
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,510
It feels just like a prison.

391
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:11,180
Gosh, are they really so curious whether His Majesty sleeps or not?

392
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,300
Your Majesty, arrest them all and punish them!

393
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,450
Eunuch Neung, turn on more lights inside the room.

394
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,710
So they can see more clearly from the outside.

395
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,510
Sorry?

396
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,180
Are you not going to take the medicine?

397
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,310
I will try enduring without it.

398
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:41,610
I cannot trust Cheong Ta.

399
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,590
I also look like a king from afar.

400
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,400
Do it right. You do not look like His Majesty!

401
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,110
I mean—

402
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,540
H-How long must we keep this up?

403
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,980
Just do it for an hour.

404
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,430
After an hour, you can put the lights out and sleep.

405
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,320
Ji Jeon Seo, let me give it a try.

406
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,370
You can stand here.

407
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,290
His Majesty's chamber's lights went out?

408
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,930
Yes, just now.

409
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,700
It looks like he went to bed tonight.

410
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,460
Is that so?

411
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,240
I am glad.

412
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,860
Have all of this clothing made by tonight?

413
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,550
If you do not finish by morning, I will have this girl

414
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,030
demoted as a water maid and kicked out.

415
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,970
Mark my words.

416
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,470
Your Highness, do you think you can do it?

417
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,610
I do not have any problem with bodily labor, but...

418
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,720
Right?

419
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,060
You are really bad at sewing, Your Highness.

420
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,680
Gosh, stop calling me "Your Highness."

421
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,450
You can just call me Yeon Wol.

422
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,540
How can I call you that?

423
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,700
Hey, why are you here?

424
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,990
Do you want to get punished? Come out.

425
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,090
Hurry up and go, Hong Goon.

426
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,370
I will do what I can.

427
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,860
My goodness.

428
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,000
- Be careful with your fingers. 
 - Okay.

429
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,660
You are holding the thread too closely. Obviously, it will not tear.

430
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,530
How did you come here?

431
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,540
Hurry up and go back.

432
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,400
- N-No, the guards are coming this way. 
 - What?

433
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,870
H-Hurry up and let me— Yes, let me in.

434
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,890
Gosh, over there!

435
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,890
G-Give it to me.

436
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,710
You just need to make this piece?

437
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,830
Please go back quickly. I will be on the lookout for you.

438
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,740
I cannot go back until dawn breaks.

439
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,580
There are too many eyes on me.

440
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,130
You cannot be doing this kind of work.

441
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,250
Did you forget?

442
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,740
I am Asatae's best tailor.

443
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,020
Of course, you will prick yourself if your eyes are on me.

444
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,980
Was it a deep wound?

445
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,350
This is a rusty needle. We must draw out your blood.

446
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:18,280
♫  Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment  ♫

447
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:24,370
♫  Your warmth remains in my heart  ♫

448
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,040
♫  Even if you become wind and cannot hold you  ♫

449
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,760
G-Gosh, you are so good at acupuncture,

450
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,490
but how are you so bad at sewing?

451
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,280
They are the same needles.

452
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,040
That is true, now that I hear you say that.

453
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,000
Why am I so bad?

454
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,930
♫  Even if I grasp, you become blurry  ♫

455
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,180
I am a bit tired.

456
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,340
♫  I'll stay here and wait for you  ♫

457
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:08,480
♫  Even if you disappear again tomorrow, I will wait  ♫

458
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,290
It will help you get rid of the fatigue.

459
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,110
Dried persimmons, huh?

460
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,660
They are dried persimmon from Sangju.

461
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,820
Did you bring them for me?

462
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,450
I mean, not necessarily.

463
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,430
How did you know I like dried persimmon?

464
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:37,430
♫  The memories become more and more blurry  ♫

465
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,680
You need to take the first bite for me to eat.

466
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,510
Please take a bite.

467
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:52,870
♫  Even if you become wind and I cannot hold you  ♫

468
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:58,580
♫  You will keep on living inside me  ♫

469
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,030
How sweet.

470
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,780
It is sweet, right?

471
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,480
You know...

472
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,550
♫  So that I can feel you, please be my wind  ♫

473
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,470
...being round and circular,

474
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,570
it looks like you.

475
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,370
Is it not hard not getting any sleep?

476
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,170
I think I got used to it.

477
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,590
Do not worry about it.

478
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,590
Since the bonghamsal was done,

479
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,950
would the rules not have changed?

480
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:53,980
Are you saying the rule where sleeping makes Ak Hee come out

481
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,300
- could have changed? 
 - Yes.

482
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,900
So, you are telling me to sleep?

483
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,180
What if Ak Hee comes out?

484
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,450
Well, in that case...

485
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,550
If he does, Yeon—

486
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,930
You would have nothing to lose.

487
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,870
No, it actually might be better for you.

488
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,120
You might be glad.

489
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,970
Well, yes. I might be glad.

490
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,970
Yeon Wol.

491
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,920
It is nice to hear you call my name.

492
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,870
 I like it, too. 

493
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,710
 I think I can overcome anything 

494
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,030
 because you are by my side. 

495
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,460
 I knew it. 

496
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,800
 According to Your Majesty's order, 

497
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,100
we have discussed the matter, and we have decided to establish

498
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:16,800
Special Welfare Center to relieve the hardships of the poor.

499
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,810
You will distribute crops collected from landowners to the people and

500
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,710
have them repay in the form of crops or labor by next year.

501
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,490
What will happen to families who are unable to pay back?

502
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,540
Regarding that matter,

503
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,060
the unpaid periods will be converted to low-interest loans and—

504
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,300
It will become a debt in the end.

505
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,200
You want to add debt to the starving people?

506
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,930
Your Majesty, that is not exactly the case because—

507
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,610
It is basically a trickery!

508
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,480
Do you think I am a half-wit?

509
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:03,610
Did I not advise you not to make enemies of the officials?

510
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,500
How could I let them be when they look down on me and fool me?

511
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,000
That is the kind of seat you are in, Your Majesty.

512
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,300
You have to laugh it off even when you see through them to last in your seat.

513
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,010
I cannot do that, Head Minister!

514
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,950
Do you think I placed you there so you can do as you please?

515
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,640
What did you say?

516
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:36,560
Surely, you do not think you were able to

517
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,310
take the throne solely thanks to yourself, are you?

518
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,580
From now on, just listen to this humble one.

519
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:54,940
That is how you will not end up like the late king.

520
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,700
The king cannot insist on using only the indoor archery ground?

521
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,430
That is why they are going on the hunt without me?

522
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,150
The gathering itself was just for those—

523
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:25,100
I mean, the ministers in the first place ever since the late king's reign.

524
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:34,190
In that case, what did the late king do?

525
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,320
Well, he joined them—

526
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,130
No, he led and coordinated the hunt.

527
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,980
Tell Grand Prince Sajo Yoong and the ministers

528
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,590
that I will attend tomorrow's hunt as well.

529
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,010
Sorry?

530
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,160
Go and tell them right now.

531
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,230
Y-Yes, Your Majesty.

532
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,400
You have not slept in three days and are going on a hunt now?

533
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,980
Gosh, what do I do?

534
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,090
Eunuch Neung, Cheong Ta has sent the courier pigeon.

535
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,360
Oh, really?

536
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,430
"As a result of studying the book of the law,

537
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,190
I am regretful to tell you, but...

538
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,340
 once bonghamsal fails, 

539
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,970
 you go back to how you were in the first place." 

540
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,690
Gosh, what do we do?

541
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,340
 "So what I am saying is 

542
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:47,200
 he will turn into Ak Hee like before if he sleeps. 

543
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,830
 It cannot be helped. 

544
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,320
 He should just sleep comfortably and... 

545
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,800
share the body with him.

546
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,790
I will see if there is any other solution in the meantime.

547
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,180
From your—"

548
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,150
"From your lady..."

549
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,090
I have to share my body again?

550
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:38,210
All hail His Majesty!

551
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:51,170
Your Majesty, are you really all right?

552
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,830
I am not all right.

553
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:57,540
Then how about you return to the palace while you still can.

554
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,530
Since you constantly show up in my place, I am saying

555
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:09,330
I am not all right, Grand Prince Yoong.

556
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:13,540
I hope you show more courtesy from now on.

557
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,880
I beg your forgiveness, Your Majesty.

558
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,910
A black deer appears on the western ridge!

559
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,320
Where is it? Where is it, Grand Prince? Geez!

560
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,630
What a waste!

561
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,850
 You look quite at peace, Your Majesty. 

562
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:47,230
 You look happy. 

563
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,240
 I wish you could do other things as you are doing now. 

564
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,540
 What puts you at ease, 

565
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,010
 and what you think is right. 

566
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,110
 That is how everything can be peaceful. 

567
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,220
 Both the people and Asatae. 

568
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,540
 What I think is right... 

569
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,570
Your Majesty, I am sorry you let the black deer escape...

570
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,400
when we almost caught it.

571
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,500
There is no need to be sorry.

572
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,810
Ministers, hear my words.

573
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:27,730
Originally, the hunting festival was meant to promote harmony between the monarch and his subjects.

574
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:33,730
However, I believe it is not right for a politician to find enjoyment in ending precious life.

575
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:39,610
Thus, I will not allow any hunting events within the palace from today onward.

576
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,310
What a half-witted thing to say.

577
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,710
Your Majesty!

578
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,390
- Your Majesty! 
 - Eunuch Neung.

579
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,850
A message from Her Majesty the Queen!

580
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,160
What is it?

581
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,710
Well... Well, you see...

582
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,350
Go on, tell me.

583
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,560
Your Majesty and Her Majesty the Queen...

584
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,890
m-must sleep together.

585
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,860
Sleep together, huh?

586
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,000
Yes, the palace official foretells

587
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,790
that tonight will be a very auspicious day for a union that comes once every three years.

588
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:39,070
Thus, you must visit Her Majesty the Queen's pavilion tonight...

589
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,840
and sleep together...

590
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,470
Deliver my words to the queen's pavilion.

591
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,890
I will not sleep with her.

592
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,760
He refused to sleep with me?

593
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

594
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:04,650
Eunuch Neung, bring me my clothes.

595
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,120
Where are you going?

596
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,960
I am going to the drapery.

597
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,940
Your Majesty, you must not!

598
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,220
What do you expect me to do if you leave your chamber?

599
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,200
I taught you what to do.

600
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,170
Do the shadow play with Officer Ji.

601
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,750
Bring me my clothes now.

602
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:28,550
 Her Majesty the Queen has arrived. 

603
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,440
Take your leave.

604
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

605
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,300
Your Majesty, I sent you a message.

606
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,870
That tonight would be a very auspicious day for us.

607
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,990
Did you also talk about this with the Head Minister?

608
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:56,050
He must have said we must bear a child soon to stabilize my reign.

609
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,790
However,

610
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,820
I have no interest in having a child yet.

611
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,270
Is it because of Yeon Wol?

612
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,590
Please leave. I have business to tend to.

613
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:15,930
If you keep doing this, Father and I cannot protect you.

614
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,030
Are you threatening me right now?

615
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,360
I never asked you two to protect me.

616
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,570
Do as you please.

617
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:29,720
Since you are not leaving, I will have to be the one leaving.

618
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,660
If you reject me like this,

619
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,710
what will the subordinates think of me?

620
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:41,030
Just what did I do so wrong?

621
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,820
I am sorry.

622
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:00,690
Sleep together?

623
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:06,250
B-But I heard His Majesty declined to sleep with her.

624
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:11,370
Everyone is saying Her Majesty has been embarrassed.

625
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:15,720
I am worried this might backfire on you.

626
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:30,350
♫  I will come and meet you  ♫

627
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:37,620
♫  I will come to you where you are breathing  ♫

628
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,260
♫  Close your eyes for a moment  ♫

629
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:49,520
♫  When I am reminded of you in my white dream  ♫

630
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,830
♫  Please embrace me in your arms  ♫

631
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:01,980
 It is not His Majesty. 

632
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:10,960
♫  With my breath, I will send myself to you  ♫

633
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:18,090
♫  The moment the flowers bloom again after this winter  ♫

634
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,760
 I want to see you dressed in this. 

635
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,910
 You will be as pretty as a crepe myrtle flower. 

636
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,790
That is right, Cheong Ta.

637
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,370
You will fall asleep.

638
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,760
You will feel sleepy.

639
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,360
What is wrong with me?

640
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,600
I cannot fall asleep.

641
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,470
My goodness.

642
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,940
There you go.

643
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,350
You should have taken the medicine I sent you.

644
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,540
You just had to make me come here.

645
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:53,200
Ak Hee, I have done my part with this.

646
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,200
It should be enough.

647
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,670
Good job, Cheong Ta!

648
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,280
Did I surprise you?

649
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,750
I heard you declined to sleep with her.

650
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,370
Is that why you came?

651
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:12,990
Was it because of me?

652
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:18,410
 Sajo Hyeon, did you decline because of Kyera? 

653
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,130
You are getting ahead of yourself.

654
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,570
It was not because of you.

655
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,320
I did not want to be manipulated by the Queen and the Head Minister.

656
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,390
Yes.

657
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,090
I thought it was because of me.

658
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,340
Did you wish it was because of you?

659
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,030
Yes.

660
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,810
I see.

661
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,220
That was how I felt,

662
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,560
but you cannot act that way.

663
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,850
You might face more difficulties.

664
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:04,140
I also will not be able to stay by your side anymore.

665
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,620
Is that why you are recommending that I sleep with her?

666
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,700
You hoped that I had rejected her because of you,

667
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,100
and then you are now telling me a detestable lie?

668
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,350
I know I am telling a detestable lie.

669
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:20,970
I know it is different from how I feel.

670
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,390
However, Your Majesty and I cannot be together.

671
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:28,580
And I am only staying briefly at the palace to help you.

672
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,420
Now I realize...

673
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,620
you came to prepare your heart, Kyera.

674
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:39,600
So that our feelings do not get more serious.

675
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,150
Perhaps so.

676
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,550
Go back.

677
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,810
I would like to be alone.

678
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,980
I also missed you.

679
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,070
I just...

680
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,230
might have found an excuse.

681
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:11,140
Having loving feelings fogged up my heart,

682
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,470
and I often do not even know myself.

683
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:19,800
Oftentimes, my longing for you blinded

684
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,060
my heart and my judgment.

685
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,520
 Sajo Hyeon, how dare you take my woman... 

686
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,420
I see.

687
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:39,640
In that case,

688
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:45,210
let me help you make sound judgments again.

689
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:50,210
I will go back to the palace...

690
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,080
and sleep with the Queen.

691
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:58,450
 That face... 

692
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,340
 Kyera... 

693
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,500
 how can you do this to me? 

694
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,550
Your Majesty!

695
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:29,800
Bring me more alcohol.

696
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,600
His Majesty is headed this way to unite with you.

697
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,340
What?

698
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,080
Warm up the bath again.

699
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,620
Decorate the bedchamber again.

700
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,650
Hurry up and spray the room with musk perfume right now!

701
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:44,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

702
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,110
What are you all doing?

703
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:55,330
Noh Ri Sa, bring Yeon Wol right now.

704
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

705
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,010
 I also missed you. 

706
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,930
 Because of loving feelings... 

707
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:16,050
 oftentimes, my longing for you blinded 

708
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:19,310
 my heart and my judgment. 

709
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,770
 Kyera, did you let Sajo Hyeon grow on you? 

710
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,840
 Sajo Hyeon and not me? 

711
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:57,000
Please announce his arrival.

712
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,070
His Majesty the Emperor has arrived.

713
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,220
 Escort him in. 

714
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:28,590
Your Majesty, you have arrived.

715
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:38,490
I had her serve me starting today.

716
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:41,160
Would that be okay with you, Your Majesty?

717
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:45,600
The Inner Court's matters are your authority.

718
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:23,590
Shall we all stay outside and wait?

719
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:28,110
Her Majesty said Yeon Wol and I are to guard this place.

720
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:31,350
You can get out of here, Eunuch Neung.

721
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,850
 Kyera, 

722
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:21,290
 you like Sajo Hyeon, not me? 

723
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:23,580
 Sajo Hyeon. 

724
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:37,950

725
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,120
♫  When the deep darkness consumes me  ♫

726
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:03,180
♫  My eyes soak up the sadness  ♫

727
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:09,870
♫  My heart is scarred deeply  ♫

728
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:16,810
♫  Please fill it up with your warmth  ♫

729
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:20,290
♫  Because I was always yours  ♫

730
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:23,960
♫  And you were always mine  ♫

731
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:30,510
♫  I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere  ♫

732
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:33,970
♫  The place where you are  ♫

733
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:39,970
♫  Even if it'll only be a moment  ♫

734
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:46,040
   

735
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,310
 It was different to call it madness. 

736
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:55,500
 You never had feelings for me as your lover? 

737
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,910
 I am sorry. 

738
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,500
 You should get on good terms and share the body— 

739
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,260
 He took my woman from me! 

740
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:07,010
 That girl knows your father. 

741
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,310
 It feels like something else is unfolding. 

742
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:14,760
 I cannot bear to watch you risk your life anymore. 

743
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,540
 Kyera.
