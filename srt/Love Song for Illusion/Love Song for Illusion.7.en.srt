12
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,590
All right, the tax report from two years ago.

13
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

14
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,930
From two years ago...

15
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,240
Here you go.

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,880
Okay.

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,390
What have you been smiling about since earlier?

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,630
Seeing you working hard to prepare for the meeting

19
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,600
makes this humble one so proud.

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,270
You were such a tiny little genius with brilliant eyes.

21
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,450
And now you have become a stately king like this,

22
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,740
looking after national affairs.

23
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,160
I would not be hungry even if I were to starve.

24
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,770
It does not seem you starved.

25
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,530
Well, it was figurative speech.

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,670
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

27
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,760
Your Majesty.

28
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,670
His Majesty the Emperor enters!

29
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,590
I will now...

30
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,790
begin the meeting.

31
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,420
First off, I would like to discuss increasing the amount of rice for the poor.

32
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,340
According to...

33
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,490
According to what I have researched-

34
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,670
Your Majesty!

35
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,410
Please allow me, Minister of Finance Hae Chan, to speak.

36
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,200
I am sorry to inform you,

37
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,940
but increasing the amount of rice for the poor is difficult in many ways.

38
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,900
- Most of all-
- I read the report you all submitted.

39
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,770
You are saying it is difficult because the landowners and the officials will have to pay more tax.

40
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,840
Your Majesty, I reckon you should not take the root of the problem so lightly.

41
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,480
How did I take it lightly?

42
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,980
I have been researching the issue of tax collection for many years.

43
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,250
According to what I researched-

44
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,920
Half-wit.

45
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,250
What a king we have here.

46
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,250
What research could a half-wit do?

47
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,320
Do we have to keep serving such a half-wit as our king?

48
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,180
The warehouse for our people becomes emptier each year,

49
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,870
but the ministers are building more warehouses each year, based on what I know.

50
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,320
What is the matter with you?

51
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,460
People would say you are trying to kill me to take the throne if they saw us!

52
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,510
Are you not him?

53
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,630
As such, the Minister of Finance built a new warehouse last fall and-

54
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,430
Your Majesty!

55
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,360
It is true this humble one built a new warehouse last fall.

56
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,300
But that was all to provide for the people.

57
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,230
Aigoo, what a half-wit.

58
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,140
I will end up a half-wit like him.

59
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,780
Half-wit, half-wit.

60
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,590
Half-wit.

61
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,400
Half-wit.

62
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,580
He is a half-wit who has no interest in managing a nation.

63
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,950
Your Majesty!

64
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,110
As the Minister of Defense, in order to bolster Asatae's strong army-

65
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,590
Shut your mouth, all of you!

66
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,380
Father.

67
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,510
Your Majesty.

68
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,830
Your Majesty!

69
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,950
Did you see His Majesty's face?

70
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,710
Of course, I did.

71
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:19,090
I was really worried he might start crying.

72
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,830
Anyhow, what shall we do about raising the tax on the officials?

73
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,340
Gosh, I know!

74
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,570
I am sure His Majesty will mention it again at the next meeting. My goodness.

75
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,030
What are you all so worried about?

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,330
Jo-sam-mo-sa.
[Jo-sam-mo-sa: Using trickery to deceive and mock]

77
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,900
We only need to give a sweet gift of trickery to the Half-wit.

78
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,430
Are you telling me to stay quiet in front of the ministers?

79
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,710
Your Majesty, it has only been three days since you took the throne.

80
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:03,460
There is no need to touch on the tax issue this soon, which the ministers are most sensitive about.

81
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,990
Let Grand Prince Sajo Yoong do the tough job of dealing with the officials.

82
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you really believe Grand Prince Yoong is doing a tough job?

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,870
Grand Prince Yoong is manipulating the officials and instigating the public for an unjust cause.

84
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,560
Were you aware already?

85
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,530
Were you also aware, Head Minister?

86
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,710
In that case, you must become even more flexible.

87
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,630
You need to coax those who have been tamed by Grand Prince Sajo Yoong

88
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,890
and turn them into your own men.

89
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,010
This humble one will help you,

90
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,940
so please trust me and follow suit.

91
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,780
Your Majesty, you are walking fast to stay awake, right?

92
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,960
- No.
- Aigoo.

93
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,960
You have not slept for three days now.

94
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,900
Is Ji Jeon Seo still not done?

95
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,350
Yes.

96
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,170
He said he would send a carrier pigeon as soon as he found Chung Ta's location.

97
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,580
But it still has not come.

98
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,440
Chung Ta is clearly avoiding me.

99
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,800
How strange.

100
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,070
Chung Ta would avoid Ak Hee that-

101
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,820
I can understand her avoiding Sir Ak Hee, but why would she avoid you?

102
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,780
She even came to the palace to redo bonghamsal.

103
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,090
That is my question.

104
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,940
Gosh, I just cannot understand.

105
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,290
Whoa, Your Majesty!

106
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,740
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

107
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,530
Chung Ta!

108
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,810
Where are you, Chung Ta?

109
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,850
Chung Ta!

110
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,700
He is desperately looking for me, my Ji Jeon-

111
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,150
Chung Ta!

112
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,670
I am here-

113
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,370
Please come to your senses, Chung Ta!

114
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,300
Please!

115
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,560
Chung Ta, Chung Ta!

116
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,150
Jeon Seo-

117
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,920
Stop! Do not do it!

118
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,520
I am sorry, Jeon Seo.

119
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,770
Oh, my.

120
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,010
Your Majesty, are you waiting for someone?

121
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,090
No.

122
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,320
To the Royal Council Hall.

123
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

124
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,730
I-It is His Majesty.

125
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,170
Her Highness Consort Hyo?

126
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,930
Aigoo, how unfortunate.

127
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,930
Working at the laundry is really hard.

128
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,580
I am sorry.

129
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,050
I will have her make you Consort Hyo right now.

130
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,660
Please do not.

131
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,370
I can stay here only by following Her Majesty's order.

132
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,650
It is also easier to spy within the palace as a palace lady.

133
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,220
Still...

134
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,270
I was ready for this.

135
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,220
I will do my best to help you from where I am.

136
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,890
So, please do your best to set this country right.

137
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:42,510
Your Majesty, you came here to see Her Highness Consort Hyo.

138
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,310
Your Majesty, there are too many eyes around us.

139
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,550
Oh, my, His Majesty?

140
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,790
He is looking at us, right?

141
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,910
Is it me?

142
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,740
You really think so? My goodness...

143
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,120
Your Highness.

144
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,740
Your Highness.

145
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,290
Wash them again.

146
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,750
Court Lady, we have washed them three times now.

147
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,350
Are you her servant?

148
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,650
Wake up!

149
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,430
She is a palace lady now, just like you!

150
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,490
Having been the Crown Prince's concubine at one time?

151
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,710
I had also once been graced by the late king!

152
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,940
That is not the reason-

153
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,390
These!

154
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,090
And these!

155
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,530
Go and wash all of them again!

156
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,290
Court Lady, I can wash them again as many times as you want.

157
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,180
However, if you are trying to tame me, giving me some other work would be better.

158
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,990
What? How dare you!

159
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,410
I heard Her Majesty cherishes this blanket cover.

160
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,850
It is made up of thinly woven hemp fiber,

161
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,050
so it will be damaged and lose its embroidery when washed too many times.

162
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,340
Really?

163
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,790
Rinse all of them again and hang them up.

164
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,140
The moment you come back, get to work in the sewing room!

165
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,580
You just let me see you helping her.

166
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,490
I will hand you over to the Palace Supervisory for a beating!

167
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,950
What are you all doing? Get to work!

168
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,010
She talked back?

169
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,700
How impertinent.

170
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,120
Should I order a severe punishment?

171
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,530
No, I must see how much she can take.

172
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,650
Tell them to keep giving her work so she cannot rest even for a moment.

173
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

174
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,740
How is Consort Cheong Myeong doing in the prison?

175
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,460
I hear she is adapting fine.

176
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,700
Is Grand Prince Sajo Yoong still not visiting her?

177
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,980
That is what I heard.

178
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,700
Keep giving her food in larger portions.

179
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,240
So, Consort Cheong Myeong's face will become nice and fat.

180
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

181
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,410
So delicious.

182
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:53,170
Gosh, how is my appetite so ravenous when my heart

183
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,330
is endlessly disturbed?

184
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,760
Is it because I have nothing to do?

185
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,410
Hello.

186
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,250
You are not Yoong.

187
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,020
Gosh, Grand Prince is being too harsh on me.

188
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,070
His mother is withering away behind bars,

189
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,660
yet he has not visited once!

190
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,270
What are you looking at?

191
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,410
Tell the Grand Prince that his mother is nearing death!

192
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,450
Huh? Are you really going?

193
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,340
Look! Hey! Look!

194
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,830
When will Grand Prince Yoong get me out?

195
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,660
Please get me out of here!

196
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,510
I am itchy all over! It is driving me crazy!

197
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,460
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong has arrived.

198
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,690
Let him in.

199
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,040
Have you called for me, Your Majesty?

200
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,700
Are you feeling unwell?

201
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,180
You have been looking pale ever since I saw you this morning.

202
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,470
Sajo Hyun is...

203
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,220
not getting any sleep?

204
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,840
Yes, his chamber's lights go out only after dawn arrives.

205
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,580
Because there is no need for lights at dawn.

206
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,540
This means he has not slept in three days.

207
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,630
He could not sleep for three days...

208
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,510
He will not sleep?

209
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,440
I am fine.

210
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,650
I ordered Consort Cheong Myeong to be released.

211
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,640
Why are you keeping her there?

212
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,240
Was Consort Cheong Myeong not found innocent?

213
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,160
She was, but...

214
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,650
she is guilty of daring to frame Consort Hyo

215
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,210
which should not be easily forgiven.

216
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,980
She must be placed on probation.

217
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,630
Consort Cheong Myeong is quite pitiful.

218
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,640
She has such a cold-hearted son.

219
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,630
I am the pitiful one.

220
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,840
I have a mother who is unworthy to be a mother.

221
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,850
I still received more than enough love from Father,

222
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,870
so I guess I should call myself fortunate.

223
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,990
You did.

224
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,010
The late king did favor you a lot.

225
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:18,430
By the way, do we still not have the one who killed Father?

226
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,580
I know who murdered His Majesty.

227
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,330
It was your hyung!

228
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,320
Sajo Yoong.

229
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,780
Sajo Yoong could do worse things.

230
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,810
He is not even his biological father. What is there to hesitate?

231
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,070
It is being investigated discreetly,

232
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,480
so it will be revealed soon enough.

233
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,960
Of course, it will.

234
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,630
By the way, when will you fulfill your promise to me?

235
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,720
Promise...

236
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,400
That Ak Hee. What did he promise Grand Prince?

237
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,110
Do you not remember?

238
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,010
Who knows? I might give this to you.

239
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,510
The one who takes this becomes the king of this country, right?

240
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,920
Hyungnim,

241
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,980
as long as you help me.

242
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,700
Sajo Yoong that bastard is persistent.

243
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,800
Hey, Sajo Hyun, tell him you know.

244
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,730
Tell him to wait.

245
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,580
Yes, right!

246
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,560
Say, "Wait, Grand Prince."

247
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,560
"Wait, Grand Prince."

248
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,550
Wait, Grand Prince.

249
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,980
That is right!

250
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,790
What do you mean, wait?

251
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,870
Was our promise a matter of waiting or not?

252
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:05,450
You said we would go hunting together once you become the emperor.

253
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,160
Sounds like you are joking with me, Your Majesty.

254
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,960
Gosh, Sajo Yoong, that bastard.

255
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,130
No, no! That was not it.

256
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,990
That was not it!

257
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,550
How could it be a joke?

258
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,120
I remember there was a different promise I made to you.

259
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,330
Whoa! Sajo Hyun, you are quite perceptive.

260
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,600
This is nerve-racking.

261
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,090
I need to hurry and get out of here.

262
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,050
Wait.

263
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,440
And release Consort Cheong Myeong immediately.

264
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,300
Did I not tell you?

265
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,420
Consort Cheong Myeong must reflect in prison for-

266
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,200
It is a royal decree, Grand Prince Sajo Yoong.

267
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,310
Bonghamsal will not work anymore?

268
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,870
That is what Chung Ta said?

269
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

270
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,480
Wait...

271
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,780
did you not say she came to the palace a few days ago?

272
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,260
She did.

273
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,520
Back then, she said bonghamsal would not work because you were not here.

274
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,160
Why is Chung Ta changing her words now?

275
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,960
The thing is...

276
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:16,210
This is a book of laws that is handed down each generation in our shaman association.

277
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,490
But I did not know there was such a condition.

278
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,800
Where was it again? Just give me a moment.

279
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,770
There.

280
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,820
One who was released from bonghamsal

281
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,080
cannot be put under bonghamsal again.

282
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,070
Right?

283
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,740
But I heard His Majesty was the one who released Ak Hee.

284
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,790
Then he cannot be put under bonghamsal again. It will not work.

285
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,460
It is written here. Cannot be put-

286
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,740
You did not know such an important fact?

287
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,930
Yeah.

288
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,940
To be honest, I do not really like to read.

289
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,820
I read and forget everything.

290
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,340
When do I have the time to read all of this?

291
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,840
When there are so many things to see.

292
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,550
Wow, that Chung Ta is such a quack.

293
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,270
How can such a person be a shaman who travels to and from the afterlife?

294
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,350
Remember the ornament used for bonghamsal?

295
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,550
Find it and burn it. That is how you undo bonghamsal.

296
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,170
I will listen to you and stop causing trouble.

297
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,880
So let us save Kyera first, okay?

298
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,200
In that case, is there no other way?

299
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,600
So, Ak Hee will come out again once I fall asleep?

300
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,790
About that...

301
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,830
A-About that?

302
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,000
Chung Ta said she needs to

303
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,860
read the said book to the end to find out.

304
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,920
That wretched shaman!

305
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,650
Chung Ta, you little!

306
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,420
Damn it!

307
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,310
Gosh, I am sure she saw it.

308
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,500
Lock up Sajo Hyun.

309
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,710
If you do not lock him up,

310
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,460
I will tell your shaman association all your crimes.

311
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,670
You know what will happen to you, right?

312
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,940
Your shaman life is over.

313
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,220
You can never return to the heavens.

314
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,860
This is all because of you, Female Chung Ta!

315
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,230
Only if you did not fall head over heels for Ak Hee back then!

316
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,490
Gosh, you little wench!

317
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,460
I will just die! I cannot live because of you!

318
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,760
- It is your fault!
- Gosh, it hurts!

319
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,150
Not the face!

320
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,740
Yes, I am blind for love!

321
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,100
Is it a sin to love?

322
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,750
Also,

323
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,310
I like someone else now.

324
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,890
My dear Ji Jeon Seo.

325
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,070
I am serious this time.

326
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,690
What do I do about her?

327
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,780
Master Yang.

328
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,150
I have been to the village you mentioned.

329
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,820
Already?

330
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,730
What you said was true.

331
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,240
Sajo Yoong's henchmen have kept the location hidden for a long time.

332
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,140
He is also only rumored to have helped the poor.

333
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,860
But he never actually helped anyone.

334
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,080
Just as I expected.

335
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,680
I am sure other things are not any different.

336
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,790
Wind Knife is looking into the other rumors.

337
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,780
Even at the village I visited, a woman was taken as an amusement troupe.

338
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,900
However, she has not come back yet.

339
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,110
But His Majesty ordered all of them to go home.

340
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,450
I heard they all left the palace after that day.

341
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,160
Could it be that they have not arrived yet?

342
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,040
The village close to the palace was just the same.

343
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,230
No one had come back.

344
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,980
Amusement troupe's women have not returned home yet?

345
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,060
- Lower.
- No, no, below there.

346
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,300
No, not there.

347
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,600
Come on! Seriously...

348
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,990
- Do it properly!
- You can try it yourself, then!

349
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,090
Sir, are you unwell?

350
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,430
I have worked in the Royal Clinic before.

351
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,020
I think I can take a look.

352
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,400
Really?

353
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,650
I think I got indigestion from lunch.

354
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,100
It is not getting better even after bleeding all 10 fingers.

355
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,110
Aigoo, is that so?

356
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,270
Let me take a look.

357
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,130
All right...

358
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,020
It is not indigestion.

359
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,890
Sir, you get anxious easily, and your nails break often, do they not?

360
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,620
I do! How did you know?

361
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,070
That is because all your energy is stuck in your liver.

362
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,880
Since it is urgent, take this off first.

363
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,100
- What?
- Your foot.

364
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,220
How is it?

365
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,290
Wow!

366
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,940
My indigestion is gone right away.

367
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,140
H-How amazing.

368
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,080
Take a look at me, too.

369
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,380
My skin right here always twitches.

370
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,010
I am farting a lot these days.

371
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,260
It is so bad.

372
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,800
You seriously want to talk about that?

373
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,450
I am glad Ji Jeon was able to get this, at least.

374
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,800
Is this the medicine Chung Ta gave me?

375
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:05,240
Yes, if you take this medicine, you could stay awake for about two more days.

376
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,350
All right, in one go.

377
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,640
Chung Ta is hiding something.

378
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,070
Did she agree on something with Ak Hee?

379
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,310
That is what I think as well.

380
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,440
I am sure there is something.

381
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,250
All right, in one go.

382
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,000
I need to find out what it is.

383
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,250
How will I find out?

384
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,930
In my opinion, we should put Ji Jeon Seo in the lead.

385
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,590
I do not know if it is him or her,

386
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,410
but Chung Ta loves Ji Jeon Seo-

387
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,780
- This is Ji Jeon Seo.
- My goodness.

388
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,120
Oh, come in.

389
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,080
So, did you take a look?

390
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,680
Yes, they are looking at your chamber from five points.

391
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,820
Five points?

392
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,710
It feels just like a prison.

393
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:11,380
Gosh, are they really so curious whether His Majesty sleeps or not?

394
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,400
Your Majesty, arrest them all and punish them!

395
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,650
Eunuch Neung, turn on more lights inside the room.

396
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,810
So they can see more clearly from the outside.

397
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,210
Sorry?

398
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,280
Are you not going to take the medicine?

399
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,510
I will try enduring without it.

400
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,610
I cannot trust Chung Ta.

401
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,590
I also look like a king from afar.

402
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,600
Do it right. You do not look like His Majesty!

403
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,010
I mean-

404
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,640
H-How long must we keep this up?

405
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,180
Just do it for an hour.

406
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,330
After an hour, you can put the lights out and sleep.

407
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,420
Ji Jeon Seo, let me give it a try.

408
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,470
You can stand here.

409
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,210
Geez...

410
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,390
His Majesty's chamber's lights went out?

411
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,130
Yes, just now.

412
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,900
It looks like he went to bed tonight.

413
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,360
Is that so?

414
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,140
I am glad.

415
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,060
Have all of this clothing made by tonight?

416
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,750
If you do not finish by morning, I will have this girl

417
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,230
demoted as a water maid and kicked her out.

418
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,870
Mark my words.

419
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,570
Your Highness, do you think you can do it?

420
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,710
I do not have any problem with bodily labor, but...

421
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,920
Right?

422
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,260
You are really bad at sewing, Your Highness.

423
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,780
Gosh, stop calling me "Your Highness."

424
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,550
You can just call me Yeon Wol.

425
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,340
How can I call you that?

426
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,900
Hey, why are you here?

427
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,790
Do you want to get punished? Come out.

428
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,190
Hurry up and go, Hong Gun.

429
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,170
I will do what I can.

430
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,060
My goodness.

431
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,000
- Be careful with your fingers.
- Okay.

432
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,560
You are holding the thread too closely. Obviously, it will not tear.

433
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,630
How did you come here?

434
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,640
Hurry up and go back.

435
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,500
- N-No, the guards are coming this way.
- What?

436
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,970
H-Hurry up and let me- Yes, let me in.

437
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,790
Aigoo, over there!

438
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,090
G-Give it to me.

439
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,910
You just need to make this piece?

440
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:54,930
Please go back quickly. I will be on the lookout for you.

441
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:57,940
I cannot go back until dawn breaks.

442
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,480
There are too many eyes on me.

443
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,930
You cannot be doing this kind of work.

444
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,350
Did you forget?

445
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,540
I am Asatae's best tailor.

446
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,820
Of course, you will prick yourself if your eyes are on me.

447
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,780
Was it a deep wound?

448
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,150
This is a rusty needle. We must draw out your blood.

449
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:18,280
♫ Even if you disappear, even if it is only for a moment ♫

450
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:25,800
♫ Your warmth remains in my heart ♫

451
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,140
♫ Even if you become wind and cannot hold you ♫

452
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,860
G-Gosh, you are so good at acupuncture,

453
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,590
but how are you so bad at sewing?

454
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,380
They are the same needles.

455
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,140
That is true, now that I hear you say that.

456
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,630
Why am I so bad?

457
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:52,030
♫ Even if I grasp, you become blurry ♫

458
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,380
I am a bit tired.

459
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:00,250
♫ I'll stay here and wait for you ♫

460
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:08,580
♫ Even if you disappear again tomorrow, I will wait ♫

461
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,400
It will help you get rid of fatigue.

462
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,210
Dried persimmons, huh?

463
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,860
They are dried persimmon from Sangju.

464
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,120
Did you bring them for me?

465
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,450
I mean, not necessarily.

466
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,370
How did you know I like dried persimmon?

467
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:37,630
♫ The memories become more and more blurry ♫

468
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,780
You need to take the first bite for me to eat.

469
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,130
Please take a bite.

470
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:52,970
♫ Even if you become wind and cannot hold you ♫

471
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:58,780
♫ You will keep on living inside me ♫

472
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,230
How sweet.

473
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,630
It is sweet, right?

474
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,580
You know...

475
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:15,750
♫ So that I can feel you, please be my wind ♫

476
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,970
being round and circular,

477
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,370
it looks like you.

478
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,170
Is it not hard not getting any sleep?

479
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,370
I think I got used to it.

480
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,390
Do not worry about it.

481
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,690
Since bonghamsal was done,

482
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,150
would the rules not have changed?

483
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,180
Are you saying the rule where sleeping makes Ak Hee come out

484
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,500
- could have changed?
- Yes.

485
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,100
So, you are telling me to sleep?

486
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,380
What if Ak Hee comes out?

487
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,650
Well, in that case...

488
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,450
If he does, Yeon-

489
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,030
You would have nothing to lose.

490
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,970
No, it actually might be better for you.

491
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,020
You might be glad.

492
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,170
Well, yes. I might be glad.

493
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,770
Yeon Wol.

494
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,920
It is nice to hear you call my name.

495
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,070
I like it, too.

496
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,910
I think I can overcome anything

497
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,930
because you are by my side.

498
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,260
I knew it.

499
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,000
According to Your Majesty's order,

500
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,200
we have discussed the matter, and we have decided to establish

501
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,600
Special Welfare Center to relieve the hardships of the poor.

502
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,910
You will distribute crops collected from landowners to the people and

503
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,910
have them repay in the form of crops or labor by next year.

504
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,690
What will happen to families who are unable to pay back?

505
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,440
Regarding that matter,

506
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,060
the unpaid periods will be converted to low-interest loans and-

507
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,400
It will become a debt in the end.

508
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,400
You want to add debt to the starving people?

509
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,030
Your Majesty, that is not exactly the case because-

510
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,710
It is basically a trickery!

511
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,280
Do you think I am a half-wit?

512
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,410
Did I not advise you not to make enemies of the officials?

513
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:09,600
How could I let them be when they look down on me and fool me?

514
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,200
That is the kind of seat you are in, Your Majesty.

515
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,400
You have to laugh it off even when you see through them to last in your seat.

516
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,110
I cannot do that, Head Minister!

517
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,950
Do you think I placed you there so you can do as you please?

518
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,640
What did you say?

519
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:36,760
Surely, you do not think you were able to

520
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:43,110
take the throne solely thanks to yourself, are you?

521
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,680
From now on, just listen to this humble one.

522
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,840
That is how you will not end up like the late king.

523
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,900
The king cannot insist on using only the indoor archery ground?

524
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,530
That is why they are going on the hunt without me?

525
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,250
The gathering itself was just for those-

526
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,700
I mean, the ministers in the first place ever since the late king's reign.

527
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:34,290
In that case, what did the late king do?

528
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,420
Well, he joined them-

529
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,030
No, he led and coordinated the hunt.

530
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,080
Tell Grand Prince Sajo Yoong and the ministers

531
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,690
that I will attend tomorrow's hunt as well.

532
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,110
Sorry?

533
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,260
Go and tell them right now.

534
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,130
Y-Yes, Your Majesty.

535
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,340
Aigoo.

536
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,500
You have not slept in three days and are going on a hunt now?

537
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,880
Gosh, what do I do?

538
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,190
Eunuch Neung, Chung Ta has sent the courier pigeon.

539
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,160
Oh, really?

540
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,430
As a result of studying the book of the law,

541
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,290
I am regretful to tell you, but...

542
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,440
once bonghamsal fails,

543
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,970
you go back to how you were in the first place.

544
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,590
Aigoo, what do we do?

545
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,440
So what I am saying is

546
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,300
he will turn into Ak Hee like before if he sleeps.

547
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,930
It cannot be helped.

548
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,420
He should just sleep comfortably and...

549
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,900
share the body with him.

550
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,890
I will see if there is any other solution in the meantime.

551
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:00,780
From your-

552
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,150
From your lady...

553
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,550
Aigoo, geez...

554
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,990
I have to share my body again?

555
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,110
All hail His Majesty!

556
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,270
Your Majesty, are you really all right?

557
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,930
I am not all right.

558
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:57,440
Then how about you return to the palace while you still can.

559
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,630
Since you constantly show up in my place, I am saying

560
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,230
I am not all right, Grand Prince Yoong.

561
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:13,340
I hope you show more courtesy from now on.

562
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,780
I beg your forgiveness, Your Majesty.

563
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,610
A black deer appears on the western ridge!

564
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,210
Aigoo!

565
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,420
Where is it? Where is it, Grand Prince? Geez!

566
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,430
What a waste!

567
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,950
You look quite at peace, Your Majesty.

568
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,030
You look happy.

569
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,340
I wish you could do other things as you are doing now.

570
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,740
What puts you at ease,

571
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:57,410
and what you think is right.

572
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,010
That is how everything can be peaceful.

573
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,020
Both the people and Asatae.

574
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,740
What I think is right...

575
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,270
Your Majesty, I am sorry you let the black deer escape

576
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,300
when we almost caught it.

577
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,600
There is no need to be sorry.

578
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,010
Ministers, hear my words.

579
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,830
Originally, the hunting festival was meant to promote harmony between the monarch and his subjects.

580
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:33,930
However, I believe it is not right for a politician to find enjoyment in ending precious life.

581
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:39,310
Thus, I will not allow any hunting events within the palace from today onward.

582
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,310
What a half-witted thing to say.

583
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,910
Your Majesty!

584
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,490
- Your Majesty!
- Eunuch Neung.

585
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,950
A message from Her Majesty the Queen!

586
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,260
What is it?

587
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,810
Well... Well, you see...

588
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,750
Go on, tell me.

589
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,160
Your Majesty and Her Majesty the Queen...

590
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,490
m-must sleep together.

591
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,960
Sleep together, huh?

592
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,100
Yes, the palace official foretells

593
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:33,890
that tonight will be a very auspicious day for a union that comes once every three years.

594
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:38,870
Thus, you must visit Her Majesty the Queen's pavilion tonight

595
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,840
and sleep together...

596
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,570
Deliver my words to the Queen's pavilion.

597
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,690
I will not sleep with her.

598
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,860
He refused to sleep with me?

599
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

600
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,850
Eunuch Neung, bring me my clothes.

601
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,220
Where are you going?

602
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,060
I am going to the drapery.

603
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,140
Your Majesty, you must not!

604
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,320
What do you expect me to do if you leave your chamber?

605
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,300
I taught you what to do.

606
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,270
Do the shadow play with Officer Ji.

607
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:24,150
Bring me my clothes now.

608
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,490
Goodness...

609
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,350
Her Majesty the Queen has arrived.

610
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,540
Take your leave.

611
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

612
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,500
Your Majesty, I sent you a message.

613
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,970
That tonight would be a very auspicious day for us.

614
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:51,090
Did you also talk about this with the Head Minister?

615
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:56,150
He must have said we must bear a child soon to stabilize my reign.

616
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,690
However,

617
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:01,720
I have no interest in having a child yet.

618
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,170
Is it because of Yeon Wol?

619
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:09,690
Please leave. I have a business to tend to.

620
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:16,030
If you keep doing this, Father and I cannot protect you.

621
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:19,130
Are you threatening me right now?

622
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,460
I never asked you two to protect me.

623
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,470
Do as you please.

624
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:29,220
Since you are not leaving, I will have to be the one leaving.

625
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,660
If you reject me like this,

626
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,810
what will the subordinates think of me?

627
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,930
Just what did I do so wrong?

628
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,620
I am sorry.

629
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:00,790
Sleep together?

630
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:06,150
B-But I heard His Majesty declined to sleep with her.

631
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,470
Everyone is saying Her Majesty has been embarrassed.

632
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:15,320
I am worried this might backfire on you.

633
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:31,480
♫ I will come and meet you ♫

634
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:38,520
♫ I will come to you where you are breathing ♫

635
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,260
♫ Close your eyes for a moment ♫

636
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:49,520
♫ When I am reminded of you in my white dream ♫

637
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,840
♫ Please embrace me in your arms ♫

638
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,580
It is not His Majesty.

639
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:11,020
♫ With my breath, I will send myself to you ♫

640
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:19,090
♫ The moment the flowers bloom again after this winter ♫

641
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:21,860
I want to see you dressed in this.

642
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,430
You will be as pretty as a crepe myrtle flower.

643
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,790
That is right, Chung Ta.

644
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,370
You will fall asleep.

645
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,660
You will feel sleepy.

646
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,160
What is wrong with me?

647
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,400
I cannot fall asleep.

648
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,470
My goodness.

649
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,640
There you go.

650
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,550
You should have taken the medicine I sent you.

651
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:48,740
You just had to make me come here.

652
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:53,100
Ak Hee, I have done my part with this.

653
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,900
It should be enough.

654
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,370
Good job, Chung Ta!

655
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,080
Did I surprise you?

656
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,950
I heard you declined to sleep with her.

657
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,270
Is that why you came?

658
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,390
Was it because of me?

659
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:17,710
Sajo Hyun, did you decline because of Kyera?

660
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,330
You are getting ahead of yourself.

661
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,770
It was not because of you.

662
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:27,320
I did not want to be manipulated by the Queen and the Head Minister.

663
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,190
Yes.

664
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,890
I thought it was because of me.

665
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,240
Did you wish it was because of you?

666
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,830
Yes.

667
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,610
I see.

668
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,320
That was how I felt,

669
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,760
but you cannot act that way.

670
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,050
You might face more difficulties.

671
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:03,940
I also will not be able to stay by your side anymore.

672
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,820
Is that why you are recommending me to sleep with her?

673
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,800
You wished I would reject her because of you,

674
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,200
but you are now lying ever so hypocritically?

675
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,450
I know I am being a hypocrite and a liar.

676
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:21,170
I know it is different from how I feel.

677
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:24,490
However, Your Majesty and I cannot be together.

678
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,480
And I am only staying briefly at the palace to help you.

679
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,320
Now I realize...

680
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,720
you came to prepare your heart, Kyera.

681
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,400
So that our feelings do not get more serious.

682
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,250
Perhaps so.

683
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,750
Go back.

684
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,610
I would like to be alone.

685
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,880
I also missed you.

686
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,870
I just...

687
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,030
might have found an excuse.

688
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:11,240
Having loving feelings fogged up my heart,

689
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,270
and I often do not even know myself.

690
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:19,900
Oftentimes, my longing for you blinded

691
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,860
my heart and my judgment.

692
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:30,620
Sajo Hyun, how dare you take my woman...

693
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,320
I see.

694
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,440
In that case,

695
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,010
let me help you make sound judgments again.

696
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,010
I will go back to the palace...

697
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,880
and sleep with the Queen.

698
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:58,650
That face...

699
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,140
Kyera...

700
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,300
how can you do this to me?

701
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,650
Your Majesty!

702
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,000
Bring me more alcohol.

703
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,700
His Majesty is headed this way to unite with you.

704
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,140
What?

705
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,180
Warm up the bath again.

706
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,820
Decorate the bedchamber again.

707
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,850
Hurry up and spray the room with musk perfume right now!

708
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

709
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,910
What are you all doing?

710
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:55,530
Noh Ri Sa, bring Yeon Wol right now.

711
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

712
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,110
I also missed you.

713
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,030
Because of loving feelings...

714
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:16,250
oftentimes, my longing for you blinded

715
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,110
my heart and my judgment.

716
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:24,670
Kyera, did you let Sajo Hyun grow on you?

717
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,640
Sajo Hyun and not me?

718
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,200
Please announce his arrival.

719
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,270
His Majesty the Emperor has arrived.

720
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,020
Escort him in.

721
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,810
Oh, my.

722
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:28,590
Your Majesty, you have arrived.

723
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:38,590
I had her serve me starting today.

724
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,060
Would that be okay with you, Your Majesty?

725
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,400
The Inner Court's matters are your authority.

726
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:23,290
Shall we all stay outside and wait?

727
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:28,210
Her Majesty said Yeon Wol and I are to guard this place.

728
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:31,050
You can get out of here, Eunuch Neung.

729
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,950
Kyera,

730
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:21,390
you like Sajo Hyun, not me?

731
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,280
Sajo Hyun.

732
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,420
♫ When the deep darkness consumes me ♫

733
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:03,380
♫ My eyes soak up the sadness ♫

734
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,770
♫ My heart is scarred deeply ♫

735
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,910
♫ Please fill it up with your warmth ♫

736
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:20,390
♫ Because I was always yours ♫

737
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:24,360
♫ And you were always mine ♫

738
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:30,610
♫ I see, hear, and feel you from anywhere ♫

739
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:34,070
♫ The place where you are ♫

740
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:39,170
♫ Even if it'll only be a moment ♫

741
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:44,740
[Love Song for Illusion]

742
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:50,510
It was different to call it madness.

743
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,700
You never had feelings for me as your lover?

744
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:57,010
I am sorry.

745
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:00,600
You should get on good terms and share the body-

746
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,360
He took my woman from me!

747
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,110
That girl knows your father.

748
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,410
It feels like something else is unfolding.

749
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:14,860
I cannot bear to watch you risk your life anymore.

750
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,330
Kyera.
