1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,067
Don't be mistaken

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:05,467
thinking that you know me so well.

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,833
I doubt you have any idea

4
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:11,767
what kind of a person I am.

5
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,700
I was wrong about you.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,967
I really have no single idea

7
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,533
of what kind of a person you are, Platoon Leader.

8
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,833
I don't even want to know anymore. But...

9
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,133
I do want to know what happened to Song I.

10
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,833
You should mind your own business.

11
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:32,700
No, I must know.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,500
Say it now. Say it.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,800
I said, "Say it!"

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
Please hold yourself back, Platoon Leader.

15
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,367
That comrade is quite awful, but please just let it go.

16
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:46,167
Enough is enough. How dare you disrespect your superior!

17
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,733
Lloyd, you can get locked up for this, you idiot.

18
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:51,100
Say you're sorry, man.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
Why don't you just take this?

20
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,767
 I was wrong about you. 

21
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:31,267
 I really have no single idea 

22
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:33,367
 what kind of a person you are, Platoon Leader. 

23
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:36,133
 I don't even want to know anymore. 

24
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,467
Relax, man.

25
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,633
Tell me what happened, Lloyd. What's going on?

26
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:47,767
Lloyd, I knew that

27
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,833
you'd get beaten up one day by Comrade Platoon Leader.

28
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,200
You aren't any better than her.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,267
How long have you known about the latest mission?

30
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,733
Before the filming?

31
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:59,300
What do you mean? You were the only one who didn't know about it!

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,167
You said we were fellow soldiers.

33
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,600
You said we were on the same team!

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,033
Comrade No, we had no idea

35
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,500
that you didn't know about it.

36
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,200
We thought that you knew all about the mission.

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,967
Isn't it odd that you were the only one who didn't know about it?

38
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,067
Don't you think so?

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,033
You're going to get locked up.

40
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,267
It's Han Song I's jacket found in Comrade No's locker.

41
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:35,100
I didn't find anything noteworthy.

42
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,433
You may go.

43
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,567
Unification.

44
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,167
I'll give you a holiday pass.

45
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,767
Go rest up for a few days.

46
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,700
I have guard duty for the upcoming event—

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,767
I said, rest up.

48
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:01,000
Thank you, Comrade Vice Commissioner.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,267
Hello, Yeon Gyeong? It's me, Lloyd.

50
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,167
 My goodness. You're finally answering my call. 

51
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,833
You ignored my text message too.

52
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,533
 I'm not doing it. 

53
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,667
But you can't say no before hearing me out.

54
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,400
Whenever you call me, it is never good news, Vice Commissioner Lee.

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,100
 This time, it's good news. 

56
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,700
It's a party. A special garden party.

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,800
 No, thanks. 

58
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,067
It's the mayor's order.

59
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:51,500
 You must attend. 

60
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,533
I'm not interested.

61
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,867
 Wait. 

62
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,467
 Quality information. Quality information. 

63
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:00,067
There will be guerrilla training soon.

64
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,167
 It'll be very rigorous. 

65
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm hanging up now.

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,833
Guerrilla training…

67
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,167
But guerrilla training is really rigorous.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,167
Then, right before the peace treaty,

69
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,900
they were all named warriors. Is that right?

70
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,600
Because they were dispatched to the South concealing their social class from the start,

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,767
the Republic gave them social status and compensation thereafter.

72
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,067
I see.

73
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,800
Is everything well with Comrade Director?

74
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,167
Yes, my father is well.

75
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:37,033
Sorry to bother him with a trivial request when he's so busy.

76
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,067
It's not a problem.

77
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,630
You may go.

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,950
Unification.

79
00:04:51,280 --> 00:05:00,310


80
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,033
I've been looking for you everywhere.

81
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,633
You have time for that?

82
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,033
Don't you have guerrilla training soon?

83
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,700
I'm in great shape. Please don't worry.

84
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,100
You must survive on your own at this guerrilla training.

85
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,400
If you fail, you die.

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,367
Don't you know why I came back here?

87
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:21,933
It's because of Song I.

88
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,400
Stop leaving me out of things and cooperate.

89
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Stop leaving me out of things and cooperate.

90
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,067
Must I repeat myself?

91
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,100
It's none of your business.

92
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,800
Complete your military duty diligently

93
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,367
and get discharged.

94
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:32,767
Okay, okay.

95
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:35,000
If that's how you're going to be,

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,267
I'll just figure it out on my own.

97
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,767
Figure what out on your own?

98
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:43,333
I can think for myself.

99
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,633
Don't bother thinking.

100
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,133
If you behave flippantly,

101
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,067
I'll not let it slide then.

102
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:57,800
Not let it slide? What can you do anyway?

103
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,233
Going forward, you won't be allowed

104
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:04,267
to leave or stay out overnight.

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,067
Got that?

106
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,800
That's too harsh.

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,900
But…

108
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,267
Hello?

109
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,000
 Attorney Seo Hee Ji? 

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
Wait.

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,367
Didn't we agree to be friends?

112
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,200
Oh, right.

113
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,767
We're friends.

114
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:36,567
You agreed too easily.

115
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,567
It seems like you have a favor to ask.

116
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,867
Were you able to find out anything about Han Song I?

117
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:46,533
I want to be the first one to know.

118
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,800
There isn't much information in the South.

119
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,300
 Other than the fact that she's a big fan of FITA. 

120
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,500
 Pyeonghwa City's security is on the line. 

121
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,367
 And it really seems like she has ties to North Korea. 

122
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:01,233
The key thing is there's information that she's a hacker.

123
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,467
A hacker?

124
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:03,700
Anything else?

125
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,267
At this point, it should be "give and take."

126
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,667
 Do me a favor too. 

127
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:11,267
 A South Korean conglomerate is hosting 

128
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:14,400
and Pyeonghwa City is supporting this fundraising party.

129
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,367
Will you attend it as my partner?

130
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm sorry, but I don't want to go to that.

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,733
You don't want to go?

132
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,733
But I have another important piece of information.

133
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,900
No, I don't want to…

134
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,467
Important information?

135
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,733
Where are you going?

136
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,100
You sister is coming.

137
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,300
I'll be right back.

138
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,200
I heard someone's giving out free gifts.

139
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,833
Don't go too far. Okay?

140
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,133
Okay.

141
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,367
Don't run!

142
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,367
Are you okay?

143
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:26,633
Yes, I'm fine.

144
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,967
Here.

145
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,133
Are you heading to the store?

146
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,367
Yes. Why?

147
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:39,267
Well, my sister said she was coming,

148
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:43,067
but I'm not familiar with the streets, so I'm really late.

149
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,033
Then she must be worried.

150
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,233
Should we head over together?

151
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,667
Mi Rae.

152
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,600
Where have you been?

153
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,633
I was worried.

154
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,333
Sis.

155
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,067
Don't scold her too harshly.

156
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,667
I think she got lost trying to get back.

157
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
Don't go out by yourself again.

158
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,700
Understood?

159
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,067
You got lucky.

160
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,933
You ran into me, so you didn't get lost,

161
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,433
and you got a nice gift too.

162
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,567
Thank you, Comrade Seong.

163
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,067
Come on. Don't call me, "Comrade Seong."

164
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,333
Just call me "oppa" from now on.

165
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,033
That's how they all refer to each other in South Korea.

166
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,000
Bye, Mi Rae.

167
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,167
Let's go.

168
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,900
Don't go around by yourself again. Okay?

169
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,467
There you go. All finished.

170
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,067
You need to take your medicine now.

171
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,233
It doesn't taste good.

172
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,800
You don't take medicine for its taste.

173
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Don't make me worry and just take it. Okay?

174
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,533
"Don't run. Eat slowly."

175
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,967
"Don't skip your medicine."

176
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,400
Did I nag that much?

177
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:49,067
Your hand looks just like Mother's.

178
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,833
Your hands take after Mother's.

179
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,033
I take after Father.

180
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,033
Mi Rae, when you grow up,

181
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:58,100
you're going to become such a beauty like Mother.

182
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,400
- Really? 
 - Yes.

183
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,500
So take good care of yourself until you get surgery. Okay?

184
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,233
And don't get into trouble.

185
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,300
Gosh, you're nagging again.

186
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,833
 So just tell me exactly what that is. 

187
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,033
 You'll be in danger if you hold on to that. 

188
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,333
 No, actually, 

189
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,000
 I need to make sure you don't have it 

190
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,233
 to ensure your safety. 

191
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:27,667
I'm about to go insane. Seriously.

192
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,267
What's this?

193
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,067
Is something wrong with Mi Rae?

194
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,700
Her heart

195
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,933
has some issues.

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,567
Have a quick drink and sleep tight.

197
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,333
If you worry too much,

198
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,333
you'll grow old.

199
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:22,633
Comrade Jae Hoon.

200
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,800
Call me Jae Hoon.

201
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:28,533
Is that the right name?

202
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,233
Weren't you, along with your name, reported dead?

203
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,900
So you knew already.

204
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,133
Seong Jae Hoon of the Republic did die.

205
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,600
The person who is here now

206
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,400
is Lee Jae Hoon, the bartender of Uno Pub.

207
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,500
This one thought came to mind after being on the verge of death numerous times.

208
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,100
"For once,

209
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,833
I want to live an ordinary life like everyone else."

210
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:10,933
You've never thought that way?

211
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,600
You need to eat a lot to be healthy.

212
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,767
Try this too.

213
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,833
Look.

214
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,667
Which one is prettier?

215
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,667
They're both pretty.

216
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,233
Are you going somewhere nice?

217
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,867
The old man from Uno Pub

218
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,767
and I were invited to an event for separated families.

219
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:35,233
I heard that many high-ranking officers of Pyeonghwa City will be there too,

220
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:39,467
so I plan to ask them to grant all our requests.

221
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:40,700
Is that right?

222
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,500
Then I'll call a taxi for you.

223
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,067
You can ride it there with Mr. Seok.

224
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,967
The owner of Uno Pub was invited too,

225
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,633
so don't worry about our transportation.

226
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:01,167
I never thought I'd have to take care of you while you were in the military.

227
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,567
- Hey. 
  - It stinks here. 

228
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,900
I have a question.

229
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,667
When I joined the military, I heard someone at the company was so excited

230
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,620
that he or she even clapped. Do you know who that was?

231
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm so happy that I even canceled my vacation to be with you.

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,867
Do you have any desire to re-enlist with the Unified Armed Force Unit?

233
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:22,267
You can even eat chocolate here.

234
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,000
Lloyd, there's a more urgent task here.

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
A Carlini suit is a must.

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,200
What do you think, Lloyd? I've got good sense, right?

237
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,267
Your partner in crime and everlasting stylist.

238
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,800
Jeong Man Gong, you know?

239
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,867
I'm so amazing.

240
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:58,767
Where are you going?

241
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:01,333
What's it to you?

242
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,833
Aren't we combatting separately on our own?

243
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,500
I thought I told you, you aren't allowed to leave.

244
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,049
Did you forget?

245
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,566
   

246
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:17,367
I told them that I didn't want to go to a formal, fundraising party.

247
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,567
But the people at the top

248
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:21,700
insisted that I attend as a VIP.

249
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,900
That's why I'm going.

250
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,867
The unit members all went in security vehicles. Why don't you come with me?

251
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:27,967
I'm not interested.

252
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,300
It's not that you're not interested,

253
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,000
but perhaps you've been excluded from guard duty.

254
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,533
Don't you know me well? That's not the case.

255
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,100
How would I know what kind of a person you are, Platoon Leader?

256
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,833
It's not like we were close.

257
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,000
I didn't complain, but frankly speaking,

258
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,600
whenever we run into each other, don't terrible things happen?

259
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,933
I got stabbed, shot, fell off a cliff,

260
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,000
I got stabbed, shot, fell off a cliff,

261
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,100
and swimming in the water and kissing…

262
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:55,167
Have you ever thought about why you keep

263
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,200
endangering yourself?

264
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,300
If anyone overhears you, he or she might mistakenly think you're concerned about me.

265
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,100
I'd never be, so don't you worry.

266
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,733
Wait!

267
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,667
This is...

268
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,433
my leave pass.

269
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,833
Keep up the good work. Unification!

270
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:02,600
   
   

271
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,267
It seems small in scale and private,

272
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:43,333
but quite a lot of political and business leaders come to this party.

273
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,133
They can be cold-blooded when it comes to their own benefits,

274
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,667
but they act nice on the outside.

275
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:53,033
Enjoy networking.

276
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,300
   

277
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,367
   

278
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,033
Why is today's party

279
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:45,267
noted on Song I's schedule?

280
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,100
 The owner of Uno Pub was invited too, 

281
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,900
 so don't worry about our transportation. 

282
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
 And... 

283
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,867
 what's "dress code"? 

284
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:57,467
 "Dress code"? 

285
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:01,867
 It says, I must wear something purple. 

286
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,267
You can't go in looking like that.

287
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,600
What do you mean?

288
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,567
This is a party.

289
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:27,533
You can't go in wearing a military uniform.

290
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,300
I'll be quick. Step aside.

291
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,133
The mayor will be here too.

292
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:36,233
Don't you know the manual?

293
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,100
Platoon Leader!

294
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,933
We meet again, Vice Commissioner Lee.

295
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:51,433
Yes, hello. What brings you here?

296
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,067
This is the mayor of our city, Pyeonghwa City—

297
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:55,733
Mom, this is my friend, Lloyd.

298
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:59,467
Lloyd, please say hello. It's my mom.

299
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:03,000
Thank you all for coming looking stunning.

300
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,300
Especially, Mr. Lloyd,

301
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,133
nice to meet you.

302
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:06,933
Thank you.

303
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,467
Wait,

304
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,767
mom and daughter…

305
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:13,733
Aren't I a little more beautiful than my mom?

306
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,600
Yes, of course.

307
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,533
Excellent.

308
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:18,967
Mr. Lloyd.

309
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:21,067
I really look forward to your speech

310
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,833
regarding the donation after dinner.

311
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,367
Sp… Speech?

312
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,600
Sure, the speech. Yes.

313
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,900
What happened?

314
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,933
Come on. Please.

315
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,100
Speech, my foot.

316
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,767
Thank you.

317
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:32,467
Can I get a refill, please?

318
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,800
I didn't make a fuss to save your face.

319
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,933
But I can't do this anymore.

320
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,200
But you asked me to help you.

321
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,567
Just one more. Just one more.

322
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,000
Just one last time with this one.

323
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,800
Please.

324
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:11,067
 These shoes go with that dress. Make sure she wears them. 

325
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:13,633
 Otherwise, she'd just come in her military boots. 

326
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:15,867
Excuse me.

327
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:18,367
Can you tell me where these shoes are?

328
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,433
Excuse me.

329
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:22,400
These shoes, please!

330
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,267
The man who makes impossible possible.

331
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:46,300
Gong Jeong Man.

332
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,340
­Damn!

333
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,367
Did you come because you were worried about me?

334
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:48,633
I'm regretting my decision to come, so don't talk to me.

335
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:50,833
You look pretty.

336
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,867
Comrade No.

337
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,433
Hello.

338
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,833
So this is the guest you mentioned earlier?

339
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,167
Yes, I guess so.

340
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,467
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

341
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,967
Mayor Won is looking for you.

342
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:06,600
Well then, enjoy the party.

343
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,867
Today's event

344
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:24,400
is to support the organization, which is the reason for Pyeonghwa City's existence

345
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,500
and the largest civic group.

346
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,533
It's an event to support the Separated Families Council.

347
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:33,067
I hope that you enjoy the games set up at all parts of the party hall

348
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:36,700
and provide various sponsorships and meaningful donations.

349
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,200
I wish you an exciting party

350
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,933
and an enjoyable dinner.

351
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,433
That's a lovely dress.

352
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,167
Would you like some?

353
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:14,500
Challenge! Let's get started.

354
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,200
That was close.

355
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,300
Sadly, he was eliminated.

356
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,067
Okay, not much time is left now.

357
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:26,567
Does anyone else want to go for it?

358
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:28,967
I'll go for it!

359
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:31,333
All right, we've got the final contestants.

360
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,033
Okay, if this couple wins the game,

361
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:35,633
no less than 100 million won will be donated.

362
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:37,300
- Yes, that's right. 
 - 100 million won?

363
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,367
It's 100 million won.

364
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,767
Isn't that amazing?

365
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,200
It's by an anonymous sponsor.

366
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,433
Lloyd, the lead dancer and the lead singer of FITA,

367
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:49,900
requested the donation to be made to establish the Children's Heart Foundation in Pyeonghwa City.

368
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,400
Is that correct?

369
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
Yes, it is.

370
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,233
Of course, in order to donate, you must complete this successfully.

371
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,833
Okay.

372
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,533
Please come on the stage.

373
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,667
If you're ready, we'll get started.

374
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:15,000
Please take a deep breath. Let's start it

375
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,167
with a loud cheer.

376
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,167
Please go for it whenever you're ready.

377
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,700
Put me down now.

378
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,200
I don't want to.

379
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,800
It's 100 million won to establish the Children's Heart Foundation.

380
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,367
Children's Heart Foundation?

381
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,867
This isn't a scam, so don't worry.

382
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,867
Okay, your hand.

383
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:37,900
My hand?

384
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,233
You have to put your arm around me in order for me to balance myself.

385
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:41,700
Do it now.

386
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,267
Hurry.

387
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:44,967
Here we go.

388
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:09,500
Successful! Amazing!

389
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,233
Okay, Lloyd, who is as tough as steel.

390
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,033
With his strong willpower,

391
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:17,467
he's able to donate 100 million won to the Children's Heart Foundation.

392
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:20,433
That was amazing. Congratulations!

393
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,400
Excuse me.­

394
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,933
Can I ask you a question?

395
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:48,500
What's your hometown?

396
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,833
Well…

397
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,333
Wait. The owner of the Michelin restaurant?

398
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,867
Hello.

399
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:56,000
I grew up in Seoul.

400
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,567
Your entire life?

401
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, my entire life.

402
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,133
I was born in Masan

403
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:05,067
and grew up in LA. When I was in LA—

404
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:08,900
You really aren't from North Korea?

405
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:11,000
No.

406
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,100
 This is the last time. 

407
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,833
Shadow?

408
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,033
 I ran out of patience a long time ago. 

409
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:01,733
 Don't expect any more chances. 

410
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,967
 Two weeks. 

411
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:06,100
 There will be an agreement ceremony between two Number Ones 

412
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,900
 for both North and South to go in and out of Pyeonghwa City freely. 

413
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,200
 If you miss that timing, 

414
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,767
 that will be your end. Don't you forget. 

415
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,300
It must be hard for you, Comrade No.

416
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,533
You're always in the center of attention and have to endure any criticism.

417
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:29,933
You only realized that now?

418
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,800
But what can I do?

419
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,600
My fans say I'm an idol that will only happen once in a thousand years.

420
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,867
I accept it as my fate.

421
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,780
How pretty.

422
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,800
You look so pretty today.

423
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,200
Don't bluff.

424
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,433
I wasn't bluffing.

425
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,333
Please excuse us for a moment.

426
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:28,067
Darn it.

427
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:30,267
That guy is so rude.

428
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:31,833
- Look, man. 
 - Lloyd.

429
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,400
The mayor is looking for you. Come at once.

430
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,133
The mayor? What now?

431
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:37,100
The speech.

432
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,233
You were sitting in the van again, weren't you?

433
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:40,267
Where have you been?

434
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:48,033
They're pretty, but they don't suit you.

435
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,767
You're right.

436
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,333
Why do women of South Korea

437
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:56,933
wear such strangely-shaped sandals like these? I don't get it.

438
00:31:56,933 --> 00:32:00,333
People on the other side aren't like you and me.

439
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,033
Be careful.

440
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,933
Don't you worry.

441
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:09,533
There are only two groups of people.

442
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,200
Either enemies or comrades.

443
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,867
Targets and nontargets.

444
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,833
Which one am I?

445
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,867
Pyeonghwa City has become...

446
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,800
very special to me now.

447
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:24,433


448
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:25,833
♫  Believe that you will return  ♫

449
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,533
♫  Whatever it is, I believe in you  ♫

450
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:28,800
♫  I can't find you anymore  ♫

451
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,333
♫  I believed in our hearts in those days  ♫

452
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,267
♫  Even though it may be foolish to turn around  ♫

453
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:35,933
♫  Back to that time on my way  ♫

454
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:38,333
♫  How are you doing? Goodbye  ♫

455
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:41,533
♫  Who will understand my feelings? Oh, my heart  ♫

456
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:45,333
♫  Only you can know. Know my heart  ♫

457
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,767
♫  I can't breathe no more  ♫

458
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:49,533
♫  A little more, a little more  ♫

459
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:51,500
♫  I'm getting closer to you  ♫

460
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,333
♫  Don't look back and don't hesitate  ♫

461
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,967
♫  This day won't come again  ♫

462
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,167
♫  Tonight  ♫

463
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:00,567
♫  Don't turn away  ♫
