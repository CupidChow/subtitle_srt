1
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:17,220


2
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,033
 Get out of my way! 

3
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,300
 I said, "get out of my way!" 

4
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:30,667
 Let me have some. 

5
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,867
 Cut that out. 

6
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,233
 This is hell, got that? 

7
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:37,433
 You have to step on and kill whoever it may be 

8
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:41,200
 in order to survive. Got that? 

9
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:48,100
 Come on. Take it now. 

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,333
Are you really Comrade Jae Hoon?

11
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,433
Yes.

12
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:58,533
It's been so long, Yeong Ok.

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,633
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

14
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:02,633
Gosh, wait.

15
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,067
I think you're embracing her too hard.

16
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,233
The person over here is a patient. Okay?

17
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,067
What if the wound opens up and bleeds again?

18
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,267
What? Comrade Baek, are you crying?

19
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,067
So I bleed or cry. So what?

20
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,300
Mind your own business, Comrade No!

21
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,667
My fans told me

22
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,533
that I was born with a warm heart.

23
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,233
They must've not seen the true nature behind that iron mask of yours, Comrade No.

24
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,267
What iron mask?

25
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:37,700
You must've watched the music video of our second album.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,700
I really am something. Seriously.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,500
But who is this?

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,967
Is he your fellow countryman from North Korea?

29
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:51,067
I'd say, we're much closer than that.

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,733
It doesn't seem like you're siblings.

31
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:56,967
Do you go to the same church?

32
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,767
It's none of your business, Comrade No.

33
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,700
But I'm sure I could be of great help if I made it my business.

34
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,033
I won't bore you with the details about who I am…

35
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,200
Hey, Comrade Baek.

36
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:14,500
Comrade, you talk and look

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,200
like a South Korean now.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,567
You haven't changed much

39
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,700
from our days in the training center.

40
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,767
We lost touch after we left the training center,

41
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:27,233
so I thought you were dead, Comrade Seong.

42
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,533
I did almost die.

43
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:33,833
Did I injure my head after joining the military?

44
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,467
Why do I keep worrying about her?

45
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,167
W-Wait a minute.

46
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,667
There's something going on between the two.

47
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,867
Gosh, who cares?

48
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,900
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

49
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,433
What? Were you injured badly?

50
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,700
A bit during the mission…

51
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,533
So I was discharged.

52
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:09,300
It must've been quite serious if you had to get discharged.

53
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,867
What are they doing?

54
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,533
There are children around. Why is he lifting up his shirt?

55
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,533
What a pervert.

56
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:29,000
He's so sly.

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,267
   

58
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:54,667
Those scars are terrible. You must have nearly got killed.

59
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,133
Do you want to see more? I have some on my back, too.

60
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,133
No, it's okay.

61
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,033
I'm fine now. I just need to get physical therapy from time to time.

62
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,733
That's why you're here at the hospital…

63
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:10,333
What about you? It seems like you got hurt badly.

64
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,633
This is no big deal.

65
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:19,700
Now that the unification is near, there are no dangerous missions to carry out.

66
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,533
What happened?

67
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,233
Because of some jerk who is like a minefield,

68
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,733
it got complicated.

69
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:34,133
"Jerk"? What do you mean?

70
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:37,700
I doubt you're referring to me who saved your life.

71
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,267
She's referring to someone whose personality and actions are terribly mean. Don't you see?

72
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:45,367
I saw you carelessly taking off your shirt earlier.

73
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,667
Comrade Lieutenant Baek, can I have a word with you?

74
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,533
By the way, who is this guy?

75
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,600
Is he your subordinate, Yeong Ok?

76
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,100
Pretty much.

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,667
Subordinate?

78
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,267
Says who? I'm not your subordinate.

79
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:03,900
I don't belong to your unit.

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,267
Don't you see that she and I are in a conversation?

81
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,367
What a rude lad.

82
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:13,167
"Don't you see"? "Rude"?

83
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,100
Stop talking casually to me.

84
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,467
Excuse me. I have good stage and table manners.

85
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:21,333
I even have good toilet manners.

86
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,333
No one has ever called me rude.

87
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:27,367
Well then.

88
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:31,200
Get lost, will you? Show some manners.

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,133
This is a life or death matter to me, so I can't do that.

90
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,867
A life or death matter?

91
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:37,867
Involving Comrade Yeong Ok?

92
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,200
- No. 
 - Yes.

93
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,000
Please don't get the wrong idea.

94
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:48,167
Could you please leave us alone now if nothing is urgent?

95
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:51,000
It is. It's totally urgent. Let's go.

96
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,600
Let go of her hand at once.

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,700
You let go first.

98
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,333
Don't you know who I am?

99
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,400
Oh, FITA.

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,667
You're not a spy at least.

101
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,367
But your name was…

102
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,233
Avon?

103
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,433
Mr. Lloyd?

104
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:33,400
My greatness just oozes out even if I'm wearing something like this.

105
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,433
Yes, hello.

106
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,700
What can I do for you?

107
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,333
Oh, would you like my autograph?

108
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,400
Let go of me. My fan's waiting.

109
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,600
Gosh, seriously.

110
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,633
Can I also borrow a pen…

111
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:47,833
Attorney Kim gave me a call.

112
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:52,467
Mr. Lloyd, I'm Seo Hee Ji of JNY.

113
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,467
This isn't what I intended.

114
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,833
You bluffer.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,367
Well then, go about your business with your competent lawyer.

116
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,600
She and I still have more to catch up on.

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,433
Go now.

118
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:12,233
You've been asking for a lawyer all day long.

119
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,233
Shall we?

120
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:28,633
I've never seen a male comrade as noisy and unfocused as he is.

121
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:31,633
If Lloyd's fans heard what you said, they'd consider you their enemy.

122
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,033
But I can't help it.

123
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,267
The South Korean female comrades

124
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,600
are so attracted to him.

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,233
I really don't understand.

126
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,367
They're even willing to risk their lives.

127
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,467
I operate a small pub in Pyeonghwa City.

128
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,600
Come visit sometime.

129
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,900
Yes, okay.

130
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,467
There was an order to assign you to the Defense PR Support Unit,

131
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:13,900
but you were suddenly sent to the Unified Armed Force Unit.

132
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,600
I don't understand.

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,700
I don't understand, either.

134
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,167
This isn't an ordinary unit, but Special Forces.

135
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,700
This isn't a place for me.

136
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,933
It's a conspiracy. It totally is.

137
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,267
A conspiracy?

138
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:30,767
They even threatened me earlier about possessing an illegal weapon.

139
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:33,033
Threatened you?

140
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,233
It was disguised as a persuasion, but was actually a threat.

141
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,100
As for the possession of an illegal weapon,

142
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,967
we can resolve the misunderstanding if Ms. Baek Yeong Ok testifies.

143
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:44,333
But you said, she isn't cooperative. Right?

144
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,400
We have to make her cooperate somehow.

145
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,800
But the unit assignment is a military matter,

146
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,300
so it won't be easy to resolve.

147
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,300
My life's always been this way.

148
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,400
Before or after my debut,

149
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,533
nothing's ever been easy for me.

150
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,033
But you know what?

151
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,267
I never give up.

152
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,400
It makes it interesting, you know?

153
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,900
I'll see you again after doing some additional research.

154
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,867
I look forward to working with you, ma'am.

155
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,333
My name is Seo Hee Ji.

156
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,533
Okay, Attorney Seo Hee Ji.

157
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,567
See you later.

158
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,267
I'll take the case.

159
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,667
The client is Lloyd of FITA.

160
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:53,967
If anything goes wrong, tens of millions of their fans will hate me.

161
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:58,633
Besides, it's a complicated case involving even higher-ups.

162
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,267
You come out even at best.

163
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:06,667
My network, academic, family background, and understanding of idol stars are stellar.

164
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,600
Despite all other aspects,

165
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,933
I'm the most qualified person for this.

166
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,500
That gun was fake, wasn't it?

167
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,867
You're the one who told me that.

168
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,833
So what?

169
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,533
Are you asking me to testify that Comrade Vice Commissioner Lee is lying?

170
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,167
That's exactly it.

171
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,900
Just tell the truth. Simple, isn't it?

172
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,400
You have a South Korean lawyer on your side.

173
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,967
Why do you need my confirmation?

174
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,667
If a North Korean comrade testifies,

175
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:36,467
they won't be able to threaten me anymore.

176
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,700
I'm a soldier. I only follow orders.

177
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,000
I won't open my mouth so carelessly.

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,533
But that gun was fake. You know that.

179
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:46,433
I'm just asking you to tell the truth.

180
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:51,867
I won't do it. I didn't receive an order to do so.

181
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,800
To that man earlier,

182
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,400
it looked like you would give him anything he asks for.

183
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,000
But why do you treat me like this?

184
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:05,667
I've known him since he saved my life when we were little. I owe him my life.

185
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,500
What about me? I saved your life, too!

186
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,733
Don't you dare compare yourself to him.

187
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:10,900
It's not the same.

188
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,933
Gosh.

189
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,100
Look at you glaring.

190
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,200
Look softly.

191
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,800
Glaring?

192
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,700
You're shooting lasers out of your eyes.

193
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,333
I feel like my skin is burning.

194
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,933
Just tell the truth.

195
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,567
That's all I'm asking for.

196
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,667
You just need to say it once.

197
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,833
Gosh, that stings.

198
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,133
Thank you. Goodbye.

199
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,300
Welcome.

200
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:13,933
You operate that restaurant without a single day of rest. Aren't you tired?

201
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,233
What will you do with all that money you earn?

202
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:20,233
The more money you earn, the better it is. Isn't it?

203
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:24,033
By the way, what are you putting up?

204
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,033
A love letter. My love letter.

205
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:30,867
"Because I, the poor one, love Natasha,

206
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:34,333
heavy snow is falling tonight."

207
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,533
Isn't your wife in North Korea?

208
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,033
Natasha?

209
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,767
Are you in love with a woman from Russia?

210
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,633
No, that's not it.

211
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:47,267
It's a poem written by a poet whom my wife used to love.

212
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,567
I see.

213
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,800
This verse is my favorite.

214
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,300
"I think of Natasha

215
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,000
and Natasha will come for sure."

216
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:02,000
As long as I remember her,

217
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,567
she'll come for sure.

218
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,333
- Don't you think so? 
 - Yes, of course.

219
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,067
You'll see each other again for sure.

220
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,150
   

221
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,820
 Hello. 

222
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,730
   

223
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,833
Will she really show up here knowing that she might die?

224
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,767
I was skeptical, but she assured me.

225
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,633
 If you won't stop hunting me down, 

226
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,967
 I'll disappear with the file forever. 

227
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:04,000
 You know that it's not possible to disappear forever. 

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,533
 We aren't the only ones who are after you. 

229
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,367
 Then what do you want from me? 

230
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:10,133
 You betrayed the organization to save that singer. 

231
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,933
 You'd better return if you want to save him. 

232
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:17,467
 If you do anything to Lloyd, I'll not let you slide. 

233
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,300
Jae Hoon.

234
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:43,100
Park Il Doo, the North Korean authority figure of the Unified Security Agency of Pyeonghwa City.

235
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,133
He rose to the top while I was gone.

236
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,467
It's going to hurt quite a bit when he falls.

237
00:14:56,033 --> 00:15:00,467
Yo. Do you want to eat out over the weekend, Do Hyeon?

238
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,233
Is there somewhere nice to go in Pyeonghwa City?

239
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,133
I've done research...

240
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,600
on all the places with good reviews.

241
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,667
Let's go check them out, man.

242
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,033
Wow.

243
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,333
What a nice life you have.

244
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,267
You have money to burn, don't you?

245
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,467
Sure, John. Let's go out.

246
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's go to a top-rated restaurant, which isn't available in North Korea

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,400
and stuff ourselves.

248
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,833
- Comrade Cheol Gyu. 
 - Yes, sir.

249
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,167
Let's go out too.

250
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,267
Yes, sir.

251
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,933
Hello.

252
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,267
You must be the grandmother of Mi Rae, the new student.

253
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:45,600
- Mom. 
 - Jun Seo, did you have a good day?

254
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,133
I'm not her grandmother,

255
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:50,900
but please help me look after Mi Rae. Thank you.

256
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,500
You must be from North Korea.

257
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,300
I suppose Mi Rae's mom works?

258
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,067
Grandmother, you always pick her up.

259
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,500
Do you think what I'm saying is not worth listening to?

260
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,267
I said, I'm not her grandmother!

261
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,367
Let's go get, "buy one, get one free."

262
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,900
Did I say something offensive?

263
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,267
I've been cleaning up your gifts for four days and three nights straight.

264
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,233
Lloyd, this is a fraction of all the gifts. There are more at your place.

265
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,400
What should we do with all these?

266
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,233
Listen, Jeong Man.

267
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,433
There must be an orphanage run by the municipality of Pyeonghwa City.

268
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:29,567
That plus the children's wards in this hospital.

269
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,200
We should send them to those two.

270
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Okay.

271
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,933
And can you hand me one of our character plush dolls?

272
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:39,367
Character plush doll? Character plush doll?

273
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Here you go, Lloyd.

274
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,000
Gosh, it's so cute. It's so lovely.

275
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,833
There we go.

276
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,033
Are you giving it to her as a gift?

277
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:56,167
But there are nicer and more expensive ones here.

278
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,933
But those are from the fans.

279
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,067
You're right.

280
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,333
Gosh.

281
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,033
Comrade Lieutenant Baek only cares about combat.

282
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:06,800
But who knows? If she sees something as cute and lovely as that,

283
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,900
she might act like a human being, you know?

284
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,767
That's true.

285
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:13,000
Look who's talking. You live with so many dolls.

286
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,567
How come you still don't act like a human being?

287
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:20,400
Grow up.

288
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,433
Did you see that?

289
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,100
Even after seeing something so cute…

290
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,433
Gosh, in any case,

291
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:40,267
that woman has no emotions whatsoever.

292
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,867
What was that?

293
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,333
Why did I have such a weird dream?

294
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,367
That's right.

295
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:59,233
I was heavily traumatized, indeed.

296
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:02,267
It's totally understandable that I'm suffering from PTSD.

297
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,233
But it wasn't even about getting shot or stabbed.

298
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,100
With that woman out of all people.

299
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,367
She pretends to be so tough, but she always has nightmares.

300
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,600
How dare she threw away my thoughtful gift?

301
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,600
This is useful, I'm telling you.

302
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,200
Worry dolls exist for a reason.

What in the world are you doing over here?

There you go again.

318

You're the one who held onto my hand tightly and didn't let me go.

00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,533
I didn't hold your hand.

Why did you come to my side to begin with?

321

Why do you have such wild dreams?

322

I couldn't sleep at all because you were being so loud.

323

Stop bluffing!

324
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,167
I'm not bluffing.

325
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,467
Look. We were holding hands like this. Right?

326
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:13,900
Look and see if I'm the one who held your hand or if it's the other way around.

327
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,867
You didn't let go of it all night. I couldn't pull it out because you're so strong.

328
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:24,467
Gosh, my arm is cramping up so much.

329
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:27,000
Here.

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,067
Hold onto this tightly next time you have a nightmare.

331
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,767
I can't be there to hold your hand every time, you know?

332
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,700
No thanks.

333
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,912
"No thanks." You always say that.

334
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:48,400
Is it that hard to just say, "thank you"?

335
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:04,167
   

336
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,533
Her expression is so angelic.

337
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:17,633
When she talks to me, she acts like an emotionless, human weapon.

338
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:19,733
Who is she talking to that she looks so…

339
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,500
What?

340
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,867
I pressed the orange drink. Why did the cider come out?

341
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,767
Darn it! Seriously.

342
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,833
What a disaster. This machine is a total wreck.

343
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,000
I wasted my money.

344
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,367
Gosh, seriously.

345
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:00,800
Did Ms. Baek Yeong Ok go somewhere?

346
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,367
She's on the phone outside speaking sweetly with her boyfriend.

347
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:05,700
But I repeatedly cautioned her not to move around.

348
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,733
Nurse!

349
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,200
Is her injury quite serious?

350
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,267
It could've been.

351
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,967
I don't know why she wouldn't listen to me, the doctor.

352
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:21,900
Seriously, what's the point of providing good treatment to North Koreans?

353
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,000
What does it have anything to do with being North Korean?

354
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,133
Sorry?

355
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:28,867
It's just that woman who doesn't take care of her own body and refuses to listen.

356
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,900
To a doctor, a person should be either a patient or a potential patient. Right?

357
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,800
Why does it matter if the person is South or North Korean?

358
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,233
Is that the mindset you have working as a doctor?

359
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,167
Gosh, the thing is… What I meant was that…

360
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:39,300
Since I'm North Korean,

361
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,533
I really don't listen. I'm so sorry about that.

362
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:43,467
Well, the thing is…

363
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:44,733
Doctor,

364
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,933
please tighten my bandage wrap.

365
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:49,133
I need to step out.

366
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,533
For reals, man. I mean it.

367
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,600
Hello.

368
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,633
   

369
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,867
My goodness.

370
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,867
Are you okay?

371
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,867
So before the peace treaty, I went to Pyongyang.

372
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:15,300
But the food was amazing.

373
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,200
The North Korean dishes were so delicious.

374
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,800
They were so good.

375
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,700
I'm sure they weren't all that.

376
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,467
No. Have you had Pyongyang-style blood sausage before?

377
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,167
It was so good that I almost died.

378
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,800
Don't make a fuss.

379
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,100
May I… take your order?

380
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,467
Two orders of Gwang Tae set menu and one sparking water.

381
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,867
And what would you like to drink?

382
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,733
I'm sorry,

383
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,500
but could you please repeat that?

384
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,167
Just two orders of Gwang Tae set menu, please.

385
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:47,367
Gwang Tae?

386
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:48,567
Yes.

387
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:51,800
Two of that, please.

388
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay.

389
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,500
Thank you.

390
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,267
Are you sure this is a famous restaurant?

391
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,733
Yes.

392
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:06,700
It's like the three-Michelin-star restaurant. Enough?

393
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,000
It doesn't look like it.

394
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:19,033
When it comes to food, North Korean food tastes the best.

395
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:20,367
Don't you think so?

396
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:21,500
Enjoy.

397
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,200
It reflects our hometown's kindness.

398
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,667
But you didn't receive the same amount of kindness.

399
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,700
What the… What's going on? Bro, that is…

400
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,933
That is not fair, bro. That is not… Where is my meat?

401
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,467
It's a good restaurant, indeed.

402
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:44,633
They understand the customers very well.

403
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,400
This is delicious.

404
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:29,500
You're going out dressed like that?

405
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,233
If you go out like that without taking care of your stab wound,

406
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:38,300
it could even lead to acute kidney injury.

407
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,200
I told you, I'm fine.

408
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,900
I'm going to report everything to your superior

409
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,767
that a soldier of the Republic is going out without receiving permission.

410
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:54,000
Comrade No, don't you cause trouble yourself

411
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,667
and stay in the hospital room.

412
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,933
I've never seen you wear plain clothes. You look pretty.

413
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,500
Where is she going?

414
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,600
Hey, Jeong Man. Take off your clothes.

415
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,733
Quickly.

416
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:12,233
- Take off your pants. 
 - Wait.

417
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,367
Hey.

418
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:17,000
I heard you're from North Korea.

419
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,300
Do you know the Daehongdan potato song?

420
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,167
I do. I watched it on YouTube.

421
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:25,167
 ♪ Potato, potato, the giant potato ♪ 

422
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:29,600
 ♪ I really, really love it ♪ 

423
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,900
Did you really only eat potatoes while in North Korea?

424
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
No.

425
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,933
How come only your grandmother picks you up? You don't have a mom?

426
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,300
No, it's not like that!

427
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,267
Friends shouldn't fight. Okay?

428
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,000
Mi Rae's been waiting for so long.

429
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,067
She's going to be so happy.

430
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:08,833
I just stopped by to see her face before I returned to the unit.

431
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:15,280
The school bus is arriving just in time. What perfect timing.

432
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:26,000
Mother.

433
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,080
"Mother"?

434
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:43,267
Why did you call me "Mother" out of nowhere?

435
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:45,200
I didn't call you that.

436
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,633
I called you my elder sister.

437
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:49,900
Did you? I must have heard it wrong.

438
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,267
You said you'd be back after three nights. What took you so long?

439
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:54,667
I'm sorry.

440
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,433
But still, you can't fake illness. Okay?

441
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:01,567
You're going to stay the night. Right?

442
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,267
Hang on just a little longer.

443
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:09,667
Then, we'll be able to live together.

444
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,467
 I promise I'll find a cure 

445
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:16,267
 for your heart, Mi Rae. 

446
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,667
Comrade No, what are you doing here?

447
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:07,833
Were you following me?

448
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,133
Me? No.

449
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:13,300
I took sick leave and stepped out.

450
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,300
It seems like you're all better to return to the unit now.

451
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,967
Says who?

452
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:21,867
Unless you bring me a letter with orders to return me to the PR Support Unit,

453
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:24,900
I'm not going anywhere.

454
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,900
Then I have no choice, Comrade No.

455
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:36,000
Hey, over there! I'm getting kidnapped!

456
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,933
Gosh, can you handle the consequences

457
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,533
of doing this to me?

458
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:42,667
I'm just following orders to return with you, Comrade Lloyd.

459
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,033
Stop telling me about following orders.

460
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:45,167
Let's go by the law.

461
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,233
Call my lawyer. I'm not going!

462
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:50,167
Obey the order as a soldier of the Unified Armed Force Unit.

463
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:53,733
I said I belong to the Defense PR Support Unit!

464
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,267
It's not because I'm not strong enough.

465
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:04,933
Your stab wound.

466
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,733
Even the slightest touch would make it painful for you.

467
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,900
That's why I'm holding back.

468
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:34,060


469
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,500
Song I.

470
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:09,967
♫  Believe that you will return  ♫

471
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,533

00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,600
