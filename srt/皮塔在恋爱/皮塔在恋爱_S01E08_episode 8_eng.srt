00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:12,133
Pyeonghwa City has become...

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,433
very special to me now.

4
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,833
You didn't do what you were trained to do!

5
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,500
Why didn't you do what you were trained to do, Platoon Leader?

6
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,233
Why were you running to me? What if you got yourself killed?

7
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:22,833
Stay right here.

8
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,720
 ­  

9
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,270
  ­ 

10
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,433
Please exit this way.

11
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,233
Get on.

12
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:27,400
Mom, are you okay?

13
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,867
Lloyd, where are you going?

14
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,933
Lloyd! Lloyd!

15
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,000
You didn't trust me at the end.

16
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,500
I just followed my belief.

17
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,567
Don't say such a thing.

18
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,400
If you risk your life over small matters, you'll end up ruining big things.

19
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,900
Just kill me.

20
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,733
I'd rather get killed by you.

21
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,367
Don't move.

22
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,500
Go.

23
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,567
Jae Hoon.

24
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,800
I said, go, you punk!

25
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,433
Please.

26
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,700
Let Seung Tae go.

27
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,720
  ­ 

28
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:19,500
You should at least wear shoes.

29
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,000
I mean,

30
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,267
does this make sense?

31
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,400
What was the Unified Armed Force Unit doing?

32
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,700
Our comrades are so skilled, almost like ghosts.

33
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,167
He just admitted they were his comrades.

34
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,700
Yes.

35
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,267
They are former members of anti-ROK operations.

36
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:48,667
See? I knew it.

37
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,700
Vice Commissioner Park, you…

38
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,067
We must cut off the funding provided by the South first.

39
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,567
I'll take care of that soon—

40
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,467
And...

41
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:58,500
we have to capture the leader called "Shadow".

42
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,733
Guilty.

43
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:02,467
Once we catch the head, it's game over.

44
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:05,033
From Pyeonghwa City's perspective,

45
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:08,833
we must solve it before the North-South Free Passage Agreement Ceremony.

46
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,967
You two.

47
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,700
Control all the media.

48
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,180
No one should know about yesterday.

49
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,150
​   

50
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,667
What are you doing?

51
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,067
It's none of your business, Comrade Baek.

52
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,600
He's going to stand trial as a DPRK citizen.

53
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,167
Don't you know that

54
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:49,533
violence during interrogation is illegal and will disgrace the DPRK?

55
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:56,733
Are you trying to teach me?

56
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,500
Does Vice Commissioner Park know this as well?

57
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,567
Illegal actions cannot be tolerated.

58
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:06,533
Keep the CCTV on at all times.

59
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,933
Are you okay?

60
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:37,833
Are you all right?

61
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,090
You look pretty injured.

62
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,033
I'm okay.

63
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,167
The car seat was covered in blood.

64
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,467
I was really worried.

65
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,567
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,700
I'll pay for the car wash.

67
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,167
A car wash?

68
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:54,433
You should get me a new car.

69
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,933
Sure, I'll replace your car.

70
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:00,800
Forget it.

71
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,900
What's up with Song I?

72
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,433
What do you mean?

73
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,167
The kid has been through a lot.

74
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,200
It seems like she was drafted into the hacker unit

75
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,633
after living alone without parents during childhood.

76
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:11,800
- Hacker unit? 
 - Yeah.

77
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,367
She was quite an ace.

78
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:17,367
North Korea even sent her to study in Russia.

79
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:21,033
It seems that she became Violet to survive

80
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,133
during her time in Russia.

81
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:26,900
She might know or possess

82
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,733
some important information.

83
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,733
But to put the child through such a thing?

84
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,667
There's one more thing.

85
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:35,667
What is it? Tell me now.

86
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,933
You must have been quite important to her.

87
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:42,450
Otherwise, why would she risk her life to report it?

88
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,400
 Everything you said... 

89
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,767
 was a lie? 

90
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:05,767
 It's nothing compared to the Republic's betrayal. 

91
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:08,833
 Do you know how many comrades sent to the South 

92
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,633
 have been eliminated? 

93
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:16,000
 Republic warriors suddenly became obstacles to unification, 

94
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:21,067
 and their reward for loyalty was death. 

95
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,840
 Comrades… 

96
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,567
 Even if I still… Comrades... 

97
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,000
Come in.

98
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,100
Unification.

99
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,700
How's your sister?

100
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,300
She's fine, thanks.

101
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:18,333
I did you the favor of keeping your sister by your side.

102
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,267
To bring you here...

103
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,320
is because I have high expectations of you.

104
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:29,633
Yes, I'm aware of it.

105
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,333
The higher the expectation, the greater the disappointment.

106
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:41,233
I'm warning you. If you disappoint me again,

107
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,633
I might be left with no choice.

108
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,600
Understand?

109
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,500
Understood, Comrade Vice Commissioner.

110
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,667
Is there anything to report to me?

111
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,433
No.

112
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,600
There isn't.

113
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,500
Are you going out?

114
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,567
You look unwell.

115
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:34,367
You're the one who got injured, Comrade No.

116
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,600
Are you okay?

117
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,533
Are you worried about me now?

118
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,567
Why would I worry about you?

119
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,700
You look like you're struggling alone.

120
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,700
It's something I have to overcome by myself.

121
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,800
It's always been that way.

122
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,733
We're closed.

123
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,867
It's me.

124
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,633
Oh, you are here.

125
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,733
How are you?

126
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,533
I'm fine.

127
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,100
Are you sick?

128
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,033
You don't look so good.

129
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:27,100
I came to see Mi Rae.

130
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,367
Is she asleep?

131
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,067
She's too old to be sleeping this early.

132
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,633
Go inside.

133
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,733
Okay.

134
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,833
He is Avon.

135
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,267
He has the fiercest look.

136
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,300
And these are Kane, Maki, and Aron.

137
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
How do you know so well?

138
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,100
They all look the same to me.

139
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,533
Never say that to anyone.

140
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,367
It's embarrassing.

141
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,300
He's the leader, Lloyd.

142
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,767
He's quite genuine about music

143
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,833
and makes good songs, too.

144
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,600
But he's not my type.

145
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,167
He's more your type.

146
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,100
What is my type?

147
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:15,733
How should I put it? It's a bit shabby.

148
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,767
What did you say?

149
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,767
What is it? Do you feel pain?

150
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,467
A little bit.

151
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,033
Did you take the medicine?

152
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,433
Yes, don't worry.

153
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,267
How can I not worry?

154
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:34,300
Stop watching this kind of stuff

155
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,500
and go to bed early.

156
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46,867
I'm not worried at all

157
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:52,000
because you promised to cure my pain.

158
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,600
Indeed.

159
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,267
Also, last time,

160
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:02,100
you kept your promise to come and get me.

161
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,167
You even found me

162
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:08,567
when I escaped the orphanage and begged at the market.

163
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,133
I can find you

164
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:16,067
no matter where you are in the world.

165
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,167
For sure.

166
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:23,833
Go to sleep early. You have school tomorrow.

167
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,667
Song I, the phone call…

168
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,633
It can't go on any longer.

169
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:38,867
Please stop now.

170
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:41,367
You didn't report to Vice Commissioner Park.

171
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,700
Pyeonghwa City? Unified Armed Force Unit?

172
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,067
Do you think this petty show will change the world?

173
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,133
They are all crazy.

174
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:00,067
Think about all the effort we've put in.

175
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,800
That doesn't justify what you did.

176
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,200
Unification is just a romanticist's fantasy.

177
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,367
We only just found out

178
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,733
there are many opponents to unification in both the North and South.

179
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,733
People like us

180
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:16,300
only gain value and reason to live when we're in a hostile relationship.

181
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,333
Don't try to persuade me.

182
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,900
I don't think that way.

183
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:29,200
Think about Mi Rae.

184
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,267
And think about us.

185
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,900
I have money and power.

186
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,533
Let's send her to the US for surgery.

187
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,267
I refuse.

188
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:49,267
If I had thought to become a traitor for such a reason,

189
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:52,833
I would not have been able to overcome those harsh times.

190
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,967
Sacrificing myself for the Republic

191
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,400
and seeking forgiveness for my father's unjust story

192
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,367
is the reason I live.

193
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,767
How much longer do you think Mi Rae can hold on?

194
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,733
 How pretty. 

195
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,567
 You look so pretty today. 

196
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,067
Do you want to die?

197
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,400
Gosh, I'm sorry.

198
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,067
Overslept? Have you lost your mind?

199
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:09,267
Get up now.

200
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,767
What is this ridiculous dream?

201
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,167
That comrade...

202
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,867
Surely he didn't come and leave, did he?

203
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,167
How come it's more vivid than a dream about getting shot?

204
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,833
Well, I can eat, after all.

205
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,033
Enjoy your meal.

206
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,667
Enjoy.

207
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:44,267
A man needs to eat well to stay strong and fight hard.

208
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:47,067
But why is it always half-and-half brown rice?

209
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,567
It's not like we are on an arduous march.

210
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,767
It's for health.

211
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:55,567
Don't just gobble rice. Eat meat too.

212
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,867
Why are you giving me something with your saliva on it?

213
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,367
I can just go get more.

214
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,267
What's your problem?

215
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,967
Stop guys, stop!

216
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,733
Aren't you tired?

217
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,367
You guys that full of energy?

218
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,833
That's why unification isn't happening.

219
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,070
   

220
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,560
   

221
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
   

222
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,433
Come in.

223
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,400
Did you lose some weight?

224
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,500
You look healthy.

225
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,733
Have you been doing okay?

226
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,900
Why did you call me?

227
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,633
Here's your overnight pass.

228
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,500
You know the Pyeonghwa hotel, right?

229
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,567
I heard your parents are coming tonight,

230
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,133
so I prepared it.

231
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:55,133
It's okay.

232
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,200
Are you not on good terms with your parents?

233
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,733
You're not picking up or calling back, so they're contacting me now.

234
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,333
It's not like that.

235
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,033
I just want to focus on my military life.

236
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,233
Just go.

237
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,867
Mr. Ban, he's good at golf, isn't he?

238
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,900
Oh, him.

239
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,000
He hits the ball well and is a good drinker, too.

240
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,800
He has a bit of a habit when drunk…

241
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Please let me meet Song I.

242
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,267
It's hard to reach her because of security clearance issues.

243
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,700
But why her?

244
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,167
Don't you know?

245
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,767
She saved my life.

246
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,500
Sure.

247
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,167
We're the kind who do favors for each other.

248
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:24,033
 You put me in a tough spot. 

249
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:29,600
Can't you help me now?

250
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,033
Traitor.

251
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:34,233
I'm the one who risked my life for the Republic.

252
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:35,967
You are the traitor.

253
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:39,600
Just kill me!

254
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,633
I can't just recklessly kill you here.

255
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,333
Cooperate.

256
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:52,500
If you do, I'll give you a big reward.

257
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,133
If we were to sell our beliefs for rewards,

258
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,767
we wouldn't have even started.

259
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,000
Just kill me now.

260
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:08,767
I'll train him mentally right up until he's about to die.

261
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,300
Shouldn't you turn off the surveillance cameras first?

262
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,667
Your injuries seem serious.

263
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:59,033
 So? Have you thought about it? 

264
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:03,533
 If you go back to the North now, you'll die. 

265
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,167
Don't you want to live?

266
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,367
I'm not even hoping for Shadow.

267
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:14,633
Let's just catch one from the upper ranks.

268
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:16,000
Then we'll climb up…

269
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,267
Kill me.

270
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:22,267
I will never betray.

271
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,633
Betray?

272
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,133
What era do you think this is?

273
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:34,200
You're so frustrating.

274
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,067
Song I, I'm here.

275
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,533
I'm sorry.

276
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:56,500
I don't have anything to tell you yet.

277
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,400
I'll come again.

278
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,533
Where do you think you're going?

279
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:58,433
It's none of your business.

280
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,367
I saw what you took.

281
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:02,533
Please don't go.

282
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,567
Do you want to get beaten up badly?

283
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,000
Keep your hands off me.

284
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,133
Are there missions that even the unit members are unaware of?

285
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,033
It clearly looks dangerous, so don't go.

286
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:19,700
It's not like that, so don't worry.

287
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,200
Do you know what I'm worried about?

288
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,600
Platoon Leader!

289
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:36,100
Please don't go.

290
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,300
- Let's go, move! 
 - Where are we going?

291
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,433
Can't you tell? We're going on a mission.

292
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,467
I'm the only one who doesn't know again.

293
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:49,100
Now that you know, get ready.

294
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,567
No need to get ready.

295
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,867
- Why? 
 - The orders are for you to come to the control tower.

296
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:57,100
Just me?

297
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:17,467
   

298
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,900
Where are you?

299
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,033
I got out.

300
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,033
 What about Comrade Gyeong Hoon? 

301
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,100
I'm sorry. Only I got out.

302
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,567
Good job, Seong Eun.

303
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:40,000
 It's nothing. 

304
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,967
I should have gotten Comrade Gyeong Hoon out too…

305
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,333
There's nothing we can do.

306
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,433
Come back safely.

307
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,800
No.

308
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,300
They might be tailing me.

309
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,733
I'll disappear from here.

310
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:57,800
 Comrade Seong, stay safe. 

311
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:03,800
Seong Eun.

312
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,333
Come to our meeting point.

313
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,367
Comrade Seong, that's risky.

314
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:11,150
Comrade Seong!

315
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,190
   

316
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,400
  ­ 

317
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,667
Attention.

318
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,800
I'll be leading today's operation, not Platoon Leader Baek.

319
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,167
 Yes, sir! 

320
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:14,667
Did Comrade Platoon Leader Baek get fired?

321
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:18,233
It seems South Korea is in charge of this operation.

322
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,600
That brat…

323
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,633
- Vice Commissioner Lee. 
 - You are here.

324
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:38,667
What's the matter?

325
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,233
This is where we control our operations.

326
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:44,233
So sit back and enjoy.

327
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:47,300
Having a strong backer must feel good.

328
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,820
   

329
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,100
  ­ 

330
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,340
  ­ 

331
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,500
Team 1 with 3 pairs,

332
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,200
move to Station 1.

333
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,133
Team 2, stand by.

334
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:33,700
Don't move rashly until the order is given.

335
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,967
Vice Commissioner Lee, where is that?

336
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:42,400
That's Pyeonghwa City Climbing Park.

337
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:46,200
My parents are coming, so

338
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,800
may I leave first?

339
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,600
Oh, really?

340
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Sure, go ahead.

341
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,133
Go on.

342
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,367
All right, Team 1 with 3 pairs, get the target first.

343
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,233
Keep an eye on those people in sight.

344
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,467
Don't miss them.

345
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,467
Let's just go.

346
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:21,033
You know he wants to treat you nice before you leave.

347
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,400
 But something feels off. 

348
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,667
All right, 10 o'clock direction. Close the gap.

349
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,567
I need to use the restroom.

350
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,333
Be quick.

351
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,933
Comrade Seong.

352
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:11,567
Thanks for your hard work.

353
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:38,700
Isn't he Seong Jae Hoon?

354
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,933
Target spotted.

355
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:43,133
Go, go.

356
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:45,133
 Shoot him. 

357
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:53,200
Okay, 2 o'clock from the restroom.

358
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,700
Second target.

359
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,933
 Permission to kill. 

360
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,067
Freeze!

361
00:34:56,067 --> 00:35:00,200
I know that sniping is done from the highest point.

362
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,367
Six of our men were hit by a sniper.

363
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:13,433
But none of them died.

364
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:16,900
Because they were all wearing bulletproof vests.

365
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,033
No, no.

366
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,867
It's because the sniper only aimed at the vests.

367
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,833
Isn't it strange?

368
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,967
Why would they do that?

369
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Why did you do this?

370
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,133
Answer me. Why did you do this?

371
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:42,233
Even if I tell you, you wouldn't understand.

372
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:45,900
Don't get involved and arouse suspicion.

373
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,267
Is that the best you can say?

374
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:54,567
To someone who rushed here out of worry for you?

375
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,600
You shouldn't have.

376
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,700
Damn it!

377
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:34,230

378
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,367
An unauthorized overnight stay is considered desertion.

379
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:45,667
Comrade Vice Commissioner.

380
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,400
Our platoon leader is not a deserter.

381
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:52,033
This is not a place for a rascal.

382
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:54,133
Arrest her.

383
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,567
What do you think you're doing?

384
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,833
I'm taking Platoon Leader with me.

385
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,300
Why are you taking her?

386
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,633
Because she's mine!

387
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,633
♫  Don't go away  ♫

388
