00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,700
   

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,490
   

4
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,800
   

5
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,400
She won't die, right?

6
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:43,833
I'm sure she'll survive if you desperately wish for that.

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,267
We were ordered to return before the roll call.

8
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:50,833
Let's pack up and go back now.

9
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,300
I'll stay here a little longer.

10
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,200
You're not her guardian. Right?

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,267
Hold on.

12
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,333
This wasn't a mere accident.

13
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,800
It seems odd no matter how hard I think about it.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,100
What's odd about it?

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,000
It's totally obvious. Why do you pretend it's not?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,833
You know what happened to her that night, don't you?

17
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,200
I'll report it to my superior to look into it further.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,800
So just focus on your military duties, Comrade No.

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,000
- Got that? 
 - Please listen—

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,633
Unification.

21
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,867
Lloyd, where have you been?

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,700
Seven.

23
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,600
Oh, my gosh. You guys, are you still doing that?

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,033
Enough already.

25
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:58,967
That's right. Give up now, Comrade Gang.

26
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,600
Are you asking a former UDT soldier to give up?

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,133
I'd rather die.

28
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,767
Why are they doing that?

29
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:07,933
Term problems, man.

30
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,933
We all have different ranks and come from different units.

31
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,733
That's why they're fighting.

32
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,933
The winner takes it all. The person who wins gets to decide.

33
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:19,867
It'll be 30 minutes in 5 seconds.

34
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,033
Your feet hit the ground first.

35
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:28,567
What? Nonsense.

36
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,467
That's because I have long legs.

37
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,433
Your legs are so short, Comrade Gye.

38
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,100
What did you say?

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,800
Hey, be grateful that I call you a comrade.

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,467
I served five years in an anti-aircraft unit and four years in Wonsan Special Forces.

41
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,933
I'm a Special Forces soldier of the Republic, got that?

42
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,200
Do you want to battle it outforgetting our ranks?

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,667
You didn't want to go against me when we were discussing pay grade.

44
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,544
Have you ever gotten a special promotion as a reward?

45
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,633
Capitalist financiers are quite scary.

46
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:56,700
How are you a real soldier if you're protecting your country to get paid?

47
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,833
I'm so sick of this, man.

48
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,200
Every day, you guys are fighting.

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,133
The unification is right around the corner. Must you fight over things like that?

50
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:08,000
- Private, you stay out of it! 
 - Low-ranking soldier, none of your business!

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,567
What did you just say?

52
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,333
Private? Why would you say that, bro?

53
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,167
Look at this.

54
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:15,167
What do you see, man? Nothing, right?

55
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:18,500
You know why? Because we're a team, man. Nobody is ranked here, bro.

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,033
We're all fellow soldiers here.

57
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:25,033
But our ages are all different.

58
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:28,467
Okay, fine. Should we tell each other how old we are too?

59
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,867
Okay. Over here. I'm John.

60
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:39,433
This guy is Lloyd. Cheol Gyu, Do Hyeon, and my man, Comrade Gae. Okay?

61
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:42,867
It's not Comrade Gae. It's Gye. My name is Gye Nam Sik.

62
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,200
Okay, "Gae."  (Sounds like dog) 

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,533
Repeat after me. Gye.

64
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,300
Gye.

65
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,367
- Gae. 
 - Gye.

66
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,167
- It's Gye Nam Sik. 
 - Gae.

67
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,800
Nam Sik. Comrade Gae. It's the same, man!

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,067
The pronunciation is different. It's Gye.

69
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,033
- Gye. 
 - Gae! Gae!

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,633
   

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,900
Did you discover anything?

72
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,800
There were traces of her hacking secret files from Violet.

73
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,033
That's why they tried to kill her.

74
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,467
Did you find the file?

75
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,100
It wasn't on the hard drive,

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,733
and I couldn't find any traces of it being uploaded online.

77
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:30,267
That means it's on a portable hard drive.

78
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,500
She didn't die, did she?

79
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,533
Is she awake?

80
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:37,133
Why does that matter?

81
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:39,600
So that we can ask her.

82
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:45,133
To me, what's important is why she went to the hospital.

83
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,900
Lloyd, are you the Korean Justin Bieber?

84
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,033
You get so many gifts every day. It's so hard to clean them all up.

85
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,600
I'm sorry. I'll clean them up right away.

86
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,833
But FITA fans are really amazing. I give you that.

87
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,067
I'm always grateful to them.

88
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,033
But you even completed the march for survival.

89
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:15,900
Why did you request to return to the Defense PR Support Unit?

90
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:20,400
I thought about it a lot, but I don't think I belong to this unit.

91
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,600
Is it that lenient in South Korea that they let you go to wherever you wish?

92
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,633
Your ideals are all messed up.

93
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,933
Private No Gwang Yeon.

94
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,900
Bro.

95
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,740
   

96
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,600
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you so much!

97
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,867
Stay with us, Lloyd.

98
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:48,167
We don't have ranks here. You can speak casually.

99
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:51,467
You'll be at the bottom of the totemthere, man. Right, Do Hyeon?

100
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,400
But having some level of ranks is important. Right?

101
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,933
Ranks, my foot.

102
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,867
Speak comfortably. I'll take full responsibility.

103
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay. Sure.

104
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,933
 What's wrong? What's going on? Is someone chasing after you again? 

105
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,333
 Lloyd, you're okay. Right? 

106
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,400
 Yes, I am. Are you okay? 

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,167
 Yes, I'm okay. 

108
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,000
 I'm sorry. It's my fault. 

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,333
 Don't say that. 

110
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,900
 I did what I ought to do. 

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
 It's okay. It really is. 

112
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
 It's really okay. 

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,067
 Where is that jacket? 

114
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,267
 What jacket? 

115
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,467
 My jacket. 

116
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,633
 I'll go lure them. You go and call for help quickly. 

117
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,933
 You're right. Where is that? 

118
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,000
 I think I lost it. 

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,867
 I'll buy you a nicer one. 

120
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,800
 It's okay. I'll get going now. 

121
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:25,100
 Don't get hurt and make sure you don't skip meals. Okay? 

122
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,633
 Okay. 

123
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:30,767
 See you again. 

124
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,433
 Yes, see you again. 

125
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,200
 I promise I'll make it happen. 

126
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,333
Dear fans,

127
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,400
we're really grateful.

128
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,633
But please stop sending gifts now. I'm going to die at this rate.

129
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,633
Lloyd, are you able to make phone calls now?

130
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,100
- Han Song I? 
  - Yes, her. 

131
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,933
Can you check and see how she's doing?

132
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:19,367
If her operation went well and when they expect her to wake up, you know?

133
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:23,667
But why? Sure. Okay.

134
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,167
Thank you, ma'am.

135
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,210
   

136
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:09,933
Ma'am? It's from the person over there.

137
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:18,867
What's this?

138
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,000
Parfait.

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Parfait. Parfait.

140
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,000
You moved here recently, right?

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,133
It's a welcome gift.

142
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Thank you.

143
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,500
Enjoy.

144
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,567
By the way, it's so pretty.

145
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:42,300
Since it's so pretty, it must be that of South Korea. Right?

146
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,533
That's not true.

147
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,867
There are many pretty things in North Korea, too.

148
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:49,400
There's nothing pretty in North Korea.

149
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:53,167
But I've never seen

150
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,967
such a pretty girl like you in South Korea.

151
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,000
They say that all male comrades of South Korea are bluffers.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,567
It's really true.

153
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,200
Who taught you that?

154
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,433
Well, it's a secret.

155
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,900
Gae…

156
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,933
Comrade Gye Nam Sik.

157
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,833
Don't talk to me.

158
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,233
I'm going to redeem myself from humiliation

159
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,667
of losing to Comrade Gang.

160
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,967
In my opinion, you definitely came out on top.

161
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:31,400
Why are you wasting your energy?

162
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:35,300
Really? It was obvious to you too. Right, Comrade No?

163
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,333
Yes.

164
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,600
I can tell that you're from the 112 unit.

165
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,300
How do you know about that place?

166
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,767
It's on YouTube.

167
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,533
The ones that were trained there are the toughest.

168
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:49,467
Your physique makes me think that you were trained there.

169
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:52,100
I'm not worthy of being compared to someone from the 112 unit.

170
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,333
They're warriors and legends.

171
00:10:55,333 --> 00:11:00,033
Comrade Platoon Leader is from that 112 unit.

172
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:05,367
So what? Once the unification happens, it won't mean anything.

173
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,267
What did you say?

174
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:11,467
The ones from the 112 unit can't be spies or terrorists now that things are peaceful.

175
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:14,233
After they got abandoned by the Republic, they formed Violet.

176
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,533
Violet?

177
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,267
At the recent unification concert,

178
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:20,567
they tried to bomb the place.

179
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:22,633
I heard that they're members of Violet.

180
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,867
You didn't know?

181
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:29,067
I heard that some girl provided information.

182
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,300
Wait.

183
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,967
A girl?

184
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:38,067
- Yes. 
 - How would you know?

185
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,520
Tell me.

186
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:51,667
Who are you?

187
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,567
   

188
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:57,133
There are some issues about assigning Mr. Lloyd

189
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,700
to the Unified Armed Force Unit.

190
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,000
Issues?

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,400
Soldiers follow orders, that's all.

192
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,000
This is a document that's ordering him to be assigned to the Defense PR Support Unit.

193
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:13,267
This is evidence showing that it wasn't based on orders.

194
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,800
What does it have anything to do with me?

195
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,433
You even had a call with the HR personnel at the defense ministry.

196
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:23,567
You didn't use a safe line.

197
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:26,780
I even have a recording of the call.

198
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,900
Shall we listen to it together?

199
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,067
Ms. Seo,

200
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,000
when you're doing what's best for our country—

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,333
You're not trying to tell me, a lawyer, that I have to

202
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,967
break the law sometimes?

203
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,133
I'm not asking for much.

204
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:59,333
You just need to send him back to where he belongs.

205
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:04,133
Please send our superstar to the Defense PR Support Unit.

206
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,933
Mr. Lloyd? This is Seo Hee Ji calling.

207
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:16,000
You'll receive an order to return to your original unit by tomorrow.

208
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,110
Yes.

209
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,100
It got resolved much faster than I anticipated.

210
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:28,567
If you're so grateful, I'll give you an opportunity to pay me back.

211
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's grab a meal together.

212
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,633
 Come in. 

213
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,667
Unification!

214
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,667
What brings you here?

215
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:47,300
Are you going somewhere? Dressed like that?

216
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,833
Is there a problem?

217
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,433
Well, I heard

218
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,667
that you're from the 112 unit.

219
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,233
You must've been very busy in your hometown.

220
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:59,467
Was that man I saw before your child's father? Am I right?

221
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,500
Don't cross the line.

222
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,860
Don't test my patience.

223
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,200
Wait, hold on.

224
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,433
A leave pass.

225
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,133
Please give me a leave pass.

226
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,867
A leave pass?

227
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm still under the Unified Armed Force Unit for today.

228
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,567
♫  I'm clumsy and awkward  ♫

229
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:29,233
♫  But I try to act like it's nothing  ♫

230
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:31,800
♫  As a day goes by  ♫

231
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,067
♫  And another month goes by  ♫

232
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,367
Why do you keep following me?

233
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,920
Me?

234
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,133
I feel flustered.

235
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:40,600
Please don't follow me. Okay?

236
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,133
I'll get going first.

237
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,867
Sis!

238
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,267
Mi Rae.

239
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:48,800
 Not "Mother"? 

240
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,133
 "Sis"? 

241
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,700
I'll come this weekend, so don't worry. Okay?

242
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,833
Are you doing well?

243
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,667
I saw Lloyd earlier.

244
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,333
That singer who came to the Unified Armed Force Unit?

245
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,633
Yes.

246
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:06,267
I should've got his autograph and posted it on the wall of our convenience store.

247
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,167
Our dear Peace and Unification,

248
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:11,233
it'd be like winning the lottery if they'd be as good-looking as Lloyd.

249
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,200
What are you saying?

250
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,900
Yu Jin, they need to take after you and me, honey.

251
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,567
Don't you worry.

252
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,567
Of course, they'll look like you, their parents. Who else?

253
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:23,900
You have to eat well for your babies to be healthy. Okay?

254
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,533
I wish

255
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,000
I could enter the demilitarized zone

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and catch a deer for her to eat. That would be so great.

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,367
Thank you for the thought,

258
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:35,100
but I don't want you to get arrested.

259
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,800
The Unified Armed Force Unit is comprised of all elite soldiers. What if you get caught?

260
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,167
Whatever.

261
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,867
Elite soldiers, my foot.

262
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:45,567
Any North Korean man would be as good as them.

263
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,400
I see. Is that right?

264
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,533
I think we have more customers after the Unified Armed Force Unit was formed.

265
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,467
What about here?

266
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,633
Yes, perhaps.

267
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,733
Hey, eat this too.

268
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,467
You eat up too, honey.

269
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,667
Eat the meat.

270
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,133
Thank you.

271
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,300
This is a pub, but the food is quite good even though the place is small.

272
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,833
It has a good ambiance, too.

273
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,467
You're here.

274
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,467
Hello.

275
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:24,933
Is this that VIP?

276
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,667
You know each other. Right?

277
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:30,233
Yes, we do. We meet again.

278
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:31,667
I'm Seong Jae Hoon.

279
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:35,400
Avon… I meant, Mr. Lloyd.

280
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,933
Let's go somewhere else.

281
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:41,233
It has a good ambiance, but feels quite nasty.

282
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,767
You're here.

283
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,433
Why don't we all sit here together?

284
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,667
It seems like we all know each other.

285
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:55,900
No, thanks.

286
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,367
Cheers.

287
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,633
Ms. Seo, you're very good at what you do.

288
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,633
Let's talk casually to each other. We're the same age.

289
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,200
What? Are you serious?

290
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,400
Why do you react like that?

291
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,633
No, I didn't mean anything bad.

292
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:23,967
I've never seen any lawyer as young and pretty as you.

293
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,333
I tend to be faster than everyone else in everything.

294
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,000
Graduating from schools, handling cases,

295
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,333
and having an eye for things.

296
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,667
Cheers.

297
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,867
Try the drink.

298
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:37,000
Okay.

299
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,400
That drink.

300
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,900
It's a cocktail that Mr. Seong made himself with blueberry wine.

301
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,700
You even know how to make drinks?

302
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,600
Yes.

303
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,033
Now I see who he was thinking of when he was making the drink.

304
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:58,700
Congratulations on returning to the PR Support Unit.

305
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,800
Thank you.

306
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,100
Did you hear that? I'm leaving soon.

307
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,667
You keep irritating me.

308
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,367
She's your superior.

309
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,600
She's my superior, not yours. So why don't you mind your own business

310
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,433
and go make that blueberry cocktail or whatever that is?

311
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,000
Just let him be.

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,700
He's no longer in my unit.

313
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:25,667
Congratulations, Comrade No. Farewell.

314
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,233
Ms. Seo, have you heard of Violet?

315
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:35,767
Do you mean, the purple color?

316
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,467
Yes, the purple color.

317
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:43,667
When I was little, I made it often by mixing blue and red.

318
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,833
I liked that color, so I always needed more.

319
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:52,433
Maybe she jumped right in front of there, so that Lloyd would see her, you know?

320
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:54,033
No way.

321
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:57,167
So many stalkers would risk their lives to get a star's attention, you know?

322
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,067
The kids these days are really scary.

323
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,900
You're right. Some even jump in the front of the celebrities' cars.

324
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,233
They don't mind dying if it's for their beloved singer.

325
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,500
Excuse me.

326
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,133
Watch your mouth if you don't really know what happened.

327
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,967
- My fan was in an accident. 
 - Wait, it's Lloyd.

328
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:14,900
She isn't a stalker or whatever you think she is. Got that?

329
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,667
If she isn't, so be it. Why are you yelling, man?

330
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,667
- Who cares if you're a celebrity? 
 - What did you say?

331
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,667
- Do you want to hit me? 
 - Were you there?

332
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,233
How would you guys know if my fan was a stalker or not?

333
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:25,333
The back door is over there. Come with me.

334
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,460
Words of people like you hurt others!

335
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,430
Calm down!

336
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,660
Seriously.

337
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,400
Thank you. Please go back in now.

338
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,000
Next time, let's meet somewhere quiet.

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Why are you asking her to meet again? Who will protect Pyeonghwa City then?

340
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,567
Make sure to lock the door.

341
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,300
 Hey, I heard that Lloyd is really here. 

342
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,567
 Really? 

343
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,367
 - Is Lloyd really here? 
 - Seriously. 

344
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,100
What if someone recognizes you again?

345
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,067
Are you worried about me right now?

346
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,133
 Hold onto this tightly next time you have a nightmare. 

347
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,767
 I can't be there to hold your hand every time, you know? 

348
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,300
That bluffer.

349
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,767
I never held his hand.

350
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:23,367
 I'm still under the Unified Armed Force Unit for today. 

351
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,600
 I'm leaving soon. 

352
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,333
What are you doing?

353
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:21,900
What are you doing here, Comrade No?

354
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,133
I thought you might need this.

355
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:26,800
Thank you.

356
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,067
That sounded so insincere.

357
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,467
What do you mean?

358
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,933
At this rate, what's the point of the unification? We can't even communicate.

359
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:39,233
Don't worry about stuff like that

360
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,133
and take care of your own business.

361
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,200
Thank you for everything.

362
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,433
I'll never forget you.

363
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,167
When you return, forget everything that happened.

364
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,067
But how could I?

365
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,733
We were so dynamic together.

366
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:03,533
In any case, I'm worried about Song I that I can't even sleep.

367
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:08,233
Other people think she was a stalker who tried to commit suicide.

368
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:12,967
But I know it well that my fans would never do that.

369
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:18,633
Since she didn't die, the truth will be revealed.

370
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:21,867
Please visit her often to see how she's doing.

371
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,200
Please.

372
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:31,167
Will do.

373
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,167
Thank you.

374
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,167
Then I'll…

375
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,367
go now.

376
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,433
I almost forgot.

377
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:46,167
Don't forget. Go see a doctor when you're sick and go to a pharmacist when you need medicine.

378
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:50,233
Stay alert! So that you don't get conned from now on.

379
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:55,367
Comrade No, you talk too much and worry too much too.

380
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,500
Take care.

381
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,067
Why do I talk so much?

382
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,230
   

383
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,567
I'll be made a private again there.

384
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:26,900
My man, Lloyd.

385
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:32,167
- Take care, all right? 
 - You too.

386
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,133
Bye, No Gwang Yeon.

387
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,733
Take care, Do Hyeon.

388
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:39,000
Bye.

389
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,733
- See you after the unification. 
 - Sounds good.

390
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:48,100
Comrade No, we just met, but we have to say goodbye.

391
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:49,867
By the way, what about our team leader?

392
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:53,600
Comrade Platoon Commander is busy these days with the Unified Security Agency work.

393
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:57,200
But still, couldn't she say goodbye at least?

394
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,800
You're a nobody.

395
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,933
Do you want to receive a farewell from your platoon commander in addition to a single soldier's death?

396
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,833
Fly and leave!

397
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,700
- Fine, Comrade Gae. I'll get going now. 
 - It's not "Comrade Gae."

398
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,867
- My name is— 
 - Okay, Nam Sik.

399
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,533
Take care.

400
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,033
Lloyd, are you all right?

401
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,633
Yes, I am. I'm totally fine.

402
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:34,933
It doesn't seem like you are.

403
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,133
Hey, I feel so relieved.

404
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:40,433
I told you that I almost died in that unit.

405
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:42,867
That doomed place.

406
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,167
Then, maybe you don't need this, but I got a gift for you.

407
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,467
I wonder if you'll like it.

408
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,633
What? It's the U.S.N. M9.

409
00:25:56,633 --> 00:26:00,033
I'm the one who ordered it from abroad. Why does it count as your gift to me?

410
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,400
The thing is...

411
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,700
that it was held in customs because of the unpaid taxes. I brought it to life.

412
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,300
So I contributed.

413
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,633
My goodness. Thank you.

414
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:12,033
You're an amazing manager. Thank you for your hard work.

415
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,500
Thank you.

416
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,033
No, I should be thanking you.

♫  You were like the wind  ♫

437
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,133
Jeong Man.

438
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,733
Turn the car around. Let's stop by the hospital.

439
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:14,833
Lloyd, many reporters are saying you joined military to escape criticism.

440
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:19,133
If the reporters see you at the hospital, they'll make weird stories out of it.

441
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,333
It'll be hard to see her again once I leave now.

442
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,600
Turn the car around. I'll take full responsibility.

443
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:28,500
Gosh, seriously…

444
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:42,767
That punk.

445
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:14,233
I don't know what really happened,

446
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:17,333
but whoever did this to you will get caught for sure.

447
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:21,833
She's a little slow sometimes,

448
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:25,367
but she's the toughest fighter ever.

449
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:32,500
We made a deal to meet again. Right?

450
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,267
You have to wake up soon to come to my fan meetings and concerts.

451
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:41,367
I'll make an exception and send you a special invitation, too.

452
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:54,267
You protected me,

453
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,700
but I couldn't do anything for you.

454
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:09,467
I'll get going now.

455
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:38,380
   

456
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,267

460
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:06,267
Do you really have to kill a girl who is already in a critical condition?
