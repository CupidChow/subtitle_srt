1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:10,520


2
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:15,900
I have a question, sir.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,200
Do the unit arrangements usually take place in the middleâ€¦

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,467
of the night?

5
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,800
Landmine?

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,467
Stay alert. We're in the midst of war.

7
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:58,500
War? What are you talking about?

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,333
Comrade, you'd be the first one to die with your state of mind.

9
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,733
Die? Why would I die?

10
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,417
You die!

11
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,767
This isn't a training. We use live ammunition.

12
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,067
Live ammunition?

13
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:13,200
Wake up, Lloyd. Come on. Let's go. Come on.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,750
Okay, okay!

16
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:46,167
Five minutes estimated to defeat the enemy and recapture the high grounds.

17
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,400
Do not kill the civilians.

18
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,267
Two each at the 9:00 and 11:00 directions.

19
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:54,900
Three at the 2:00 direction.

20
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,167
Two of you, cover the left side.

21
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,200
Two of you, after covering fire, gather at the central high grounds.

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,333
Comrade No. Stay right behind me.

23
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:06,267
 I'm supposed to go to the PR Support Unit after being discharged today. Not this. 

24
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,967
Lloyd.

25
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:09,400
You must survive.

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,267
Get moving now!

27
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:25,000
Hey, who are we fighting against?

28
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:41,600
Hey! Hey.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,367
Hurry up.

30
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,367
Roger, Ma'am.

31
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,733
Private No Gwang Yeon.

32
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,233
A gun isn't a toy.

33
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:50,833
Fire first if you don't want to die. Got it?

34
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,300
Roger.

35
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,433
Darn it. Comrade Gang Do Hyeon.

36
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,967
Comrade!

37
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,700
Get down!

38
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:35,033
 Lloyd! Lloyd! 

39
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:40,133
 Lloyd! Lloyd! 

40
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,600
   

41
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,967
   

42
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:01,700
 Don't cry! Don't cry! 

43
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,567
 Don't cry! Don't cry! 

44
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,000
 Don't cry! Don't cry! 

45
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,400
 Don't cry! Don't cry! 

46
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,100
 You can't join the military. 

47
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,833
 You're the breadwinner of our family. Who will bring in money? 

48
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,500
 I've earned enough for us to live on. 

49
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,267
 Son, more income requires more expenses. 

50
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,600
 We have to pay more taxes now that we have a bigger house. 

51
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,067
 Your showy father spends money like water to keep up his status. 

52
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,900
 What about your younger sibling's tuition abroad? 

53
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,233
 But everyone has to go at some point. It's better to get it over with. 

54
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,933
 What is Mr. Ban doing? He can't even take care of your military issue. 

55
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,767
 My fans don't want me to skip the military. 

56
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,267
 Neither do I. 

57
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:48,533
 I'm concerned that you might get hurt. What if you die due to an accident? 

58
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:53,400
 I'd better go and get a few good life insurance policies. 

59
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,567
 You never know. 

60
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:09,500
 Mr. Ban, I'll join the military. 

61
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,833
Get up now.

62
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:34,633
Stop making a fuss over a blank and get up now.

63
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,433
Wasn't it live ammunition?

64
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,200
But it hurts.

65
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,933
Mountain Hawks Team One of the Unified Armed Force Unit reporting.

66
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,367
Sunflower. Currently at 17:15, the enemy has been completely eliminated.

67
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:13,100
One of our men was killed. We'll finish up the counterterrorism training.

68
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,000
What do you mean by training?

69
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,400
That was the counterterrorism training.

70
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,967
You told me a war broke out earlier. What? It was counterterrorism training?

71
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,367
This is the Unified Korean Armed Force Unit of Pyeonghwa City.

72
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:27,100
I suppose you lost your mind after getting a shot by a blank.

73
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,433
Pardon? The Unified Korean Armed Force Unit?

74
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:34,400
I'm supposed to be assigned to the Defense PR Support Unit today.

75
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,933
Oh, my god, Lloyd.

76
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,367
Never? You had no idea?

77
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:43,400
Clean up quickly and return to the living quarters.

78
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,233
Excuse me!

79
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,633
You and I have unfinished business, don't we?

80
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,867
What unfinished business?

81
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,733
Don't you remember me?

82
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,400
- You smashed my gun! 
 - Don't disrespect the Comrade Major General.

83
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Comrade Major General? We aren't North Korean soldiers.

84
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,267
This is the Unified Korean Armed Force Unit.

85
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:15,233
Exactly my point. I shouldn't be here.

86
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm John Kim. Nice to meet you.

87
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,200
Because the team members didn't work in unity,

88
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,167
Comrade Lloyd of us Mountain Hawks was shot to death today.

89
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:29,533
Mountain Hawks, you lost a member. You'll march back instead of driving.

90
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:33,067
Put on the full combat gear and gather up.

91
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:35,000
But I marched yesterday. I have to do it again?

92
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,867
I can't even walk properly because of the blisters on my toes.

93
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:40,167
Move it!

94
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,167
Seriously, what is this place?

95
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:51,967
The unit was formed to combat terrorism, but it has become a symbol of Pyeonghwa City.

96
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,200
Rather than working only behind closed doors, I wanted to bring it to light

97
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,733
to showcase the unity of two Koreas.

98
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:02,200
Now we'll have Lloyd, too. How amazing.

99
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,733
Given Lloyd's popularity, it's really amazing.

100
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,733
I got very lucky.

101
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,467
What do you mean, lucky?

102
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:13,167
You contributed significantly. You're really something.

103
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,833
When we put on a military uniform, we all become soldiers

104
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,567
and when we join the military, we all become sons of the country.

105
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,567
What's all the fuss about?

106
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:24,067
You're so oblivious when it comes to marketing. Gosh.

107
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:28,600
Mayor Won, Pyeonghwa, our city, will be recognized globally.

108
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,800
Then I should've ordered them to take a promotional photo at the training today.

109
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,333
My bad.

110
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,467
What did you say?

111
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,667
Are you saying he participated in today's training?

112
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:40,733
I was just informed that he was shot to death during the training.

113
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,300
What? Shot to death?

114
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,733
Do you know what I had to do to bring Lloyd to Pyeonghwa?

115
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:48,267
But he just completed the new recruit training.

116
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:50,733
How could you put him through such tough counterterrorism training?

117
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,800
Don't you like equality in South Korea?

118
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,100
He wouldn't want to be the talk of the town for receiving preferential treatment.

119
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,767
I'm warning you.

120
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,733
If Lloyd sustained even a small scratch on his face,

121
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,700
I'll hold you responsible. Got that?

122
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,133
Lloyd. Here it is.

123
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:17,600
Ms. Baek of Mountain Hawks Team One of the Unified Armed Force Unit.

124
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,700
We don't belong to South or North. Please decide how we should call each other.

125
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,400
Do you still not realize why you lost a teammate during today's training?

126
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,333
Comrades, did you get into a fight?

127
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,500
Why do you keep calling us "comrades"â€¦

128
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,933
Comrade Gye, did you trip Comrade Gang when we were infiltrating just now?

129
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,733
No, Ma'am.

130
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you not know that you get punished at once if you hurt a teammate during an operation?

131
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,967
It's my fault.

132
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:58,467
I got in Comrade Gye Nam Sik's way trying to go faster than him.

133
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,167
Comrade Gye Nam Sik.

134
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:06,333
Since Comrade Gang Do Hyeon says so, I'll let it slide today.

135
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:12,467
Work together as a team and set a unifying title to call each other.

136
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,433
Move it now.

137
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,833
That fool

138
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,067
is going to lure that girl who is crazy about some cheap singer

139
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:07,933
to get information on Violet.

140
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:11,567
Shake up the South Korean comrade before that.

141
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,233
 I'll show him the power of our republic 

142
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,367
 and make him cooperate fully. 

143
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,533
Excuse me.

144
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:32,000
I have leg cramps. Cramps.

145
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,267
I have cramps!

146
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:36,567
I have cramps!

147
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,567
I said, I have cramps, you crazy bastards.

148
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,870
Ah, shit!  Seriously!

149
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:59,233
I have cramps. Darn it.

150
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,133
   

151
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,700
What do you think?

152
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,200
Nothing particular, Sir.

153
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,080
 Unlocked. 

154
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,930
   

155
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:37,033
You have important things to do. You must eat.

156
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,633
I know that you gave us information trying to save Lloyd.

157
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:49,833
But to the other side, you're a traitor.

158
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:55,500
If you help us, we'll guarantee your safety.

159
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:00,900
You guys are capable of threatening a kid like me.

160
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,567
How would you be able to guarantee my safety?

161
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:07,267
We're not trying to threaten you. We're asking for your cooperation.

162
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,767
Please trust us.

163
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,300
We'll protect you until the end, Ms. Han Song I.

164
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,833
I don't trust anyone.

165
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:17,367
Then,

166
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:20,000
would you trust Lloyd?

167
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,233
What do you mean?

168
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,400
Two boxes, right?

169
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,700
Chateauâ€¦ Cheva?

170
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,000
Chateau Cheval Blanc.

171
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,767
You're the owner. You should know how to say the wine names properly.

172
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,133
You order me around to deliver boxes.

173
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,033
Are you sure I'm the owner?

174
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:59,200
Why do you keep ordering wine that doesn't even sell well?

175
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,400
Natasha.

176
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,533
She used to like it.

177
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,967
A glass of wine. A single flower.

178
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,567
Oh, I see.

179
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,100
How lovely.

180
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,500
When will you come?

181
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,267
Song I hacked our list.

182
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:37,033
Where have you been while a single loach was turning the entire place into a muddy mess?

183
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:40,467
Our organization works in small groups. If our list is exposed, we'll be done for.

184
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,667
Find out where she is and secure the list again.

185
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,533
We already know.

186
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,267
Where is she?

187
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,367
Please don't worry.

188
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:05,067
The list hasn't made it to the hands of the national security agency.

189
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,400
Unification!

190
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,233
- Unification! Thank you for your hard work. 
 - Gosh.

191
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,900
- Oh, my god. 
 - Come on.

192
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,900
We made it!

193
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,570
Hey, hey, hey!

194
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,700
Thanks, Bro!

195
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,500
Unification.

196
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:28,767
Unification.

197
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,733
 Has Comrade Lloyd returned? 

198
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,567
Not yet.

199
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,200
You're teaching him a lesson.

200
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,900
Work him harder.

201
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,000
But wouldn't it cause any trouble?

202
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,933
 I doubt it. 

203
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,933
I have Vice Commissioner Lee under my control.

204
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:57,900
You just need to do as I say, Comrade Major General Baek.

205
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,400
Yes, Comrade Vice Commissioner.

206
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,233
 Bring Comrade No to me as soon as he gets back. 

207
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:06,067
 I want to bring him to the informant. 

208
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,433
Yes, understood.

209
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:27,700
How can soldiers be so disloyal?

210
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,033
In the movies,

211
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:32,700
teammates help each other carrying the gear

212
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,500
and get punished together if someone falls behind.

213
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,700
Where am I? I'm starving. Seriously.

214
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,867
   

215
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,433
Should we eat a boxed meal for dinner?

216
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,833
There are leftovers from yesterday's food to be discarded.

217
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,067
What are you talking about?

218
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:24,700
Your body is precious carrying a baby. You can't eat something like that.

219
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,300
Let's eat something nice.

220
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,433
Precious? You're making me blush.

221
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,733
If we don't save up diligently now,

222
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:36,500
when will we be able to buy a house and settle down as a family?

223
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:40,567
- Yu Jin. 
 - Sang Hoon.

224
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,967
You guys are so lovey-dovey.

225
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,467
You're here.

226
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,433
Don't mind us. Keep going.

227
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:50,200
- My goodness, Ma'am. 
 - No worries.

228
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,233
We haven't met. What's your name?

229
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,500
My name is Mi Rae.

230
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,700
It's my relative. She'll be staying with me for a while.

231
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:01,700
Mi Rae, make sure you greet them whenever you see them from now on.

232
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,467
Hi, Mi Rae.

233
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,967
We have a generous deal today.

234
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:09,067
Ice cream is "buy one, get one free."

235
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,267
Mi Rae, good for you.

236
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:13,900
Honey, you're mixing South Korean, North Korean, and English,

237
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,467
all three languages together again.

238
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,967
That's why Pyeonghwa City is a great place.

239
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,600
We use each other's languages

240
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
and live harmoniously together here.

241
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,467
Yes, that's absolutely right.

242
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:29,867
Okay, the generous ice cream deal of "buy one, get one free."

243
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:32,400
Let's get a variety and try them.

244
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,800
- Over here. 
 - Yes!

245
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,333
- What? 
 - Hush.

246
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,033
Gwang Yeon, how is it that you're here?

247
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:31,730
Gwang Yeon?

248
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,000
What? You're our fan, aren't you?

249
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,467
Yes, I am.

250
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,600
We only gave it to our fans the year we debuted.

251
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,467
- You must be a big fan of ours. 
 - Yes.

252
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,233
Wait, you need to run now.

253
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,133
Who are they?

254
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:47,267
Why are you being chased?

255
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:50,000
You shouldn't be here, Lloyd.

256
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,800
I know. I should've been deployed to the PR Support Unit.

257
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:58,067
I think it's my fault.

258
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,100
I reported it because I was worried about you.

259
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,967
But I never asked them to let me see you. I'm serious.

260
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:04,967
What are you talking about?

261
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,233
Hey, are you okay?

262
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:10,767
Hey, run now!

263
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,567
Follow me.

264
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,100
Run! Hurry!

265
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,133
- Find her now! 
 - Yes, sir.

266
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:46,833
Hey, you're bleeding. Are you okay?

267
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,000
What about you? Are you okay?

268
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:53,433
I can't believe this is happening. This isn't a dream.

269
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:57,033
I can't believe I ran into you here. I feel like I'm in a dream.

270
00:22:57,033 --> 00:23:00,333
Let's stop the bleeding first. Take that off.

271
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,433
- Who are those punks? 
 - Hush!

272
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,167
Because I have something, they can't kill me even if they catch me.

273
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:16,367
I'll draw their attention. You get out of here at least.

274
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,267
They wouldn't have fired if they couldn't kill you.

275
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:19,930
I'm FITA.

276
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,850
I'll protect my fan. Right?

277
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,050
FITA?

278
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:41,300
Don't you know that I set the new 100m record for the Idol Star Athletics Championships?

279
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,267
I'll go and lure them. You go and call for help quickly.

280
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,733
No.

281
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:51,567
You just run that way no matter what.

282
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,767
You want to see me again. Right?

283
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,800
If you want to see me again,

284
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,867
don't look back and run. Got that?

285
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,700
See you again.

286
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:06,500
Lloyd.

287
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,733
Get her!

288
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:30,167
If you keep doing that, your eyes are going to pop out.

289
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:34,600
Even if you wait like this, she can't visit you every day, you know?

290
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,933
I was just looking. I'm not waiting.

291
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:41,900
Wash up and go to bed.

292
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,533
After some days go by,

293
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:48,280
she'll come someday. Okay?

294
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,100
All right.

295
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:10,433
Gosh, I almost died.

296
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:12,367
Where am I?

297
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,100
There's nowhere to go. What do I do?

298
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,333
Song I, enough already.

299
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,133
Hello.

300
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:32,133
Who are you?

301
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:36,467
You're making me sad. Please don't do that.

302
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:40,600
What scares me the most is being forgotten while I'm in the military.

303
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,000
You aren't joking. Right?

304
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,267
Put your hands up.

305
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:47,500
Put your hands up, you bastards! What's with you guys?

306
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,367
Put your hands up, you bastards! I said, hands up.

307
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,867
No unit receives live ammunition while in training.

308
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,900
Oh, is that right? I wasn't aware of that.

309
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,567
I surrender.

310
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,000
I surrender. Don't shoot.

311
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,433
I surrender.

312
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:03,867
Do you need money? I have plenty.

313
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:06,567
I have a lot, but I don't have my phone, so I can't transfer it.

314
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,533
To which bank? Please don't shoot!

315
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,233
What happened?

316
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,300
How is it that you're here?

317
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,767
I don't leave a fallen soldier behind.

318
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,900
You're really amazing.

319
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,933
Comrade, you must be from 112.

320
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:07,200
Farewell.

321
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,133
No, this isn't going to work!

322
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:12,240


323
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,767
â™«  I'm clumsy and awkward  â™«

324
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:29,500
â™«  But I try to act like it's nothing  â™«

325
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,100
â™«  As a day goes by  â™«

326
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,067
