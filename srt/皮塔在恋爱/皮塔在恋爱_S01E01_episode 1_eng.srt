00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:06,767
 Hello, viewers. 

2
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:09,267
   
 After 46 years, South and North 

3
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,000
 finally achieved reconciliation. 

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,533
 Shortly after the Inter-Korean Summit in August 2000, 

5
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,367
   
 a civil aircraft of North Korea's Air Koryo 

6
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,300
 will arrive in South Korea for the first time since the division. 

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,300
   

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,967
 It was a moment when the air route between the two Koreas opened up. 

9
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:27,233
   
 The waterway to Mt. Kumgang finally opens. 

10
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:30,633
 Down the line, history will mark this day as the day 

11
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,467
 that opened the gates to full-scale exchanges between the two Koreas. 

12
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:34,400
   
 The overland tour route to Mt. Kumgang 

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,333
 across the Korean Demilitarized Zone has opened. 

14
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,900
   
 It was a historic moment reconnecting 

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,467
 the two Koreas. The trial operation of Inter-Korean trains 

16
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,667
   
 is truly amazing news. 

17
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,200
   
 Today, the leaders of the South and the North 

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,200
 agreed to build a peace city in the DMZ, which was a symbol of division, 

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,033
   
 a place that the two Koreas will cohabit 

20
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,833
   
 ahead of unification. 

21
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,033
   
 The June 15th North-South Joint Declaration… 

22
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:58,600
 South and North Korea agreed to resolve 

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,500
 the issue of national unification autonomously 

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,167
 the issue of national unification autonomously 

25
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:07,920
 by joining forces as people of one nation.

28
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,200
   

29
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:50,667
   

30
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,820
   

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,410
   

32
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,000
 The population of our metropolitan city for peaceful unification 

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,300
   
 was calculated to be 200,145. 

34
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,267
 This is an 815% increase compared to 19,438 people 

35
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:36,133
 at the time of the initial move-in. 

36
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:39,867
 The rapid increase in the number of residents of Pyeonghwa City 

37
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:43,067
 is attributable to the desire for unification of all South and North Koreans 

38
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:44,967
 and the establishment of infrastructure such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) 

39
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:47,533
 and the urban high-speed railway linking Seoul and Pyongyang, 

40
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,833
 as well as the Kaesong Industrial Zone… 

41
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,167
   

42
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,033
   

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,400
   

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
   

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,267
   

46
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,833
   

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,090
   

48
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:01,567
   

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,300
Clear energy fills the space between your eyes.

50
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,700
You look so nice and kind.

51
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,967
By the way,

52
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:15,233
how come you seem so worried and concerned, lady?

53
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,400
- A family member must be sick. 
 - My goodness.

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,900
So I should be devoted and have a shaman perform a ritual.

55
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,933
But it'll cost a lot?

56
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,267
But I was told to watch out when people like you

57
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:31,967
approach me in South Korea.

58
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,533
We're in the 21st century and the unification is near. Ritual? Devotion?

59
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:38,367
You can't save your ill family with such things.

60
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:40,333
What nonsense.

61
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,500
It is nonsense.

62
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,033
Those are all superstitions. Who told you such things?

63
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:48,733
It recently passed the FDA review in the US.

64
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,433
It's made by the top medical professionals in Korea.

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,167
Check out the texture. Be careful. Be careful.

66
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,300
Check out the texture. Be careful. Be careful.

67
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,333
This works well for cerebral hemorrhages

68
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,367
but actually, it's quite effective for cancers too.

69
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:05,700
But more than anything, heart conditions…

70
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,833
Heart conditions! Heart conditions, that's right.

71
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,733
- It's a heart medication. 
 - Yes, the heart, the heart.

72
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,700
It's really good for heart conditions.

73
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,533
Is it really effective for heart conditions?

74
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,467
Yes, of course.

75
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,533
Words aren't needed.

76
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,400
 Gosh! Lloyd! 

77
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,600
   

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
My daughter talks about FITA nonstop.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,733
Now I finally understand why.

80
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,033
FITA is a global idol group.

81
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,767
It took a year just to cast them.

82
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:05,900
You say it as if you recruited them yourself, Vice Commissioner Lee.

83
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,400
"Recruit?" You sure have the anti-ROK operations background.

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
- What did you just say? 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

85
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,767
- What did you just say? 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

86
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,133
When FITA performs here today, the entire world will be watching us.

87
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,700
When FITA performs here today, the entire world will be watching us.

88
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,733
- Let's work hard. 
 - Yes, let's work hard.

89
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,367
- Let's work hard. 
 - Yes, let's work hard.

90
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,500
And the fact that you've taken office, Mayor Won.

91
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,067
We need to let the whole world know.

92
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,967
We're going to be very busy today.

93
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,567
Look. What's a heart?

94
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,533
It's a storage where a person's entire blood gathers up, right?

95
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:38,067
The heart muscles must be tight and elastic

96
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:40,133
so that the blood can go in and out.

97
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,133
- In and out. 
 - In and out.

98
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:45,267
This medicine makes the heart muscles

99
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,033
nice and elastic.

100
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,467
It makes the heart muscles pump up and down.

101
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,000
This medicine does that.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,467
Is it really expensive?

103
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:56,200
No, the cost isn't the problem.

104
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,533
Even if you have a lot of money, you'd be lucky just to get hold of it.

105
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,767
Fortunately, we have a bottle…

106
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,467
Two bottles…

107
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,133
We have five bottles.

108
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:11,333
Please give them to me, all five bottles.

109
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:19,767
But how much is it?

110
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,433
We accept other things besides money.

111
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,233
You're healthy, right?

112
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,600
Yes! Of course.

113
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:57,133

A bomb threat?

158
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,533
Did you check the authenticity of the report?

159
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,433
We don't have time for that right now, Ms. Mayor.

160
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,300
Don't you know how important this day is?

161
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,333
Number One's surprise visit has been canceled.

162
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,600
No, wait.

163
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,133
I must stay here today.

164
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:01,200
If I, the mayor, back down to a terror threat that might even be a prank call,

the peace and trust that we've built until now

166
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,200
will collapse in an instant.

167
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,767
What if the information is true?

168
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,400
We don't know what's going to happen then.

169
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,067
Solution! Find a solution.

170
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:12,333
Can we deploy the Special Eighth Corps immediately?

171
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,467
No, we can't do that.

172
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:14,967
Pyeonghwa City represents peace.

173
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,200
- How can we do that without approval… 
 - I approve.

174
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,067
Ms. Mayor.

175
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:25,800
The whole world is paying attention to peace on the Korean Peninsula.

176
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,433
What EOD unit can be mobilized

177
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,433
right away?

178
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,067
Where are we going?

179
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,367
I've never felt like this with anyone,

180
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,767
but I feel so close to you.

181
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,233
Well, we are

182
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,333
fellow countrymen.

183
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:47,067
It seems like you just came down from the North.

184
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,700
Do you even have a place to stay the night?

185
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,667
I'll feed you, give you a place to stay,

186
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,833
and even help you earn money.

187
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,300
I'm not interested.

188
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,630
Just give me those bottles now.

189
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,600
My goodness, young lady.

190
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Do you even know how expensive that is?

191
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,700
You need to earn money first. Okay?

192
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,800
You have a beautiful face.

193
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,567
You're going to earn a ton.

194
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:10,267
No, thanks! Stop the car.

195
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:13,200
We're in the middle of nowhere. I can't stop the car now.

196
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,833
    
 There's no place to stop the car.

197
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,600
The brakes aren't working.

198
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,733
Stop the car now.

199
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,233
Gosh, seriously.

200
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm scary when I get mad.

201
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,767
Stop the car now.

202
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,267
I need to borrow your car.

203
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,767
Please pick it up in front of the pharmacy tomorrow.

210

Good work, everyone.

211
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,467
One minute to get to the meeting location.

212
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,833
We're all set and are on standby.

213
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,967
Pardon?

214
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:59,333
But this is a golden opportunity to get our message across the world.

215
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,500
 Number One's visit has been canceled. 

216
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,600
 Retrieve the item and wait for the next order. 

217
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,633
Comrade Seong!

218
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,500
Didn't you hear me saying that the operation has been called off?

219
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,933
Retrieve everything in ten minutes

220
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:16,667
and disappear without a trace.

221
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,200
Over.

222
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,700
   

223
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,333
You're really the best!

224
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,633
Come over here. Come to me.

225
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:57,033
So you're the HK-416.

226
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,000
Wow, it balances amazingly.

227
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,767
Do you even know what I went through to get this?

228
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,767
I'm sure it was hard. I couldn't even get one.

229
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,400
I didn't realize you're so capable.

230
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,567
- You're really the best… 
 - Hush.

231
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:11,867
You shouldn't say.

232
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,367
Don't speak English. It doesn't suit you.

233
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,100
   

234
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,067
Is Lloyd here?

235
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,900
He wasn't with you?

236
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,000
He went to use the restroom, but I don't know where he is.

237
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,133
He needs to join the grand finale.

238
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,833
Go look for him now. We have to get on the stage soon.

239
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,633
Okay, will do.

240
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,433
But I can't just accept it.

241
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:46,733
Don't say that. We're more than that.

242
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,833
"We"?

243
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,000
There's nothing between us.

244
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Now that I look at it, it's so perfect.

245
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,900
To be your girlfriend, one has to be as qualified as me

246
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,733
to meet the FITA standard, don't you think?

247
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,433
You can adjust this part too

248
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:02,033
and even has the holographic sight.

249
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:04,020
Wow!

250
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,933
What are you doing?

251
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
 Check Section Three. 

252
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,100
Hey. Come on.

253
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,940
Hey, wait!

254
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,267
- We found the informant. 
 - Really?

255
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:36,733
The informant stole the IP address using an internet phone,

256
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,900
but the IP address leads to your office, Vice Commissioner Lee.

257
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,633
- What? 
 - It's your office.

258
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:41,567
That's impossible.

259
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,433
But it's your office, Sir.

260
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:46,633
These awful South Korean louts are quite daring.

261
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:49,133
What did I do wrong?

262
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,333
I don't know who you are. What do you think you're doing?

263
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,533
That's mine. Give it to me.

264
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,133
Hey!

265
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,567
What do you think you're doing?

266
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:03,133
Do you want to get punched?

267
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,067
Don't touch me.

268
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:08,800
If you mistreat me, you can get killed, you know?

269
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,833
This bastard.

270
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,700
You sure can talk well

271
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,767
for someone who plays with a toy gun.

272
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:36,267
I can't just reveal my identity. You should reveal yours too, don't you think?

273
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,067
We have no time to delay.

274
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,633
Get moving!

275
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,200
Who are you?

276
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,733
I saw your faces clearly.

277
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:03,100
I'm going to follow you to the gates of hell. Got that?

278
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,967
I worked so hard to get that.

279
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:07,567
Why did you have to smash it?

280
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:10,667
Lloyd! Are you okay?

281
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,533
Are you okay? You must be in total shock. My poor, Lloyd.

282
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:19,733
- Stop taking pictures. 
 - Are you okay, Lloyd?

283
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,967
How do you feel right now?

284
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,900
    
 Lloyd and I…

285
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:32,533
I believed that we had a close relationship.

286
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,133
 So, 

287
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,467
 it was my own misunderstanding. 

288
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,167
 As soon as 

289
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,900
   
 he got what he wanted from me, 

290
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,930
 he abandoned me at once. 

291
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,000
   

292
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,867
That's not true.

293
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:51,700
Hey, that's not true.

294
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,400
This is what I wanted,

295
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
but it totally got smashed.

296
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,800
Lloyd, calm down.

297
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,167
   

298
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:07,433
This incident will go quietly thanks to the scandal involving Lloyd.

299
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,700
Rather, the concert in Pyeonghwa City entered the Top Trending Searches list.

300
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,100
It turned out to be a blessing in disguise.

301
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,767
A blessing in disguise, my foot.

302
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:16,133
It's manageable only because we stopped the newspapers and other news media.

303
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:17,800
Did you say it as a prank call?

304
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,233
It may not be a prank next time.

305
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,433
What will we do then?

306
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:25,867
So you want to summon troops

307
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,700
to this city of peace. Is that it?

308
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,600
You want to bring in military using terrorism as an excuse?

309
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,700
Are you provoking us again?

310
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,200
We won't just sit back and watch.

311
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,467
That's a great idea.

312
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,700
- What did you just say? 
 - Pardon?

313
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,333
Instead, we should form the Unified Korean Armed Force Unit in Pyeonghwa City.

314
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,533
But, Mayor Won,

315
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,367
even if it's okay with us,

316
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:50,200
would the North approve it?

317
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,067
I'll do my best.

318
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:04,467
We have a good cause.

319
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:05,867
Absolutely.

320
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:09,633
We must work together to suppress terrorism that hinders our unification.

321
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,967
We need to do some promotion work, too.

322
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:16,167
You're an excellent mayor, indeed.

323
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,000
We prevent terrorism while promoting our city.

324
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,033
Killing two birds with one stone.

325
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,330
   

326
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,700
Hello? Reporter Choi.

327
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,467
What are you talking about?

328
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:30,233
What do you mean, Lloyd pushed Avon?

329
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,600
That's a rumor. A rumor.

330
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,100
No. Sir, that's not true.

331
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,233
We're getting complaints from advertisers, too.

332
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:38,733
Sir, please make a decision soon.

333
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,233
Gun? What do you mean?

334
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:54,167
What? Possessing an illegal weapon?

335
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:56,867
Hey, that's total nonsense!

336
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,138
- Hey, you little… 
 - But…

337
00:22:58,138 --> 00:23:01,133
Hey, that wasn't a real gun. It was fake.

338
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:03,233
Sir, it was a fake gun…

339
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:10,900
Gosh, whatever. Fine.

340
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,467
I just need to lie low for a few months, right?

341
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:14,700
I'll just go play video games.

342
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,933
Hey! Hey!

343
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,160
Wow!

344
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,800
Given the situation, should I just go out with Jini Yoon for real?

345
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,733
What?

346
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:32,300
Lloyd, don't even joke about doing such a thing.

347
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,800
I heard that tabloids are yapping lately

348
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,100
about how I've never had a girlfriend and that something must be wrong with me.

349
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,633
That's because you're so cold to women

350
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,800
and you're the only member who has never been involved in a scandal.

351
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,933
You're right, Jeong Man.

352
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,267
Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, and Margot Robbie.

353
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,567
Even when someone like that tries to hit on me, I don't even flinch, you know?

354
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:49,467
- Of course, I do. 
 - But Jini Yoon

355
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,733
caused damage to my career.

356
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:52,867
Lloyd, calm down. Calm down.

357
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,133
You have to maintain your composure in a situation like this.

358
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,533
In my opinion, Jini Yoon is a tough cookie.

359
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:59,033
It's suspicious how the reporters appeared out of nowhere.

360
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,767
Forget it.

361
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:04,733
Even if the world ends tomorrow,

362
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,200
I'll die playing video games.

363
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:17,867
   

364
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,890
   

365
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,333
   

366
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,133
I almost had it.

367
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:00,200
 Didn't I say I'd follow you even to the gates of hell? 

368
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,967
 I worked so hard to get that gun. How dare you destroy it! 

369
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,433
 If I catch you, you're dead meat. 

370
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,233
 No! 

371
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,567
 What did I just witness? 

372
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,967
 Two minutes until the grand finale. 

373
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,733
 Hey, Jeong Man! 

374
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,467
 Back up. Back up. 

375
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:30,267
 I saw a real human weapon. I'm serious. 

376
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:31,800
 - Back up. 
 - No. 

377
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,100
 I can't do that even if you met your dream girl! 

378
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,133
 You have to be there for the grand finale. 

379
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:46,533
Aren't the South Korean punks practically mentally ill?

380
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:47,967
They follow around damn singers

381
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,200
and waste their time and money.

382
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,300
If they're still bored, they make prank calls.

383
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,567
It doesn't seem like it was a mere prank call.

384
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:59,933
What do you mean?

385
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,467
I found this, Sir.

386
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,633
Isn't this a detonator?

387
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:11,133
I thought hard about it, but Violet…

388
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:13,300
Don't make a big deal out of it!

389
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,367
But...

390
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:19,800
we should reinvestigate this commotion…

391
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,267
What? Do you have something else to say?

392
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,200
No, Sir.

393
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:31,033
I'll look into this matter separately,

394
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:34,600
so keep your mouth shut, Comrade Baek. Got that?

395
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,033
Understood, Comrade Vice Commissioner.

396
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,300
Did you forget my order to disappear without a trace?

397
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,467
I'm sorry, Sir.

398
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,367
Our operation has been compromised.

399
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,433
Find the informant.

400
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:38,033
Yes, Sir.

401
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:53,100
Follow me. Follow me. You'll die if you do that.

402
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:57,000
Gosh, come here.

403
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:03,667
Just follow me… Gosh.

404
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:06,533
Gosh, that stings. Protect me.

405
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:08,633
I'm going to die. That stings.

406
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,300
Darn it. Why didn't they help me?

407
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,000
If they want to win, they need to protect me. They're so frustrating.

408
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,900
Forget this.

409
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,467
   

410
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:27,300
Gosh, what now? I'm lying low!

411
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,000
 Don't you read the comments at all? 

412
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,233
I don't have time for that. I'm so busy.

413
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,300
 You should go. 

414
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,167
You told me to lie low. Go where?

415
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,000
 The military. 

416
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,767
What? The military?

417
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:55,100
Victory.

418
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,733
It'll be three weeks as of tomorrow.

419
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:27,900
You said you'd find a way at all costs as long as I finish my training.

420
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,467
But you said before

421
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:32,800
that you'd be cool and join the Marine Corps, and complete the entire term.

422
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,567
I didn't realize that it'd be so tough. I'm suffering so much. Seriously.

423
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,667
Hang in there just a little longer.

424
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,867
Then what? Would you have a solution then?

425
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm sure they'll assign you to the Defense PR Support Unit.

426
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,367
 You volunteered to go there. 

427
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:47,833
 I love you. 

428
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,200
Hey!

429
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:41,770
