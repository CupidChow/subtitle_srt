1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,733
An unauthorized overnight stay is considered a desertion.

2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:04,667
Arrest her.

3
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:07,100
What do you think you're doing?

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,667
I'm taking Platoon Leader with me.

5
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:17,967
Why are you taking her?

6
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,000
Because she's mine.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:29,410


8
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:43,033
You'll be fine without me. Right?

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,900
I have no choice, but to figure it out.

10
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:54,600
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,933
Don't apologize.

12
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:59,933
I'm the one who should apologize. I'm no help at all.

13
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:04,200
You stayed by my side the entire time.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,600
That's more than enough.

15
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,667
Why don't you

16
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,767
take this chance and be with that woman?

17
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,933
You guys look great together.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,533
It's too late now.

19
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,067
I don't want

20
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,567
to make her suffer more.

21
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,900
Do you know

22
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,833
what I regret the most in my life?

23
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:39,333
Making the person I love wait.

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,833
Don't make us wait too long.

25
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,333
Both me and her.

26
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:57,600
This is your home,

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,433
so come back any time.

28
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,433
Fine.

29
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:12,400
Platoon Leader Baek has the ex post facto reporting procedures to follow.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,600
Let's drop the issue of desertion caused by an unauthorized overnight stay.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,968
Tell me your whereabouts from yesterday afternoon to this morning.

32
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:20,267
The thing is…

33
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:23,833
I told you, she was with me the entire time.

34
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,467
Comrade No.

35
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,100
This is my strategy, so be quiet.

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,500
Even in the middle of the night?

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,467
That's nonsense.

38
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,767
Yes, we were together all night long.

39
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,067
We were never apart, not even for a moment.

40
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:39,300
I'm her alibi and a witness. Does that suffice?

41
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,167
But that makes no sense.

42
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:45,500
There's no reason for you two to be together all night, don't you think?

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,400
Why not?

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,867
We're dating.

45
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,300
You're dating?

46
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,367
Comrade, you tell me.

47
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,467
If you tell the truth, I'll consider it an extenuating circumstance.

48
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:58,900
Comrade Vice Commissioner,

49
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,500
why must I tell you about my whereabouts last night?

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,933
Please tell me the reason.

51
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:03,933
This isn't fair.

52
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,133
Six of our unit members were targeted yesterday.

53
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:11,000
But all shots fired hit the bulletproof vests,

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,850
so no one got hurt.

55
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:18,067
There aren't many snipers who can do that.

56
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,567
Vice Commissioner Park, I'm really disappointed in you.

57
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,033
How could you doubt Platoon Leader Baek with such logic?

58
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:26,500
Are you a single-celled organism?

59
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,800
A single-celled organism?

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,067
Watch your mouth.

61
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,100
You're digging your own grave.

62
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,233
Come on…

63
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,267
Both of you, please calm down.

64
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:37,933
Please calm down.

65
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,967
I suppose you didn't play card games all night.

66
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,767
Just tell us what you were doing and where.

67
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,600
If that's convincing,

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,633
it establishes an alibi. Right?

69
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,533
But you do know, Vice Commissioner Lee.

70
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,333
I do?

71
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,300
Where was I last night?

72
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,800
Pyeonghwa Hotel?

73
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,067
What are you two scheming?

74
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:07,000
I understand that it must be hard for you to believe.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,933
But I feel so horrified by the fact that I must disclose

76
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,500
my dating life like this.

77
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,933
Horrified?

78
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,467
You may not be familiar with it since you're from North Korea.

79
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,367
But in South Korea,

80
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:19,667
it's difficult for a top star like me

81
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:24,200
to reveal that I'm dating someone.

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,370
That's why Platoon Leader Baek…

83
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,600
That's why I had to

84
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,167
keep Yeong Ok a secret.

85
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,733
Because of me…

87
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,700
Is he really telling the truth?

88
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:43,900
Well…

89
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,430
It's okay.

90
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,833
You don't have to hide in the shadows anymore.

91
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,200
From now on,

92
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,067
you don't have to hide

93
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,800
your love for me.

94
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,633
You punk, you caused such big trouble.

95
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,567
It's you who caused trouble. I handled it.

96
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,933
I'm sure there was a better way to resolve it other than bluffing.

97
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,167
What other way?

98
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,800
But still.

99
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,200
What? "My girl"?

100
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,700
We're dating?

101
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,867
What ridiculous nonsense!

102
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,667
I didn't want to say that, either.

103
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,967
Is it because you don't want my help or you don't like to lie?

104
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,933
If they find out that we lied,

105
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,700
have you thought about what could happen?

106
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,767
As long as you don't mess up, they will never find out.

107
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,767
Why are you going this far?

108
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:51,700
Are you asking because you really don't know?

109
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,967
That punk. What on earth is he thinking?

110
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:06,800
I've always thought he was playing with fire,

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,433
but he really crossed the line this time.

112
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:10,567
Do you believe what he said?

113
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,333
I'm not a single-celled organism.

114
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,767
How could I?

115
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,267
How about you wait and see…

116
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:19,100
I already have a plan.

117
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,233
Get Baek Yeong Ok off this mission

118
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:27,367
and focus on finding Seong Jae Hoon, Comrade Cho.

119
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,767
I'm at your service, sir.

120
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:40,233
Vice Commissioner Lee.

121
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,900
There's a CCTV over there.

122
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,733
This isn't the Fifth Republic.

123
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,233
Don't you think media restriction is too severe?

124
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:56,400
It's all for our country's peace and unification—

125
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,967
We need to make a living too, you know?

126
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,467
Seriously?

127
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,800
Satisfied?

128
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,467
Satisfied? Then go now.

129
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:19,833
- Don't follow me. 
 - Okay.

130
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,400
   

131
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,500
- Hello, Mr. Ban? 
  - Hey, Jeong Man. 

132
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,867
 Are you properly caring for Lloyd? 

133
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:37,500
Yes, of course.

134
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,167
I'm up all day and night,

135
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:43,900
taking care of Lloyd. I'm so exhausted.

136
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,500
 Hey! Every word out of your mouth is a lie. 

137
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,567
Sir, why are you getting mad?

138
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,100
 What? Why am I mad? 

139
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,833
 How could I not be? 

140
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,133
 Haven't you seen the internet? 

141
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,333
 Lloyd has been caught in a scandal. 

142
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,233
Sorry?

143
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:58,600
What did you say? What?

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,767
 Come into the office now. 

145
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,067
No.

146
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,300
That crazy…

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,067
   

148
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:20,133
   

149
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:23,233
   

150
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,433
How do you plan to handle this?

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,400
You've never gotten into a scandal. Now while in the military of all times?

152
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,267
How does it make sense?

153
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,267
It doesn't.

154
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:45,600
Did you get shot in the head? Is there a hole?

155
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,967
You shouldn't do this to me. It's hard for me, too.

156
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,433
Take these vitamins.

157
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,233
Mr. Ban went to buy a missile.

158
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,733
He wants to destroy you.

159
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,200
And what about the fans?

160
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,367
I feel bad for the fans,

161
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,733
but they'd understand if they knew the situation I was in.

162
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,000
Understand what?

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,933
Even I can't understand.

164
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:06,267
Even firmly denying it won't be good enough.

165
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:09,067
But what? What did you say? "She's my girl"?

166
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:12,067
As an idol star, you can't ever say that you have a girlfriend!

167
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,567
Don't you know that?

168
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:19,167
Please tell the members and Mr. Ban that I'm sorry.

169
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,000
Jeong Man,

170
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,933
I admit that I acted rashly,

171
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,167
but I don't regret it.

172
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:34,133
Lloyd, let's just tell them it's a misunderstanding.

173
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:36,700
Because it's not true, you know?

174
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,333
Does Platoon Leader Baek like you too? No, right?

175
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,600
That's not what's important.

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,633
If I back out now, she'll get hurt.

177
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,033
- Yes, Mr. Ban. 
  - Hey, Jeong Man. 

178
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,900
 Wow, Platoon Leader Baek saved us. 

179
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,067
 Hey, read the article. 

180
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,767
 Anyway, FITA fans are really something. 

181
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,633
Pardon?

182
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,700
What? Does he want to kill me?

183
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,833
Gosh, whatever. He can just kill me if he wants.

184
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,600
Whatever.

185
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,267
Lloyd.

186
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,133
I think we'll be okay.

187
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:16,733
No, actually,

188
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,067
we're saved.

189
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:27,733
   

190
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,867
By any chance, is this me?

191
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,500
Then, I would've destroyed it already.

192
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:39,500
At once.

193
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,367
Please go easy on me, won't you?

194
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,267
We're fellow comrades on the same team, you know?

195
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,200
Everyone in the North and South is making a fuss about us.

196
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,267
What on earth are you thinking, Comrade?

197
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

198
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,600
- Unification. 
 - You startled me, seriously.

199
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,733
What's the matter?

200
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,567
Vice Commissioner Park asked for me, so I went to see him.

201
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,567
And?

202
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,567
Hey, is this for real?

203
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,900
Yes, it is.

204
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,600
He called me in discreetly

205
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,733
and asked me to spy on the two of you carefully.

206
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,067
Spy on us?

207
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:20,967
He asked me to monitor you to see if you're really dating and to report to him.

208
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,967
Nam Sik,

209
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:26,000
tell him that you saw the two of us kissing.

210
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:28,867
How embarrassing.

211
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:30,667
I'll do as you say,

212
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,900
but the problem is that I'm not the only one he gave the order to.

213
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,267
Many people are watching you.

214
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:39,567
Oh, my god. I need some popcorn to watch this.

215
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,333
You mean, corn puff snack?

216
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,533
I'll go bring some.

217
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,033
Why did you hit me?

218
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,933
Comrade Gye, I want to know why you're telling us all this.

219
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,433
To me,

220
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:01,933
it's not important what the truth is.

221
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:07,533
I just don't want Comrade Platoon Leader Baek to be sent back to North Korea

222
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:13,100
and I support the revolutionary love between two citizens that goes beyond borders.

223
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,167
Fortunately, this incident

224
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,800
got buried by Lloyd's scandal.

225
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Yes, Ma'am.

226
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,767
The public is very excited about the South-North couple.

227
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,900
Do you actually believe what that punk said?

228
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,067
Is the Lloyd scandal fabricated?

229
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,067
No, Ma'am.

230
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:36,000
It began when they were in the hospital together.

231
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Vice Commissioner Lee, you're just jumping to conclusions.

232
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,167
Okay, listen.

233
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,333
There'll be a peace agreement ceremony of the South and North soon.

234
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:50,600
I ask the two of you to cooperate carefully to prevent any unsavory situations.

235
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,067
You heard about Lloyd already. Right?

236
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,867
Someone I want to have.

237
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,133
I still feel the same.

238
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:03,467
Do you want to have him or do you love him?

239
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,233
Both.

240
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:49,867
Please finish your food

241
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:52,767
if you don't want them to find out on day one.

242
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,567
It makes it easier if you pretend that everyone's eyes are camera lenses.

243
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,833
They'll lose their interest soon if there isn't anything exciting.

244
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,067
I don't have the same state of mind as you.

245
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:18,133
You know that I'm trying to understand your state of mind right now. Right?

246
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,500
The way you acted that day,

247
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,733
no one understands it.

248
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,833
I couldn't make sense of it in my head, either.

249
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,200
Only my heart does.

250
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,833
Enjoy your food.

251
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,933
You've never been on a date before?

252
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,300
It's not like we're going on a mission.

253
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,900
Why do we have to

254
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,800
wear our uniforms?

255
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,667
We're going on a mission.

256
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:10,533
In any case, how many people are following us?

257
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,267
Three or four, I think?

258
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:15,400
But I think there could be more.

259
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,167
Let's start acting.

260
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,633
Why are you asking me to ride a bike

261
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,000
at a park for no reason?

262
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,767
The thing is

263
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,067
that people who are in love

264
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:32,333
ride a bike together at parks.

265
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,067
In any case, please don't mention anything to Mi Rae. Understood?

266
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,700
In any case, please don't mention anything to Mi Rae. Understood?

267
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,633
You still don't know FITA fans very well.

268
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:44,667
I bet she already knows that we're dating.

269
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,433
What's up with your acting?

270
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:55,233
It's been a while since I had fun last time.

271
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,567
Let's hold hands first.

272
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,533
Run on the count of three.

273
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:08,500
One, two…

274
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,980
Gosh­.

275
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:38,867
Congratulations, you two. You're Mi Rae's elder sister, right?

276
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:42,467
And you're Mr. Lloyd.

277
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,167
South Korean man and North Korean woman. They look so good together. Right, Honey?

278
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:50,333
We're big fans of yours.

279
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,433
If we could have your autograph,

280
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,200
we'll feel so honored and pass it down from generation to generation.

281
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,300
Oh, okay.

282
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,067
Of course, I will.

283
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,900
I suppose I'm popular in North Korea, too?

284
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,733
I'm not sure about that.

285
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,933
I mean, we're big fans of yours.

286
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:11,867
Oh, I see.

287
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,133
Thank you.

288
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,067
I hope many South-North and North-South couples follow suit in Pyeonghwa City.

289
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:23,233
As you know, we're such a fantastic couple.

290
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,833
That's enough.

291
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,833
That's how she reacts when she feels embarrassed.

292
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,033
Well, goodbye.

293
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:34,500
- Don't forget this. 
 - Oh, right.

294
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,133
- Go home safely. 
 - Thank you. Take care.

295
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:38,867
Please come again.

296
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,233
Don't they remind us of our old days?

297
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:47,130
I hope they become happy like us, right?

298
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,000
No worries.

300
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:17,267
So,

301
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:21,000
what a pair of lovely lovebirds.

302
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,333
It's not like that.

303
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,133
You aren't Avon.

304
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,933
Mi Rae.

305
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:33,267
Of course, I'm not Avon.

306
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:35,567
Don't you know who I am?

307
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,500
As for me,

308
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm the leader who represents FITA.

309
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,333
I'm Lloyd. Hi.

310
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,933
Oh, my.

311
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:44,467
He isn't that great to begin with,

312
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:47,900
but now that I see him in person, he isn't even your type.

313
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,933
Don't be silly, Mi Rae.

314
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,633
What does your sister like then?

315
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,200
Some belly fat like a party officer.

316
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,833
Broad shoulders. Eyes that resemble wild grapes.

317
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,667
But that's not the trend nowadays.

318
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,433
She's totally right.

319
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,267
You have to look as strong as me to be considered a manly man.

320
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:07,500
What's up with you guys?

321
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,100
What are you doing here?

322
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,633
We just came to a restaurant to eat. What's wrong with that?

323
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:14,767
Hello.

324
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,100
Hi, kiddo.

325
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Hi.

326
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,400
Come on in.

327
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,433
Let's invite the convenience store couple, too,

328
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:28,100
and have a feast today for the first time in a long time.

329
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,333
A feast?

330
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,133
Your man is here too,

331
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:36,467
so wouldn't it be sad not to have a feast?

332
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,033
It's not like that.

333
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:44,133
If your mother and father were alive,

334
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,933
they'd been so happy.

335
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,867
I shouldn't have said that.

336
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:56,200
Go bring a nice bottle of sesame oil from the room.

337
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,933
Okay.

338
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,800
Comrade Seong.

339
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,133
- Makgeolli, cheers. 
 - Cheers.

340
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,200
But that's not helpful.

341
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Don't listen to him. It's total gibberish.

342
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,900
Listen carefully, okay?

343
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,800
If you do as I say, you could benefit greatly.

344
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
So tell me.

345
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,133
How will I know if you don't tell me?

346
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:44,100
We know Comrade Platoon Leader Baek quite well.

347
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,133
But we don't think

348
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:48,133
Comrade No fully won Comrade Platoon Leader Baek's heart.

349
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:49,933
But we're dating.

350
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:51,933
It's very obvious to us.

351
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:55,800
North Korean women don't act so cold when they have totally fallen for you.

352
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,533
It's entirely different from being coy.

353
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,167
Even if you're dating already, if you want to win her heart,

354
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,700
you need a strategy.

355
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,167
Strategy?

356
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:07,000
Like how? Keep going.

357
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,900
What did he say?

358
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,367
He's telling you to go.

359
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:10,600
- All of a sudden? 
 - No.

360
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,067
No, no.

361
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:14,800
Keep going. Continue what you were saying.

362
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,400
What strategy?

363
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,700
Listen carefully, Comrade.

364
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:27,033
North Korean women like men who are strong and as tough as steel.

365
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:29,267
Show a quick smile.

366
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:32,300
- Then hit the brick with your head. Bam. 
 - That's right.

367
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,367
Destroy it.

368
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,433
Break a brick with your head out of nowhere?

369
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,067
Hit it hard with your head. Bam.

370
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:39,900
Lloyd, don't do that.

371
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,733
You must give her a gift.

372
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,533
You're rich, you know?

373
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:47,100
Get her something that's most expensive and the best.

374
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,600
- You mean, just buy her a designer bag. Right? 
 - Yes.

375
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,833
Gosh, listen to that South Korean capitalist punk.

376
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,300
More than money or words,

377
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,467
your heart matters the most.

378
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:59,367
That's what I'm talking about, man.

379
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:03,100
Hey, heart?

380
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,933
A heart that's as fickle as the wind? It changes instantly when there's no money.

381
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,633
Yes, that's right.

382
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:10,033
Be quiet.

383
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,533
Aren't you guys all single?

384
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,067
Is anyone dating at the moment?

385
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,000
You're crossing the line.

386
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:24,267
These are your and Mi Rae's passports.

387
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:26,000
We'll go to China first

388
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,600
and catch a flight to the US.

389
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,833
We don't need these.

390
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,167
What are you talking about?

391
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,233
You saved my life. This is nothing.

392
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,667
I just paid you back for what I owed you ten years ago.

393
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:44,567
Ten years ago?

394
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,333
If it weren't for you, Comrade Jae Hoon,

395
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:51,167
I wouldn't be alive now.

396
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,200
What about Mi Rae then?

397
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,967
You know me, don't you?

398
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:04,300
I must get surgery for Mi Rae on my own.

399
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,767
I promised her.

400
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,700
I can't even ask you to come with me, then.

401
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:30,067
Do you even want to leave?

402
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,500
From now on,

403
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:48,533
I hope

404
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:51,833
we don't meet ever again.

405
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,267
I really mean it.

406
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:16,267
We're going to meet again for sure.

407
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,933
That must be our fate.

408
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,500
Wow! That was amazing.

409
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:26,280
  ­ 

410
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,067
This is so great.

411
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:39,067
Where are we?

412
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:41,833
This isn't our rooftop, is it?

413
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,100
Tell me about it.

414
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,600
You said you'd let us have a date alone. What happened?

415
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,733
There are paparazzi everywhere.

416
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:52,167
Therefore…

417
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,400
We prepared this.

418
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:59,733
Peace Beach in Peace City.

419
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:25,567
Why are you so excited about joining someone else's date?

420
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,767
Seriously.

421
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,700
Isn't it good?

422
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,067
It's nicely grilled.

423
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,000
Love you more!

424
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:58,870
I'll not let you slide. Just you wait!

425
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,950
Hey, don't come over here.

426
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:44,290
♫  I can do anything... Oh-oh... You are my everything  ♫

427
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:48,033
Okay, come on in.

428
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,600
Everyone worked hard today.

429
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,700
I got to see Yeong Ok smile for the first time in a long time.

430
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,567
It was so great to see Mi Rae so happy.

431
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:14,767
Do I resemble your son a lot?

432
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:21,367
If I hadn't let go of that little hand back then...

433
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,033
and if he grew up by my side, I would think so.

434
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:38,933
Are there any unique characteristics that you can recognize him by?

435
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:44,800
On his elbow, he has a burn scar that looks like

436
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,500
the map of the Korean Peninsula.

437
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:52,567
That was my fault, too.

438
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,900
If I hadn't taken my eyes off him…

439
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:19,833
We prepared a heartfelt gift for you two.

440
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:23,200
It's okay. Soldiers don't get paid much.

441
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,000
Why do you keep putting us together?

442
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,100
I don't know what the gift is,

443
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,467
but I'll treat you with ten times the amount that you spent today.

444
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:33,133
But don't you think they are very thoughtful?

445
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:36,800
We hope you're happy together for a long time.

446
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,933
Ta-da.

447
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,133
- Look. 
 - Surprise.

448
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:43,133
I picked it out.

449
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:46,833
Why did you pick that? I hate it.

450
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:52,233
What is that? You guys wear it. Matching shirts are so last season.

451
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,633
They look lovely.

452
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,867
Please stop.

453
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:31,867
Here you go.

454
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,267
Do you have feelings for me?

455
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,230
Feelings?

456
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,767
I knew you were blunt,

457
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:02,033
but how could you change the tempo from ballad to EDM so abruptly?

458
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:05,067
BPM is just way too fast.

459
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:07,700
Don't like me.

460
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,533
We should've never met from the start.

461
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,830
Why?

462
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,967
Are you asking because you really don't know?

463
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:24,900
Because we're too different?

464
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:29,500
But isn't this Pyeonghwa City where North and South unite?

465
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:33,300
That's a separate issue.

466
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:37,367
You sacrificed too much.

467
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,833
I'll always be grateful for what you've done.

468
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,033
Are my feelings one-sided?

469
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,700
I like you, too.

470
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,733
But it must end here.

471
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,833
After today, forget everything.

472
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,167
I'll do the same.

473
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:16,000
You care about me so much...

474
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:19,567
to the point that you want to forget about me?

475
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,967
After today…

476
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:08,110


477
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,867
We could've slept more, don't you think?

478
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:19,467
Do you all want to end up at a coal mine?

479
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:21,433
Go back in now and sleep.

480
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,167
Unification.

481
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:28,280
What's a coal mine? A coal mine…

482
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,150
 Hey! 

483
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:36,233
 What's a coal mine? 

484
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,667
Why do you keep following me?

485
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:50,367
You usually end a date by walking the girl home.

486
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:52,333
But this is a dorm.

487
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,700
Go now.

488
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,367
I'll watch you go inside first.

489
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,650
   

490
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,833
What's wrong?

491
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,890
   

492
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,633
What's going on?

493
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:40,133
 (What?) 

494
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,833
 (Tell me.) 

495
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:50,300
 (Wiretap.) 

496
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:53,167
Wire—

497
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,600
   

498
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,400
I know these punks are in love, but still,

499
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,510
what on earth are they doing on a military compound?

500
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,540
 ­It feels good. 

501
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,350
It feels so good!

502
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:06,167
You should've been an actor, not a singer.

503
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,933
I had many roles offered to me,

504
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,000
but because of my musical ambition—

505
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,900
Shut your mouth.

506
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,633
Go back now.

507
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:16,367
Fine, I'm going.

508
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:22,133
But I've got to do something before I go.

509
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,433
♫  I'm clumsy and awkward  ♫

510
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:50,067
♫  But I try to act like it's nothing  ♫

511
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:52,800
♫  As a day goes by  ♫

512
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,667
♫  And another month goes by  ♫

513
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,800
♫  Will I be  ♫

514
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,433
♫  A little closer to you then  ♫

515
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:03,700
♫  You and me  ♫

516
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,133
♫  So special  ♫

517
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,067
♫  Love my hurt  ♫

518
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,733
♫  Only for you  ♫

519
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:12,033
♫  I wish for you  ♫

520
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:14,900
♫  I was hoping for romance  ♫

521
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,667
♫  A heart-pounding day  ♫
