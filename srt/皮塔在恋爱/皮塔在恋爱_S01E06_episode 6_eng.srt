1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:11,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,300
If you move even a single step, I'm going to pull the trigger.

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,833
You, an idol star, is going to shoot me with those hands that used to hold a mic?

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:23,767
Yes.

5
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:24,900
Do you want to test it out?

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,567
Is that a real gun at least?

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,967
Do you think I came here unprepared?

8
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,933
Our unit members will arrive soon.

9
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,433
Let's take care of these punks all together.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,667
Are you all right?

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,300
 Lloyd!­ 

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,533
My stomach.

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,033
Where are they?

14
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:13,467
Come out!

15
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,267
What on earth is going on?

17
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,100
Mind your own business.

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,867
You don't even belong to our unit anymore.

19
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,533
How could I not mind it?

20
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:27,100
My fan risked her life for me and is dying right now.

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,400
Why are they trying to kill Song I?

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,767
I need to know.

23
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,533
Fine. You've seen it yourself, haven't you, Comrade No?

24
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:40,333
Things could go down really badly.

25
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,733
You got lucky and survived with a fake gun this time,

26
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,867
but you'll have no such luck next time.

27
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:50,167
I don't want to get involved, either, but these things keep happening.

28
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,400
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with me, but it does. Right?

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,500
Am I wrong?

30
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,133
   

31
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:13,100
The separated families of South and North aren't moving in as much as we expected.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,800
It's been more than 70 years since the country was divided.

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,333
It's a given, don't you think?

34
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:21,833
I'm sure many people already passed away while waiting.

35
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,767
To draw the entire nation's attention,

36
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:27,433
we need fresh impetus.

37
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:28,833
For example,

38
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,600
we promote it using Lloyd.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,367
You're really using him for everything, aren't you?

40
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,600
Isn't he returning to the PR Support Unit?

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,367
No, he isn't.

42
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,600
Lloyd belongs to the Unified Armed Force Unit.

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,867
We can do anything.

44
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:49,933
I'm sure you're well aware,

45
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:53,700
but you can't pressure him or do things unofficially.

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,733
Of course not.

47
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:55,833
This decision

48
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,467
is based on the agreement between Lloyd and me.

49
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:04,200
Please submit reports on how we can give additional support

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,500
to separated families of Pyeonghwa City.

51
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,700
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,467
What a nuisance.

53
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,530
  ­ 

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,167
Is that Song I's cell phone?

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,033
I knew it.

56
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:38,900
It's my birthday.

57
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,533
What are you doing here?

58
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:44,600
Can't you guess it just by looking at the wallpaper?

59
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,500
Look at these. They're all pictures of me.

60
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,733
Team Leader,

61
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,567
let's work together?

62
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,567
I'm absolutely certain that I can be of help to you.

63
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,500
Answer my question at once.

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,167
What are you doing here, Comrade No?

65
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,833
Unification! Private No Gwang Yeon.

66
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,733
I was ordered to serve in the Unified Armed Force Unit…

67
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,567
I came here of my own volition.

68
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,900
Hey, my dear fellow soldiers.

69
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm back. Everyone, make some noise!

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,167
Lloyd. Oh, my god. What the—

71
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,633
What's with that face?

72
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,033
People don't maltreat me like this in other places.

73
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,433
I wonder why you're like this.

74
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:33,133
Comrade No, are you not taking military seriously?

75
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:36,000
Why do you keep changing your mind?

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,767
You guys are so ridiculous.

77
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,800
Didn't you try to convince me that this was a good place?

78
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,200
It's not because of the pay, right?

79
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,900
Okay, listen. I came back because… Well…

80
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:50,800
Since you're new, you sort the garbage.

81
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,900
I missed you, bro. I really did.

82
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,600
But I did it last week.

83
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,167
It's your turn to do it this week, John Kim.

84
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:01,200
I think Korean is really hard to understand.

85
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:08,967
That entertainer figured out

86
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:11,600
the girl's cell phone passcode. Right?

87
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, I requested for a forensic analysis.

88
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:17,367
Didn't I tell you?

89
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:21,667
I told you, there must be a reason why that girl visited the hospital.

90
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:26,367
There's definitely something between the two.

91
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,400
Don't you think so?

92
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,367
In my opinion, it's just a singer and his fan—

93
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:30,833
Did you look up the vehicle records?

94
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,867
Yes.

95
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,533
It's a car belonging to a small advertising photography company.

96
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,033
It wasn't registered under a fake name?

97
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,500
It doesn't seem like it.

98
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,767
No, wait.

99
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,967
They're trying so hard to kill a mere girl.

100
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:48,500
They must be looking for something.

101
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,433
Shouldn't we find it before they do?

102
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,667
I'll find it.

103
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Let's confirm it first.

104
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,067
Let's use bait.

105
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:06,967
If the bait works, it means there's something that will be useful.

106
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Things will get interesting for the first time in a long time.

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,400
Let's cast a net and corner the fish.

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,200
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

109
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,233
Something came up so I must do.

110
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,600
I wonder what it is.

111
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,067
Ms. Seo, can you look into someone for me?

112
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,433
Are you asking me to dig into someone's background?

113
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:47,433
You were the only person I could think of to ask for help.

114
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:50,467
I was the only person you could think of?

115
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,190
 ­Wow. 

116
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:59,000
If you're asking me as a friend, not as your lawyer, I'll help.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,167
A friend? Sure, let's do that then.

118
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,300
But in return, you have to do a favor for me next time.

119
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
How does that sound?

120
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,667
Okay, sounds good.

121
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,433
 What do you mean by bait? 

122
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,410
 Who else? 

123
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:29,233
 Do you mean, Comrade No? 

124
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,833
 Didn't they try to kill a girl who doesn't even have a chance of surviving? 

125
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,167
 To eliminate any possibilities, 

126
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:41,067
 they wouldn't leave Comrade No alone, don't you think? 

127
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:43,233
 If Comrade No has something, 

128
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,000
 there's no reason why he wouldn't tell us. 

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,800
 How would you know? 

130
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,000
 Are you sure about that? 

131
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,800
 But it would be dangerous for him to be included in the mission now. 

132
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,433
 Comrade No hasn't gotten proper training yet… 

133
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:59,467
 What do you think you're doing worrying about him? 

134
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:13,133
Gosh, you startled me.

135
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,900
You should've knocked.

136
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,167
We're all busy. Let's not fuss over things like that.

137
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,933
What brings you here?

138
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,733
If you're going to contribute, you should make it firm.

139
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:26,200
We should do marketing that you love so much, Vice Commissioner Lee.

140
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,500
What marketing?

141
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:32,267
With the entertainer,

142
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,667
shouldn't we make a flashing show of the Unified Armed Force Unit?

143
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,667
For the reunion of separated families,

144
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:42,300
let's draw the attention of all people in both the North and the South.

145
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,533
That's quite ambitious.

146
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,667
I was already thinking about it.

147
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,200
Is that right?

148
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,367
You can take all the credit for it, Vice Commissioner Lee.

149
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:57,133
They say, "strike while the iron is hot." Let's proceed immediately.

150
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,800
You really love starting things immediately,

151
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Sounds good. Right now.

152
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,833
I'll let you get back to work.

153
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,767
Why wouldn't it go in?

154
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,550
 ­  

155
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,870
 ­  

156
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,660
 ­  

157
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,000
  ­ 

158
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,267
Hold on.

159
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:52,967
No outsiders are allowed here.

160
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,467
May I see your ID?

161
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,167
I'm sorry. I'm terrible with directions.

162
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,600
Comrade Seong Jae Hoon?

163
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,467
What brings you here?

164
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,300
I came to see you,

165
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,067
but I ended up getting lost.

166
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,167
I didn't know you were coming. What's going on?

167
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,833
I was just curious

168
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,933
about the Unified Armed Force Unit of North and South.

169
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,767
Isn't the mood quite different from that of the Republic?

170
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:47,133
I never imagined

171
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,533
that the world will come in which we who were raised as warriors of the Republic

172
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,300
are no longer needed.

173
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,100
I doubt that.

174
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,067
Comrade Seong Jae Hoon, you were injured serving our country.

175
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,967
Wouldn't they compensate you once the unification happens?

176
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:04,367
Compensate me? How?

177
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:09,733
I've never seen a soldier as great as you.

178
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:12,800
Look at me.

179
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
I'm totally just a civilian now.

180
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,333
I like the way things are now.

181
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,767
I think I'll be busy soon.

182
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,933
Really? Is something going on?

183
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,633
I'm totally dumbfounded.

184
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:30,033
It wasn't enough that they meet up outside

185
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:33,233
and now he even visits the unit to have a date?

186
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:39,667
Don't disturb the work of your platoon comrade.

187
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,500
Comrade Gae, I'm not trying to interrupt.

188
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
I just need to tell her something. Okay?

189
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,167
Gosh, let go of me!

190
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,000
Hey, wait. Can you listen to me for a second?

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,367
No, it's not like that. Hey!

192
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,050
Answer your phone.

193
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,100
Got it. I'll come up.

194
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,533
You must be busy. I'm sorry that I came to visit unannounced.

195
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,433
No worries.

196
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,367
Okay.

197
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,200
Then, get back to work. I'll go now.

198
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,200
I'll go now. Bye.

199
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:48,633
Gwang Tae must be a young man in his twenties now.

200
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,533
Yes.

201
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:56,067
He takes after his father,

202
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:59,090
so I'm sure he's handsome.

203
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,767
On behalf of Pyeonghwa City,

204
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,533
I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to the hard work

205
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,600
of the Unified Armed Force Unit.

206
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,167
Gratitude?

207
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,300
They're doing their duty as soldiers.

208
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:20,300
You're the symbol of Pyeonghwa City now.

209
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,433
And as for Private No Gwang Yeon,

210
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:26,780
he's the face of Pyeonghwa City.

211
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:32,267
In any case,

212
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:35,967
I plan to create a calendar using you as models.

213
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,500
And the entire proceeds

214
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,667
will be used for the separated families of Pyeonghwa City.

215
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,933
Private No Gwang Yeon. I have a question.

216
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes, go ahead.

217
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,500
Well, your intentions are good.

218
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,533
But did you come to an agreement with my agency?

219
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,600
That's a good question.

220
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Private No Gwang Yeon, you're a member of the Unified Armed Force Unit now.

221
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,967
Please don't forget that.

222
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,100
A model?

223
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
How can we make a fool of ourselves like that?

224
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,767
You're a warrior of the Republic. Is there something you aren't capable of?

225
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:04,867
No, sir!

226
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll make sure to do my best to contribute to the Republic!

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,367
Private No Gwang Yeon.

228
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,233
At this filming,

229
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:23,133
may I expect to see your outstanding performance, Comrade No?

230
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,400
I'll do my best.

231
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,300
Unification.

232
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,533
Comrade Vice Commissioner.

233
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,133
Please consider it one more time.

234
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,267
Not just Comrade No,

235
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:42,267
but it could put our unit members in danger too.

236
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,367
We must take risks to get results.

237
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:13,267
Now that you don't wear military uniforms, are you ignoring my orders?

238
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,367
No, sir.

239
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Seung Tae.

240
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
Let's not get ahead.

241
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
Jae Hoon.

242
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,767
We have to kill Lloyd.

243
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:27,800
You know that, don't you?

244
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,667
If Song I handed over the file to Lloyd, all of us are in danger.

245
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,400
Don't make me repeat myself. We have to wait until the right time!

246
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,733
We used up all our chances of getting into the Unified Armed Force Unit because of you.

247
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,267
Your rash judgment

248
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,600
has become a big obstacle for our organization's future. Got that?

249
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,633
Is it because of Comrade Baek Yeong Ok?

250
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,900
What did you say?

251
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,533
Rather than our organization's safety,

252
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,467
it seems like you're more concerned about her.

253
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,500
Comrade,

254
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,833
did you forget how we got to where we are today?

255
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,433
Let's not cross the line.

256
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,000
Got that?

257
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:59,567
 I believed North and South would never unite. 

258
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,433
 It's really amazing news. 

259
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,667
 Today, the leaders of the South and the North 

260
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,033
 agreed to build a peace city in the DMZ, which was a symbol of division, 

261
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:08,500
 a place that the two Koreas will cohabit 

262
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,100
 ahead of unification. 

263
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,133
 Based on the June 15th North-South Joint Declaration, 

264
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:17,700
 the unification issue should be resolved autonomously by joining forces as one nation… 

265
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,433
Jae Hoon, do you think unification is really possible?

266
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:26,367
Then, will we go back to North Korea?

267
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,767
Just eat. The food is getting cold.

268
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,000
I can't get in touch with Mr. Jung.

269
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:38,633
Since when?

270
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:41,167
I think it was starting last week.

271
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:56,733
 Barriers kept piling up over the time of 70 years. 

272
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:01,333
 It led to greater mistrust and ignorance. 

273
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,267
 And people who were indifferent about unification. 

274
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:10,433
 And that became a stronger barrier 

275
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:13,300
 that I ended up believing there was no future where the Korean Peninsula 

276
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,700
 will be united. 

277
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,733
- Seung Tae. 
 - Yes?

278
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,300
Look to the right and run right away.

279
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,167
You go that way.

280
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,200
It'll be dangerous on your own.

281
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,767
- There's no time. Go report it! 
 - Jae Hoon.

282
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,800
Go now!

283
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,167
 We, who gave our lives for the Republic… 

284
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,467
Jae Hoon.

285
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,633
 were eliminated like that. 

286
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,533
 Like slaughtered animals. 

287
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:49,433
Next, this one. Chocolate.

288
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,300
Yes, okay.

289
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,467
Let me put them aside first.

290
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:56,500
Count this one too.

291
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:03,333
It seems like it was unsuccessful again.

292
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,133
Every time they visit the separated families liaison office,

293
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,033
they feel down.

294
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:11,167
As for the family of Grandfather Seok, she must be over 80 years old now.

295
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,000
So it's uncertain if she's still alive.

296
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,167
As for Ms. Geum Sook, she doesn't even know if he's in the North or the South,

297
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,600
or somewhere in China.

298
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,100
This country isn't even that big. I feel so bad for them.

299
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,567
Honey, let's always be thankful as we live.

300
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,967
Yu Jin,

301
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,333
shouldn't you go to your parents' place to give birth

302
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,733
and recover there?

303
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:37,600
But you can't come.

304
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,300
I'll just give birth here.

305
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,400
I feel so ashamed before your parents.

306
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,867
As for your parents who passed away,

307
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:48,633
I can't even visit them.

308
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,000
So what's the point of having trains that run at 400km per hour?

309
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,433
We can't even go visit.

310
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,400
When our kids, Peace and Unification, are born,

311
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,000
let's hope that we can go back and forth freely.

312
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,200
Let's hope.

313
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,767
It's a soldier's duty to protect our country by bearing arms.

314
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:09,467
What do they mean, we have to take pictures to promote?

315
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:13,100
Promoting is what you guys do best.

316
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,067
Yo! Come on, man. It's for a good cause.

317
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:20,333
It's for a good cause. We've got this, bro. Come on, let's get it. Give me five.

318
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,167
Gosh. For Pyeonghwa City's peace, I'll do it.

319
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,467
Don't get too excited.

320
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:25,800
Lloyd will get the lead role,

321
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,967
and we'll just be in the background.

322
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,000
What's wrong with you?

323
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,333
I'll show them the spirit of North Koreans.

324
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,167
I'll show them what I got too.

325
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:37,033
- I'll do my best! 
 - That's right. Let's go!

326
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:47,100
Comrade Do Hyeon, come with us.

327
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,400
Okay, here we go.

328
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,367
You're the heroes who protect Pyeonghwa City.

329
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,867
You'd gladly sacrifice your life.

330
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:25,400
Don't forget the theme of being the brave special forces soldiers.

331
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,933
Listen to them talking carelessly since it doesn't concern their own lives.

332
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,400
Please look over here.

333
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Okay, one, two.

334
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,367
Please change the pose a little.

335
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,833
Okay, one, two.

336
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,167
Okay, great.

337
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,667
Here we go again. Do a different pose.

338
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:52,467
Look cooler.

339
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,833
I'm so honored, Mr. Lloyd.

340
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,533
I'm not a singer now. I'm a soldier who protects our country.

341
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,467
What are you talking about?

342
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:07,500
You're Lloyd, the lead dancer and the lead singer of FITA.

343
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,800
You're making me blush. Please stop.

344
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,567
Mr. Lloyd, we'll take a couple of solo shots of you from now.

345
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:15,100
Sure, sounds good.

346
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:35,167
 Seung Tae, do you seriously have a death wish? 

347
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,467
I'm dead already.

348
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,700
It's a trap. Get out of there now!

349
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,767
 I'm just doing what I need to do. 

350
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,100
You focus on what you need to do, Jae Hoon.

351
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,430
  ­ 

352
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,300
Gosh, darn it. What was that?

353
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,733
The ten o'clock direction. Number three and four, block the path.

354
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,867
Rest of you, follow me.

355
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:39,633
What Han Song I stole

356
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:42,500
was the list of names of Violet members.

357
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:51,133
You punk, you should've told us sooner.

358
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:00,133
You must find it and bring it to me.

359
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:02,533
Yes, sir.

360
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,333
Will they give us the pictures?

361
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,533
If my mom back in my hometown sees it, she'd be so…

362
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:11,800
Don't you have a girlfriend? All you talk about is your mother.

363
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,300
Don't show your bitterness of being deprived of your mother's love.

364
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,633
What did you say?

365
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,367
Hey, stop fighting, man.

366
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:22,400
My mother will be so happy to see my picture.

367
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:32,067
Song I, I'm here.

368
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,600
 You shouldn't be here, Lloyd. 

369
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,500
 I think it's my fault. 

370
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,933
 I reported it because I was worried about you. 

371
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:48,000
 But I never asked them to let me see you. I'm serious. 

372
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,000
 The ones from the 112 unit 

373
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,933
 can't be spies or terrorists now that things are peaceful. 

374
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:58,433
 After they got abandoned by the Republic, 

375
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:01,233
 they formed Violet. 

376
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,000
Hey, Song I. What's the matter?

377
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,433
Song I!

378
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:24,800
Doctor! She needs help.

379
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,433
It's cardiac arrest.

380
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,900
- We'll perform CPR. 
 - Okay.

381
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,800
One, two, three, four,

382
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,967
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

383
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:35,433
- Vital signs? 
 - 90 over 44.

384
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,300
- Blood pressure? 
 - It's dropping, Doctor.

385
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,467
Let's do it one more time. Get the resuscitator ready.

386
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,467
Yes, Doctor.

387
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:02,900
Four, five, six.

388
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,900
- It's getting better. 
 - Seven. Is it?

389
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,900
- She's okay now. 
 - I'm so relieved, Doctor.

390
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,967
Thank you for your hard work.

391
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,033
She's okay now.

392
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:19,333
Seriously, what happened to you?

393
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,850
What are you looking for?

394
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,167
I was conducting a surprise inspection of the barracks.

395
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,267
If you're possessing anything illegal, according to the penalty rules—

396
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:37,867
So did you find it?

397
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:40,000
The illegal item?

398
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,830
I guess not.

399
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,460


400
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,767
Do you have to work right now when you haven't seen me, your mom, in such a long time?

401
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,900
Isn't it good to be busy?

402
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,000
You were late because you were working too.

403
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm proud of you for doing it on your own without my help,

404
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,033
but seriously, who are you doing this for?

405
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:05,767
Someone I want to have.

406
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:08,367
I've never seen you like this before.

407
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,095
Once I get him, I'll show him to you first.

408
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:18,120
   

409
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:23,700
How come I'm the only one who didn't know?

410
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:28,067
All the members of the unit knew what they needed to do,

411
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:31,500
but I was the only one who was making a fool of myself!

412
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,433
What are you looking for?

413
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,167
Is it because you think that I got something from Song I?

414
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,733
That's just a jumper.

415
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:43,700
If you got something from her, hand it over to me now.

416
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,933
So just tell me exactly what that is.

417
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,067
You'll be in danger if you hold on to that.

418
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,367
No, actually,

419
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:55,333
I need to make sure you don't have it to ensure your safety.

420
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:58,833
You bluffer.

421
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,800
I really mean it.

422
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,133
Seriously, what is the truth?

423
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:08,167
What I know is that Song I saved my life,

424
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:12,100
but I couldn't protect her. That's all.

425
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,633
Who protected whom?

426
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:17,567
You can't even protect yourself.

427
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:22,933
So you were trained in the 112 Daenam Training Center?

428
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:29,700
Then shall we battle it out forgetting our ranks?

429
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,700
Your life depends on this.

430
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,200
Stop acting like such a fool!

431
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,600
Otherwise, I can't protect you.

432
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,500
Have you actually protected someone?

433
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,633
You get shot or stabbed all the time.

434
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,767
You can't even protect your own body.

435
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:48,533
You always pretend to be tough on the outside,

436
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,467
but you're a softy on the inside.

437
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:54,600
Don't be mistaken thinking that you know me so well.

438
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,067
I doubt you have any idea

439
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:00,967
what kind of a person I am.

440
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,367
♫  Believe that you will return  ♫

441
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:08,100
♫  Whatever it is, I believe in you  ♫

442
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,433
♫  I can't find you anymore  ♫

00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,833
♫  How are you doing? Goodbye  ♫

447
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:22,000
♫  Who will understand my feelings? Oh, my heart  ♫

448
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,933
♫  Only you can know. Know my heart  ♫

449
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:28,433
♫  I can't breathe no more  ♫
