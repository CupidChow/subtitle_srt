1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,567
Go back now.

2
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:06,333
Fine, I'm going.

3
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:11,233
But I've got to do something before I go.

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:29,590
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Our Hearts as One ❤️ Team@Viki.com  

5
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:33,033
What were you thinking?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,533
It's time for roll call.

7
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:38,567
I was thinking the same.

8
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:41,400
It would be better if just the two of us go for the next mission.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,967
Didn't you say it was just for today?

10
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:45,833
Have a good night. Unification.

11
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,667
Sleep well.

12
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:23,733
Yeah… This is my reality.

13
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,244
Snap out of it, Baek Yeong Ok.

14
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:32,128
All me, baby!  It's all me, baby.

15
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,302
It's all right.

16
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,518
It's all me, baby.

17
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,633
That's so dope, right?

18
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:41,033
Matching shirts, do you agree?

19
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,556
Bro.

20
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:46,084
Let's go. I'll take your love, baby.

21
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:47,600
What are you talking about?

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,067
Wasn't the swimming pool the best?

23
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,600
It was my idea.

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,867
That's because Comrade Gang insisted.

25
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:55,667
We didn't want that.

26
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,767
I'll come up with a better plan next time.

27
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,767
Hold on a second.

28
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:04,633
Are you suggesting we go on another date?

29
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:08,333
Who else but us would help you two?

30
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,867
Next time, let's do it outside.

31
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:12,033
No! Yo, let's go to Jeju Island.

32
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:15,033
- I've never been to— 
 - No, how about a staycation for the six of us?

33
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:16,733
No, I've never been to Jeju Island.

34
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,267
We can't go to Jeju Island.

35
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,800
- Why not? 
 - It's defection.

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,100
- Defection? 
 - Everyone got carried away.

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,633
What the hell is "defection"?

38
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:27,267
- Don't say "defection". Let's go. 
 - We can't go.

39
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,900
It's today.

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,400
It's not like we are wiretapped.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,933
Why are you saying it like that?

42
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,967
You should show me properly this time, shouldn't you?

43
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,733
How do I do it properly?

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,533
Listen.

45
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,100
I'll prepare everything needed for the mission.

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,800
You can think about what to do or where to go.

47
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,467
Why should I?

48
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, seriously.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,667
The key to a successful mission is to learn, practice, and act.

50
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,833
You need to learn if you don't know.

51
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,633
Where can I even learn that?

52
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,600
In the old days, we learned about love from books.

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,833
Nowadays, we search on YouTube.

54
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,533
Everything from a first kiss and the thrill to dating spots.

55
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:24,467
Fine.

56
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:27,833
I'll take care of it, so leave yourself out of this.

57
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,833
Can I count on your skills for the operation, Comrade Platoon Leader Baek?

58
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,650
Can I?

59
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,500
Yes?

60
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,400
So, where's the date going to be?

61
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,167
Not today.

62
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,900
I made time especially for this.

63
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,967
We're not that free, either.

64
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:49,000
Exactly, you made time.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,600
So spend it with someone important. Why make such a fuss with me?

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,900
Go.

67
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,033
Our team is very important to me.

68
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:00,133
Just go while I'm saying nicely. Okay?

69
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm all set.

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,300
I mean, why are you all preparing?

71
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,433
We've all been ready for a long time.

72
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,500
Okay, then the four of you who are perfectly prepared,

73
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,633
please have fun.

74
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,167
Bye.

75
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,833
Not going? Go.

76
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,100
Go!

77
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,933
Geez.

78
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:48,133
 In the old days, we learned about love from books. 

79
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:51,133
 Nowadays, we search on YouTube. 

80
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,267
 Do you want to come over for ramyeon? 

81
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:07,367
 When a man hears this, 

82
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:08,867
 - he can't resist. 
 - What is it? 

83
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:11,700
 "I love you?" "Do you want to come over for ramyeon?" 

84
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:15,633
 Make some magical ramyeon. 

85
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:18,233
 In a sexy, 

86
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,700
 elegant voice, say "Do you want to come over for ramyeon?" 

87
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,133
 Let's have some ramyeon. I'm hungry. 

88
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,400
 It means you love me, darling? 

89
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,967
 I'm the only one. Right? 

90
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:33,267
"Do you want to have ramyeon?"

91
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,933
"Do you want to have ramyeon?"

92
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,800
"Do you want to have ramyeon?"

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,033
What are you doing?

94
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,867
Just get on, hurry.

95
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,800
You, leave right now.

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,567
- Oh, my. 
 - Ugh, what are you doing?

97
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,967
What's wrong?

98
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,267
Hurry up.

99
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,400
Look over there.

100
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,033
Those clingy people, seriously.

101
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,200
They claim to be the best special forces from North and South Korea.

102
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,100
Yet, look at how they're wasting their military tracking skills like that.

103
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,767
Well, never giving up

104
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:54,567
is part of our military spirit.

105
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:58,767
Sure, that must be it.

106
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,033
Wait.

107
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,267
Your lips.

108
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,367
And that dress.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,967
I've done some searching like you said.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,200
Then, where shall we go?

111
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,400
Haeundae Beach?

112
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,533
Yeosu's night sea?

113
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,800
Home is where you wanted to go?

114
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,433
Barracks or home, home or barracks.

115
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,933
Who would choose a commuting route as their dating spot?

116
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:51,467
You said you did all the studying and research.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,900
I did.

118
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,733
Then why here?

119
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,800
Do you want to have ramyeon?

120
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:11,767
 (What? Ramyeon?) 

121
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,000
Now? Here?

122
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,600
Of course, it's just ramyeon.

123
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,733
She literally meant ramyeon.

124
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:34,267
What was I expecting?

125
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,033
Where is picked radish?

126
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:43,233
This is how we make it.

127
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,967
Seeing the gimbap

128
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,600
makes me want to go on a picnic, doesn't it?

129
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,767
A picnic? No way.

130
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,133
Me too!

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,900
Mi Rae, do you want to have a picnic?

132
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,433
Does Mi Rae want to have a picnic?

133
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:03,600
Really?

134
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,033
Don't run like that. Be careful!

135
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,333
Oh, so heavy.

136
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,267
At least wear sunglasses.

137
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,900
What if someone recognizes you?

138
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,700
We're here to be seen.

139
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,767
Right?

140
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,767
Let's go.

141
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,024
Where are you going?

142
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,567
Lloyd.

143
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,267
Where did Comrade No go?

144
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:37,100
He went on a date with Platoon Leader Baek.

145
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,433
I'm so thirsty.

146
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,867
So he went with just Comrade Platoon Leader Baek?

147
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:46,100
It must be, since it's a date.

148
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,000
After several years of experience in military operations,

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,433
I was outmaneuvered by a private.

150
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:54,100
Lloyd is so sneaky and petty.

151
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,267
What a schemer.

152
00:09:56,267 --> 00:10:00,333
Why do they keep moving around in groups like it's a civil defense drill?

153
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,100
Stop touching it. You'll scratch it.

154
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,567
Comrade No.

155
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,467
Giddy up, horsie!

156
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:24,500
Hop on!

157
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:41,500
♫  I'm clumsy and awkward  ♫

158
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,167
♫  But I try to act like it's nothing  ♫

159
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,900
♫  As a day goes by  ♫

160
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,800
♫  And another month goes by  ♫

161
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,133
♫  Will I be  ♫

162
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,367
♫  A little closer to you then  ♫

163
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,933
♫  You and me  ♫

164
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:02,300
♫  So special  ♫

165
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,200
♫  Love my hurt  ♫

166
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,833
♫  Only for you  ♫

167
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,267
♫  I wish for you  ♫

168
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,900
♫  I was hoping for romance  ♫

169
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,700
♫  A heart-pounding day  ♫

170
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,200
♫  My trembling heart  ♫

171
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,067
♫  I'll give it to the season  ♫

172
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:21,633
♫  Rising up to the sky  ♫

173
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,900
♫  I promise you  ♫

174
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,433
♫  For you  ♫

175
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:29,533
♫  I'll give you the stars  ♫

176
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,833
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm so sorry.

178
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,367
That's something that doesn't make sense in the South Korean language.

179
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,667
It's not like you committed a crime.

180
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,633
Why say sorry?

181
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,200
Here.

182
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,900
Would you be full just eating that?

183
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,967
Follow me.

184
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:15,667
Wait, your stuff…

185
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:23,010
   

186
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
I'll get going now.

187
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,933
I have something to do.

188
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,700
Are you from North Korea?

189
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,600
Sorry?

190
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,433
That Snow White Rice Cake.

191
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:37,333
My kid used to love it.

192
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,300
I won't charge you,

193
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,500
so come in and have a meal.

194
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,800
Why are you just standing there?

195
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,167
Where's your hometown?

196
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,133
I don't know, either.

197
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,533
I defected when I was very young.

198
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,800
Yes.

199
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,633
Yes, got it.

200
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,133
I'll come back for the meal next time.

201
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,200
Wait…

202
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,500
Gwang Tae.

203
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,600
Good job.

204
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,900
If you make it, you get a doll?

205
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,367
How about whoever wins gives the doll to Mi Rae,

206
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,767
and the loser grants the winner's wish?

207
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,300
Are you saying you'll beat me?

208
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:27,400
That's not what I meant.

209
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,933
It's just for fun.

210
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,333
So, are you in or not?

211
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,600
That was so close.

212
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,733
Here I go.

213
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,033
See, Mi Rae. I'll definitely score this one.

214
00:14:57,733 --> 00:15:01,867
Nice shot, I won!

215
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,100
I still have the last arrow.

216
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,367
Even if you make it, it'll just be a tie.

217
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:14,600
You can win if you shoot from further back.

218
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,633
It won't work, though.

219
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,767
Wait! Are you going that far?

220
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,033
I won.

221
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,360
 ­  

222
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:06,100
- Ow, ow. 
 - What happened?

223
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,267
Seems like Pyeong Hwa and Tong Il want to come out soon.

224
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:11,467
They are kicking a lot.

225
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:15,267
Little ones.

226
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,333
We will meet very soon.

227
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,100
Just hang in there a little longer.

228
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,367
Ugh, so annoying.

229
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,767
This gimbap doesn't even have pickled radish,

230
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:36,133
but it strangely still tastes good.

231
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,500
Do you like it?

232
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,233
I'm so annoyed that I lost the game,

233
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,833
but it's even more annoying because it's delicious.

234
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,000
Granting a wish isn't an easy task.

235
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So, what's your wish?

236
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,867
My wish is…

237
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,000
Tell me the most expensive thing.

238
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,200
Like a diamond ring worth a fortune.

239
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,433
Sing a song for me.

240
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,600
A song? Now?

241
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,167
A song?

242
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,200
That's such an easy wish.

243
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,100
It's not easy for someone.

244
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Is it?

245
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,333
A song…

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,600
Hi, everyone.

247
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,933
I'm Lloyd from FITA, currently serving in the military.

248
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,167
I came to sing…

249
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,467
 Isn't that the real Lloyd? 

250
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:39,567
...while passing by.

251
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,933
Let me sing a song.

252
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:53,667

253

267
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,233
I didn't know

268
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,867
Lloyd was that sneaky.

269
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,600
It's so disappointing. We are a team.

270
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,633
Anyway, does Lloyd have any relationship issues?

271
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,533
Of course there are issues.

272
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,867
With Comrade No rushing in like a moth to a flame,

273
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:30,767
I wonder if Comrade Platoon Leader Baek can handle it alone.

274
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:33,100
She definitely can't handle it.

275
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,167
Can a South Korean idol and a North Korean officer make it to the end?

276
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,467
Realistically?

277
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,000
It would be hard.

278
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
But I believe they can overcome that reality.

279
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,533
In Pyeonghwa City, youths from the North and South got to know each other,

280
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:56,300
and a miracle happened where they fell in love.

281
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm looking forward to the future they will change.

282
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,533
Here, cheers.

283
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,567
Cheers.

284
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,200
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

285
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,467
What is it? You're making me nervous.

286
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,100
You're going to tell me that it's only for today,

287
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,500
so I should forget about you. Right?

288
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,733
The whole day felt like a dream.

289
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,300
I'm so happy...

290
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,967
that I don't want to let go of this hand.

291
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,533
If you don't want to, then don't.

292
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,600
Look.

293
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,633
Even though it's so beautiful,

294
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:05,967
no one believes it will last forever.

295
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,333
After flying around like that,

296
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,900
it'll eventually pop.

297
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,333
Then we just blow some more.

298
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:18,800
If it pops, we can make a new one.

299
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,900
I'll take care of that.

300
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,400
You just stay by my side, Platoon Leader Baek.

301
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,633
This is the black box footage from my car.

302
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,733
So, what do you want?

303
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,867
I already told you.

304
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:53,467
Send her back to where she was.

305
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:56,167
That's too easy.

306
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:01,467
This is worthy of execution.

307
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,400
Is this the answer you wanted?

308
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,267
I'm satisfied.

309
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:07,200
Okay, then.

310
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,033
When your mother wanted something, she wouldn't let anything stop her.

311
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:15,433
Please send my regards to her.

312
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:17,433
Will do.

313
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,300
By the way, about Natasha you mentioned last time.

314
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,500
Yes?

315
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,167
Could a miracle happen to me, too?

316
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,800
The photo on The Wall Of Peace.

317
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I posted it, and this came up.

318
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,967
She is alive.

319
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,767
Natasha.

320
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,500
We can finally meet.

321
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,167
Platoon Leader Baek.

322
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,967
The reason Song I came to see me at the hospital that day.

323
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,400
And the thing you were looking for.

324
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,967
I think I know what it is.

325
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,950
What is it?

326
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,633
Isn't it the SD card in Song I's jacket?

327
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,800
So, you're saying you have it?

328
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,400
What's in it that everyone is searching for it?

329
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,733
It's a list of Violet agents.

330
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:38,267
But why are you telling me this?

331
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,233
Because that's causing you to worry about me.

332
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,267
Let's take a photo together.

333
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:54,300
A photo?

334
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,100
You two take some.

335
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,000
We are fine. Let's leave.

336
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,700
I'll be sitting right in front. Don't worry.

337
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,210
  ­ 

338
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:56,233
I think the fourth photo came out the best.

339
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,833
- Mi Rae. 
 - Mi Rae.

340
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:08,433
- Where is she? 
 - Mi Rae.

341
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,200
Mi Rae.

342
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,267
Mi Rae.

343
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,867
Mi Rae.

344
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:24,867
Mi Rae.

345
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:34,200
Mi Rae.

346
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,500
I couldn't find her anywhere.

347
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:06,600
Comrade Seong Jae Hoon…

348
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,500
Don't worry.

349
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,433
What he wants is the list.

350
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:13,700
We can't do that.

351
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,000
Then what about Mi Rae?

352
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,567
I'll take care of this.

353
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:20,067
Trust me this time.

354
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:23,100
I'll bring her back at all costs.

355
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,833
There's…

356
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,733
something I couldn't say.

357
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,033
Tell me when I come back.

358
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:48,100
I knew you had it.

359
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,533
Just to confirm that

360
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:54,233
you even kidnapped a sick kid?

361
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,900
I've been wondering

362
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,900
why Han Song I would risk her life to come and find you.

363
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,933
It wasn't simply out of concern, was it?

364
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:04,867
Where is Mi Rae?

365
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:08,800
That thing has nothing to do with you. Give it back to me.

366
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,533
Answer me. Where is she?

367
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,233
Sleeping.

368
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:28,567
You.

369
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:33,333
Stay away from Mi Rae and Platoon Leader Baek.

370
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:38,267
If you hadn't butted in, it wouldn't have come to this.

371
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:39,200
Don't talk nonsense.

372
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,033
You're just a jerk who'll do anything to achieve your goals.

373
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:46,767
On that list are the names of our comrades…

374
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:50,933
No, their lives.

375
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:56,600
Then Song I…

376
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,500
Did you do that to Song I, too?

377
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,800
She brought it upon herself.

378
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,967
What are you doing, Seung Tae?

379
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,133
It seems he doesn't trust you.

380
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:14,233
He asked me to bring it to him myself.

381
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:26,367
Mi Rae.

382
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:28,680
Are you okay, Mi Rae?

383
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,460
­Mi Rae.

384
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,900
How could you hand it over?

385
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,567
Who said I did?

386
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,567
The real one is already with you.

387
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:17,667
Do you know the safest way to boost your chances of winning?

388
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:21,767
It's by teaming up with reliable and skilled players.

389
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,567
When the SD card came into my hands,

390
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:36,800
I chose you as my teammate.

391
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,200
Here it is, ta-da!

392
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,067
This isn't a game.

393
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:49,333
- This is a matter of… 
 - A matter of life and death reality.

394
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,033
That's why I should have chosen my teammates more carefully.

395
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:55,900
Just wait. We will definitely win.

396
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,267
I've never lost in this area.

397
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:02,600
Later, I should play a game with Mi Rae.

398
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:06,467
So, it's been there all along?

399
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:07,733
Yes.

400
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:09,967
It's been right next to you all this time,

401
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:13,200
but you missed it, just like you missed me.

402
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,733
Tell me now.

403
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,533
You said you had something to say.

404
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,000
If it's a prank again…

405
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yes.

406
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,633
I was the one who lied, not Comrade Lloyd.

407
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,733
Bringing someone home in the middle of the night,

408
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:39,567
it seems you've had quite a romantic time.

409
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,333
It's not like that.

410
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,533
Baek Yeong Ok,

411
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,800
you are being repatriated for treason against the Republic.

412
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,167
Comrade Vice Commissioner.

413
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,533
What do you mean by "treason"?

414
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:51,400
We've got evidence that you have been meeting Seong Jae Hoon.

415
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,500
It's also related to the recent shooting incident.

416
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,300
Vice Commissioner Park,

417
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,900
I told you she was with me that night.

418
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,100
If you don't want yourself to be charged with treason too, stay out of it.

419
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,667
Why am I accused of treason?

420
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,933
Comrade Vice Commissioner,

421
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:12,200
Comrade No has nothing to do with this.

422
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,900
Then quietly follow me.

423
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,160
Platoon Leader Baek.

424
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:46,467
Sister?

425
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,067
Vice Commissioner.

426
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:49,367
Hands off me.

427
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,133
Vice Commissioner Park, what kind of law is this?

428
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:53,633
- Vice Commissioner. 
 - Sister.

429
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,100
- Mi Rae! 
 - Mi Rae!

430
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,267
Go away. She's dying.

431
00:31:58,267 --> 00:32:00,133
Mi Rae.

432
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:01,167
- Mi Rae, are you okay? 
 - Mi Rae.

433
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:03,067
- Wake up! 
 - Mi Rae.

434
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,233
- Platoon Leader Baek. 
 - Mi Rae.

435
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,267
I'll protect Mi Rae.

436
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,900
- Don't worry about her. 
 - Mi Rae!

437
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,067
- Mi Rae, are you all right? 
 - What happened?

438
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,667
Take her to the hospital, hurry!

439
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,500
Lloyd.

440
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:20,251
    
    

441
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:29,704
   

442
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:37,352
   

443
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:50,372
I guess that guy is a fan of him.

444
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:53,228
He has unique taste.

445
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:56,335
 ♪ Come a little closer ♪ 

446
00:33:56,335 --> 00:34:00,524
 ♪ To the end of the sky with you ♪ 

447
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:09,433
My little sister is in the hospital.

448
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:12,333
Comrade, please let me make a call to her.

449
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:15,500
Do you have any idea how serious this is?

450
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:21,167
Treason is...

451
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,967
punishable by death.

452
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,900
Let go of me.

453
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,233
I said, let go!

454
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,267
Platoon Leader Baek.

455
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,000
Stop.

456
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:52,133
They should at least say goodbye to each other.

457
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,933
Platoon Leader Baek.

458
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,800
Comrade No.

459
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,967
Please take care of Mi Rae.

460
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,600
If something happens to her, tell Ms. Geum Sook…

461
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,833
Don't worry.

462
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,467
She's fine in the hospital.

463
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:12,167
I'm also looking for a doctor.

464
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,633
Thank you.

465
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,967
I'll bring you back to Pyeonghwa City no matter what.

466
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,667
We will definitely meet again.

467
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,267
Enough.

468
00:35:25,267 --> 00:35:26,767
Please don't worry.

469
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:28,767
Platoon Leader!

470
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:31,810
Let go.

471
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,730
♫  But there is no answer  ♫

472
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,060
♫  I can't control my heart  ♫

473
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:42,820
   

474

♫  Can't you hear my heart  ♫

475
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:56,150
♫  On that dark night  ♫

476
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:03,010
♫  You were like the wind  ♫

477
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:09,990
♫  Leaving nothing behind ♫

478
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
I will come back.

479
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,500
Definitely.

481
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:31,000
Baek Yeong Ok was a double agent for Violet?

482
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,233
Yes.

483
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,067
Now that we've caught the informant,

484
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,600
we'll arrest all the remaining remnants.

485
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,733
But why are you sending her straight to North Koreay

486
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:40,000
But why are you sending her straight to North Korea

487
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,767
instead of investigating her here in Pyeonghwa City?

488
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,967
Look at this.

489
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:45,400
It's very suspicious, Ma'am.

490
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,500
Baek Yeong Ok is a Republic 112 member, after all.

491
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,400
How can I recklessly investigate her?

492
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,133
That's right.

493
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:54,967
I understand the North's stance too.

494
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,433
Now, we need to capture Violet as quickly as possible

495
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:59,700
Now, we need to capture Violet as quickly as possible

496
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,233
so as not to cause an obstacle to the upcoming peace agreement ceremony.

497
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:05,633
Mayor Won!

498
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:08,033
Get off me.

499
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:10,967
How dare a private barge in here?

500
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,467
You know Han Song I, right?

501
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,967
Han Song I?

502
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,667
I have the Violet list that she left me.

503
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,533
If you provide the original file,

504
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,800
we will investigate its connections.

505
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,400
No, let's reveal it here.

506
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,433
In front of everyone.

507
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:29,360
Here?

508
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:32,267
This is the Violet list leaked from the inside.

509
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:34,833
If Baek Yeong Ok's name isn't on it,

510
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,567
it means she was falsely accused.

511
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:38,233
Falsely accused?

512
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:40,133
Where does this hack get off spouting crap?

513
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,967
All right.

514
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,500
- Mayor! 
 - Mayor!

515
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:09,200
♫  Believe that you will return  ♫

516
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,933
♫  Whatever it is, I believe in you  ♫

517
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:12,400
♫  I can't find you anymore  ♫

518
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,700
♫  I believed in our hearts in those days  ♫

519
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,833
♫  Even though it may be foolish to turn around  ♫

520
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,467
♫  Back to that time on my way  ♫

521
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,700
♫  How are you doing? Goodbye  ♫

522
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,900
♫  Who will understand my feelings? Oh, my heart  ♫

523
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,500
♫  Only you can know. Know my heart  ♫

524
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,367
♫  I can't breathe no more  ♫

525
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:32,933
♫  A little more, a little more  ♫

526
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:34,867
♫  I'm getting closer to you  ♫

527
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:37,800
♫  Don't look back and don't hesitate  ♫

528
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,500
♫  This day won't come again  ♫

529
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,733
♫  Tonight  ♫

530
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,500
♫  Don't turn away  ♫
