2
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:48,467
 Number 127. 

3
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:51,300
 Do you still think you're Baek Yeong Ok, the daughter of Director Baek Ri Soo? 

4
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,833
 Living the high life in Pyongyang, leeching on people's blood, 

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,967
 and filling your stomach, 

6
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,667
 is that why you can't run any faster? 

7
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,600
 Get out of my way! 

8
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,500
 I said, "get out of my way!" 

9
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,500
 Let me have some. 

10
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,033
 Let me have some. 

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,367
 Cut that out. 

12
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,633
 This is hell, got that? 

13
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,900
 You have to step on and kill whoever it may be 

14
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,067
 - in order to survive. Got that? 
 - Take it now. 

15
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,167
 Come on. Take it now. 

16
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,167
Did you really see Baek Yeong Ok?

17
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:18,467
Yes, sir. I'm certain that it was Comrade Baek Yeong Ok.

18
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:21,420
You're saying, you got rid of her?

19
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,467
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,100
Seung Tae.

21
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:35,367
You can't just assume that you got rid of her. It must be verifiable.

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,167
And you know that she's no match for you guys.

23
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:45,433
If you went out to catch a rabbit, stick to the plan.

24
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:49,400
Why can't you realize that you could be killed if you go after a tiger instead?

25
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,867
Stick with the rabbit. Got that?

26
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,633
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:00,800
Don't sacrifice your life for a drill that's good for nothing.

28
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,767
We're not soldiers.

29
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,400
Where am I?

30
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm alive.

31
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,700
Be quiet.

32
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,233
We're not safe yet.

33
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,433
By any chance, on your way over,

34
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,933
did you see a girl?

35
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:51,167
I sent her away safely in a car that was driving by.

36
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:52,900
That's why I was delayed.

37
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,333
You're amazing, indeed.

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,110
You're quite something yourself too, Comrade.

39
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,167
Pardon?

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,967
Putting one's own life on the line for someone else

41
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:10,367
isn't an easy thing to do.

42
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,267
Is that what she said?

43
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:15,300
That I put my life on the line?

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,067
I wasn't thinking that at all at that moment.

45
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:21,400
If I really had to risk my life,

46
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,700
I don't think I could've done it.

47
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,633
I agree.

48
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:34,300
How is it possible that you can't contact Platoon Leader Baek by radio?

49
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,267
She'd guard the walkie-talkie over her own arm.

50
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:38,433
She was trained at Wonsan 112.

51
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:41,700
Comrade Lieutenant Baek was trained at Wonsan 112?

52
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,933
If you don't want to be discharged dishonorably, find her at once.

53
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,967
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,120
   

55
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,088
   

56
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:06,167
United force? Unification? You were all talk.

57
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,567
I knew you were scheming something behind my back,

58
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:11,267
but I didn't think you'd do that in a dire situation like this.

59
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,633
Please calm down.

60
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,267
I was going to share it after I confirm it.

61
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:18,533
Share it? The Coordination Committee changed everything already.

62
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,667
That's manipulation, not sharing.

63
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,867
A Violet member was among us.

64
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,800
She took Han Song I.

65
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,067
We, the Security Agency, became a laughingstock.

66
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,233
So you intend to keep the incident a secret by deleting the CCTV footage?

67
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,267
Can you be sure that there's only one Violet among us?

68
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,667
It was a security issue

69
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:43,233
and I didn't intend at all to handle it on my own.

70
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,467
Here. Look.

71
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:57,100
You know something. Don't you?

72
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,400
Don't blame it on North Korea whenever there's an issue!

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,000
Fine, just say you don't. Why are you getting mad?

74
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,200
You spat on me.

75
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:12,844
It's freezing.

76
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:18,967
It's freezing. How long do we have to stay here like this?

77
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,400
Don't you have a walkie-talkie or a cell phone?

78
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,000
We'll wait at least an hour before going back.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,900
I saw you wearing a walkie-talkie on your back earlier…

80
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,233
Are you hurt?

81
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:32,000
- I'm fine. 
 - But it looks like you're bleeding.

82
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,900
Are you okay?

83
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,890
Wake up.

84
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,100
Gosh. Wait.

85
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,533
I was on a variety show getting the First Aid Certification.

86
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,333
Please don't get me wrong. I'm trying to treat your wound.

87
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:57,900
If you press down hard like this,

88
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,567
I heard that you can stop the bleeding.

89
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,867
Lean on me like this.

90
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,233
Satisfied?

91
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:11,100
You punks are the best of the best in both North and South Korea combined.

92
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,767
But you were punished like simple soldiers.

93
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:13,900
- No, Sir! 
 - No, Sir!

94
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,800
You basically lost your heads and limbs today.

95
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,520
Got that?

96
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,867
Get up.

97
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,000
Do whatever it takes

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,733
to find her at once. Got that?

99
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,560
 Yes, sir! 

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,820
Let's go.

101
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:36,367
- Attention. Unification! 
  - Unification! 

102
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,000
At rest.

103
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,433
Exactly at the top of the hour.

104
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:43,833
Starting now until midnight—

105
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,333
Midnight, my foot.

106
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,200
Twenty-four hours.

107
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,700
No, even if we spend many days and nights,

108
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,333
if we can't find Comrade Lieutenant Baek, we'll all be sent to a coal mine!

109
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,500
You don't use your brain.

110
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
That's why you fail even easy tasks.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,433
What did you say?

112
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,167
I didn't say anything wrong.

113
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,867
This is all because of that foolish South Korean comrade.

114
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,300
Don't you see?

115
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,200
No, no. Stop, stop.

116
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,867
We shouldn't blame each other. Come on.

117
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,800
We're like this because our teamwork is broken.

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,400
Hey, they don't know what "teamwork" means.

119
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,833
They only know to "charge forward."

120
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:21,700
You stinky breath. When I charge forward, don't you bog me down.

121
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,433
Speak for yourself.

122
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:24,767
All right, let's go.

123
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's go. Move, move.

124
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:41,133
Byoung Man said this is how you start a fire.

125
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,300
How come it's not working?

126
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,033
It seemed to work well in the jungle.

127
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,767
 The moment you faint, you die. 

128
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:17,900
 Wake up! 

129
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,633
 Your father was a high-ranking officer of the Republic 

130
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,300
 and your mother was a professor at Kim Il Sung University. 

131
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,000
 Thanks to your proud parents who were both powerful, 

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,800
 I'm sure you thought your life would only be rosy. 

133
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:44,167
 Why are you doing this? 

134
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,470
 Honey! 

135
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,570
 Why are you doing this? 

136
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,530
 Why are you doing this? We haven't done— 

137
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,733
 - Honey! 
 - Honey. 

138
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,433
Father.

139
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,833
Please don't go.

140
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,233
 Yeong Ok! 

141
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,700
 But you erased the shame of being the opposition 

142
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,900
 and endured the hellish 112 training center for South Korea. 

143
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,267
 Mother. 

144
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,920
Mother.

145
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,667
Father.

146
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:42,667
Please don't go.

147
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:45,900
 Become the best warrior of the Republic! 

148
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,500
 That will be the only way you'll be able to wash away 

149
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,433
 your parents' sorrow and to live together as a family. 

150
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,833
I should go call the emergency hotline.

151
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,733
She might die.

152
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,300
Don't… go.

153
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Hey, look.

154
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,633
I have to go ask for help. Otherwise, you might die.

155
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:33,333
Please… Please don't go.

156
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,800
What should I do? Seriously.

157
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,867
South Korean Comrade, take a break.

158
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll look through the southeast side again.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,867
Why would I take a break?

160
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:09,700
You might get lost too.

161
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,367
We should ask for help.

162
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,333
Let's ask the superiors… for help.

163
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,433
- No, we're going to find her. 
 - We have to find her ourselves.

164
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,733
Wait!

165
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,467
Over there.

166
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:30,500
Call a medic. Call a medic!

167
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,400
- Medic. Call a medic! 
 - What? What happened?

168
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:01,233
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

169
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:05,333
- Can you recognize me? 
 - Lloyd, Mr. Ban was so worried about you.

170
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:12,233
This isn't a dream, right?

171
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:16,267
I would say it's a the dreamlike reality?

172
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,467
Why did you get so much?

173
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,310
Eat up.

174
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,100
Are you sure this is enough?

175
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,467
No, I'll go back in now and cook something…

176
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:35,467
No, it's okay, Honey.

177
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:38,367
It's just that I remembered the time when we were in Kaesong.

178
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,333
You were enjoying the food so much.

179
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,067
Thinking about those days is making me have cravings.

180
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,333
Yes, right.

181
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,700
Whenever I bought something,

182
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,333
you told me that it was "buy one, get one free."

183
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,167
I thought it was strange.

184
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,267
I gave the "buy one, get one free" deal only to you,

185
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:55,333
but you always gave me the extra one you got.

186
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:59,200
Is that why we're having "buy one, get one free" (twins), too?

187
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,867
Our dear Peace and Unification,

188
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:04,800
eat well and grow big.

189
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
Grow big.

190
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,467
Hello, you're here.

191
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:10,667
Not many days left, right?

192
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,167
No, just a month away.

193
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,067
May I have one of those?

194
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:17,900
Yes, sure.

195
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,020
   

196
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,633
Sir, what did the owner of Uno Pub do before?

197
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,600
I heard a rumor he's the third-generation scion of a conglomerate family.

198
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,433
Or is he a secret, illegitimate child of a conglomerate family?

199
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:48,567
Gosh, how would I know the owner's personal information?

200
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:52,133
Here you go.

201
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,767
By the way, how come you always only eat that?

202
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:59,233
Nowadays, even North Korea makes different types of snacks.

203
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,700
She always

204
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,700
smelled so sweet just like this snack.

205
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:09,600
If you saw her face, would you recognize her?

206
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,233
No matter how many years go by,

207
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:16,833
I wouldn't be able to forget her beautiful face.

208
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,633
Bye.

209
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:34,967
- Hey, eat now. 
 - Okay. It'll get soggy.

210
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,600
Why the Unified Korean Special Armed Force Unit of Pyeonghwa City out of nowhere?

211
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,000
No, it's the Unified Armed Force Unit.

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Be quiet. That's not the point here.

213
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,367
To keep Pyeonghwa City's peace,

214
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,500
they really need you. You have no choice.

215
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,300
Peace, my foot!

216
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,467
Hey! Do you even know what I went through there?

217
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,133
Have you been in the military?

218
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:57,000
Me? Of course, I haven't.

219
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
- Have you done the counterterrorism training? 
 - No.

220
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,533
Have you battled against lunatics

221
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:04,100
who try to shoot you and stab you from every angle?

222
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,270
No, I haven't.

223
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,667
While I was being bombarded with bullets,

224
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,000
I defeated the resistance army!

225
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,267
To save a fan of mine… a fan of FITA,

226
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,033
I escaped a gunman!

227
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:19,433
All night long, I carried a woman who was like a human weapon,

228
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,500
walked a few tens of kilometers through the DMZ,

229
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,600
and even saved a life. I'm that great.

230
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,800
You know that, right?

231
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:31,300
I had faith in you that you'd pull through again.

232
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,700
What did I manage to pull through last night?

233
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,467
I'm insane. Seriously.

234
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:37,433
Your fans are totally excited

235
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:42,533
to hear that you've been assigned to the Special Forces of Pyeonghwa City.

236
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,767
That news has been released officially already?

237
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:50,167
If this doesn't go well,

238
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,267
it'll jeopardize your image as well as that of other members.

239
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:55,067
And the FITA fans will be really disappointed too.

240
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,533
No, no.

241
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,733
What was it?

242
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:02,467
I saw a document that looked like an order to transfer me to the Defense PR Support Unit.

243
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:06,267
How could they change the plan without informing me?

244
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,467
Hey, what happened to that plan?

245
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,967
Well, I'm not the one who planned it.

246
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:14,500
Hey. Get out.

247
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,133
Get out.

248
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,767
Doctor, I think I hurt my shoulder.

249
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,500
It hurts so much. Please take a look.

250
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
One moment, please.

251
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,333
Let me attend to the wounded patient first.

252
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,067
You shouldn't be sitting up.

253
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,233
What on earth are you doing here?

254
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,500
You bluffer.

255
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,233
What? Hey, Jeong Man.

256
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,900
What did she say? Did she just curse at me?

257
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,667
She called you a bluffer.

258
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,733
My goodness.

259
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,467
Excuse me. If it weren't for me,

260
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:54,167
you would've died already from excessive bleeding. Do you even realize it?

261
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:58,500
Think carefully why I even got stabbed in the first place!

262
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,700
Ms. Baek Yeong Ok, you have to stayin the hospital to recover for a few more days.

263
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,233
No, I'm fine.

264
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:09,700
Please check on the head of that bluffer who is talking nonstop over there.

265
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,367
What did you just say?

266
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,633
Mr. Lloyd, your test results are all normal

267
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:18,067
and you're only showing signs of exhaustion and a minor abrasion,

268
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:20,467
so you can be discharged even today.

269
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,133
Gosh, doctor. I don't think that's the case.

270
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:26,033
I think I'm in a coma.

271
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,667
Gosh, MRI, please.

272
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:28,967
My goodness.

273
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,833
It's all covered by the insurance,

274
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,867
so please proceed with a CT scan too…

275
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:34,500
But…

276
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:47,867
What a relief that Lloyd wasn't seriously hurt.

277
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:48,967
Even though Pyeonghwa City is on the outskirts,

278
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:52,567
firing away here is totally unacceptable. Okay?

279
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,467
This isn't North Korea, you know?

280
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,700
If this happened in Pyongyang,

281
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,067
they would've been executed on the spot.

282
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:05,967
The actions of Violet, the anti-unification force, are troubling.

283
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,000
We can't let it slide this time.

284
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,267
We have to make an official complaint to the North.

285
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,433
What evidence do you have to be so sure that it was our doing?

286
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,567
Those Violet punks who are on the wanted list

287
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,067
are all from North Korea.

288
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,900
North Korean defectors are from North Korea, too.

289
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm curious about who's behind it. The one in the shadow.

290
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,500
Well, how would I know what these cunning and selfish South Koreans are really thinking?

291
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,100
Okay, okay.

292
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,133
People who oppose our unification can be anywhere.

293
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,400
Let's solve things one by one.

294
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,567
- Jeong Man. 
 - Yes?

295
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:49,933
What do you call that?

296
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:53,367
When the soldiers march carrying their gear to their death?

297
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:56,467
- Long distance load march? 
 - Yes, that one.

298
00:19:56,467 --> 00:20:00,800
I marched a long distance carrying you on my back instead of gear.

299
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,200
Instead of carrying me,

300
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,533
you should've run quickly to ask for help.

301
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,833
I was going to do that.

302
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,733
But you held onto my hand

303
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,733
and begged me not to go.

304
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:13,633
It's not like I was shot in the head. There's no way I would've done that.

305
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,233
Wow.

306
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:18,233
Listen to her. She's so shameless.

307
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,433
You don't remember?

308
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:23,000
Let me tell you what you did. You held my hand…

309
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:30,200
 Don't leave me by myself. 

310
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,067
 Father. Mother. 

311
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:38,667
 Please, don't leave me by myself. 

312
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,200
Cut the nonsense

313
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
and just say what you want to say, Comrade No!

314
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:35,567
I'm Vice Commissioner Lee Min Ho of the Unified Security Agency of Pyeonghwa City.

315
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,567
It's my pleasure meeting you.

316
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:40,567
Please don't say that. I almost died just now

317
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:44,300
thanks to you who allowed me to have such a rare and precious experience.

318
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,967
It's my pleasure. Nice to meet you.

319
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:51,467
The Unified Armed Force Unit doesn't operate in a traditional way.

320
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:55,867
The Unified Korean Armed Force Unit respects individual's privacy as much as possible.

321
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:59,400
On top of that, within Pyeonghwa City…

322
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,100
it's not difficult to go out or stay out.

323
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,600
You have a lot of freedom.

324
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,200
So what now?

325
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,967
You can't restore my life? Is that what you're saying?

326
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,833
I'm not saying that I can't.

327
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm saying that you'd be much happier here.

328
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,733
- Jeong Man. 
 - Yes, Lloyd.

329
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:20,833
Can you try calling Attorney Kim again?

330
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,233
Gosh, Lloyd.

331
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:23,900
Mr. Lloyd.

332
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,567
You've become the hero of Pyeonghwa City.

333
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,633
You put on the gauntlet, okay?

334
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:30,800
"I am Iron Man." Like that?

335
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,500
Hey, wait. Please wait.

336
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,533
You can't do this without prior notice.

337
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:35,967
We got a call.

338
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:37,567
What? From who?

339
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:38,867
- Hello. 
 - Wait, come on.

340
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:41,367
Take a picture. Take a picture.

341
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:42,967
Mr. Lloyd,

342
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:45,167
how do you feel about joining the Pyeonghwa City's Unified Armed Force Unit?

343
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:46,433
Do you feel okay?

344
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:49,567
We were informed that you made a great impact from day one.

345
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,433
As you can see, I'm completely fine.

346
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:55,367
The Unified Armed Force Unit is Special Forces, you know?

347
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:59,467
Perhaps because I've been working out regularly as a singer,

348
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,267
I really enjoy doing the training with the members of my troop.

349
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,067
I'll be earnest and diligent

350
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,233
as I complete my military duty. Thank you.

351
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:09,133
Please say a word to the FITA fans.

352
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,400
Dear FITA fans,

353
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm doing well, so please don't worry.

354
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,767
After my service, I'll return healthy and well to perform again.

355
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,567
I love you.

356
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,900
We'll take a picture.

357
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,067
Picture, picture.

358
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,367
Sir,

359
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,967
we'll take a solo shot of Lloyd.

360
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:32,500
Just one shot, please.

361
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,733
Please step aside.

362
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,933
- Please smile nice and big. 
 - Sure.

363
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:49,067
Comrade No, you're so shameless.

364
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,100
- Please publish a nice article. 
 - Will do.

365
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,367
    
 Thank you.

366
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,867
Good to see you.

367
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,633
Yes, hello?

368
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,900
Wait!

369
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,033
Gosh. My goodness.

370
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:35,967
People are reacting faster than I anticipated.

371
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:39,233
"The idol star who is most confident even among the Unified Korean Special Forces soldiers."

372
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:40,467
"Lloyd,

373
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,267
a role model for all idol stars."

374
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:47,167
"A global idol star has been reborn as a hero of Pyeonghwa City."

375
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,600
Hero, my foot.

376
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,400
I nearly died. Thanks to you.

377
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:57,833
It'll never happen again.

378
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,000
I can guarantee that.

379
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
I guarantee this too.

380
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,067
If you don't restore my life,

381
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:07,267
I'll reveal every little thing

382
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:12,533
about how the Security Agency put me in that unit without my consent!

383
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:15,967
Mr. Lloyd,

384
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:18,600
I wasn't going to go this far and say this,

385
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,233
but do you recall why you joined the military?

386
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:23,033
Possessing an illegal weapon.

387
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,933
That's a serious crime.

388
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,133
Wow.

389
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:29,767
Some people have no conscience.

390
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:32,767
Do you think you can threaten me with that?

391
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:36,233
I'm sure you know that it was a fake gun. I even have a witness.

392
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:39,867
A witness? Who?

393
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:41,167
Hey, witness.

394
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,900
Comrade Baek.

395
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,567
Comrade Baek, tell him…

396
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:48,067
What? Where did she go?

397
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:50,167
There's no one.

398
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,867
Exactly my point. Did she go for a walk?

399
00:25:56,533 --> 00:26:00,400
Welcome to the Unified Armed Force Unit.

400
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,633
Where did she go?

401
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,700
Gosh, you startled me.

402
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,270
Didn't you hear me calling you?

403
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:23,267
Oh, you're that person from before.

404
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:24,500
You remember me, don't you?

405
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,200
I was going to go and find you.

406
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,933
For… what?

407
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:32,700
Can I buy that Golden Water right away?

408
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,967
We told you then too, but it's really expensive.

409
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,567
Give me ten bottles, please.

410
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,333
Ten bottles? That many?

411
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:47,800
Yes. You're sure that it's good for the heart. Right?

412
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,933
I see. It's you who are not well.

413
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:57,533
No, I'm fine.

414
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,533
If you drink Golden Water regularly,

415
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:03,033
any illness will be healed completely.

416
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,067
This refined gold, you see,

417
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:10,467
kills bad cells while helping good cells grow well

418
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:12,767
and strengthens the blood vessels.

419
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:16,867
It works wonders for hearts.

420
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:18,867
"Wonders?"

421
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,500
You don't get it, do you?

422
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,167
It expands the heart nice and full.

423
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,967
Nice and full…

424
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,433
If you drink it every day instead of water,

425
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,500
it'll be really good.

426
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,300
No words can describe it entirely.

427
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,533
So how much will do?

428
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:44,533
For now, go to a nearby ATM

429
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:46,767
and pay us the deposit of one million won in cash.

430
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:48,200
If you give me your address,

431
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,333
I can deliver it to you every month for a monthly subscription.

432
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:53,467
Oh, right. You can pay in installments too.

433
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:59,733
Monthly subscription? Installments? What are they?

434
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,433
What else? They want to scam your money

435
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,467
every month on a regular basis.

436
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,933
Comrade No, stay out of it.

437
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:11,800
This is too terrible. I can't stay out of it, Comrade!

438
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:16,700
Young lad, you must be her boyfriend.

439
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,233
Don't be so rude. What do you mean, scam?

440
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:23,633
So, you mean, that's a cure-all?

441
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:25,167
You haven't heard of Golden Water?

442
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,700
It got the FDA approval this year…

443
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,633
Never.

444
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,300
Is it good for constipation too?

445
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,267
It really works wonders.

446
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:35,267
It'll make your butt sob.

447
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:38,633
Wow, would it really?

448
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,867
You won't be able to handle the consequences if you're lying.

449
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,600
What do you mean, I'm lying?

450
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,133
Perhaps, you don't really know since you're from North Korea.

451
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:49,900
This is South Korea.

452
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,500
The healthcare and medical technologies are gathered right here…

453
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,733
Then I'll try it.

454
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,600
What's wrong with you? This is quite pricy.

455
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,833
I'll pay you ten times the asking price if it works.

456
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:01,533
Besides, I'm South Korean.

457
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,800
Oh, no.

458
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,967
Llo… Lloyd?

459
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:14,100
Okay, let's say I drink it and it's effective,

460
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,200
and then my fans will really thank you.

461
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Because they know that I've been suffering from constipation.

462
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,700
But if I get sick or something goes wrong after I drink it,

463
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,933
then all your personal information will be doxed

464
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:27,200
and you'll be investigated by the police. You can just guess what will happen next.

465
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,200
- Thank you for this. 
 - No, Oppa!

466
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:33,533
Did you just call me "Oppa"?

467
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:37,267
I'm in your fan club.

468
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:43,100
 ♪ Keep your eyes on me every day, I want you ♪ 

469
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,167
Gosh, seriously. Hey, come here.

470
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,533
Wait.

471
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,833
- Wait! 
 - Sorry for loving you.

472
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,000
- Lloyd! 
 - What's wrong with you?

473
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,033
Hey. Please stop loving me.

474
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,667
No fan of mine is a fraud.

475
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:58,267
Stop being my fan immediately.

476
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,333
You jerk.

477
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,000
Let go of my hand now.

478
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,333
Don't you get what just happened here?

479
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:09,000
I saved you from almost being conned.

480
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,833
How can I trust someone who bluffs?

481
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,100
If you could treat illnesses by drinking random liquid like this,

482
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,100
no one would be sick in this world.

483
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:28,267
But what if they were telling the truth?

484
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:31,533
What if it really could…

485
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,267
Are you naive or just slow?

486
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:43,233
Are you usually all over the place?

487
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,900
Cut it out.

488
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,667
Or perhaps you're really ill?

489
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,567
