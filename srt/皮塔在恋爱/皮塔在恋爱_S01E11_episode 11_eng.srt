00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,800
What was that?

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,712
   

9
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,100
The happiest song?

10
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,133
The happiest song.

11
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:17,000
 Since Song I set up this trap… 

12
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,967
 Two more chances remain. 

13
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,033
 This is the final chance. 

14
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:35,967
But why does it keep…

15
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:41,633
The title is too long.

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,367
 The title. 

17
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:54,600
 If it isn't the title… 

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,200
 The day I returned after taking time off due to emotional pain. 

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,067
 The fans said, they felt the happiest then. 

20
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:02,233
 That date was… 

21
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,733
 That date was… 

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,867
Gosh, what's all that?

23
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:36,233
Arrest them all. Now!

24
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,233
Thank you, Song I.

25
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,600
 ­  

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,567
You're under arrest for violating the security law.

27
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,000
What?

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,467
No!

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,067
Mayor Won.

30
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,900
Mr. Lloyd.

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,867
The list of Violet members has been exposed. It's dangerous for you to go around like this.

32
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:19,233
There's only one thing I'm concerned about more than my personal safety.

33
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,233
Please reinstate Platoon Leader Baek Yeong Ok.

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,833
Didn't that list reveal that she has

35
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,500
nothing to do with Violet? I beg you.

36
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,167
I see.

37
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll try hard to make it happen.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,900
Thank you. Thank you so much.

39
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,333
Thank you so much.

40
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,533
You really don't give up, do you?

41
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,067
Even if she's been vindicated for now,

42
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:53,567
she can't be with you in the end, Lloyd.

43
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,100
That's not for you to decide.

44
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,600
You were the one who brought the dashcam to Vice Commissioner Park, weren't you?

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,767
Why did you do that?

46
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,133
If you get involved with that North Korean woman,

47
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,933
you could lose everything you've accomplished in the blink of an eye.

48
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,733
So what? Why are worried about that?

49
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,833
Because we're friends…

50
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,633
No.

51
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,067
Because I like you.

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,367
Hee Ji.

53
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,433
I'm sorry,

54
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:32,067
but you're not my type.

55
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:36,000
We can't even just be friends from now on.

56
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:44,133
When Platoon Leader Baek returns, make sure you apologize to her.

57
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,667
Mayor Won.

58
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:05,733
We successfully mopped up the Violet members

59
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,033
who have infiltrated Pyeonghwa City.

60
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,633
What about the leader of Violet?

61
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,300
Well, the thing is

62
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,633
that Shadow is extremely discreet…

63
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,867
He's a coward who hides in the shadows.

64
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,167
Please don't worry about him.

65
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:18,667
But I shouldn't worry?

66
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,400
What did you say?

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,133
But it wasn't all for nothing.

68
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,100
Now we know how Shadow and Oh Seung Tae

69
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,200
communicate with each other.

70
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,567
We need to set a trap.

71
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,100
We must capture Shadow.

72
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,300
If the outsiders find out about Violet,

73
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,667
Pyeonghwa City, a pilot city, will end as a failed project.

74
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,133
Hello, Ma'am.

75
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,800
Shouldn't you return to your unit?

76
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,567
I'll take good care of Mi Rae,

77
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,267
so you should go back now.

78
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:01,700
Okay. Thank you for your help.

79
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,300
Please don't worry.

80
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,800
The sisters have endured strongly until now.

81
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,100
A doctor

82
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,533
will come from Seoul to operate on Mi Rae soon.

83
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,767
Really?

84
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,033
That's great.

85
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,900
If Yeong Ok were here,

86
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,867
she would've been so happy.

87
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:33,333
Platoon Leader Baek will come back for sure.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,300
Of course, she will.

89
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,100
Until then,

90
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,733
I'll look after Mi Rae too.

91
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,133
Thank you.

92
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,400
I'll get going now.

93
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,567
 I'll bring you back to Pyeonghwa City no matter what. 

94
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:05,367
 We will definitely meet again. 

95
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,767
 Are you okay? 

96
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,500
Comrade, are you okay?

97
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,367
We meet again looking awful like this.

98
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,600
Seong Jae Hoon.

99
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,000
What happened to Comrade Seong?

100
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,633
I don't know.

101
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,867
But what's certain is that

102
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:52,833
because that South Korean singer exposed our names,

103
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,200
we were all arrested

104
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,867
or killed.

105
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,933
Do you mean, Comrade No?

106
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,200
That's right.

107
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,400
So now,

108
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,933
his days are numbered.

109
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,967
What do you mean?

110
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:14,467
The leadership has ordered us to kill him with all our might.

111
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,767
So it's only a matter of time, you know?

112
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,900
Baek Yeong Ok.

113
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,567
Come out.

114
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:48,967
 Comrade No! 

115
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:52,333
Comrade Platoon Leader Baek has been released.

116
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,733
For real?

117
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,767
Is she all right? When will she be back?

118
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,300
But...

119
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,333
she's been ordered to transfer to the revolutionary unit.

120
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,867
The revolutionary unit? Where is that?

121
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:10,267
The great revolutionary unit in the Middle East, you mean?

122
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,967
If the misunderstanding has been resolved, shouldn't she come back here?

123
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,400
Salute. Working…

124
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,300
What's wrong? Why do you look like that, Lloyd?

125
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,200
Are you not feeling well?

126
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,700
Please get me a pass to enter North Korea.

127
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,500
What?

128
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,900
If I can't get that, I might really die. You don't want me to die, do you?

129
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,167
I might desert.

130
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,567
Should I just do that?

131
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:46,733
Why do you want a pass to enter North Korea?

132
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,233
Is it because of Platton Leader Baek?

133
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,367
She's been ordered to transfer to the Middle East.

134
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,533
Jeong Man,

135
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,867
shouldn't there be another way?

136
00:10:55,867 --> 00:11:00,033
She's a soldier. She must go if she's been ordered to transfer.

137
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,833
You can't stop it from happening.

138
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,400
Then, I'll volunteer to be sent there too.

139
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,033
Why not? I'm qualified. I'm healthy.

140
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,767
Can I do my military service there?

141
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,167
Yeah.

142
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:17,933
Yes, of course you'd say that. You've been too tame for a while.

143
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,233
I miss her so much.

144
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,333
She was finally released.

145
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,367
But the Middle East?

146
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:41,533
I won't be able to meet or see her ever again.

147
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,800
This is nonsense.

148
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,133
I'm really sad too,

149
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,667
but it's okay, man.

150
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,333
I miss her so much.

151
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,833
I wish I could see her again just once.

152
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,833
You want to see me just once?

153
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,300
If we see each other again, I will never let her go.

154
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,900
I'll keep her by my side for the rest of my life.

155
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
For the rest of your life?

156
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,333
She is pretty even in my dreams.

157
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,167
Ugh, so annoying.

158
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,733
Even her smile is so beautiful.

159
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,067
Comrade Platoon Leader Baek!

160
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,733
How is it that you're here?

161
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,700
Didn't I promise you that I'd be back?

162
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,733
Hold on.

163
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,167
This isn't a dream. It's not, right?

164
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,933
Did I drink too much water?

165
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,600
I need to use the bathroom.

166
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,033
- I have a stomachache too. 
 - Me too.

167
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:52,233
Kiss. They're about to kiss.

168
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
You should've told me. What happened?

169
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,800
I was so worried.

170
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm so happy.

171
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:24,533
I have to go now.

172
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:27,800
Can't you stay a little longer?

173
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:33,833
I have to go back to Mi Rae.

174
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,167
Oh, right.

175
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:39,133
Mi Rae needs an operation soon.

176
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:41,267
I'm aware of it.

177
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:45,667
Thank you for taking care of her in my absence.

178
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,933
So,

179
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:52,233
I locked in Mi Rae's operation date.

180
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,933
Operation date?

181
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:56,433
I'm sorry for deciding it on my own.

182
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:58,767
I had no choice.

183
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
Does my sister Mi Rae

184
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,500
really get to have an operation?

185
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:12,133
Yes, I always tell you the truth.

186
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,900
Thank you.

187
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,333
If you want to thank me, make me gimbap.

188
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,767
I want to go on a picnic again.

189
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,033
Sure, of course.

190
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:33,400
Please don't worry anymore.

191
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:44,500
   

192
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,267
   
   

193
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:54,833
   

194
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,167
- Keep monitoring. 
 - Yes, sir.

195
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,567
Perhaps, he realized that it's a trap.

196
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:39,767
He hasn't appeared.

197
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,367
The members of both South and North

198
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,600
refuse to come to Pyeonghwa City until we capture Shadow.

199
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,600
The peace agreement ceremony must take place at all costs.

200
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,467
Pyeonghwa City's survival depends on it, Vice Commissioner Lee.

201
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:57,733
Yes, Ma'am. I'm doing my best too.

202
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:02,000
Someone is definitely leaking information.

203
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,900
Please thoroughly investigate everyone on our side, too.

204
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,110
Yes, Ma'am.

205
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,867
 ­  

206
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,933
Okay, Mi Rae.

207
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,367
You must've been worried that you wouldn't get to see your sister again.

208
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:19,133
I didn't worry.

209
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:23,033
My sister has never broken her promises.

210
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,900
­That's my girl.

211
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,300
Here.

212
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,533
It's so cute and adorable.

213
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,333
My mom and dad must've put a lot of effort into it.

214
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,800
Sure.

215
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,433
It's their first grandchildren. They must be dying to see them.

216
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,633
They've applied for a pass, so they'll be here soon.

217
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:54,033
But since our place is a mess,

218
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,333
they might get really worried when they see it.

219
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,300
Honey, we'll move into the Unification Apartment Complex in two years.

220
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
We even got a special housing allocation living in Pyeonghwa City.

221
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,967
Isn't it so great?

222
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,500
Yes, it is.

223
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,533
Let's live in Pyeonghwa City forever. kay?

224
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,300
Once you can come and go freely

225
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,733
and the blocked route between South and North opens up,

226
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,567
our apartment is going to be so awesome. Right?

227
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,200
Tell me about it.

228
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,633
It's close to both Kaesong and Seoul, too.

229
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:22,333
I'm going to decorate Pyeong Hwa and Tong Il's room nicely, too.

230
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,500
Let's do that.

231
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,433
They sent so many things.

232
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,500
We'll get to meet Sang Hoon's babies, Pyeong Hwa and Tong Il soon.

233
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:43,267
They're going to be so cute.

234
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,533
Yes, I'm sure.

235
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,067
I was talking about our kids.

236
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,733
Our kids that you and I will have.

237
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,233
Aren't we the perfect combination?

238
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:54,433
South Korea's top star and North Korea's top—

239
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,133
Quit that nonsense.

240
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,167
Mr. Lloyd.

241
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,133
Vice Commissioner Lee.

242
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,300
Please come with me.

243
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,600
What on earth is going on?

244
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,533
Please have a seat.

245
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,600
What are you doing?

246
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,100
Where is Platoon Leader Baek?

247
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,533
We need to do an investigation.

248
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,700
Don't you know that it's illegal to take someone into custody by force?

249
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,767
In the presence of an attorney—

250
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:28,567
As we were arresting the Violet members,

251
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,700
we seized evidence that they attempted to get revenge on you.

252
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,433
We'll protect you.

253
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,933
Mayor Won.

254
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,467
Doesn't that mean that Platoon Leader Baek is in danger, too?

255
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:40,133
We're conducting the investigation now.

256
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:43,200
But as of now, Ms. Baek Yeong Ok

257
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,767
is the prime suspect.

258
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,167
That's ridiculous.

259
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,267
As you must be well aware, Ms. Baek Yeong Ok is someone

260
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:53,433
who would do anything for her sister's surgery.

261
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,300
Vice Commissioner Lee,

262
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
it's not like that.

263
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,267
I'm the one who arranged everything for her sister's surgery.

264
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:03,200
Ms. Baek Yeong Ok's reason for returning from Pyongyang is dubious, too.

265
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,433
She's no longer a soldier, either, so we can't help but suspect her.

266
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,930
­So...

267
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,000
She's not a soldier? What do you mean?

268
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,700
You didn't know?

269
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,767
Baek Yeong Ok voluntarily retired from the military while in Pyongyang.

270
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,667
Including Shadow,

271
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,767
the Violet agents who escaped are very dangerous.

272
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:26,867
You must be extra careful until we arrest every one of them.

273
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:29,933
Please cooperate so that we can protect you

274
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:32,167
for the time being.

275
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,433
Mayor Won,

276
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,933
where is Platoon Leader Baek? Please let me see her.

277
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:40,100
Baek Yeong Ok,

278
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,800
why did you return?

279
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,567
You even left the military. What is it that you want?

280
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,300
There is no such thing.

281
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:51,700
It'll be revealed soon.

282
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,733
If it turns out that you've fooled me with your fake dating scheme,

283
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:59,833
I'll make sure you pay the price.

284
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,767
My feelings for Comrade Lloyd

285
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,767
are genuine.

286
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,933
I do hope that they are.

287
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,967
If not,

288
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:14,133
both you and Lloyd will be in trouble, Ms. Baek Yeong Ok.

289
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,367
Why are you looking at me like that?

290
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:39,267
What happened to the bluffer who used to talk back at me nonstop?

291
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:44,900
You're so quiet that you're scaring me.It feels like the calm before the storm.

292
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,700
Hey.

293
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,000
Why did you do that?

294
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,100
How could you make a decision like that?

295
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:01,167
If you quit being a soldier,

296
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:05,600
it also means you'll never be able to clear your father's name.

297
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,833
 Unification. 

298
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:29,167
 So, are you all ready to be dispatched? 

299
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,967
 I'm sorry, sir. 

300
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,900
 What do you think you're doing? 

301
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,200
 I thank you for allowing me 

302
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,567
 to be a warrior of the Republic. 

303
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,800
 I'll return to being a glorious person of the Republic 

304
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,367
 and devote my life. 

305
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:06,733
 Think carefully before you make the decision. 

306
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,900
 It's the first time in my life 

307
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,800
 that I made a decision for myself. 

308
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:19,300
 I guess peace and unification will come true after all. 

309
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,133
I had to return.

310
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,800
Because Mi Rae's here.

311
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,600
It's also because of you, Comrade No.

312
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,267
They can hear everything.

313
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:54,900
Your life is in danger.

314
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,667
Please make sure to be careful as you were taught and trained.

315
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,733
Gosh, seriously.

316
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,300
Stop worrying about me. Okay?

317
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:17,700
 If I'm in danger, then so are you. 

318
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,900
 I'll catch them first, 

319
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,800
 so that I don't make you worry. 

320
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,967
We prepared a safe house for you, Lloyd.

321
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:41,533
So I'm a very important being. Right?

322
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:44,200
If something happens to you,

323
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,500
it could cause problems for Pyeonghwa City as well as the South and North Korean relations.

324
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,700
On top of that, what about the numerous FITA fans?

325
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,267
How will we be able to handle all that?

326
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:54,900
Then, I'll stay with my unit members.

327
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,100
I'd be safer if Platoon Leader Baek was with me too.

328
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,867
Comrade Baek can't go with you.

329
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,733
May I have a word with you for a second?

330
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,267
I'm sure you guessed that there's an information leak

331
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,033
from the control tower.

332
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:22,667
We're going to leak the information about your safe house.

333
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:26,700
Whoever bites the bait first will be Shadow.

334
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,833
What you're saying is

335
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,900
that I'll need to be the bait. Right?

336
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,467
I ask for your help.

337
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:40,833
Your safety will be our number one priority.

338
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,100
It's for Pyeonghwa City.

339
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:55,900
I'm excited since it's been a while since we carried out a mission.

340
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,867
How interesting that we get to carry out a mission without Comrade Lieutenant Baek.

341
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,400
Each of you clearly understands what you're supposed to do. Right?

342
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
We're all ready.

343
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,733
I trust you guys.

344
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,533
Got you, bro. All right, let's go. Let's go.

345
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:07,967
- Okay, one, two, three. Unification! 
 - Unification!

346
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,233
What's going on here?

347
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,833
So, the thing is…

348
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:38,867
The best way to hide the real thing

349
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:42,033
is to hide it among fake ones.

350
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,867
Then, shall we get going?

351
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:49,367
I'll go with Mr. Lloyd.

352
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,600
But Mayor Won.

353
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,467
This is a very dangerous situation.

354
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:55,633
Until now, Pyeonghwa City

355
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:58,833
owes so much to Mr. Lloyd.

356
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,033
So from now, Mr. Lloyd

357
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:04,367
should receive the same level of protection as me, the mayor.

358
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:08,133
That's a reckless behavior on your end.

359
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:12,400
So, please make sure to capture Shadow.

360
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,400
Let's go, my clones.

361
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:37,467
Do you think they'll really show themselves?

362
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:41,533
I'm certain that Shadow installed a GPS.

363
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,167
The one who shows up to our car,

364
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,267
which isn't going toward the safe house,

365
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,533
will be Shadow.

366
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,767
What beautiful weather.

367
00:28:58,933 --> 00:28:59,967
Let's see.

368
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:03,000
Two vehicles already arrived at the destination.

369
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,267
The last remaining one…

370
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,633
Vice Commissioner Lee, I thought you were smart,

371
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,267
but you seem so naive in situations like this.

372
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:11,733
Why do you keep following me around and bothering me?

373
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:16,867
Why do you think Mayor Won Tae Sook is hanging onto that singer like that?

374
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:20,133
Do you really think that she's trying to protect Comrade Lloyd?

375
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,767
Well, then that…

376
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:27,367
Does that mean

377
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:29,967
that he's the bait to capture Shadow?

378
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:34,567
The one who will follow that singer first will be Shadow.

379
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:39,433
Or would it the one who secretly put on the GPS?

380
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:40,933
Are you trying to frame me?

381
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:44,200
That would be for the hunter who set the trap.

382
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,367
What I mean is that before you fall into the trap, find a way out,

383
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:50,300
Comrade Vice Commissioner Lee Min Ho.

384
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,700
But…

385
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,900
Wait a second.

386
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,533
Then, what should I do…

387
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,467
I… I just need to capture Shadow first.

388
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,833
Wait.

389
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,800
Hello?

390
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,267
Is this the counterterrorism…

391
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,700
I'm sorry. I called the wrong number.

392
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,033
Okay. Darn it.

393
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
Hello?

394
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,433
Get the counterterrorism unit ready now. Hurry.

395
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:21,700
Location?

396
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,000
The location is…

397
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,667
What?

398
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,400
Wait.

399
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,700
Where did they go?

400
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,500
What is this place?

401
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,033
I already told you earlier.

402
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:03,100
The place where it's going to be determined whether I get hunted down or I hunt them down.

403
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:06,467
If you keep acting unpredictably,

404
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:09,967
we can't guarantee your safety.

405
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:13,367
High-risk, high-return.

406
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:16,900
You must take a risk to win big.

407
00:31:51,070 --> 00:32:00,570
