4
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,500
I guess you're Mr. Kinn's favorite now.

5
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,230
Give this to him.

6
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,740
You wanted me to be shocked to know that Kinn's gay?

7
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,060
But I'm shocked that there are still people like you,

8
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,450
who mess with others with this stuff.

9
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,500
There's a diamond auction tomorrow.

10
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,480
You must be there as my bodyguard.

11
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,370
Pete.

12
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,450
Where is Porsche?

13
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,090
Check all of the security cameras.

14
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,100
Now!

15
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:37,650
Boss.

16
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,789
Kinn's alerted.

17
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,610
Porsche, are you alright?

18
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,280
Just admit it that you like me.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,320
Otherwise, why would you kiss me at the pier?

20
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,980
What happened to me?

21
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,590
You were drugged.

22
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,050
But they didn't do anything to you.

23
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,700
I got there in time.

24
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,010
Who are they?

25
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,910
I've already had Pete and Arm dig into those guys.

26
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,290
I don't have any enemies.

27
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,470
The first day that you walked
into the main family's house,

28
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,570
was the day you got yourself enemies.

29
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,650
Why are they targeting me?

30
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,730
I don't know.

31
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,760
Are you okay?

32
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,360
Porsche.

33
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,820
Please leave me alone.

34
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,370
I'll let you have one day off.

35
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,450
Go take a shower.

36
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,920
Papa.

37
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Papa.

38
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,630
Mr. Kinn turned off his phone.

39
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,330
Once he arrives, tell him to come meet me.

40
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:16,960
Yes, sir.

41
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,570
Mamma Mia!

42
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,590
Looks like it's gonna rain today.

43
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,590
I happened to pass by to run some errands.

44
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,690
So I brought you deep-fried dough sticks
from your favorite place.

45
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,750
Wow, I guess it must be an important errand.

46
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,450
I just wonder why you have
Big take care of me these days.

47
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,890
Big was injured then.

48
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,580
So I had to find a new guy for Kinn.

49
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,900
Where is he from? An ex-soldier or a police?

50
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,450
A bartender.

51
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,630
He's skilled.

52
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,450
Really?

53
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,250
It's a bit weird, Papa.

54
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,940
Normally, when Papa accepts bodyguards,

55
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,470
if they were not raised by you
or they are specifically qualified.

56
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,510
Why?

57
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,810
Are you interested?

58
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,710
I'm more interestedp in what you're thinking.

59
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,740
I'm outta here.

60
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,020
Oh, hey.

61
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,370
Won't you stay for a meal?

62
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,860
I'm off.

63
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,200
If you're still not alright,
you can take tomorrow off.

64
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,130
I'm not that weak.

65
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,350
Boss asked me to escort you to him.

66
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,890
Have a seat.

67
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,560
We haven't done this in a while.

68
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,110
Are you bored playing with Chan?

69
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,070
We don't use the word "play" in a war.

70
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,120
How's work these days?

71
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,730
It's running.

72
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,820
It's great to hear that you focus on work.

73
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,970
Okay.

74
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,170
I skipped work today.

75
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,230
Porsche was drugged yesterday.

76
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,620
As a boss,

77
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,050
I'm supposed to take care of him, aren't I?

78
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,680
As a boss,

79
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,410
you don't have just one man working for you.

80
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,220
Arm's checked the footage.

81
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,320
Porsche was drugged
because he was too careless, sir.

82
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,010
If your people knew that you didn't finish your work,

83
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,360
and slept with the guy who failed his task,

84
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,310
how would they feel?

85
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,740
Papa, would you want me to punish him?

86
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,850
This happened to him
because Porsche works for our family.

87
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,610
Checkmate.

88
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,060
When you're at war,

89
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,190
you must see things in the bigger picture.

90
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,610
Don't let just one piece confuse us,

91
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,570
and cost us every piece on the board.

92
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,360
Like what happened before.

93
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,750
Papa, don't you worry.

94
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,790
I'm not going to let it happen again.

95
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
C'mon, let's start over.

96
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,830
Are you not dead yet?

97
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,620
I happened to be around here so I came to visit Papa.

98
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,260
I'm not talking to you.

99
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,660
I'm talking to the fish.

100
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,560
Right, I'm off.

101
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,280
Hey.

102
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,190
Wait.

103
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,800
I'm just kidding.

104
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,840
And...

105
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,130
Are you here to visit or spy on something?

106
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,920
And?

107
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,040
Well...

108
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,640
And...

109
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,320
Did you get anything?

110
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,030
Once a nosy person, always a nosy person.

111
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,030
Nosy, nosy, nosy, nosy, nosy!

112
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Thanks.

113
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,610
Hey.

114
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,020
You!

115
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,540
Are you not gonna stay home at all?

116
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,260
Do I ever stay home?

117
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,200
Well,

118
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,950
no.

119
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,130
Yeah, I'm outta here.

120
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,560
Dada is off, my dear.

121
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,840
Bye-bye, good night, my babies.

122
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,690
Is this Porchay's number?

123
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,810
Are you still looking for a guitar tutor?

124
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,600
Why did you call me here?

125
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,490
Take off your shirt.

126
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,110
Crawl back and forth 100 times.

127
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,410
And why do I have to do that?

128
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,490
Are you dumb, bro?

129
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,940
You're drunk on duty.

130
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,700
You troubled Mr. Kinn.

131
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,080
Just this, it's way too little.

132
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,340
I wasn't drunk. I was drugged.

133
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,010
And what rights do you have to give me orders?

134
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,430
I gave the order.

135
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,590
Once you're on duty, you must
be aware of everything at all times.

136
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,500
If I'm guilty, I admit.

137
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,150
Darn right.

138
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,360
The ones who fail must be punished.

139
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,310
C'mon.

140
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,370
More.

141
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,960
C'mon.

142
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,980
Hey, don't tell me you're tired already, huh?

143
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,390
Faster!

144
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,680
Aren't you the great one?

145
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,540
C'mon.

146
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,060
Why are you stopping?

147
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,100
Whoa!

148
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,510
Just this and you're tired?

149
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,220
Are you tired, huh?

150
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,020
Go on!

151
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,820
Aargh!

152
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,990
Wow.

153
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,030
Just like that.

154
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,680
Good!

155
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,110
Why are you stopping?

156
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,370
- Yeah!
- What?

157
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,560
Want me to help you? Huh?

158
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,740
Porsche.

159
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,650
Porsche.

160
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,650
Porsche.

161
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,590
Are you okay?

162
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,480
You look like a rubbish, man.

163
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,319
C'mon, man.

164
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,050
Mr. Kinn may be concerned about how others feel.

165
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,560
It's become talk of the town already.

166
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,960
Don't overthink.

167
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,079
I know exactly how you feel.

168
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,100
The first time is always the worst.

169
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,790
It happened to you before?

170
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,270
Mmm.

171
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,140
Mr. Tankhun did it to me.

172
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,050
Shoot.

173
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,580
That time,

174
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,620
Mr. Tankhun,

175
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,290
had me do air chair squat for days.

176
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,260
Fudge!

177
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,620
The first time that you talked about...

178
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,540
was the punishment?

179
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,540
Yeah.

180
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,770
Wait.

181
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,920
Wasn't it because of Mr. Kinn's punishment,

182
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,880
that made you have this messed-up face?

183
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,350
Or is there something else?

184
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,860
Nothing.

185
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,030
Oh, Mr. Tankhun asked me to invite you to party at Yok's.

186
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,670
He said partying with you
is the raddest no one could compete.

187
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,790
Coming?

188
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,710
So you'd stop looking like this.

189
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,610
Mr. Tankhun asked me to go to Yok's with him.

190
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,400
If I'm not allowed, I won't go.

191
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,730
Is that all?

192
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,750
Huh?

193
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,100
After this, don't ask for permission
if it's a trivial matter.

194
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,180
Do what you want to do.

195
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,920
Ah, faster, faster, faster!

196
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,430
- Have you tried this, Pete?
- Wow.

197
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,890
- Can we drink now?
- Mr. Tankhun.

198
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,920
One moment, Mr. Tankhun.

199
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,180
Ohhhhhhh.

200
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,220
- Fire!
- Flaming?

201
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,410
Good to go?

202
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,670
Go, Mr. Tankhun.

203
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,400
So good.

204
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,090
Pete.

205
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,070
- Go!
- Let's go.

206
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,560
How was it?

207
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,680
How was it?

208
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,330
Fire!

209
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,330
We want more! More! More!

210
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,360
C'mon.

211
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,850
Pete, go on!

212
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,300
Hey.

213
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
There.

214
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,550
Someone wants to know you.

215
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,470
- I'm not drunk, I'm not drunk.
- I'll unlock the car.

216
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,000
- Look into my eyes, look into my eyes.
- Mr. Tankhun.

217
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,080
- I'm sober.
- Mr. Tankhun.

218
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,260
Please go home and take some rest.

219
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,320
- I haven't danced to the song I chose.
- Let me help you.

220
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,360
- Easy, man.
- Come here.

221
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,770
Are you all leaving?

222
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,960
I have a little something to show Porsche.

223
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,040
Then, you stay.

224
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,190
I'll drive them home.

225
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,090
Thanks, man.

226
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,610
Yes?

227
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,200
You like it? Just bought it.

228
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,530
This is the top model.

229
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,300
Oh, they gave you steering dampers as well?

230
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,600
This one is, like,

231
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,780
killing it all.

232
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,250
You wanna try?

233
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,520
Can I?

234
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,440
Go ahead, why not?

235
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,320
- Listen to this song, guys!
- Yes, sir.

236
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,720
♪There's a werewolf, in the woods♪

237
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,720
♪He's crying. He's lonely♪

238
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,280
Who's that man in red?

239
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,400
Where is Porsche?

240
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,690
Oh.

241
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,920
Mr. Vegas came over to see Porsche at Yok's.

242
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,240
So he asked him to stay.

243
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,750
Who allowed him to?

244
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,780
Would you like me to get him back?

245
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,780
No!

246
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,460
We should get going, Mr. Tankhun.

247
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,990
Let's go. Why are you all yelling?

248
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,190
Mr. Tankhun.

249
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,970
I want more drinks.

250
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,060
Mr. Tankhun.

251
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,570
What is all that noise?

252
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,430
Let's go.

253
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,800
- Hey!
- Oh!

254
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,100
- Are you okay?
- Okay!

255
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,310
C'mon.

256
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,360
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

257
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,870
It was fricking awesome.

258
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,000
Right?

259
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,930
It was so much better than what people talked about.

260
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,190
So you're really okay now?

261
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,070
Okay about what?

262
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,300
Earlier at Yok's, you seemed stressed out.

263
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,480
Seeing you smile like this, that relieves me.

264
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,230
Mmm. Thanks for letting me ride.

265
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,820
You know,

266
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,720
if something ever bothers you from now on,

267
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,920
you can think of me.

268
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
Mmm, c'mon.

269
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,350
See ya.

270
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,990
Kinn.

271
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,980
What took you so long?

272
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,740
I asked for your permission.

273
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,820
You only told me that
you were gonna hang with Khun.

274
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,190
Well, you told me not to ask if it barely mattered.

275
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,520
Haven't I told you so many times already,

276
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,360
to not get involved with the minor family?

277
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,350
You know they can't be trusted.

278
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,510
At least, they've done me no harm.

279
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,500
Are you saying that I've hurt you?

280
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,530
Or have you not?

281
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,800
Don't you forget.

282
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,710
Your life...

283
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,980
is mine.

284
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,530
I can do whatever I want.

285
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,300
Then go ahead.

286
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,500
C'mon.

287
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,650
Do it.

288
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,660
What the heck are you waiting for?

289
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,940
Starting tomorrow,

290
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,660
Ken is going to be my head bodyguard.

291
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,810
I'm replacing you.

292
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,370
What's up, bro?

293
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:58,970
Hey.

294
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,040
Yeah, I'm gonna use the room for a moment.

295
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,900
Yeah, sure, go on.

296
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,660
Yeah, uh,

297
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,900
this is Porchay.

298
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,680
Nice to meet you.

299
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,790
Nice to meet you.

300
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,980
Oh, one thing.

301
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,380
There are more guitars coming in next week,

302
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,980
that I'm gonna put them here.

303
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,380
Yeah?

304
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,250
Is that okay?

305
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,100
Sounds great.

306
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,110
We have plenty of room here.

307
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,670
You can put them all.

308
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,340
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

309
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,080
See you.

310
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
See ya, bro.

311
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,890
You can eat the snacks.

312
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,800
I've prepared them for you.

313
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,390
Thought you might like them.

314
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,560
Yes.

315
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,290
So how's this place? It's my personal rehearsal room.

316
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,190
Is it okay?

317
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,010
Of course, it's okay. Really okay.

318
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,640
But, uh, actually,

319
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,490
you could just tutor me
at the faculty's living area, Wik.

320
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,120
Kim.

321
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,020
Huh?

322
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
My name is Kim.

323
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,220
[Week]

324
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,200
Wik.

325
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,670
[KIM]

326
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,360
Kim.

327
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,220
Oh.

328
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,850
Wik is another side of me.

329
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,050
Maybe, it's the side that I prefer.

330
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,390
Huh? Any side would do. I like them all.

331
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,620
Oh, I meant, the songs. Your songs.

332
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,410
And why do you want to study Music?

333
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:53,910
Well, uh, I mean, it seems fun.

334
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,140
What do they need for a quota admission?

335
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,460
I have to play one general song.

336
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,640
And compose a song on the spot.

337
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,380
Mmm.

338
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Then let's try writing a song.

339
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,540
Let's do it on your brother.

340
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,250
Eh?

341
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,480
How do you know that I got a brother?

342
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,250
I saw it on your phone.

343
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,110
So I thought you must be brothers.

344
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,330
Oh.

345
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,250
Yes, yes.

346
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,450
Er, about songwriting,

347
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,690
how do I start?

348
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,220
It's not that difficult.

349
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,570
Try thinking about whom you want to write about.

350
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,180
If you want to write about your brother,

351
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,400
try gathering general information about him.

352
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,890
List them out.

353
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,240
Like, what's your brother's name?

354
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,810
His name is Porsche.

355
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,380
How is Porsche like?

356
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,950
He's a cool guy.

357
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,330
He loves me, a lot.

358
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,969
He's good at everything.
I wanna be like him. He's strong...

359
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:14,130
His eyes aren't shifting. He seems relaxed.

360
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,830
He's not getting into too much detail.

361
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,940
Guess he's not lying.

362
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,330
But there's nothing new aside from what Big gave me.

363
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,719
I feel like I still can't be like him.

364
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,280
- I think that's enough.
- I mean--

365
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,159
That is it.

366
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,500
Porchay, try writing it out.

367
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,889
I'll be right back. Just one moment.

368
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,650
Can I borrow your phone?

369
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,280
Mine's dead.

370
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Oh, sure thing.

371
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,360
Here it is.

372
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,040
Thanks.

373
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,110
Go on.

374
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,199
I'll try.

375
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,199
Be right back.

376
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,810
How are you?

377
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,240
Doing well?

378
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,600
I know you wouldn't read this.

379
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,720
I'm so tired today.

380
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,760
Phew.

381
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,480
I miss you, bro.

382
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,840
Wik's gonna be my tutor. It's like I'm in heaven now.

383
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,630
Alright, that's it for today.

384
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,270
I gotta go somewhere.

385
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,230
Hey, wait.

386
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,700
The thing is I've written a little something.

387
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,830
Could you listen to it?

388
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,260
It's alright. I really need to go now.

389
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,560
Oh, please, please, please.

390
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,860
Pretty please, listen to it.

391
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,110
Mmm.

392
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,160
- It won't take long.
- Try me.

393
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,620
Alright, okay.

394
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,760

00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,660
Interesting.

403
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,580
Can you play it one more time?

404
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,120

412

Finish the song.

413
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,470
Okay.

414
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,610
[Because of you, no matter what obstacles come up, I will continue to move forward]
[As long as there is a hug, even if it is uncomfortable]

415
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,330
Since you've been here,

416
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,500
we rarely get to talk.

417
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,230
How are you doing?

418
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,640
Not so well, sir.

419
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,950
I heard that Kinn replaced you with someone else.

420
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,630
I guess I couldn't work well as he wanted.

421
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,780
How hard could it be?

422
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,770
Taking care of Kinn?

423
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,140
Everyone makes mistakes.

424
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,340
But here,

425
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,910
just admit and fix them.

426
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:37,370
Then can I take care of someone else?

427
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,570
How's this?

428
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,380
I'll give you one week to think.

429
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,830
Go back to your old self.

430
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,670
Stay with your brother.

431
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,830
Don't think about work.

432
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,310
And then come back with an answer,

433
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,940
whether you still want to be Kinn's bodyguard.

434
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,880
Whoops!

435
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,700
Mr. Kinn, what brings you here, sir?

436
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,370
Where is Porsche?

437
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,550
He's gone.

438
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,720
Where?

439
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,300
He's gone since yesterday.

440
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,160
Who gave him this order?

441
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,030
Mr. Korn, sir.

442
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,490
I heard that he's allowed to have a week off.

443
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,450
And has he told you about anything lately?

444
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,280
Nothing special, sir.

445
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,130
But he seems sad.

446
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,490
If it's not about failing his task,
I thought that he might be heartbroken.

447
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,650
Mr. Kinn, sir.

448
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,270
Don't think that I don't know my place.

449
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,750
I don't know what's going on between you and Porsche.

450
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,240
Porsche seems hot-tempered on the outside.

451
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,100
But he's very sensitive on the inside.

452
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,570
If you'd like to have a good conversation with him,

453
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,320
you must be patient and calm.

454
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,210
Pete!

455
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:48,970
Yes, sir!

456
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,010
Thanks!

457
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,650
- Alright, alright, alright!
- Oops.

458
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,610
Did the pork get you?

459
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,610
The pork got me good.

460
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,000
Whew, almost die.

461
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,680
Whoa, we haven't seen each other in so long.

462
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,540
So, you're alright?

463
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,080
Yeah, I'm alright.

464
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,320
How about your bro?

465
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,630
Speaking of that,

466
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,320
where's your bro?

467
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,470
He went to a camp.

468
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:40,760
At first, he wouldn't go.

469
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,560
But I persuaded him to go.

470
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,630
He must've missed me.

471
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,330
He misses you, of course.

472
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,950
Even I, miss you.

473
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,740
Really.

474
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,250
Your facial expression is the opposite.

475
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,480
I miss you, man.

476
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,860
You miss me or the drinks that I make?

477
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,000
The drinks that you make.

478
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,350
You read my mind, man.

479
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,350
C'mon, let's eat.

480
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,180
I'm so happy.

481
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,770
Pork. Beer. And friends.

482
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,750
Hey.

483
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,830
What's wrong, Porsche?

484
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,040
What?

485
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,360
You have an butt-face on.

486
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,870
Speak your mind, man.

487
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,710
He might need to shit.

488
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,110
He always has a butt-face on.

489
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,870
Darn you, Jom.

490
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,050
Moron.

491
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,820
Is it that obvious?

492
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,250
This kind of stuff,

493
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,260
you don't need to say anything.
Your eyes tell everything.

494
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,690
Who could it be?

495
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,950
Booty calls?

496
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,580
No.

497
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,700
You called them to surprise us?

498
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,700
Nope.

499
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,490
Let's clink the glasses.

500
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,240
I agree.

501
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
Cheers.

502
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,640
Pour me a beer.

503
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,030
Are you a person with disability?

504
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,060
Who the heck invited you here?

505
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Right.

506
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,710
I was gonna ask you the last time we met.

507
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,630
Are you Porsche's new boss at his new work place?

508
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,100
You dress up quite alright.

509
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,970
Thought you're a mafia.

510
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,380
Or...

511
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,480
is he your new colleague?

512
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,010
Wasn't it Mr. Tankhun who's your boss?
The one with crazy outfit.

513
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,990
I was drunk too fast that night. Sorry.

514
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,070
Yeah, I'm his colleague.

515
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,560
Ah. I heard about his crappy boss.

516
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,680
Well, not exactly that.

517
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,120
You told us.

518
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:24,920
He's very oppressive.

519
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,630
Yeah, right.

520
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:27,990
When he's not satisfied,

521
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,980
- he pulls out his gun to threaten his people.
- Right.

522
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,370
Right?

523
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,530
Never thought that one could be that cruel.

524
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,480
That's terrifying.

525
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,960
- Yeah.
- I got goosebumps.

526
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,980
C'mon, eat up!

527
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,490
Oh, wpe've run out of beer.

528
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,520
Can we get your new friend to bring us more beer?

529
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,460
Leave him alone. I don't wanna bother him.

530
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,660
It's alright. As you wish.

531
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,520
Cool.

532
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,540
The beer is in the fridge.

533
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,210
Oh, and bring us more ice.

534
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,690
- Yeah.
- Okay.

535
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,680
And we're out of veggies.

536
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,190
The veggies are the lower drawer of the fridge.

537
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,990
If there's none, slice us some more.

538
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:03,470
Okay.

539
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,410
Thanks a lot, man.

540
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,800
Darn, so stuffed. I can't even stand up.

541
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,060
It's kinda cool to have a henchman.

542
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,710
But he seems dull.

543
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,020
Wake up, Jom!

544
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,540
Whoa, you slept like an hour.

545
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,970
What? I was just blinking, really.

546
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,150
Hey, we gotta go. Better get going.

547
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,870
Bye, see ya.

548
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,090
Hey.

549
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,990
If you wanna change your job, let me know.

550
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,170
I got connections.

551
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,070
Really, you shouldn't be with the crappy boss.

552
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,470
You wanna change your job, you let me know.

553
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,020
Tell me. Let me know.

554
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,820
- Don't listen to him.
- Text me.

555
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,190
- Tell me.
- See ya, Porsche.

556
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,280
See you, man.

557
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,630
Call me when you get home.

558
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:58,620
Alright.

559
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,910
Why are you here?

560
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,790
Are you really asking?

561
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,830
I'm taking you home.

562
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,710
If you'd like to have a good conversation with him,

563
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,790
you must be patient and calm.

564
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,840
I think I would've said something
like that if it was the old me.

565
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,870
But I understand that you're off work now.

566
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,870
If you do, go home.

567
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,050
But you must come with...

568
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,440
me.

569
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,780
When are you coming back?

570
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,860
What does it have to do with you?

571
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,050
I must know!

572
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:45,270
I'm your boss.

573
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,250
Who said so?

574
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,730
Even if I'm back to work, I wouldn't be your bodyguard.

575

What the heck did y--

576

Why?

577
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,010
What the heck is wrong with you?

578
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,070
You really don't know a darn thing about yourself?

579
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,130
I may seem like a crappy person.

580
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,620
I may seem like I'm oppressive,

581
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,530
but I do care about all of my people.

582
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,050
But you never care about me.

583
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,740
You never care about me.

584
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,310
If I don't care about you,

585
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,080
why am I sitting here then?

586
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,100
I'm sorry,

587
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,400
that I punished you.

588
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,040
Sorry?

589
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,150
Right.

590
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,650
A guy like you?

591
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,380
Yeah, a guy like me.

592
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,770
Look at what I've done.

593
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:04,070
I've tried my best.

594
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,620
I'm sorry.

595
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,750
One sec.

596
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:14,500
Are you here alone?

597
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,560
It's just me here.

598
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:22,550
That means we've got company.

599
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:43,260
Boss, Mr. Kinn's GPS is moving out of Bangkok.

600
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,200
Have you called him?

601
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,260
We couldn't reach him.

602
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,090
Take the best men out there as soon as possible.

603
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,100
Yes, sir.

604
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,370
Mr. Kinn's GPS is in that truck.

Target comfirmed.

606
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,690
Big. Ken. Bring him back.

607
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,150
- Hey, Big!
- Big!

608
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,060
Big.

609
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:22,190
Get closer.

610
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,550
I've tracked Mr. Kinn's GPS from his phone

to where the truck was.

613
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,520
But we haven't found any tracks of both of them.

614
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,610
From now on, we're going to search
for them 24 hours until they're found.

615
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,650
No matter in what condition they're in.
