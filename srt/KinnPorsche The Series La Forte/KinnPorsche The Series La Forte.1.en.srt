4
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,470
Mr. Don is waiting inside, sir.

5
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:47,110
Normally, Mr. Korn doesn't have urgent meetings.

6
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,710
I know.

7
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,790
Sorry to keep you waiting.

8
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,910
Where is Mr. Korn?

9
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,990
Due to Mr. Korn's health condition,

10
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,470
from now on, Mr. Kinn will be in charge.

11
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,829
Ciao, Kinn.

12
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,829
You are all grown now.

13
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,710
Oh! Mama!

14
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,350
Please, take a seat.

15
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,790
Still, you're fond of Gelato?

16
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,550
No, thank you.

17
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,750
I won't bother you for long.

18
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,710
Welcome to Hum Bar!

19
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,630
Good evening! Hello there!

20
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,550
Please, take the seats, ladies.

21
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,550
Porsche!

22
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,990
Kong.

23
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,990
Yes?

24
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,350
For this beautiful Jang, Pink Lady.

25
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,390
Pink Lady.

26
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,950
And the charming Kaproy...

27
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,550
Vodka Martini, shaken, not stirred.

28
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:32,990
And for Lada...

29
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,990
a little special, I'll handle it.

30
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,470
My dad hasn't been very well lately.

31
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,150
Things are a bit out of hand.

32
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,590
Just today, that I've had a chance
to look through the company statements.

33
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:06,630
How excited are you for the big profit?

34
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,430
Right.

35
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,710
The casino is making bigger and bigger profit each year.

36
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,350
So big that...

37
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,470
it arouses someone's greed

38
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,630
to start cheating.

39
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,110
Do you agree?

40
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,430
Calm. Calm down.

41
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,430
If you wanna be on top of the game, you gotta have it all, like him.

42
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,110
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,310
See that? All the ladies are hooked.

44
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,310
Porsche is so cool.

45
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,350
Calm down.

46
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,590
I've done business with your Dad,

47
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,070
for years.

48
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:11,710
And he's never been disrespectful

49
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,630
with me.

50
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,830
With me!

51
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,990
People says,

52
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,790
I'm more like my Mom.

53
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,270
We were corrupted.

54
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,430
He wouldn't have succeeded

55
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,790
without contribution from my people.

56
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,790
Hopefully, the last case.

57
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,830
Betrayers must die.

58
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:25,350
We are going to do big business together, Mr. Kinn.

59
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,950
I'm doing quite alright tonight.

60
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,950
Porsche, teach us!

61
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,230
Gimme a thousand.

62
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,670
Hey, Ball, you got some money?

63
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,630
You got it?

64
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,190
I got two hundreds.

65
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,180
Another two, c'mon.

66
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,070
We got five hundred baht.

67
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,110
Please, tell us a little.

68
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,030
You don't have to do anything.

69
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,710
Just give them what they want.

70
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,390
You see those wealthy chicks?

71
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,510
They have no lovers.

72
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,630
But money.

73
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,950
You just need praise them.

74
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,590
And when they give you money...

75
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,590
Thank you, Porsche.

76
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,990
Hey, Porsche. The ladies here are calling for you.

77
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,070
Hurry up!

78
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,830
Take back your money.

79
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,390
I don't take money from my homies.

80
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,670
Thank you.

81
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,190
C'mon, make some drinks for the ladies.

82
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,630
They want you. They miss you.

83
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,110
Right away.

84
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,590
We got company.

85
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,310
Go that way.

86
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,310
I'll take Mr. Kinn through the tunnel. We need backup.

87
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,990
Porsche.

88
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,670
The woman at that table is checking you out.

89
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,670
I know.

90
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,870
This way, Mr. Kinn.

91
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,470
Mr. Kinn, go!

92
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,590
Shit, for god's sake.

93
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,670
Hey!

94
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,750
Help me.

95
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,790
Stay out of this, you piece of shit.

96
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,910
Hey!

97
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,670
Fifty-thousand.

98
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,630
You got it.

99
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,870
One moment.

100
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,030
I told you I needed a moment.

101
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,190
Go ahead.

102
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,390
Wait, man.

103
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,590
You're really have do this?

104
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,350
Hey there.

105
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,430
Hey, fifty-thousand!

106
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,630
You!

107
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,390
Get of me!

108
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,390
Calm down, bro.

109
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,630
Check if more are coming.

110
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,430
Thanks.

111
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,420
Hey.

112
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,470
Give me your bank account number.

113
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,270
I'll transfer the money.

114
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,270
Are you nuts?

115
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,310
Transfer it now.

116
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,590
I don't have a phone with me.

117
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,270
Give me your phone.

118
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,270
I'll have my people handle it.

119
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,550
Here you go, of course.

120
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,310
C'mon, you shithead.

121
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,230
Do I look like a fool?

122
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,870
You'll have your people beat me up.

123
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,870
So what do you want?

124
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,350
Hey, what are you doing?

125
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,900
Hey, hey.

126
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,430
Be still, be still.

127
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,590
Take it.

128
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,110
Now, that's better.

129
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,750
I'll have it.

130
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,990
What's your name?

131
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,470
And what's that for?

132
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,470
I'll send you a gift hamper.

133
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,030
My name is Jom.

134
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,870
Mr. Kinn, how are you doing, sir?

135
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,910
I'm okay.

136
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,710
What happened?

137
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,230
Porsche, come sit.

138
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,510
Chai came here to collect the rent.

139
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,470
I happened to be here.

140
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,980
If not, Chay would've been hurt.

141
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,350
Shit.

142
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,110
Thanks a lot, Uncle.

143
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,390
It's alright.

144
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,150
Are you okay?

145
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,150
I'm good.

146
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,950
But why did we stop paying them?

147
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,470
Chay's just started a new semester.

148
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,790
So I haven't been paying them.

149
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,790
They asked for 200,000 baht by this week.

150
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,790
Or they'll take the house.

151
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,590
200,000? Hell with them.

152
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,590
Bro, I'm sorry.

153
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,190
Nah, I was just rambling.

154
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,190
It's alright. I can still take care of it.

155
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,910
Uncle, have you eaten?

156
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,670
I bought some noodles.

157
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,150
Go ahead. Eat with Chay.

158
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,070
I've already had something.

159
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,070
I'll put them in the plate then.

160
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,830
I shouldn't have listened to my friend
and invested in Crypto.

161
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,390
Aside from loss...

162
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,390
we're losing this house.

163
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,830
Forget about it, Uncle.

164
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,870
At least, you're the only person
who's been trying to help us.

165
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,870
If it weren't for you, Chay would...

166
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,110
I haven't helped you guys with anything.

167
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,110
I'm also making things worse.

168
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,310
I'm so sorry.

169
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,310
How much do you think this costs?

170
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,230
Where did you get it?

171
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,630
A customer gave it to me.

172
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,590
Well, I don't really know much about this.

173
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,070
I guess a hundred thousand, maybe.

174
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,670
But that's still not enough.

175
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,790
Whoa, Uncle, if it costs that much...

176
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,790
we'll be fine. I'll find the rest.

177
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,990
How would that be possible?
We only got a few days.

178
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,510
Trust me, Uncle.

179
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,710
We'll be just fine.

180
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,750
You didn't steal this, did you?

181
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,230
C'mon, guys, come on!

182
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,670
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

183
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,670
It's time for some violence and the smell of blood.

184
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,070
Are you ready?

185
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,590
Yes!

186
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,590
Ready?

187
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,150
Yes!

188
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,150
And over here?

189
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,310
We're ready!

190
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,230
Ready?

191
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,230
Go!

192
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,710
Porsche, don't end it too fast.
Stall the time.

193
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,710
When we hit the target, I'll let you know.

194
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,710
Bring it on, buddy.

195
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,390
And finally, our final knockout!

196
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,110
Let's not waste more time.

197
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,910
Are we ready to have some fun?

198
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,590
Are you?

199
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,910
If you are...

200
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,870
Ready.

201
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,870
Fight!

202
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,230
You're doing good, Porsche.

203
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,230
Very well, Porsche.

204
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,030
What? He's about to go down, bro.

205
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,310
Thanks a lot, bro.

206
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,870
Hey, did you miscount this?

207
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,350
Well, only if you'd waited a little longer to knock him down.

208
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,190
Where would I find the money to pay you?

209
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,070
Why don't you go fight yourself?

210
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,030
Hey, c'mon.

211
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,870
Next month, I'll ask for a raise.

212
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,870
Bro!

213
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,350
Hey, hell with him.

214
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,150
Take mine.

215
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,150
I bet on you.

216
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,590
Don't worry.

217
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,110
Let's go grab a bite.

218
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,070
Pineapple. Sausages.

219
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,790
Porsche is here!

220
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,150
Bro, come sit here.

221
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,310
Who won the lottery?

222
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,310
You did.

223
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,710
The watch was worth 700,000 Baht.

224
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,070
C'mon, don't joke around, Uncle.

225
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,270
Really. We got 700,000 Baht.

226
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,750
So we get to keep the house?

227
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,270
And the rest could cover Chay's tuition fee.

228
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,950
Ouch!

229
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,670
Why are we having pizzas then?

230
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,270
Well...

231
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,150
Grab the beers! We need to celebrate!

232
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,070
Beer!

233
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,230
So many many beers!

234
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,670
Bro...

235
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,070
Can I have one?

236
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,350
Oh.

237
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,350
Yours is this one.

238
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,590
And this, is for you, Uncle.

239
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,590
C'mon, cheers. Yeah!

240
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,350
Sir.

241
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,110
Big's wound is more serious than we thought.

242
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,430
He might need to rest for months.

243
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,950
So...

244
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,750
Are you happy now?

245
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,110
It's fortunate they didn't kill you.

246
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,070
Or else you wouldn't be standing here.

247
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,350
You're too hot-tempered.

248
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,990
In this business, you need to know your place.

249
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:06,990
When I started, I had to greet them
with respect along with gifts.

250
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,750
It's my fault.

251
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:17,110
I did send some gifts to them
to apologize this morning.

252
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,510
They should be satisfied, I suppose.

253
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,870
What the hell!

254
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,550
What happened here?

255
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,310
Who did it?

256
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,790
I have no idea, sir.

257
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,870
Bring those bastards who did this here,

258
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,670
I'm going to kill them!

259
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,950
Right.

260
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,750
Look at you guys.

261
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,550
And what you've done.

262
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,310
Have we found Jom yet?

263
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,390
We're still looking for him, sir.

264
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,230
No matter who he is, find him quickly.

265
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,910
Yes, sir.

266
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,910
Whoa! Such a surprise.

267
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,750
Well, when I don't have to work, I come to study.

268
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,750
Don't I look like I love studying?

269
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,990
And where are your notes?
Let me copy them.

270
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,870
I already took the notes for you.

271
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,030
Wow. Very kind of you.

272
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,110
What, man?

273
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,990
You're not sharing.

274
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,430
This is so soft. Tastes good.

275
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,470
You wanna eat it, huh?

276
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,630
Is it tasty?
The snack that you stole from me.

277
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,310
It's crunchy too. Is it Ovaltine?

278
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,550
It's done, my dorayaki.

279
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,310
Hey!

280
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,310
Porsche!

281
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,630
Shit. There's no more.

282
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,630
You're unbelievable.

283
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,790
Where is Jom?

284
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,710
Oh, someone's looking for him earlier.

285
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,710
He said to meet him at the basketball field.

286
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,190
Holy shit!

287
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,790
Jom!

288
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,510
Porsche!

289
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,350
Your friend is going to be a star!

290
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,350
Earlier, a guy from a modeling agency
asked me to go to a series casting.

291
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,470
He wanted me to play a waiter

292
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:09,630
who's actually the greatest boxer undercover.

293
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,470
This role is obviously written for me.

294
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:19,990
It's my time

295
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,990
to be known to the world.

296
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,350
Yes?

297
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,430
What are you doing?

298
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,750
They're coming a lot.

299
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,430
Who's coming?

300
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,870
I can't fight this any longer, bro.

301
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,670
Fight who?

302
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,270
Who's there, Chay? Talk to me.

303
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,950
Shit! I'm taking a shit.

304
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,230
What do you want? Can't you just wait?

305
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,990
Oh, it's nothing.
Lock up the house.

306
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,990
I thought something happened.
Just lock the house nicely. Beware of the thieves.

307
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,710
Porsche, someone's here for Yok.

308
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,630
Take that for me, would you?

309
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,470
This is pretty nice.

310
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,470
But I'm nicer.

311
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,230
Thank you so much
for wanting to be my bar's partner.

312
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,270
The pleasure is mine.

313
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,710
Wow, you're so cute.

314
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,510
And so are you.

315
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:02,990
Thank you.

316
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,550
Hey, Porsche.

317
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,230
This is Mr. Kinn.

318
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,990
He's interested in becoming our bar's partner.

319
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,990
But I'm thinking about convincing him
to be another kind of partner.

320
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,030
The name is Porsche?

321
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,910
Yes, Porsche.

322
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,630
Oh, I thought it's something else.

323
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,470
He's the top of our list.

324
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,150
The customers want him.

325
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,900
If it weren't for the customers,
I would have him all by myself.

326
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,830
But that's not right.

327
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,830
May I have a word with the bar's favorite guy?

328
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,470
Of course. Take a good care of Mr. Kinn.

329
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,470
Excuse me.

330
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,070
What?

331
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,070
You're scared I might hurt the people around you?

332
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,350
You think I'm a low-class mafia?

333
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,110
You want your watch back, right?

334
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,190
Nope.

335
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,190
I think you've been fooled.

336
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:33,190
This watch, at least it should be 2 million Baht.

337
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,790
So what exactly do you want?

338
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,070
Calm down.

339
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,070
I'm here to relax.

340
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,590
Yok told me you're a great bartender.

341
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,070
Make me a drink.

342
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:17,190
Sugar. Bitter. Liquor.
Fragrant oil of an orange peel.

343
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:26,750
Wow. Bitter with sweet after taste.

344
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,710
This is nice.

345
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,470
What the hell do you want?

346
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,310
You got your watch back.

347
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,510
I think it's loud here.

348
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,510
Let's find a private spot to talk.

349
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,230
I'm not going.

350
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,110
Well, that's a shame.

351
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:01,430
This pretty bar might get messy...

352
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,430
Don't you think?

353
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,630
Take it off!

354
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,990
Why did you take me here?

355
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,430
Hey, do you hear me?

356
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:49,430
Hey! Can you hear me? Shitheads.

357
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:17,230
Porsche, Pachara, 23 years old.

358
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:23,070
Former national Taekwando's champion.

359
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,230
Also, an orphan

360
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:32,230
who has to be fully responsible for his own brother.

361
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:40,190
His main job is a top list bartender, shaking fast, treating nicely.

362
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,710
Another job,

363
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,950
an underground boxer,
also known as, The Phoenix.

364
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,870
Are you done?

365
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,510
Are you a psycho?

366
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,390
You kidnapped me to tell my story to me.

367
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,910
Are you crazy? You, asshole.

368
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,190
Let go of me! Untie me!

369
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,190
Be my bodyguard.

370
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,110
Be your bodyguard?

371
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,870
And hold my balls like a wallpaper
like these maniacs?

372
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:17,030
Watch it!

373
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,390
Cut it out.

374
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,390
I know you don't like it.

375
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:30,350
But this job will make a fortune for your brother and your family.

376
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,550
Yuck.

377
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:39,350
You think your pennies could buy me and my family.

378
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,510
I would do terrible things for you,

379
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,470
kidnap good people and tie them up,

380
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,670
and dig into their background.

381
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,070
Your friends here would act all cool walking in.

382
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,070
I know your kind very well.

383
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,750
For real?

384
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,190
You, be my bodyguard,

385
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,630
or be the fish's food?

386
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,150
I'm gonna count to three.

387
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,910
One.

388
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,630
Sorry. I'm a bit hasty.

389
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:56,990
Two.

390
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,990
What the hell!

391
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,270
Me, being your bodyguard?

392
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,470
I'd rather die.

393
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,830
Let him go.

394
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,510
How come you're back empty-handed?

395
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:39,590
I told you, a guy like him wouldn't work for us.

396
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,390
If you want someone good,

397
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,630
there are lots of guys who are better than him.

398
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,550
Yes, there are.

399
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,150
And just buying them off
with lots of money, they'd follow you.

400
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,070
But to someone, even with lots of money offered,

401
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:59,270
and he still doesn't want to come.

402
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,270
Don't you think this person is interesting?

403
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,750
He might be just a fool.

404
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,670
How many of our people

405
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:20,150
were bought by other gangs, or even the smaller families?

406
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,830
He might be whom you've been looking for after all.

407
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,510
Checkmate!

408
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,830
Chay, pack your bags.

409
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,190
Who did this?

410
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,270
Hell with Kinn's people?

411
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,990
Which Kinn?

412
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,470
The mafias.

413
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,470
If it weren't them, who would do such thing?

414
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,390
And are you alright?

415
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,390
I'm okay.

416
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,390
Bro...

417
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:46,350
Hey!

418
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,670
I've already cleared off all debts.

419
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,470
There must be some kind of misunderstanding.

420
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,350
Well, well...

421
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:56,350
That money wasn't delivered to us.

422
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,110
Your investor Uncle

423
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,630
invested in my club.

424
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:08,470
But he must have forgotten
that all the investments have risks.

425
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,710
He still owes me 2 million Baht.

426
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,710
Pull him up!

427
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,470
It's not true, is it, Uncle?

428
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,030
You tell them that it's not true.

429
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,750
Porsche, where have you been?

430
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,750
Everyone knows he's a regular at my club.

431
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,830
And that he told you about the money
he got cheated by his friend,

432
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,830
it's here.

433
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,750
2 million, right?

434
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,750
Give me one month.

435
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,390
Right. I'll give you one day.

436
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,470
If you don't have it by tomorrow,

437
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,470
both of you will be dead bodies on the street.

438
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,510
Let's go.

439
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:25,070
Porsche, I'm sorry. Porsche.

440
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,630
Porsche, I didn't mean to.

441
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,990
The thing is, Chai really cheated.

442
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,070
Porsche, believe me.

443
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,910
Uncle, stop bullshitting.

444
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:39,990
Porsche, you gotta believe me.

445
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,510
Are you done, Uncle?

446
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,510
Are you done bullshitting?

447
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,710
I'm your Uncle, Porsche.

448
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,470
Calm down and talk to me nicely, would you?

449
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:54,870
This is exactly why

450
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,310
I haven't crushed you.

451
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:02,910
What does a gambler like you care about except yourself.

452
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,950
Leave.

453
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:12,630
Porsche, forgive me.

454
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,870
Porsche, I know I'm wrong now.

455
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,950
Please.

456
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,310
Please forgive me, Porsche.

457
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,310
Leave!

458
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,710
I've raised you since you were a kid.

459
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,190
Cutting me off like this,

460
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:06,470
you've really thought it through?

461
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:25,030
Go ahead. It's still hot.

462
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,430
Alright.

463
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:39,950
Are we good?

464
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:41,670
Yeah.

465
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:05,190
Bro, about the money, just leave it.

466
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,190
We could move to somewhere else.

467
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,790
But I love this house.

468
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,790
Who doesn't love this house, bro?

469
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:29,270
But...Just forget it.

470
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,870
We could use the rest of the money
and rent a small house.

471
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:45,470
That's the last savings for your university expense.

472
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:56,750
Bro, studying won't do us any good now.

473
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,150
Let me help you work.

474
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:12,630
You know what,

475
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,830
what I want for you the most is,

476
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:24,190
I want you to have a degree,
have a quality social life and good friends.

477
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,190
I don't want to disappoint our parents.

478
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:41,110
They know, bro.

479
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:45,110
They know that you've done your best.

480
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:57,790
Don't forget, you're not alone in this.

481
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,790
And you're not the only one fighting.

482
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,270
Are you hurt?

483
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,350
Well, I'm not the smart one.

484
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,350
Leave the hard work to me.

485
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:33,550
Bro, please, we could rent a small house together.

486
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,910
And when we have enough money,

487
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:46,910
we could open a small bar business
by the beach just like you always wanted to.

488
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:51,830
You, make the drinks.

489
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:56,630
And I'll play live music.

490
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,870
Ooh.

491
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:59,550
So cool.

492
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,550
Haha.

493
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:07,030
In real life, it's not that easy, you know.

494
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,310
The reason I support you to go study is,

495
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:12,630
if you play live music,
you'll scare off all the customers.

496
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,030
What the hell?

497
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:14,750
Ah.

498
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,870
Just wait and see.

499
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,910
Ah.

500
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,910
I'm seeing it right now.

501
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:33,150
I love you, bro, very much.

502
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:29,350
Bro.

503
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,350
Bro...

504
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,670
Chay, I've got good news.

505
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,910
Yok has a nice friend
who's gonna clear all debts for us.

506
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,910
And he is going to help you with the school fees
until you get the degree.

507
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:07,670
But in exchange, I gotta take care
of his bar in a private island.

508
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:11,710
I'm so lucky.

509
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,670
I suddenly get to do my dream job.

510
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,950
I guess the atmosphere must be really nice.

511
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,950
Beautiful sand and clear water.

512
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:23,830
Every where I look, I see happiness.

513
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:34,030
But unfortunately, there's no phone signal.

514
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,750
No internet.

515
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,590
Or else I'd take photos for you to see every day.

516
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:41,630
I love you, Chay.

517
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:42,630
Porsche.

518
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,470
Don't forget our deal.

519
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:34,470
Well, you too don't forget that your life is mine now.

520
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,070
My life is mine.

521
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,550
You have no right to speak like that with Mr. Kinn.

522
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,990
Why can't I?

523
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,830
Are you a god?

524
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,790
Hey, watch your mouth.

525
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:46,310
You have no idea that Mr. Kinn...

526
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,310
You'll find out.

527
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,950
Porsche, the boss is calling for you.

528
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:58,550
I heard that you didn't want to work here?

529
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:04,830
But I'd love you to be here and be happy.

530
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,910
The hell with happiness.

531
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:14,390
And about your brother, don't worry.

532
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:16,390
I'll take care of him as promised.

533
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:26,150
If you really want me to be the bodyguard here,

534
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:30,670
I must be in charge of these two.

535
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:41,070
Good.

536
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,070
You got the guts.

537
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,630
Alright.

538
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,030
Because now Big isn't in the condition.

539
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,150
But Sir...

540
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:05,350
Well, consider it done.

541
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,350
You all may leave. I'll rest.

542
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:24,990
Papa.

543
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:53,230
At last, all the pieces are complete.

544
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:01,550
Alright, let's start.

545
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,250
This is the product opening party.

546
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,000
I'll take care of Mr. Kinn.

547
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:15,140
Let me have one.

548
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,390
You think you still working in a bar?

549
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,390
Do you know that you make a fool out of me?

550
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,000
Keep an eye on the new bodyguard named Porsche.

551
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,880
And report to me.
