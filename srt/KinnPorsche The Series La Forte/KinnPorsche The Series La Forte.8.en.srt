The last time I saw you like this

5
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,190
was when you were dating...

6
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,110
Tawan.

7
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,510
I've heard this so many times now.

What really happened?

9
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,150
Kinn shot Tawan to death.

No matter what happens,

You're way more loose than I thought.

15

Okay, alright, you're getting better at bull-crapping.

And? Hmm?

99
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,350
Since you're better at bull-crapping now,

100
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,860
you definitely don't just want to have a drink with me.

101
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,750
Is it that obvious?

102

- Who
- With Kinn, Yok.

Oh.

112
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,830

138

You're being like this.

139

That's because you love him.

And what should I do next, Yok?

141

Yeah.

148
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,630
Well, you gotta find some time to be together.

149
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,630
Aside from being in the bed,

150
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,830
you go out on a date, go to
the movie, go out for some meals.

151
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,190
Take a walk. Something like that.

152
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,030
And where do people go on a date?

153
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,990
Because I normally ended up at the back of your bar.

Yeah.

156
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,110
I took girls there often.

157
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,470
There are plenty.

158

Which one?

159
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,870
Come on.

160
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,190
Google it.

161
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,550
Right.

162
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,950

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,910
Yeah.

177
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,110
Thirteen romantic cafés.

178
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,830
There.

179
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,270
So people go to these places nowadays?

180
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,470
Right.

181
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,310
Ah.

182
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,910
You look great.

183
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,230
Where did you get them?

184
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,430
Why are you so darn cute?

185
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,150
Isn't that normal?

186
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,950
I'm not used to this.

187
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,750
Neither am I.

188
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,750
Are you ready?

189
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,510
I am ready.

190
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,910
Let's go.

191
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,950
C'mon.

192
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,110
Wow.

193
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,100
Here it comes.

194
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,870
I'm sorry, sir.

195
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,110
Okay.

196
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,070
Well, please get us new ones.

197
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,580
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

198
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,780
- Sorry again.
- It's okay.

199
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,250
Here.

200
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,190
This is so good.

201
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,830
Here, this is how you do it. Like this.

202
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,370
You twist it.

203
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,680
Let me show you.

204
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,470
Your eyes really look so...

205
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,670
Hey!

206
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,300
Waiting, I'm waiting.

207
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,430
Here.

208
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,950
This is delicious.

209
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,230
See? I knew that this place would be good.

210
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,230
I've done some homework.

211
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,630
The sweets here are good.
And it's great for taking photos.

212
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,270
Shoot!

213
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,670
Thank you.

214
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,230
I forgot to take a photo.

215
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,710
Give me your phone.

216
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,630
Alright, alright.

217
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,630
Your phone, your phone.

218
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,190
Put it back.

219
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,190
Hey!

220
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,550
Spit it out!

221
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,310
What are you doing?

222
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,310
Spit it out!

223
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,470
Put it where it was.

224
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,110
There.

225
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,310
Turn it a bit.

226
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,790
There.

227
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,790
A bit more to this side.

228
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,750
Smile!

230
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,430
Hold it, hold it.

231
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

232
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,550
Peace sign!

233
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,550
That's too high.

234
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,870
Two fingers.

235
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,510
Yes, that's it.

236
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,590
Like this.

237
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,590
C'mon.

238
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,230
Blow your cheek.

239
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,190
Hey.

240
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,910
Your cheek, blow it.

241
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,870
I haven't taken a shot yet.

242
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,870
One. Two. Three.

243
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,910
So adorable.

244
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,110
Alright. Put it down. Continue.

245
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,870
Never delete that one.

246
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,070
Hey, I'll do it for you.

247
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,950
Give it here.

248
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,630
Put that one down.

249
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,270
You must really like this. I'll take you back here again.

250
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,270
It's delicious.

251
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,319
But before we leave the place.

252
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,470
Ta-da.

253
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,030
Let's take some photos.

254
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,310
Smile.

255
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,990
Let's see.

256
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,150
Ta-da.

257
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,950
It'll take some time.

258
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,350
Put it at your armpit.

259
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,830
Yeah, there, warm it up.

260
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,750
- Is it done?
- Look.

261
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,070
Wait and see.

262
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,820
Here it comes.

263
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,190
- We're good-looking!
- Hey.

264
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,190
Why do you look so stressed?

265
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,850
Oh.

266
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,910
Take it again.

267
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,910
Alright, again.

268
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,790
Smile, c'mon.

269
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,830
One more time. Go.

270
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,670
One.

271
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,930
Okay, okay.

272
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,990
One. Two. Three.

273
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,030
What?

274
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,550
Why the stressed face?

275
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,700
C'mon, last pic.

276
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,840
Give it here!

277
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,910
Such a waste. C'mon, last one.

278
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,680
Any face you wanna do.

279
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,720
Let's go. One, two, three!

280
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,510
What you're doing? Kinn!

281
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,430
Kinn!

282
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,430
There're people!

283
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,550
It's alright, c'mon.

284
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,350
We're not at the house!

285
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,510
Check the pic first.

286
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,830
You're unbelievable.

287
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,070
Mr. Kim, is there anything?

288
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,860
[Nampeung Kittisawat]

289
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,780
[Chayapat Kittisawat
Nampeung Kittisawat]

290
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,150
Kittisawat?

291
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,670
Porsche's Dad and Mom?

292
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,870
I heard that they got hit to death by someone wealthy.

293
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,550
And the case was cut loose.

294
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,510
They still haven't found the driver yet.

295
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,510
Find out who did it for me.

296
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,310
Why are you so interested in this matter?

297
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,150
Or are you afraid that Porsche faked his bio

298
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,510
about his parent's car accident?

299
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,470
Do you watch too many movies?

300
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,990
I just wanna know, that's all.

301
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,750
I think it must be someone
wealthy close to us who hit them.

302
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,950
But if it's just that,

303
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,470
why would Mr. Korn puts so much interest into this?

304
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,110
Well,

305
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,110
maybe it's Porsche's skills and his craziness.

306
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,100
Or maybe,

307
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,150
he could be the son of my Papa's mistress.

308
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,190
Huh?

309
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,790
I was just kidding.

310
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,030
This may be the last thing
about Porsche I'd want you to find out.

311
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,540
We have lost our time with him so much.

312
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,630
Way too much.

313
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,310
Then excuse me.

314
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,110
I'm so sorry.

315
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,790
I actually planned to take you
out on a dinner by the river.

316
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,790
But it didn't say on the website
that it's gonna be closed today.

317
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,790
I'm just bummed.

318
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,790
That's alright.

319
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,950
You didn't ask for any sauce?

320
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,710
Oh, they didn't give us one?

321
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,870
I'll go ask for it.

322
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,870
Hey, it's okay.

323
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,470
You know what,

324
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,630
this is the first date of my life.

325
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,110
I studied every little detail.

326
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,510
I thought that today was going to be perfect.

327
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,510
But it's all messed up.

328
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,110
I intended to keep today as our good memory.

329
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,610
I just suck so much.

330
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,830
How would you know that you sucked?

331
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,910
Actually,

332
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,350
I've never thought

333
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,350
that I have a chance
to do anything like this before too.

334
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,470
And what do you think?

335
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,470
Is it good or is it bad?

336
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,510
It's freaking awesome.

337
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,750
What's that?

338
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,950
There's only my number on this phone.

339
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,550
You're giving this to me?

340
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,550
Yeah.

341
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,230
In case, you happen to miss me.

342
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,310
You're so adorable.

343
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,990
Well, you too.

344
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,750
You're happy, aren't you?

345
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,470
I am.

346
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,470
So am I.

347
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,710
What's wrong?

348
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,670
There's someone...

349
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,750
W-what?

350
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,830
A guy there, he's gone.

351
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,830
Didn't you see him?

352
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,070
What guy?

353
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,470
There's no one. Everyone went home.

354
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,790
There was one. I saw him.

355
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,630
Let's go.

356
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,010
Nobody will take a walk there.

357
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,400
Are you sure?

358
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,520
Careful.

359
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,520
♫ Every event I've met ♫

360
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,680
♫ Every night I've passed ♫

361
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:46,060
♫ They are nothing, just come and go in a circle ♫

362
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,350
♫ But when you come into my life ♫

363
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,820
♫ I started to get it ♫

364
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:00,060
♫ Every minute that I spent
is for waiting to see you ♫

365
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,140
♫ What if we'll keep look into
each other eyes for tonight ♫

366
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:15,320
♫ What if we'll keep holding
each other hands for today ♫

367
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:24,370
♫ It's okay even if the whole
world is going to collapse ♫

368
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,860
♫ It's you ♫

369
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,290
♫ It's because of you ♫

370
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:40,080
♫ Even if we face a world without stars ♫

371
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,340
♫ But we both will overcome that ♫

372
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,260
♫ No matter how long ♫

373
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:55,300
♫ Embrace me, there's just the two of us for tonight ♫

374
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,910
♫ Why don't you stay ♫

375
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,990
Did you get me coffee?

376
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,550
Nope.

377
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,010
You're unkind.

378
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,670
Man, go get it yourself.

379
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,750
I change my mind.

380
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,750
I think I'm gonna quit smoking.

381
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,190
What are you doing?

382
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,940
Quitting.

383
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,910
I'm gonna start a new life.

384
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,200
Oh, wow.

385
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,710
A guy like you?

386
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,950
Wow, unbelievable.

387
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,550
Well, smoking makes you so cool, huh?

388
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,890
Right?

389
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,230
Hey, break's over.

390
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,230
Let's go.

391
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,510
Go on. I'll catch up.

392
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,750
- Yeah, yeah.
- Just go.

393
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,030
Hello.

394
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,990
You called earlier,

395
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,110
I was on my break.

396
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,270
So I didn't answer.

397
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,030
I miss you. Send me a selfie to freshen me up.

398
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,510
You said it like we hadn't seen each other in ages.

399
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,340
I'm about to be on my way to you.

400
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,390
And? I wanna see you now. And without a shirt too.

401
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,430
Are you crazy? No!

402
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,030
There!

403
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,510
- Hey!
- What?

404
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,950
Porsche!

405
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,950
I saw someone

406
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,150
- Eh?
- What?

407
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,150
There's no one.

408
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,550
Are you hallucinating?

409
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,750
Let's go. Our break's over.

410
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,590
Let's get back to work.

411
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,900
Get back to work.

412
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,670
There's someone stalking Mr. Kinn lately.

413
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,070
But I'm just not sure if you know him or not.

414
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,070
Or you might have seen him before.

415
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,310
Or is it an assassin sent to kill Mr. Kinn?

416
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,310
No.

417
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:35,440
He's got short hair and a little pointy nose.

418
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,950
And I think he looks way too polite to kill anyone.

419
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,430
If you don't believe me, take a look at my drawing.

420
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,700
He looks just like this.

421
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,170
Any ideas?

422
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,910
Porsche.

423
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,910
Huh?

424
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,220
What the frick did you draw?

425
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,350
No, he doesn't seem familiar.

426
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,950
But in real life, if I ever see a guy looking like this,

427
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,670
I would be so freaking startled like you.

428
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,470
I think this guy

429
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,470
is trying to find a way to get to Mr. Kinn.

430
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,590
You got any more thoughts?

431
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,110
Hey.

432
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,350
Or could he be one of the guys on Mr. Kinn's list?

433
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,110
Some of the guys were dumped by Mr. Kinn.

434
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,150
And they wouldn't let it go.

435
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,170
They would try to get back with Mr. Kinn.

436
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,990
Man, how slutty.

437
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,470
Yeah, I think that could be it.

438
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,270
I'll go ask him.

439
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,430
Wait, wait.

440
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,590
This is so personal.

441
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,110
Would he tell you?

442
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,100
What?

443
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,870
What would you suggest me?

444
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,110
How about this?

445
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,830
I used to see Mr. Kinn's special cell phone.

446
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,590
It's only used to communicate with
the agency that sends the guys to Mr. Kinn.

447
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,310
If you check it, you might find the guy.

448
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,400
And where's that special phone?

449
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,520
Clear.

450
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,070
Ostrich, search for a phone.

451
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,110
Tailorbird will be the lookout.

452
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,470
Why are we using secret names?
There are only two of us.

453
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,470
C'mon, hurry up.

454
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,710
There're so many.

455
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,950
So promiscuous.

456
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,150
So slutty.

457
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,660
Looks familiar.

458
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,390
Oh, you slept with a celebrity?

459
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,470
Darn, Porsche!

460
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,980
Black Eagle is on the way.

461
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,110
Tailorbird will run now.

462
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,110
Pete!

463
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,630
Surprise!

464
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,850
Darn!

465
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,110
Well, if it's this guy, I'll have to use another gun.

466
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,310
I miss you.

467
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,870
Porsche.

468
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,310
What punishment were you called in for?

469
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,950
Well, it was another rough one.

470
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,310
I knew just by the look.

471
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,590
Your neck, there're red spots everywhere.

472
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,310
Next time, don't block it with your neck.

473
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,710
You might break your neck.

474
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,110
Use your arms.

475
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,110
Like this.

476
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,390
Alright?

477
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,030
Yeah.

478
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,990
Right, I've checked.

479
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,350
I didn't see that guy on the phone.

480
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,870
No?

481
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,870
But I found this.

482
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,660
It's in the back of the photo frame.

483
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,070
Surprise!

484
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,310
Darn!

485
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,750
So, you know him?

486
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,750
Porsche.

487
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,949
Are you certain that this is the guy you saw?

488
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,150
Yeah.

489
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,389
This butt-head has been stalking Kinn.

490
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,630
Well,

491
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,830
It's Tawan, Kinn's deceased ex.

492
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,580
Please, your venerable.

493
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,270
Oh.

494
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,790
And where is the other person?

495
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,190
I'm alone.

496
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,989
I saw him standing here earlier.

497
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,949
Right here.

498
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,750
Your venerable.

499
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,830
No need to repeat.

500
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,830
I believe you.

501
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,750
But that's the reason

502
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,950
why I'm making merits here.

503
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,590
I think right now,

504
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:14,590
I'm being haunted by the ghost
of an ex of the person I'm seeing.

505
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,870
Frankly, your venerable.

506
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,510
Do you have any kind of amulets that I can have?

507
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,070
Like, holy water or holy rice, something like that?

508
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,030
Those, I don't.

509
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,710
But I have the other thing.

510
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,630
It works too.

511
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,630
What is it?

512
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,150
Kim.

513
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,150
Porchay.

514
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,710
Why are you not answering any of my calls?

515
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,770
Oh, I've been making a new song so that's why I couldn't...

516
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,030
Oh, that's what I thought.

517
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,110
So I went to get your address from your friend.

518
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,750
And also, I'm here to play my homework love song,

519
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,510
for you to listen.

520
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,310
The thing is I gotta go now.

521
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,550
Wait, wait, wait.

522
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,550
Please.

523
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,310
Please listen to it.

524
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,310
It won't take long.

525
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,870
Oops.

526
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,030
No.

527
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,790
I forgot my guitar strap.

528
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,350
But it's alright.

529
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,510
I got my own guitar stand.

530
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:37,750
♫ I am melted away when we're near ♫

531
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,150
♫ I can't hold my feelings. My heart is about to pop ♫

532
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:47,190
♫ My thoughts are flying away.
You're making my heart fly away ♫

533
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,870
♫ I can't hold it any longer
 I need to say what's in my heart ♫

534
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:58,190
♫ It's stuck. I seem to keep stuttering like that ♫

535
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,460
♫ When the time comes, I just can't do it ♫

536
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,630
♫ There are a million words in my heart I wanna say ♫

537
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,670
♫ If I keep them all, I may get crazy one day ♫

538
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,710
♫ So I collect all the love words ♫

539
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,710
♫ That are bursting out of my heart ♫

540
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,790
♫ And make them into a song
that I'd like for you to listen ♫

541
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,190
♫ It's written from the sound of my heart ♫

542
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,190
- Excuse me, please lower your voice.
- Yes?

543
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,350
Just one moment, please. I...

544
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,350
I'm almost done here.

545
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,910
Yes, sir.

546
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,750
♫ It's written from the sound of my heart ♫

547
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,270
♫ Darling, can you hear it? ♫

548
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,350
♫ This love song belongs to you, just you ♫

549
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:45,070
♫ And this song is called 'You' ♫

550
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,070
This guitar stand is tired now.

551
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,190
Okay.

552
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,590
So...

553
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,950
Let me know what you think, Kim.

554
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,470
Bye-bye.

555
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,270
What the heck are you looking for?

556
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,190
Why?

557
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,710
You're making noises.

558
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,790
Nothing, it's just too hot for me.

559
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,750
What are you doing tonight?

560
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,870
I'm watching the movies with Mr. Tankhun till dawn.

561
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,550
Hey, let me join you.

562
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,070
Please.

563
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,270
Please!

564
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,790
What?

565
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,470
You said you didn't like watching movies with him.

566
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,350
No!

567
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,830
That's not it.

568
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,910
Who said so?

569
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,630
I loved it.

570
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,750
I'm coming with you.

571
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,990
Please.

572
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,110
Hey, let me join you.

573
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,790
Didn't I tell you

574
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,590
to put on the horror makeup?

575
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,590
You are a black sheep now.

576
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,870
Whoa.

577
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,390
Don't we have anything else to watch, Mr. Tankhun?

578
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,870
Well, this is our horror night, horrified until dawn.

579
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,990
But there's also Casper, the friendly ghost.

580
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,110
- Have you never heard of it?
- Shhhhhh.

581
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,790
Quiet.

582
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,380
The ghost is about to come out.

583
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,630
What?

584
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,630
I will kill you all!

585
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,310
I will kill you all!

586
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,270
Why the heck did you kick me, Porsche!?

587
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,560
What the heck are you doing then?

588
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,760
I'm bringing the microwaved popcorn.
See? All the smoke.

589
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,870
It's freaking hot.

590
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,470
Darn you, idiot!

591
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,910
You freaking scared us all.

592
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,870
Come here.

593
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,610
- Popcorn.
- You stole all the ghosty vibe.

594
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,550
Go sit over there.

595
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,790
Darn it.

596
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,590
Darn you!

597
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,590
I shouldn't have brought you all popcorn.

598
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,060
Why would you cover yourself with the sheet?

599
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,670
What the heck are you wearing?

600
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,270
Don't I just look cool?

601
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,260
Sit down.

602
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,430
- Look.
- Why?

603
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,270
Shhhhhh.

604
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,270
Everyone, quiet, quiet, quiet!

605
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,460
This scene.

606
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,910
Porsche.

607
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,990
Porsche!

608
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,210
Get out!

609
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,670
Such an annoyance!

610
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,350
Leave. Go to your own room now!

611
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,350
Go!

612
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,910
- I'm getting moody now!
- Mr. Tankhun!

613
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:23,710
Mr. Tankhun!

614
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,710
Please let me in!

615
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,590
Shut up.

616
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,390
Hello.

617
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,830
What are you doing?

618
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,550
I'm alone tonight.

619
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,510
You wanna try something new?

620
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,710
I'm barely wearing anything now.

621
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,470
Hey, Kinn!

622
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,830
Porsche.

623
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:43,750
Porsche.

624
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,750
Hey.

625
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,270
- Porsche.
- Whoa!!!

626
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:55,990
Porsche!

627
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,230
Porsche.

628
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:11,350
A phallic sculpture, consecrated by my mentor.

629
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,630
To do it, say the mantra three times.

630
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,630
And throw it at what's disturbing you.

631
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,130
Porsche.

632
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,510
What's wrong with you?

633
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,550
What the heck?

634
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,320
Why did you throw it to me? Darn you!

635
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,300
Now, that's better.

636
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,750
You really saw Tawan?

637
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,390
Darn right.

638
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,520
He freaking haunts me everywhere.

639
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,520
I think he might be jealous that you...

640
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,990
and I are in love.

641
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,370
That's not it.

642
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,310
How could you possibly know?

643
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,310
I think it is.

644
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,260
We used to see each other when we were in college.

645
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,770
Back then we were like any ordinary couple.

646
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,420
I couldn't imagine how I could stop loving him.

647
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,310
And one day,

648
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,200
I found out that

649
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,400
he betrayed me.

650
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,500
He sold my family's information to the Italians.

651
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,710
So I...

652
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,350
shot him.

653
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:06,270
And after that, I couldn't trust anyone.

654
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,840
Were you really hurt?

655
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,960
I got no choice.

656
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,470
Tawan didn't love me.

657
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,630
Never did.

658
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,630
He just used me.

659
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:31,100
So that's why Tawan couldn't be
the jealous ghost that haunts you.

660
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,910
You're alright now?

661
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:38,910
No.

662
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,110
Mmm.

663
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,950
Why do you keep it?

664
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:02,350
I just want it as a reminder.

665
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,830
4A reminder or a can't-get-over?

666
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,100
Then, I couldn't get over him.

667
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,550
How about now?

668
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,510
I totally forget everything.

669
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,150
Here, I'll throw it away.

670
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,150
Smash it first.

671
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,270
I'll take it out later.

672
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,190
Cheers.

673
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,430
The monk's here.

674
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:40,830
Please, your venerable.

675
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:49,030
So, the thing I gave you didn't work?

676
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,030
I'll give you a bigger one.

677
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,510
Come here, Joe.

678
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:56,900
That's fine, your venerable.

679
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,750
I don't think I have to use it anymore.

680
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,750
I'm just here to make merit
and pour water of dedication to someone.

681
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,510
Alright. Come here.

682
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,670
Here.

683
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,310

Tawan.

00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,810
♫ It's you ♫

♫ It's because of you ♫

00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:59,320
♫ Even if we face a world without stars ♫

♫ But we both will overcome that ♫

♫ No matter how long ♫

♫ Embrace me, there's just the two of us for tonight ♫

00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,450
♫ Why don't you stay ♫

or are you scared of something else?
