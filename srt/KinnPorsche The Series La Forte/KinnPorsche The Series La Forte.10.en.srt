We agree that you have our protection

5
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:21,030
in exchange of all evidences pointing to the crimes
of the ones behind the Italians.

6
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,990
Tomorrow, Porsche and I will go get it.

7
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,430
No.

8
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,910
Only you and I, the two of us.

9
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,150
I told you Porsche couldn't be trusted.

10
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,150
Lock him up.

11
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,070
I knew that you'd trus-

12
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,060
Run away with me, Porsche.

13
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,830
Right now,

14
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,140
everything is going according to Tawan's plan.

15
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,910
He's about to break the two families apart

16
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,910
by using me and you as his tools.

17
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,130
And how can I know

18
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,759
that you're telling the truth, Vegas?

19
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,430
No matter how bad I am,

20
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,750
if it's for the person I love,

21
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,780
I will never hurt his feelings.

22
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,990
If I run, I'll become a traitor.

23
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,070
But if you don't run,

24
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,070
you gotta be here,

25
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,410
and you can't do a thing.

26
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,630
Porsche, you choose.

27
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,950
Stop it!

28
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,630
Don't make this hard on me.

29
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,350
Go, Vegas!

30
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,270
Porsche.

31
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,590
You have to trust me.

32
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,870
Why are you pretending to be asleep?

33
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,950
Well,

34
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,550
I'm scared

35
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,180
that if I look at you,

36
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,390
I'll cry.

37
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,870
Why's that?

38
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,460
I...

39
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,860
I've always felt

40
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,870
that I'm an unlucky person.

41
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,140
But today,

42
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,540
I've realized

43
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,700
that all the lucks I have

44
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,350
are for being here with you.

45
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,550
Kim.

46
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,890
I love you.

47
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,870
Do you love me?

48
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,830
I...

49
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,710
I'm hungry.

50
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,550
Let's find something to eat.

51
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,280
Mmm, okay.

52
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,150
Then,

53
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,800
I'll...

54
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,580
I'll make you some fried eggs.

55
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,990
Here.

56
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,540
It's a smiley face.

57
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,990
Where are his eyes?

58
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,270
Oh.

59
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,270
I'll be right back.

60
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,390
[Gotta go, sorry]

61
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,750
Help me!

62
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,470
Help!

63
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,860
Help me, Kim, help me!

64
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,920
Kim!

65
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,710
Chay!

66
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,990
What have we got?

67
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,190
Umm, it seems encrypted, Mr. Kinn.

68
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,750
If anyone's trying to get in,
it'll be locked automatically.

69
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,060
I'm try--

70
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,340
I'm trying to fix it.

71
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,990
I think it's locked if
there's access from other devices

72
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,990
that don't have the correct IP.

73
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,030
Or maybe it's nothing at all.

74
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,030
The encryption is to stall the time.

75
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,750
If you have so much time trying to prove me wrong,

76
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,660
don't you think it'd be better to go after the escapee?

77
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,980
Tawan.

78
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,430
Go back to your room.

79
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,630
Mr. Kinn.

80
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,990
Mr. Kinn, do you still trust Porsche?

81
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,900
You think that there's a mole here for Vegas, right?

82
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,810
I believe there are some clues in Vegas' secret room.

83
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,190
Last time, you went in by the system.

84
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,240
But this time, you're gonna go undercover.

85
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,190
What if you get caught, what are you going to do?

86
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,350
I may get tortured.

87
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,270
They may get me to talk.

88
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,440
And once I have no more use, they'll kill me.

89
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,030
So you want me to send you to die?

90
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,590
I must go because I trust Porsche.

91
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,080
So what should we do?

92
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,000
Right now, the main family is hunting us.

93
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,820
We need to find the evidence to prove our innocence.

94
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,000
Before we do that,

95
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,380
can we go get my brother first?

96
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,500
Yeah.

97
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,070
Tomorrow, we're gonna go get Porchay.

98
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,230
Kinn.

99
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,950
What happened at the house?

100
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,430
I've missed you.

101
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,430
See you around.

102
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,470
Excuse me.

103
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,030
Could you help me with this?

104
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,110
Thank you.

105
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,110
I'm coming in.

106
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,020
Hey.

107
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,190
Let me check that first.

108
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,870
You may go.

109
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,990
What the heck is this?

110
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,110
It's alright. It's Mr. Vegas'.

111
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,370
Okay.

112
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,030
We'll take it from here.

113
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,750
Er, sir.

114
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,510
May I use the toilet, please?

115
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,280
I can't hold it anymore.

116
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,390
Go, hurry.

117
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,390
Thank you so much.

118
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,150
Shoot, what the frick?

119
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,750
Arm, you're so awesome.

120
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,590
Porchay.

121
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,590
Porchay.

122
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,870
Porchay.

123
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,750
Chay.

124
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,550
Porchay.

125
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,390
He's not home.

126
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,180
[At the warehouse near Nuea Napa Pier, 4 p.m. Come alone]

127
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,950
Darn.

128
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,750
This must be freaking Tawan's doing.

129
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,130
If you wanna help Porchay,

130
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,600
we must go find the evidence.

131
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,070
I got an information about Tawan,

132
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,850
that he worked with the Yakuzas.

133
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,230
If we go there,

134
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,510
we will find the evidence that they're in contact.

135
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,030
But--

136
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,150
We won't fricking find anything.

137
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,230
I'll find my brother.

138
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,910
And if they've done anything to Porchay,

139
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,910
I'll freking kill each and every one of them.

140
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,000
We're in, Mr. Kinn.

141
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,410
But there's nothing left.

142
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,990
The thumbdrive itself is the virus.

143
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,990
It destroys every of our CCTV.

144
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,310
Urgent, Tawan has run away.

145
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,310
Mr. Kinn, Tawan's escaped.

146
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,270
Capture him.

147
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,990
Chay.

148
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,750
Porchay.

149
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,510
Porchay.

150

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,070
Porchay.

152
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,390
Chay.

Porchay.

154
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,050
What the heck did you do to my brother?

155
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,780
This world is cruel,

156
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,270
don't you think?

157
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,150
Hey.

158
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,590
Hey, what the heck are you doing?

159
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,770
Tawan, you jerk!

160
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,750
Hey.

161
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,110
What the heck are you doing?

162
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,550
Darn you.

163
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,550
You're a dead man if I can untie this.

164
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,480
Are you angry?

165
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,880
You're angry, right?

166
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,870
You really love you brother, don't you?

167
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,410
- You love him. huh?
- Hey!

168
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,550
Do you love him so much?

169
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,710
- There. There.
- Hey!

170
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,390
- Jerk!
- You love him so much, don't you?

171
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,220
Porsche.

172
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,670
Make sure you're free first
before having that smartmouth.

173
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,200
You think I'm here alone?

174
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,050
Mr. Kinn, I've got it.

175
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,430
It's the emails with all information sent to them.

176
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,770
There's work schedule

177
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,040
and important documents.

178
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,640
Is it Tawan?

179
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
I'm having Arm dig into it now.

180
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,980
But I think there's more than one person.

181
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,450
It maybe Mr. Tawan and one of our bodyguards.

182
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,980
Right now, Tawan is missing.

183
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,830
I think he must be going to see Vegas.

184
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,310
Find his whereabouts.

185
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,950
Roger that, sir. I'll have Arm
locate Vegas from his cell phone.

186
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,310
And once I get it,

187
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,910
I'll send it to you as soon as I can.

188
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,690
Okay.

189
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,700
I'll be the one putting an end to this show.

190
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,220
So it's you.

191
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,300
What the heck are you doing?

192
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,770
What did I do wrong?

193
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,760
I'm helping you, Vegas.

194
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,860
I was with the main family for a long time
and didn't get anything.

195
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,170
So this is what I gotta do.

196
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,630
A guy like Kinn, he keeps his information safe
with his important one.

197
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,900
Or do you care about him, Vegas?

198
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,070
No.

199
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,470
No, no, no.

200
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,160
But this wasn't the fricking plan.

201
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,560
What the heck is going on, Vegas?

202
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,240
He's your cousin.

203
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,460
How could you do this to your families?

204
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,070
Whose family?

205
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,070
What family?

206
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,390
The main family?

207
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,390
That filthy family.

208
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,960
I don't take them as my family.

209
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,950
You're such a jerk.

210
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,670
You've just realized that?

211
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,350
I've been exchanging the information with
the Yakuzas and the Italians for a long time.

212
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,110
But when Don died,

213
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,570
the Yakuzas threatened to blackmail me.

214
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,750
And send this information to the main family.

215
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,750
But I don't get a fricking thing back.

216
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,110
All because of your dumbass.

217
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,930
I'm sorry.

218
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:18,970
I'm sorry.

219
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,150
Kinn will never let you guys go.

220
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,620
What if the story goes this way,

221
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,270
"Actually,

222
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,150
the bodyguard that he trusts most,

223
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,740
has been sending the information to the Yakuzas.

224
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,110
And when he gets caught,

225
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,980
he kidnaps Kinn's ex,

226
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,750
in order to blame him
and then runs away to hide with his brother.",

227
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,490
Kinn will suddenly look like a fool.

228
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,790
And no one is going to respect him.

229
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,510
But luckily,

230
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,950
I know of the plan,

231
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,300
so I help my cousin catch the traitor.

232
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,180
Kinn is not that stupid to believe you.

233
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,430
You dumb.

234
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,830
And...

235
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,440
what if there's a fake evidence?

236
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,700
Porsche's been in contact with them,

237
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,820
and that evidence is dropped in the crime scene.

238
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,250
Even he doesn't want to believe it,

239
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,570
he can't do anything about it.

240
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,450
What do you fricking get from killing me?

241
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,240
What do I get?

242
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,990
Kinn's got his heartbroken again.

243
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,550
Because he gets fooled again
by the ones he trusts most.

244
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,910
The main family will get weaker and weaker.

245
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,600
Because they got a stupid leader.

246
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,070
Unskilled.

247
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,660
And that's all it takes for us
to be together, right, Vegas?

248
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,570
Mr. Vegas,

249
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,430
the main family is heading here.

250
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,430
God darn it!

251
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,870
Vegas.

252
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,870
Let's run.

253
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,340
Thanks for putting up with me.

254
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,230
Now, go rest.

255
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,190
I got here first.

256
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,710
Mr. Kinn is on his way.

257
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,690
Thanks so much, man.

258
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,910
You, come with me.

259
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,510
Darn you!

260
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,950
Get Porchay outta here.

261
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,030
Go!

262
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,950
The main family didn't get you a bulletproof vest?

263
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,070
Porsche.

264
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,110
Porsche.

265
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,230
Porsche.

266
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,430
Big.

267
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,870
Mr. Kinn loves you so much.

268
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,750
Please take care of him.

269
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,750
Darn you, Tawan!

270
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,140
Big!

271
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,240
You--

272
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,270
Big!

273
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,630
Hey!

274
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,390
Drop the gun.

275
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,030
And I'll let you live.

276
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,430
Kinn.

277
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,150
Porsche is the one who betrayed you.

278
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,190
I've known about your plan long ago.

279
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,230
Big.

280
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,630
Porsche, are you alright?

281
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,160
I survived once.

282
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,630
Are you really going to kill me again, Kinn?

283
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,850
Please give me one last chance, Kinn.

284
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,760
I love you, Kinn.

285
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,500
Stop pretending.

286
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,050
You never loved me.

287
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,980
Stop bullcrapping.

288
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,490
You said you loved Vegas earlier.

289
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,490
Now that you're useless, he abandoned you.

290
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,270
Stop being so stupid.

291
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:20,980
No!

292
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,590
He didn't leave me.

293
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,590
He's waiting for me.

294
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,470
He just used you.

295
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,690
A selfish guy like you,

296
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,830
who would want to be with?

297
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,790
Vegas!

298
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,420
It's Vegas!

299
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,340
Vegas said he loved me.

300
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,990
Vegas said he'd marry me.

301
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,520
Vegas!

302
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,070
Where is Vegas? Help me, Vegas.

303
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,930
You said we'd be together forever.

304
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,030
Vegas!

305
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,150
Vegas.

306
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,030
Stay with me like this forever.

307
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,610
Of course.

308
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,590
But you gotta help me.

309
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,070
Do you really want me to do that?

310
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,760
Trust me.

311
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,200
After all this, I'll become the leader.

312
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:38,590
More importantly, Papa will accept us.

313
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,350
Vegas.

314
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,550
I love you, Tawan.

315
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,550
Marry me.

316
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,990
I love you, Vegas.

317
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,190
Kinn.

318
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,060
I'm sorry.

319
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,380
But if I can't be happy,

320
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,659
no one will ever be happy too.

321
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,310
Run!

322
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,360
Are you okay?

323
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,830
I'm okay.

324
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,850
Are you?

325
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,970
I'm okay.

326
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,390
Everything is under control, Mr. Kinn.

327
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,600
But Big...

328
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,700
Just take care of what needs to be done.

329
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,710
It wouldn't have been like this,

330
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,920
if you guys had had a better boss.

331
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,070
Where is Kim?

332
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,310
Mr. Kim is safe. He left.

333
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,030
Chay, can you hear me?

334
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,880
I'm sorry.

335
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,430
Do you know what you're doing?

336
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,710
You lied to me.

337
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,710
I'm sorry.

338
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,280
I don't like myself being this.

339
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,830
I put you in danger.

340
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,050
What if something were to happen to you,
I wouldn't forgive myself.

341
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
Sorry.

342
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,630
But that something didn't happen,
and look at how you feel now.

343
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:00,140
And how about me? How would I feel?

344
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,550
Chay.

345
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,630
Chay.

346
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,790
Porchay.

347
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:21,990
Give him time.

348
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,600
What about Vegas?

349
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,820
He must have crossed the border by now.

350
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,230
This country, any jerk with money
could run off easily.

351
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,350
But someone must be responsible for this.

352
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,280
Can I ask you something?

353
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,590
Was it true about what you said?

354
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,280
Said what?

355
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,890
That you knew everything from the start.

356
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:21,190
I knew from the start that
Tawan was working for Vegas.

357
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:28,310
And Pete, found the evidence
that they both had been in contact.

358
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,860
I was there to tell you.

359
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,990
But you fricking ran first.

360
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,990
Hey.

361
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:49,850
Two brothers, same personality.

362
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:28,270
My plan is all ruined because of you.

363
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,150
So, you think

364
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,690
how a guy like you should be punished?

365
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,240
You're laughing?

366
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,430
Oh, you're still smiling?

367
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,110
One more time?

368
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,990
I'm sorry.

369
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,550
Mr. Kan.

370
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,400
What the heck are you and Vegas doing?

371
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,870
I'm being honest, sir.

372
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,580
Mr. Kan, I apologize.

373
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,630
Didn't I tell you

374
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,990
not to do what's not my order?

375
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,990
I'm sorry.

376
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,530
No, no, no, n--

377
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,870
You two, go clean up the mess Vegas did.

378
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,140
Where is Vegas?

379
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,470
He ran away, so I had to come here instead.

380
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,240
I brought you something.

381
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,510
Open it.

382
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,120
What?

383
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,520
Your guy who betrayed us.

384
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,550
Us?

385
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,070
Which us?

386
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,860
How could you say that?

387
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,190
This was him betraying the main family.

388
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,190
And worked for Vegas, ain't it?

389
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,000
You've misunderstood.

390
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,630
I saw him taking both of our families' information

391
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,430
to sell to other gangs.

392
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,920
I think Vegas was just trying to lure him.

393
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,020
So he could expose him.

394
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,040
Expose?

395
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,320
If he's that good of a person, why would he run away?

396
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,470
He had to run to settle first.

397
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,550
Ran from the ones who don't listen to reasoning.

398
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,550
And only want to punish.

399
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,310
Here's some evidence.

400
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,700
But someone must be responsible for this.

401
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,590
If you think that the minor family is the traitors,

402
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,510
you can take my life.

403
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,070
Are you going to shoot him yourself?

404
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,270
Or are you going to let me?

405
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,730
Our Papa used to say that

406
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,260
true victory comes from not taking advantage
from the ones who are weaker.

407
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,070
Thank you, brother.

408
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,700
But you must bring Vegas here to talk to me.

409
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,780
Yes, I will.

410
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,990
You know,

411
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:38,720
I never take advantages.

412
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,230
Why did you call me?

413
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,920
I noticed that we were kinda busy.

414
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,190
But now everything seems to be settled now.

415
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,530
I think it's about time you apologize.

416
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,660
Huh?

417
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,780
Apologizing to you?

418
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,100
I think you're the one who needs to apologize.

419
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,350
Why do I have to apologize?

420
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,830
Which one should I go first?

421
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,670
You, bringing your ex into the house?

422
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:50,280
Or you, locking me up?

423
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,970
Locking you up less than a day
and you ran off with a guy?

424
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,200
Do you think I'm that easy?

425
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,870
Well, you don't seem to be so difficult.

426
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,010
Is that what's coming out of your mouth?

427
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,180
If you knew the plan from the start,
why didn't you tell me?

428
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:15,010
The plan was about to succeed,

429
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,800
if you didn't run off with Vegas.

430
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:20,800
He fooled me.

431
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,940
And did you let him fool you?

432
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,060
You're doing it again, jerk.

433
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,800
You never trust me.

434
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,630
So are we good now?

435
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,850
If you wanna know,

436
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,860
you gotta try...

437
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,940
Darn you!

438
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,830
That's disgusting, darn!

439
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:12,150
Now, we're good.

440
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,870
What are you so moody about?

441
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:15,790
Or do you want another one?

442
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:16,950
Huh? Huh? Huh?

443
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:17,750
Do you want another one?

444
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,200
Huh? Huh? Huh?

445
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,030
You want more? Huh?

446
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,150
Yeah, smile. That makes you so cute.

447
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,230
It's been tough lately.

448
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,330
Porchay wants me to resign.

449
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,610
And if I don't,

450
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,040
he'll cut me off.

451
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,980
Yeah.

452
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,520
I'm stressed too.

453
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,220
It's like I've forgotten something.

454
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,850
But I can't think of what I've forgotten.

455
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:17,110
If you can think of it, would it be called "forgotten"?

456
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,680
Smile.

457
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,820
Oh, you're growling.

458
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,710
Don't fart again now.

459
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:30,470
Okay.

460
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:31,950

The main family has put you on the blacklist.

475
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,460
They'll send in some guys to check.

476
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,750
Clean this mess up.

477
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,440
Your grandma must really love you.

478
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,580
What the heck are you doing?

479
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,360
I'm gonna hurt you so you'll remember.

480
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,990
Are you happy now?

481
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,170
No.

482
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,770
I've just started.
