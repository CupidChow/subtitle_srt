4
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,400
When you're at war,

5
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,680
you must see things in a bigger picture.

6
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,610
Don't let just one piece confuse us,

7
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,010
and cost us every piece on the board.

8
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,490
Like what happened before.

9
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,420
Can I ask to change whom I'll be taking care of?

10
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,530
Why are you here?

11
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,330
I'm freaking taking you home.

12
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,260
Are you here alone?

13
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,910
Boss, Mr. Kinn's GPS is moving out of Bangkok.

14
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,910
Take the best men out there as soon as possible.

15
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,590
Mr. Kinn!

16
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,729
Mr. Kinn!

17
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,770
- Mr. Kinn!
- Mr. Kinn!

18
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,410
Mr. Kinn.

19
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,020
Mr. Kinn!

20
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,610
Charn.

21
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,680
I've tracked Mr. Kinn's GPS from his phone,

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,440
to where the truck was.

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,900
But there's no sign of any of them.

24
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,370
From now on, we're executing
a non-stop search until they're found,

25
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,890
no matter in what condition they're in.

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,920
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,829
It's because of me.

28
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,120
I couldn't help Mr. Kinn.

29
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,850
Stop being distracted.

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,300
And back to your duty.

31
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,320
Mr. Kinn is going to be alright.

32
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,950
Mr. Kinn!

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,720
Mr. Kinn.

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,579
Mr. Kinn, sir!

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,680
Mr. Kinn.

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,470
What the fudge? Where are you going, huh?

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,710
I don't believe you anymore. Where are you going?

38
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,070
This way.

39
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,100
I'll go this way.

40
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,980
This way.

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,100
No, this way.

42
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,650
I'm your boss.

43
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,890
Why, are you gonna have your people hurt me?

44
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,780
Hey, Big. Hey, Ken!

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,710
Oh.

46
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,930
I didn't think so.

47
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,360
Don't act so tough, man.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,400
Fudge!

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,300
You don't know a darn thing.

50
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,280
And what are you gonna do?

51
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,610
Then I'll use the bodyguard's rule to decide.

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,480
Rock, paper, scissors!

53
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,120
This way.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,130
Hey.

55
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,600
You didn't mention how many times.

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,860
best out if five!

57
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,070
What? This is stupid.

58
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,980
You think you might lose?

59
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,680
Well, c'mon then.

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,760
C'mon.

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,410
You, come on.

62
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,810
Come on if you think you're so good.

63
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,200
Rock, paper, scissors!

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,340
Loser.

65
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,290
Rock, paper, scissors!

66
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,570
Ha! Darn you, thought you'd do better.

67
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,870
Rock, paper, scissors!

68
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,750
Yes, 2-2 now.

69
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,420
You think you can do it? C'mon now.

70
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,920
Rock, paper, scissors!

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,839
Yeah! Darn you!

72
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,690
Come on, man.

73
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,399
That's it. We're done.

74
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,150
We're going this way.

75
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,610
What?

76
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,140
We've walked for so long,
and you got us back to where we were.

77
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,090
I totally agree with the phrase,
"Stupid leaders will doom us all." now.

78
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,930
If you think you can do better, why don't you lead?

79
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,380
Oh, absolutely.

80
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,830
Thought you wouldn't ask.

81
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,810
Acting all so tough.

82
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,810
You, follow me.

83
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,180
Follow me now.

84
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,360
I think I hear water running.

85
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,890
What water?

86
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,020
Trust me.

87
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,220
What?

88
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,950
Come here.

89
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,090
Hey, come here.

90
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,050
Hey, c'mon, this way.

91
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,100
Just follow me, okay?

92
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,420
Where the freak is water?

93
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,160
This is exactly the same spot.

94
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,240
Well, I heard water.

95
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,100
Trust me.

96
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,860
Let's walk this way.

97
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,860
Take a look, man.

98
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
- This way.
- Whoa!

99
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,950
We survived from the bullets.

100
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,340
But we're gonna die from dehydration.

101
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,740
And that's on you.

102
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,310
If you're not happy, go other way.

103
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,450
Don't follow me.

104
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,000
You think I love being stuck with you now, huh?

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,040
If it hadn't been for you,
I would've been outta here long time ago.

106
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,240
Then break it.

107
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,610
So we can go our own ways.

108
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,770
Smash it then!

109
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,490
Yeah.

110
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,380
- Smash it now.
- C'mon.

111
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,860
- Come on now.
 Do it!

112
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,700
Smash it.

113
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,300
Right, you asked for it.

114
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,220
- Go on.
- Put your hand over here.

115
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,360
- Harder.
- I'm doing it.

116
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,280
- Shoot, this won't do.
- I told you.

117
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,530
It wasn't gonna break, you stupid.

118
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,620
Whatever.

119
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,409
If you're such a Mr. Know-It-All, when they attacked us,
why didn't you say a darn thing?

120
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,950
So it's my fault?

121
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,070
Wasn't it because of you
who ran home in the first place?

122
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,110
Then why did you follow me?

123
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,520
If you didn't follow me, they wouldn't come.

124
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,810
Don't be a jerk.

125
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,720
Why can't I be a jerk?

126
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,000
My life's been a disaster since I met you.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,650
"Your life is mine"

128
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,330
Darn you!

129
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,290
You should be able to survive on your own now, moron.

130
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,170
Jerk.

131
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,690
- What, huh?
- What, what?

132
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,760
Did you just--

133
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
- Shoot!
 - Ah!

134
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,710
Hey!

135
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,650
Water!

136
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,770
I've told you there's water.

137
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,070
I've told you I hear water running.

138
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,030
Hey, hey, hey!

139
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,660
Take my hand, take my hand.

140
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,070
Let me lead.

141
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,070
- I'm the one who found this.
- Mm.

142
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
I told you I heard water.

143
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,610
We're not gonna die!

144
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,240
I'm not gonna die here!

145
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,330
Yeah.

146
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,990
Darn. If only you'd believed me from the start.

147
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,600
Well, it's a fluke, of course.

148
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,820
Shoot, this is freezing.

149
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,350
Do you even know where you're going?

150
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,670
Just keep on walking. Don't complain.

151
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,570
Shoot, don't swing your arm too much.

152
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,880
Hey! A truck!

153
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Man!

154
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,840
Whoa, see if the engine still works.

155
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,810
Man, how could it work? It's old.

156
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,870
At least, we got a place to sleep.

157
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,910
Darn!

158
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,480
You, get up.

159
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,690
Up. up up.

160
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,690
Up!

161
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,210
Go up!

162
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,520
I am coming up!

163
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,130
C'mon.

164
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,250
- Hey, there's a blanket.
- Let me see.

165
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Hey, you come here.

166
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,130
C'mon, take a look.

167
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,390
You're alright?

168
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,330
Darn.

169
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,830
Do you really know how to do it?

170
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,140
One sec.

171
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,560
Fire and I are belong together.

172
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,890
Polite but hot.

173
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,860
Have you heard of it?

174
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,480
My slogan.

175
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,680
Just a little bit longer.

176
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,220
Jeez!

177
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,970
Yes, sir.

178
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,730
Please make it burning hot.

179
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,010
Hey, put your leg away.

180
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,010
You might get burned.

181
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm looking forward to a standing ovation.

182
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,410
Forgetp it. I'm not gonna do it anymore.

183
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,690
What?

184
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,170
We can sleep in the dark like this.

185
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,930
I love sleeping in the dark.

186
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
Alright.

187
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,300
So we both might be eaten by a somewhat animal.

188
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,560
So what are you gonna do?

189
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,680
What!

190
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,880
Why didn't you say you got a lighter?

191
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,980
Well, I'd like for Mr. Kinn to show off his talent.

192
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,980
I didn't want to interrupt.

193
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,240
I was waiting to see Mr. Kinn's hotness.
I wanted to see how it'd be like.

194
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,980
"Put your leg away"

195
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,660
Hey, Mr. Kinn.

196
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,370
Move a bit. Move, move.

197
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,170
Move a bit more.

198
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,780
The fire might burn your legs.

199
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Shoot.

200
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Moron!

201
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,470
- Darn you.
- Oh.

202
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,750
If you don't have a gun, you can
just stick your finger into my eyes.

203
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,140
Instead of mocking me, why don't you stay up and keep watch?

204
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140
Jeez.

205
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,730
You're such a burden.

206
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,270
I heard that.

207
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,280
Mr. Kinn.

208
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,280
Mr. Kinn!

209
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,220
Yes, sir.

210
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,450
You don't have to worry.

211
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,840
I've ordered every team to search.

212
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,650
We'll find him in no time.

213
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,160
And about that,

214
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,320
I have Pete stationed there to see if something's up.

215
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,320
If something goes wrong,
I will inform you immediately.

216
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,850
Yes, sir.

217
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,650
Found him?

218
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,130
Not yet, sir.

219
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,130
Split up and search.

220
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,940
Mr. Kinn.

221
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,410
When is Vegas coming?

222
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,710
Hey, Pol.

223
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,760
Vegas's bodyguard or me,
who do you think would do a better job?

224
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,350
I think it'd be me definitely.

225
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,760
Don't you think, Pol?

226
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,990
Hey!

227
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,080
The thing is, do you think they know that we know?

228
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,790
What the fudge are you doing?

229
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,880
Vegas is gone.

230
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,460
Huh? Mr. Vegas?

231
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,560
Where to?

232
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,640
Where did he go?

233
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,800
I don't know. You were sleeping.

234
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,210
I don't know where he went now.

235
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,100
- Where?
- Let's follow him.

236
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,560
Did you see him?

237
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,310
Oh!

238
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,340
Hello, Mr. Vegas.

239
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,630
What a coincidence.

240
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,430
Here. I see you've been on a lookout for so while.

241
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,490
I'm afraid you might get hungry.

242
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,990
Thank you.

243
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,800
Hey.

244
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,200
Bread!

245
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I'm so hungry.

246
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Mosquito repellent?

247
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,880
What?

248
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,360
Let me see.

249
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,930
A condom!

250
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,720
Why did you have to scream so loud?

251
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,680
Sorry.

252
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,240
That one, I bought it for myself.

253
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,250
Or would you like to share?

254
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,250
That's alright, Mr. Vegas.

255
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,230
Please go on.

256
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,610
Take care.

257
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,280
Why are you taking me here?

258
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,780
To catch a fish.

259
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Catch a fish?

260
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,170
Why are you playing with a stick?

261
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,680
Everyone does this, don't they?

262
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,700
If I catch one, don't ask for a bite.

263
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,110
What are you eating?

264
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't know, some kind of fruit.

265
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,120
I found it near the place we slept last night.

266
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,730
How do you know that it's edible.

267
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,860
What if it's poisonous?

268
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,870
Ah!

269
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,320
Hey, Porsche. Porsche, Porsche.

270
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,980
Spit it out--

271
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,370
It's edible. Trust me.

272
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,260
I hope you choke on it.

273
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,810
Awww, c'mon.

274
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,329
Awww, don't be mad.

275
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,170
Bite me, leave me alone.

276
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,599
How's this?

277
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,040
I'll teach you how to catch a fish.

278
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,440
Wait.

279
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,250
First thing first.

280
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,510
You need to sharpen this
stupid stick therefore it will work.

281
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,810
Have you got any fish yet?

282
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,270
Here.

283
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,630
Hey.

284
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,990
Why didn't you tell me you got a knife?

285
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,270
Well, I just realized.

286
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,110
Found it in the truck where we slept last night.

287
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,870
Give me that.

288
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,150
I'll do it for you.

289
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,960
Hold it.

290
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,370
Be still.

291
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Like this.

292
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
And twist.

293
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,740
Holy crap, so attentive.

294
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,200
See? When the tip is sharp, it's useable.

295
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,940
Okay?

296
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,670
And when you want to stab a fish in water,

297
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,420
see, you look into water, and remember that
the sight ain't the same as on land.

298
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,500
Mmm.

299
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,250
If you wanna stab, let's say, a fish.

300
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,670
You need to stab above of it.

301
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,270
Because the sight is distorted.

302
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,990
Mmm.

303
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,110
Aha.

304
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,600
And now, look here.

305
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,400
You aim.

306
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,130
See?

307
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,090
This one.

308
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,490
Yeah.

309
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,190
See that? It's coming.

310
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,060
Hold the stick.

311
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,540
Yes.

312
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,160
Not too close but not too far, at the right weight.

313
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,940
You aim and focus.

314
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,100
Then stab, gotcha!

315
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,570
There you go!

316
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,100
Why does it look so simple?

317
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,890
Just do as I told you.

318
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,420
Can I try?

319
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,830
Of course.

320
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,630
Not too far.

321
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,090
Here, okay?

322
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,910
So you'll get the right weight.

323
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,930
Hold it tightly. See?

324
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,640
The sight is distorted, remember.

325
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,640
Stab above to fish. Hold it tightly.
Aim. Above the fish.

326
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,760
Darn, this is crazy.

327
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,490
Shoot.

328
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,640
Can I do more? More, more, more!

329
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,330
Go on.

330
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,570
Help me get the fish off.

331
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,610
You quite have a talent.

332
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,900
Quick learner, you are.

333
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
So kind.

334
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,620
What are you looking at?

335
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,760
Why do you keep your smiles to yourself?

336
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,640
I barely see you smile.

337
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,130
Of course, I smile.

338
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,580
I thought I'd starve to death.

339
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,110
I mean,

340
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,570
since you've been here, you don't stop smiling.

341
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,680
I guess you don't have to act
all serious in front of your people, huh?

342
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,530
Hmph.

343
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,390
So that's why you've been
a full jerk to me all this time.

344
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,370
No need to respect anymore, right?

345
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,750
Oh.

346
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,950
That's my personality.

347
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,910
You moron.

348
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,190
No, you moron, man.

349
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,190
Darn.

350
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,970
It's freezing.

351
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,410
Try again.

352
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
This is so refreshing.

353
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,070
So freezing cold here.

354
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:41,040
Ohhhhhhh.

355
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,440
Are you cold?

356
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Look at my hand.

357
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
A hug?

358
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,170
It's been a while. Let's go up.

359
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,400
What the freak are you laughing at?

360
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,070
You don't have one?

361
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,650
I do.

362
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,290
Just not so small like that.

363
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,900
Hey, what's that?

364
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,630
Would you point the light there?

365
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,760
- Fudge!
- Oh, boy!

366
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,860
Oh, my God.

367
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,160
What are you looking at?

368
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,780
It's just a skull of a lost man in the woods.

369
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,690
Would you stop mentioning that?

370
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,020
It's probably nothing.

371
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,890
I'm trying to forget what I saw!

372
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,180
And you!

373
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,460
I've just realized that
you can be afraid of something.

374
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,960
Is there anything else I don't know about you?

375
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,040
What could it be?

376
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,350
You've been digging into my bio,

377
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,920
Porsche Pachara Kittisuwan, 23 years old.

378
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,530
Darn, so detailed.

379
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,020
I'm not that free, you know.

380
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,120
Like...

381
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,980
What's your dream job?

382
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
I never knew that.

383
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Nosy.

384
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,090
Well, you couldn't sleep.

385
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:23,930
Forget it.

386
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,480
I'm just trying to make a convo here.

387
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,810
Nevermind.

388
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,570
I want to open a little bar by the beach.

389
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,610
It'd be nicer if it were a private beach.

390
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,120
I can just open whenever I wake up.

391
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,840
I close it if I get too drunk.

392
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,490
And most importantly,

393
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,910
I will sell only the dish I wanna eat that day.

394
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:59,380
Like, when I wake up and feel like eating something,
it will be the menu of the day.

395
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,520
That is so you.

396
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,780
And how about you?

397
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,310
What's your dream?

398
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,110
Me?

399
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,650
Well,

400
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,330
want to make my family bigger.

401
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,090
That's insane.

402
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,090
I don't believe you.

403
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,280
No kids would ever want to
dream of making the family bigger.

404
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,290
Hey.

405
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,800
Are you a middle child?

406
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,650
Right?

407
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,770
You're the middle one?

408
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,570
Look at me, man.

409
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,850
I believe that before Tankhun became crazy,

410
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,300
you had a dream.

411
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,100
Hey, look into my eyes.

412
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,620
You're avoiding me.

413
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,460
I told you my story.

414
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,160
If you don't tell me yours, it's not fair.

415
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,100
Promise me.

416
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,910
That you won't laugh.

417
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,410
Why would I laugh about your dream?

418
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
I...

419
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,990
I wanted to be a singer.

420
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,750
I didn't think that was on your list.

421
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,100
What about it?

422
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,500
When I was a kid, I...

423
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,910
I watched a singing competition on TV.

424
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,510
It seemed like fun.

425
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,110
I wanted to give it a try.

426
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,540
I did it once.

427
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,560
And I quit.

428
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
So you lost.

429
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,820
No, I won.

430
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,810
There were more talented people than me.

431
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,330
I think Papa gave them big money.

432
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,140
No, you might be really good at it.

433
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,590
Let's do this.

434
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,220
What song did you sing then? Sing it to me.

435
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Mmm, no.

436
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,160
Hey.

437
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,690
I promise I won't even smile this time.

438
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,100
Okay?

439
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,200
No.

440
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,190
Please.

441
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:26,980
I wanna hear it.

442
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,180
I promise.

443
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,180
Okay?

444
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,810
Alright, whatever.

445
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,320
I'm looking the other way now.

446
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:55,010
♪When the sun is setting♪

447
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,060
♪The birds--

448
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,550
Darn you.

449
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,510
- You jerk.
- Aw.

450
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,780
I tried to hold it in but it's just like...

451
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,540
I just couldn't.

452
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,990
I didn't think that you
were gonna do the oldies like that.

453
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,740
But seriously, you sang beautifully.

454
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,030
Stop it.

455
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,620
If you didn't have to take over from Mr. Korn,

456
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,740
I really would encourage you to compete in The Star.

457
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,180
I want this country to know that

458
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,060
there's Kinn The Star...

459
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,600
who's here to kick Phi Bird's butt.

460
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,660
"Search in the sky, Reach for the star."

461
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,470
Ah, you're a big fan.

462
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,430
Sometimes, I think,

463
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,080
if Khun was just acting crazy,

464
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,670
so he wouldn't have to take over the family's work.

465
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,750
Just by being kidnapped at young age,

466
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,350
could one change this much?

467
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
I think he could.

468
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,530
I experienced that before.

469
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,220
I was sitting with my Mom and Dad in a car accident.

470
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,880
They're killed in a crash from a fast-coming car.

471
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,320
I was in shock. All my memory was gone.

472
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,300
And after that, my uncle
told me everything that had happened.

473
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,510
I was in a hospital for months.

474
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,180
So yeah, I think it's possible.

475
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,790
That may be good for you.

476
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,990
So you only have good memories about them.

477
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,680
Actually,

478
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,250
if I could,

479
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,130
I...

480
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:26,210
I would want to erase the things I did you wrong.

481
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,610
Mmm.

482
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,260
It's alright.

483
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,380
Oh, yeah.

484
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,050
I can feel that we're gonna find a way out today.

485
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,540
You say that everyday.

486
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,070
Mr. Kinn. Mr. Kinn.

487
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,170
What now?

488
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,660
I'm here!

489
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
Mr. Kinn!

490
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
I'm here!

491
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,880
Are you okay?

492
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,350
And you, you're okay, huh?

493
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Okay.

494
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
I'm okay.

495
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,060
Pull me up, would you?

496
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
Easy there.

497
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
I'm alright.

498
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,820
Okay.

499
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,870
You're okay?

500
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
I'm okay.

501
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,639
Come here.

502
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,170
Hey.

503
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,300
Hey, that's enough.

504
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,340
Jeez!

505
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,870
- Really, that's enough.
- Ouch.

506
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,960
Darn it!

507
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,040
Why do we have to be cuffed together like this?

508
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,180
I'm sorry.

509
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,710
But this makes us know each other so much better.

510
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,740
You said we're gonna find a way out today.

511
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
Of course.

512
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,330
But I didn't say if we're gonna get out alive.

513
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,040
You know,

514
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,980
when I heard my people from up there,

515
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,220
the first thought was,
I didn't wanna get out of the woods.

516
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,460
Are you insane?

517
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,010
Are you crazy like Tankhun now? Huh?

518
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,810
I don't know.

519
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,420
Being here, I got nothing on my shoulders.

520
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,230
I don't have to follow the schedule.

521
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,540
It's like I get to be myself once again.

522
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
I like that.

523
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,510
I really like this version of you.

524
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,670
It's cute.

525
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,610
Who would be like you, man?

526
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,460
Everywhere you go, you get on everyone's nerves.

527
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,260
Porsche.

528
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,910
Huh?

529
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,250
I'm sorry.

530
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,580
For what?

531
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,680
About that night.

532
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,780
I'd never crossed the line with any bodyguard before.

533
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,960
I don't know how I should place myself.

534
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,470
I've done so many bad things to you.

535
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,640
If I could turn back time,

536
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,540
I would not do things like that to you.

537
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,460
I don't know how I should place myself too.

538
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,700
Because...

539
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,250
no one has ever crossed that line with me before.

540
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,710
Can you please forgive me?

541
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,510
I've done that a long time ago.

542
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:10,620
Then, from now on, we won't
have any doubts between us anymore.

543
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Mmm.

544
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,620
No doubts.

545
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,870
Yeah.

546
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,300
Kinn.

547
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,670
Huh?

548
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,230
I think I know how to get us outta here.

549
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,110
How?

550
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,710
One of us needs to cut our hand off.

551
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,710
And the other can go up and get help.

552
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,030
And who will make that sacrifice?

553
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,590
You.

554
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,530
You can control your people without a hand.

555
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,220
If I don't have a hand, I can't take care of you.

556
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,420
Jerk.

557
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,140
You're my bodyguard.

558
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,480
Your job is to sacrifice yourself
to your boss, isn't it?

559
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,290
If we can't decide,

560
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,070
we must go by the bodyguard's rule.

561
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,850
Who loses will lose the hand.

562
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,620
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

563
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,350
I didn't want to come up with this.

564
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,630
One strike, okay.

565
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,630
Don't hesitate.

566
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,890
What?

567
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,360
You know how to unlock it and you didn't say anything?

568
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,810
This thing,

569
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,850
every member of my family knows how to do it.

570
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,220
Darn it.

571
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,220
You're such a jerk.

572
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
C'mon.

573
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Let's get outta here.

574
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,220
How?

575
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,270
I'll lead you.

576
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,270
Follow me.

577
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,080
Come on.

578
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,350
Careful.

579
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,070
Let go. Let it go.

580
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:49,910
C'mon.

581
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,790
Finally, we're out!!!

582
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,600
If you knew how to get out in the first place,
why wouldn't you say so?

583
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,670
You're a jerk.

584
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,990
Leave.

585
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,230
Huh?

586
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,970
I'll tell everyone you die in the woods.

587
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,240
So you can go back to your brother.

588
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,460
Get to open a bar.

589
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
Just like you've always dreamed of.

590
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,520
Why?

591
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
I don't know.

592
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,690
Maybe you'd sacrifice a hand for me.

593
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,590
Or maybe because I've crossed your line.

594
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,020
Or I...

595
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,710
I like it when you're happy.

596
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,760
Just leave.

597
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,610
Go now.

598
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,080
Before I change my mind.

599
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,970
Just go!

600
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,070
That's an order!

601
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,090
Darn it!

602
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,180
Mr. Kinn.

603
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm here to help you!

604
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,470
You!

605
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,890
Kinn!

606
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,020
You go undercover in the casino.

607
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,500
And get them all.

608
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,220
It's about time we know who's behind this.

609
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,170
What will we do after that?

610
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,960
About that, I got a plan.

611
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,640
Come work with me.
