5
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,190
There's someone stalking Mr. Kinn lately.

6
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,190
But I'm just not sure if you know him or not.

7
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,070
Well,

8
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,150
it's Tawan, Kinn's deceased ex.

9
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,710
Tawan didn't love me.

10
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,630
He just used me.

11
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,510
So that's why Tawan couldn't be
the jealous ghost that haunts you.

Tawan.

16
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,470
It's been a long time.

17
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,800
Kinn.

18
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,270
Still alive, huh?

19
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,940
Since that day,

20
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,610
the Italians have captured me.

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,160
Well, you were working for the Italians anyhow.

22
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,870
They took my family and threatened me.

23
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,540
I had no choice so I...

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,750
sold the main family's information to them.

25
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,190
I'm sorry I lied to you, Kinn.

26
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,710
But the feelings that I've got
for you are always true.

27
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,430
What do you want?

28
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,430
Kinn, you must help me.

29
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,470
They're gonna kill me.

30
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,100
Because I've got the information
on who's behind the Italians.

31
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,310
But I never had a chance to see you.

32
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,110
Right now, I'm one of the people,

33
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,110
who wants to kill you too.

34
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,350
Lock him up.

35
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,350
We'll talk about this tomorrow morning.

36
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,950
Shoot!

37
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,940
The doctor said,

38
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,950
it's fortunate that Mr. Tawan
didn't get too much poison,

39
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,950
so he'll live.

40
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,060
Someone wants to kill me, Kinn.

41
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,140
I'm scared.

42
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,480
I don't wanna die. I mean it.

43
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,350
They will never let me go.

44
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,790
You must help me, Kinn.

45
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,909
If you help me, I'll...

46
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,830
I'll give you the evidence in exchange. Okay, Kinn?

47
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,360
Okay?

48
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,950
Please trust me again, Kinn.

49
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,910
I really don't know whom to trust except you, Kinn.

50
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,510
Ha! Trust? Only the stupid will.

51
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,310
He's fricking fooled you once.

52
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,230
How could you know that he wouldn't do it again?

53
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,550
I'd say we kill him.

54
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,909
All these times, we have
never got any lead on the traitor.

55
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:41,870
That means, they have
someone powerful backing them up.

56
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,310
Like, the minor family.

57
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,500
And this may be the best chance.

58
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,470
So Papa, you vote we keep him?

59
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,670
Alright, alright, then 1-1.

60
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,630
The rest is up to you, Kinn.

61
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,710
Excuse me.

62
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,070
We're having father-and-sons conversation.

63
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,830
Don't you have manners?

64
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,790
I do, sir.

65
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,990
But I was Mr. Kinn's closest guard
when he and Tawan were dating.

66
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,110
And the one who first suspected him as a traitor,

67
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,110
was me.

68
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,270
Please believe me. This person cannot be trusted.

69
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,190
You're Kinn's new bodyguard, right?

70
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,270
Well,

71
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,630
Poised.

72
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,630
No wonder why Kinn replaced Big with you.

73
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,470
This family, they're all easy to read.

74
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,470
Right now, they must be voting on what to do next.

75
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,590
Tankhun,

76
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,740
is voting to have me killed.

77
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,910
Mr. Korn is looking at the big picture.

78
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,790
He will choose to keep me for further use.

79
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,750
Eventually, it's up to what Kinn's going to choose.

80
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:09,550
No matter what Kinn chooses,
it's probably the best for the family.

81
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,550
Or maybe what's best for

82
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,550
his heart.

83
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,310
We agree that you have our protection

84
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:41,550
in exchange of all evidences pointing to the crimes
of the ones behind the Italians.

♫ If I keep them all, I may get crazy one day ♫

87
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,950

♫ That are bursting out of my heart ♫

89

♫ And make them into a song
that I'd like you to listen ♫

♫ And this song is called 'you' ♫

94

Guys.

95
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,790
Hey.

96
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,750
What?

97
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,750
Come here.

98
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,310
Arm.

99
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,510
Tawan returns.

100
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,070
Speaking of that,

101
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,510
where is he staying now?

102
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,590
In Mr. Kinn's room?

103
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,350
Don't know.

104
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,390
If it were you guys, would you
bring a venomous snake into you room?

105
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,720
Mr. Kinn lets him stay in the guest room.

106
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,680
There's a bodyguard stationed in front of the room.

107
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,940
He must ask for permission
in order to leave the room.

108
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,950
Do you think they both will get back together?

109
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,510
Who?

110
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,100
Well, Mr. Kinn and Mr. Tawan.

111
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,550
Don't know about them being back together.

112
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,140
But our friend will be needing backup.

113
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,990
Who are you talking about again?

114
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,300
Do you have anything in here? Huh?

115
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,130
Porsche.

116
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,510
Haven't you noticed?

117
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,430
Between Porsche and Mr. Kinn, there's something

118
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,430
Even without my glasses,
I can see it from 100 meters away.

119
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,590
- Shoot, you guys are so...
- Something, really?

120
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,390
Yeah. Have I ever missed anything?

121
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,430
I'd say for sure!

122
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,630
My eyes, I give you four eyes.

123
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,330
- Do you think I'll miss that?
- Pete!

124
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,710
Yes, sir!

125
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,910
Excuse me, I have to go, I forgot to turn off the water.

126
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,910
Me too, Mr. Kinn.

127
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,670
Darn you!

128
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,030
I'm sorry, sir.

129
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,070
Sorry for what?

130
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,070
What's wrong with you?

131
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,070
Oh, is there anything, Mr. Kinn?

132
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,070
I have a job for you.

133
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,950
Yes.

134
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,470
I think Vegas knows that Tawan is here.

135
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,390
Keep your eyes on Vegas.

136
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,870
If there's something wrong.

137
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,710
Mr. Kinn, would you like
to give this job to someone else?

138
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,710
Last time I did, it didn't turn out well.

139
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,150
Pete.

140
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,430
You're the person I trust the most.

141
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,750
If there's something wrong,
give me a call as soon as possible.

142
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,470
Don't let me down, understood?

143
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:47,950
Hey!

144
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,310
Come here.

145
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,910
You left me!

146
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,750
- C'mon, man.
- Darn you.

147
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,590
It's all okay now.

148
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,630
- I almost peed my pants.
- C'mon man, you're our head so that's on you.

149
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,230
- So what's the deal?
- Did you get scolded?

150
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,150
Thanks.

151
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,830
Have you eaten?

152
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,070
It's quite busy these days.

153
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,070
I found it in the river.

154
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,070
It broke but I got it fixed.

155
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,710
It still works?

156
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,230
Kinn.

157
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,070
Kinn.

158
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,910
Do you remember this?

159
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,390
Was it in Japan?

160
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,110
Korea.

161
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,790
Wasn't it Japan?

162
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,750
Let's look at the pics if you don't believe me.

163
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,670
Here.

164
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,110
Oh, right, it really was in Korea.

165
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,750
That's Korea.

166
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,070
Do you remember? It was our first time
seeing the autumn colors together.

167
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,270
And we also love locked.

168
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,150
For no reason.

169
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,950
And then you got us lost.

170
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,270
We walked so much. It was exhausting.

171
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,190
No, I didn't.

172
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,550
Yes, you did. Don't argue with me.

173
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,310
No.

174
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,830
Yes, how could you not remember, Kinn?

175
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,670
You got us lost for quite some time.

176
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,510
No.

177
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,550
- Yes.
- Yes!

178
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:10,869
You do have a meeting, don't you, Mr. Kinn?

179
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,950
What meeting?

180
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,670
Think.

181
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:26,869
Just think.

182
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,910
Oh, right, a meeting.

183
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,670
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

184
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,990
A meeting, a meeting, a meeting.

185
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,670
Do your best on your meeting, Kinn.

186
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,910
Tasty as it's always been.

187
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,430
That same old familiar taste.

188
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,270
Just eat it, moron.

189
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,510
Gosh, take a look.

190
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,430
Don't you see?

191
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,310
He's bad.

192
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,910
He's freaking bad.

193
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,510
This is our home, not a brothel.

194
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,270
Take a look.

195
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,870
Eww.

196
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,750
Look at him.

197
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,670
Would a good man do such a thing?

198
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,910
Would a good man keep staring
at a CCTV footage all day and night?

199
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,660
Whoa!

200
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,270
You! You're not clever.

201
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,750
That's why you got fooled.

202
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,750
Watch out, you will be hurt again.

203
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,030
Anyway, before you do anything,
think about your loved ones first.

204
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,470
Eww.

205
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,470
Take a look at that.

206
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,070
This just pisses me off.

207
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,870
Darn it.

208
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,870
Hey, Porsche, hello there.

209
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,200
Hi there.

210
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,590
So, how are things here?

211
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,630
It's okay so far, today.

212
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,990
Oh, lots of customers, today?

213
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,350
Thank you, thank you. Take that, would ya?

214
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,590
Oh, it's you again. You're here again.

215
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,110
With another basket.

216
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,030
So what did you tell him about me this time?

217
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,820
How did he let you out?

218
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,030
I told him that you got your boobies enhanced.

219
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,640
Enhnaced boobs? Aren't they big enough already?

220
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,150
Ah, sad eyes I'm seeing.

221
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,150
So?

222
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,530
I guess, it's about a third wheel, isn't it?

223
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,390
Ah, there you go. What is it?

224
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,310
Well, not yet, Yok.

225
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,670
Keep it down.

226
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,030
So? What is it? Tell me.

227
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,170
Do you think I should make him jealous
by talking to someone else?

228
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,420
No.

229
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,860
People no longer do that.

230
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,500
How many couples have broken because of that?

231
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,710
C'mon, let's do it my way.

232
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:39,750
I assure you, you guys will
break yourselves off. Woohoo!

233
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,390
Don't worry.

234
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,120
Trust me.

235
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,990
C'mon now, any drinks?

236
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,040
Don't be sad.

237
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,790
Come in.

238
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,590
Are you okay?

239
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,190
Not really.

240
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,750
Have you taken any pills?

241
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,480
They're all out.

242
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,790
Pete isn't here tonight.
He's out to watch movies with Tankhun till dawn.

243
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,950
I guess, I'll have to sleep and wait all night.

244
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,990
Then I'll go...

245
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,070
No need.

246
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,310
Lady's secret technique: first move.

247
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:26,350
I'm strong but sometimes I can pretend to be weak.

248
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,420
If you really wanna help me,

249
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,710
just clean my body.

250
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,470
You want that?

251
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,910
Yes.

252
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,910
Then I'll go get a towel...

253
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,270
No need.

254
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,230
I've prepared it all for you.

255
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,350
Then take off you clo...

256
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,510
Lady's secret technique: second move.

257
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,550
Be in charge. Catch the enemy by surprise.

258
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,950
Lift your arm up.

259
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,390
Oh.

260
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,590
Are you okay?

261
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,230
Oh.

262
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,310
Woo.

263
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,440
Kinn.

264
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,750
I'm cold.

265
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,310
Okay, okay, okay.

266
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,070
I'll cover you with a blanket.

267
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,450
I think...

268
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,390
it's warmer here.

269
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,430
You're being weird today.

270
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,210
And do you like it?

271
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,910
Kam-sa-ham-ni-da!

272
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,880
I thought you said you're gonna be
watching the movies until dawn.

273
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,310
Don't wanna waste it.

274
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,750
I watched the series with Mr. Tankhun.
I saw him drinking and I wanted to do it too.

275
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,070
Now, Mr. Tankhun is asleep.

276
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,510
Hey, Porsche.

277
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,540
Why is your leg so long today?

278
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,680
You don't see quite clearly.

279
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,510
I think I'm drunk.

280
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,380
I'd better go to sleep.

281
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,310
Sweet dreams.

282
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,150
Sarang-hae-yo!

283
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,700
A-ri-rang!

284
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,790
So what's next?

285
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,830
I don't know.

286
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,230
But this is exciting too.

287
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,190
You're crazy. I...

288
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,470
Hey!

289
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,430
I'll tell you about the series I watched.

290
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,790
It's so fun.

291
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,510
At the end...

292
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,630
Pete!

293
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,190
Hey!

294
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,670
Pete!

295
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,670
A-jum-ma!

296
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,440
Where is Ken?

297
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,070
He's sleeping.

298
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,390
I don't wanna wake him up.

299
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,390
I couldn't sleep so I had to get some warm milk.

300
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,150
You couldn't sleep too, Porsche?

301
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,520
Porsche, what are you afraid of?

302
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,470
Do you think I would fool Kinn,

303
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,420
or are you afraid of something else?

304
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,910
Tastes good.

305
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,660
Mr. Kinn.

306
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,230
Mr. Vegas went to the casino in the morning.

307
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,190
And then he had lunch.

308
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,350
Right now, he's doing something at the temple.

309
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,990
I'm not so sure.

310
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,670
Alright, be careful. Don't let
them know that we're watching.

311
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,750
Yes, sir.

312
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,230
Hey.

313
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,070
Oh! Hello, Mr. Vegas...

314
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,590
Hello, Mr. Macau, I mean.

315
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,110
Seeing you here.

316
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,950
Don't tell me that Tankhun is here too?

317
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,950
Where? Where's Tankhun?

318
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,070
I don't think so.

319
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,030
I think he's by himself.

320
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,980
Right.

321
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,830
A sinner like Tankhun, wouldn't come to a temple.

322
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,390
It's too hot, right?

323
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,150
Right.

324
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,150
And, what brings your here, Pete?

325
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,190
Oh, it's my day off today so I wanted to make merits here.

326
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,550
Oh.

327
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,430
Hey, that's nice, we're gonna be listening
to a monk's sermon this afternoon.

328
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,030
Pete, please come with me.

329
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,350
I don't know what's got into my bro lately.

330
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,150
He's suddenly into Dharma.

331
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,230
Let's just come along with me.

332
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,630
Er...

333
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,870
- I have an errand to run. I should hurry...
- Hey!

334
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,180
Wait.

335
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,150
You said it's your day off.

336
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,750
Didn't you want to make merits here?

337
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,910
C'mon, please.

338
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,270
Listening to the sermon is great.

339
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,110
Let's go.

340
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,070
Er, you'd like me to come along?

341
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,870
Yeah.

342
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,710
This monk, he gives an enjoyable sermon.

343
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,150
C'mon, let's go.

344
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,270
Wait, wait.

345
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:09,350
The person who keeps
the precepts with utmost rigidity

346
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,230
will become happy and prosperous.

347
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,710
The precepts give you insurances.

348
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:24,230
The first precept is life insurance.

349
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,100
The second precept...

350
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,330
Mr. Vegas, do you like listening to the sermon?

351
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,740
Isn't that a good thing?

352
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,230
Your heart will be peaceful and calm.

353
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,110
Or what do you think, Pete?

354
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,110
That is all.

355
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,230
Now, the water of dedication and blessing.

356
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,430
Mr. Vegas, do you want another jug?

357
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,870
I'll go get it for you.

358
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,790
We make merits together.

359
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,790
So next life, we'll get to see each other again.

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:26,590

362
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,590
(Buddhist mantra)

363
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,590
(Buddhist mantra)

364
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,790
Go pour that for me too, would you?

365
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,870
Yes, sir.

366
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,990
[Don't forget to do this again together, so we'll see each other often in the next life.]

367
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,940
What are you doing?

368
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,270
I'm checking the A/C for you.

369
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,350
Right. Great.

370
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,310
It wasn't cold yesterday.

371
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,190
You didn't peek, did you?

372
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,150
Leave if you're done.

373
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:55,949
Mmm.

374
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,910
This is the wiretrap I developed myself.

375
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,630
It's unscannable and noise-canceling.

376
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,030
There are earbuds and the device in the box.

377
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,390
When you use them together,

378
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,390
the sound will be so clear as if you're under their bed.

379
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,510
So I just put it near the target, right?

380
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,950
Mmm.

381
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,950
Thanks, man.

382
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,590
So whom are you gonna use it with?

383
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,550
Those cheating gamblers at the casino.

384
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,430
Alright.

385
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,670
You don't have to tell me the truth.

386
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,930
But I'm on your team, man.

387
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,830
Go, Porsche! Go, Porsche!

388
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,580
Who is it?

389
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,430
It's me.

390
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,990
If you're in a shower, I'll come back later.

391
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,990
It's alright, Kinn. Just a moment, I'll be out.

392
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,430
Hey.

393
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,510
What are you listening to?

394
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,030
Soccer game.

395
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,870
Which one?

396
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,710
The small match. You wouldn't know them.

397
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,590
Hey, I love small matches.

398
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,590
Which league? Spain, England, or Italy?

399
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,670
Ethiopia, alright?

400
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,550
I gave you protection.

401
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:52,630
So where's the evidence of the traitors?

402
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,190
You're still hot-tempered as usual.

403
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,590
I'm asking, where is it?

404
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,950
It's somewhere...only I know.

405
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,150
Tomorrow, Porsche and I will go get it.

406
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,070
No.

407
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,110
Only you and I, the two of us.

408
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,310
Why?

409
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,500
Because I don't trust anyone, Kinn.

410
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,750
You do know you have a mole here.

411
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,990
Maybe, it's one of your guards.

412
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,190
You know, right? Who's behind those men?

413
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,710
Actually, you never trusted the minor family, did you?

414
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,470
But that is...

415
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:04,350
But I won't risk my safety with your soft heart.

416
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,310
Kinn, you choose.

417
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,550
You're going with me, just two of us.

418
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,950
Or...

419
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,950
you'll never see this evidence ever again.

420
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,190
Choose wisely, Kinn.

421
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:57,110
So did they win?

422
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,270
Whoa, just by your look, I know they lost.

423
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:50,870
[Ohm: Wanna go to the movie?]

424
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,070
Would you like some?

425
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,190
Are you here for a business talk with Mr. Korn?

426
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,720
What if I told you that I came over to see you?

427
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,430
About that night,

428
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,310
I'm sorry.

429
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,470
Just forget about it.

430
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,790
I'm glad that you're not mad at me.

431
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,030
Is there a bad rumor about me lately?

432
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,340
Why do you think so?

433
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,670
Because people in this family
give me a strange look.

434
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,830
And Kinn sent Pete to follow me around.

435
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,750
Coincidence?

436
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,190
I don't think so.

437
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,830
I'm used to that now.

438
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,510
Since I could remember,

439
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,790
the dirty works were for us to do.

440
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:27,270
If there's something wrong, they suspect us first.

441
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,990
Porsche.

442
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,990
Huh?

443
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,430
If one day, Kinn,

444
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,470
order you to kill me,

445
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,230
could you not make it suffering?

446
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,430
C'mon.

447
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,590
Okay.

448
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,950
Two of us will go get the evidence.

449
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,990
I miss this place.

450
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,560
I never thought I'd be able to come back here.

451
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,670
Where's the evidence?

452
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,280
Why are you always so uptight?

453
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,140
Go sit down first.

454
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,590
I remember that...

455
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,390
Not here.

456
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,050
I remember now.

457
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,590
Hey.

458
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,590
Stay still, Kinn.

459
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,670
Have you got it?

460
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,910
Didn't I tell you

461
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,810
that I wasn't lying.

462
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,910
Can you believe me now?

463
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:55,230
I guess you didn't have Porsche follow us, right?

464
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,620
I've had a weird feeling about this

465
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,550
since Porsche did something suspicious in my room.

466
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,390
I told you Porsche couldn't be trusted.

467
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,080
Lock him up.

468
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:39,750
Kinn.

469
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,480

471
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,760
I trust no one.

472

Kinn.

473
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:13,720
I heard from your friend
that you're hanging around here these days.

474
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,600
What's up?

475
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:22,650
I just wanted to say

476
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,890
the result on the practice exam is out.

477
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,740
By the look on your face, I know that you pass.

478
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,760
That's no fun.

479
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:39,200
Oh, well, I got a great tutor.

480
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,100
Well, thank you.

Well.

From now on, I won't have...

489
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,950
any excuse to, uh,

490
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,870
see your face, I mean.

491
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:28,870
Sorry.

492
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,550
I guess I won't be bothering you.

493
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:32,150
Would it be okay if...

494
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,500
if I want...

495
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,230
to bother you for the last time?

496
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,610
I like you.

♫ How lucky I am to find you ♫

504
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,070
Can't breathe here.

505
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,070
Oh, sorry.

506
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,630
That same old familiar taste.

507
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,700
How is it?

508
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,710
Quiet and peaceful, huh?

509
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,890
Here's some hot milk. Drink it.

510
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,190
So you'll get a good sleep.

511
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:49,790
I don't believe that Porsche betrayed us.

512
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:52,310
I think Tawan framed him.

513
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,310
I could even see it from Mars.

514
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,070
What do you think?

515
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:05,110
But you did well.

516
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:09,470
Or else other people of ours would rise up.

517
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,350
I'm gonna clear things up with him.

518
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,550
All I ask is to trust me.

519
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:36,310
I knew that you'd trust

520
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:43,020
Run away with me, Porsche.

521
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,540

522
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,130
Mr. Kinn, do you still trust Porsche?

523
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:32,840
I believe there are some clues in Vegas' secret room.

524
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,910
So you want me to send you to die?

525
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:37,190
I must go. Because I trust Porsche.
