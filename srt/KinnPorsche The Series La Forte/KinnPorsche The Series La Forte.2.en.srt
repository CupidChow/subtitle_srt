5
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,729
All bodyguards must strictly follow the training schedule,

6
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,460
and must pass the standard tests every month.

7
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,750
This is the main family's shooting range.

8
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,880
Shooting skill is the most important skill of all bodyguard.

9
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,570
Strength and conditioning is a big deal.

10
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,940
There's no room here for anyone who's out of shape.

11
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,390
Got it?

12
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,980
Got it.

13
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,340
The first rule, all bodyguards must station here.

14
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,250
We can only go out when we're on missions.

15
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,340
What if I get hungry at night?

16
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,930
C'mon, man. That's your damn business, not ours!

17
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,840
Hey, the new guy is here.

18
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,180
Why are you calling me now, Jom?

19
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,300
Damn, I'm working now.

20
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:48,840
Hey.

21
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,570
The second rule, all kind of personal devices are not allowed.

22
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,840
Except when you're out on a mission.

23
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,880
If you have to make an urgent call, use the central phone.

24
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,420
Each call can last no more than ten minutes.

25
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,120
And all conversations will be recorded.

26
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,950
Is this the bodyguards' residence or a prison?

27
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,890
Watch your mouth.

28
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,860
No, you watch your mouth.

29
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,050
They let me be in charge of you, and you too.

30
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,090
Asshole!

31
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,560
What is wrong with you?

32
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,190
Hey!

33
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,310
We're not on the street.

34
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,220
Leave your old habits out there.

35
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,570
The third rule is...

36
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,930
All bodyguards must be at peace.

37
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,500
No arguments nor fights.

38
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,080
We don't like chaos.

39
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,360
You do know.

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,470
This is not a playground.

41
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,730
If you think about working here,

42
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,090
you must know all rules by heart.

43
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,190
Understood?

44
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,670
Everyone, back to work.

45
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,880
You.

46
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,159
Come with me.

47
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,620
This is tailor room for all bodyguards.

48
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,230
And if you're lucky to survive from getting shot,

49
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,900
there are doctors and nurses here to take care of you 24/7.

50
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,660
But if you die,

51
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,200
so be it.

52
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,500
Shit.

53
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,680
I forgot.

54
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,800
The new guy arrives today.

55
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,120
Hello.

56
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,680
Are we allowed to eat in the room?

57
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,630
I walked past a huge cafeteria earlier.

58
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,560
Actually, no.

59
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,200
But my Grandma sent me this. It tastes way better.

60
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,460
My name is Pete.

61
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,040
I heard that you're the head bodyguard of Mr. Kinn.

62
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,500
And you?

63
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,610
I take care of Mr. Tankhun, Mr. Kinn's older brother.

64
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,970
Kinn's younger chlid?

65
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,750
I thought he was the big bro, acting all mature. Jerk.

66
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,330
There are three sons in the family.

67
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,160
Mr. Tankhun.

68
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,170
Mr. Kinn.

69
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,160
And Mr. Kim.

70
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,420
But Mr. Kim, he moved out and lives on his own.

71
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,920
He comes back every once in a while.

72
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,270
Oh, the egoist, I see.

73
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,280
And Mr. Tankhun, is he a psycho like Mr. Kinn?

74
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,150
Nope.

75
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,550
You're lucky.

76
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,850
Because he's worse.

77
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,180
Your Mr. Kinn is the most normal one in the house.

78
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,510
No way.

79
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,659
Normal my ass.

80
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,140
Hey, go change and get your things from the kitchen.

81
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,220
Auntie.

82
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,500
Seems like they want me to get something here for Mr. Kinn.

83
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:14,860
Here you go.

84
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,120
bring it.

85
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,450
Mr. Kinn is waiting at the shooting range.

86
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,660
I'm his bodyguard.

87
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
Do I need to call someone to bring it for him?

88
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,230
I guess you're a newbie.

89
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,600
You'll get used to it.

90
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,620
Yeah.

91
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,300
Oh well, all hits again.

92
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,070
You're such a brag.

93
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,720
A brag? Didn't you see that?

94
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,350
Hey, that means we're still good.

95
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,150
Yeah, we're doing alright.

96
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,600
Right.

97
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,660
Who is this? Your new guy?

98
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,270
Looks like your type of guy.

99
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,840
My Papa brought him in. His name is Porsche.

100
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,280
You can use him all you want.

101
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,550
Tell your Papa to find me one.

102
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,680
You want me to find one for you?

103
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,750
That's alright. I'm just joking.

104
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,930
I'll tell my Papa for you.

105
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,010
In exchange of you telling your Papa...

106
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,840
that I want to expand my business to Thonglor area.

107
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,100
Whoa.

108
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,780
This, you need to go talk to Teh's Dad.

109
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,240
That's his old area.

110
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,650
When I crashed my car, he cleared it off. The whole thing went silent.

111
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,750
Easy-peasy.

112
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,570
You guys are a bunch of asses.

113
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,580
What did you say?

114
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,930
Huh?

115
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,930
I said the weather's rad.

116
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,900
Oh!

117
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,620
Oh...it's nothing.

118
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,000
And this is for Mr. Kinn.

119
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,540
Auntie said that this one was specially made for Mr. Kinn.

120
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,210
I'm not thirsty. It's all yours.

121
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,110
It's alright, I've had it.

122
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,990
Just now, still stuffed.

123
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,300
Why not?

124
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,390
Drink it.

125
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,540
It's alright. I wouldn't dare.

126
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,030
I'll be right here guarding.

127
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,310
Are you going to drink it or not?

128
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,900
So fresh!

129
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,340
I'm all freshen up!

130
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,800
If it's that freshen up, then finished it.

131
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,630
It's all yours.

132
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,090
You're so good, babe.

133
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,310
Of course.

134
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,510
Where did he shoot? That's such a big target.

135
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,410
I think paper targets are boring.

136
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,330
Hey, put an apple over there.

137
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,780
So, where should i put it?

138
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,830
On your head.

139
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,280
That's a nice joke.

140
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,500
I'm for real.

141
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,390
What are you waiting for?

142
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,410
Or are you scared?

143
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,590
Kinn, are you being serious?

144
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,470
C'mon, let's have a meal.

145
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,110
Make me a coffee and bring it to the living room.

146
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,260
What are you doing?

147
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,210
Oh, I'm here to make coffee for Mr. Kinn.

148
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,780
Do you know how to use the machine?

149
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,710
Here, let me.

150
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,090
It's alright, Auntie. I've used it before.

151
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,990
C'mon now.

152
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,830
What's that burning smell?

153
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,860
It's roasted coffee, Auntie. Go, go, go!

154
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,160
Shit!

155
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,200
Ouch!

156
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,590
Who put vodka in the bottle?

157
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,170
Shit!

158
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,400
What the flip are you doing?

159
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,510
Holy shit, my home is wet!

160
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,790
Turn if off, you ass.

161
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,670
Two hundred and ninety nine...

162
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,180
Three hundred.

163
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,350
Did I tell you to stop? Get up!

164
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,590
Why don't you do it yourself, you brat?

165
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,870
Resume your daily training.

166
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,600
And...

167
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,510
where is the restroom...

168
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,710
Wouldn't you listen to me, saphead?

169
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,320
I'll just pee here.

170
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,290
This is the main family tree and all the businesses we take care.

171
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,280
You have thirty minutes.

172
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,650
Memorize them all.

173
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,840
[Main family]

174
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,099
The main businesses of the main family are luxury car imports...

175
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,910
and the real estate.

176
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:20,420
Including, housing, condos, hotels, spas, resorts...

177
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,030
and many more.

178
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,180
What are the businesses of the main family?

179
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,190
Oh, yes.

180
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,070
The main businesses of the main family are...

181
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,360
a lot.

182
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,460
That's not funny.

183
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,950
Go change.

184
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,570
Continue your training.

185
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,810
Just so you all know...

186
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,470
if you are captured, taken hostage,

187
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,060
you have less than three minutes to untie yourselves.

188
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,270
Make the minutes count.

189
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,660
It'll be the difference between living and dying.

190
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,680
I hope everyone remembered how to untie yourself as I taught.

191
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,790
Hey, nice one, loser.

192
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,270
Three bullets. Load them in. This side. Right.

193
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,230
Right.

194
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,800
Slide this in.

195
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,270
Release the slide.

196
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,540
Use your right hand and hold it up like this.

197
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,910
Okay, your left hand up to aim.

198
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,190
Stand firm.

199
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,150
Okay.

200
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,550
Shoot. Three times.

201
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,790
Go.

202
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,000
Go.

203
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,210
Sorry I told you that it's like a prison here.

204
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,060
It's actually a battlefield.

205
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,120
I train as if I were going to war.

206
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,300
Shit, it's exhausting.

207
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,230
Give it a try. It's so much more when you're on a mission.

208
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,370
Take a look. This is a freaking happy meal for kids.

209
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,410
I'm exhausted from the training.

210
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,990
And for sake! look at what they made for us to eat.

211
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,610
The chef has calculated that it's good for our health.

212
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,120
Nope, they're just being avid.

213
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,620
Just eat. Don't complain.

214
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,050
Mr. Tankhun.

215
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,190
Who killed Elizabeth and Sebastian?

216
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,260
Who?

217
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,860
His beloved Fancy Carps.

218
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,150
Who killed Elizabeth and Sebastian?

219
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,750
My children, let's eat!

220
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,950
Your Dada is here.

221
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:00,120
Pol, do you think I should change the brand of the bread?

222
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,360
I think it's not fab. Should we get a...

223
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,620
Truffle bread, or something like that.

224
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,640
What do you think?

225
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,820
Truffle bread?

226
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,370
Yeah.

227
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,660
I think it should be good. They eat normal bread everyday. They could be bored to death.

228
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,740
Right?

229
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,670
Truffle! Truffle!

230
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,200
You know Fancy Carp very well.

231
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,730
Thank you.

232
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,260
I guess that's why you look like a Fancy Carp.

233
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,940
Then I make you be the guardian of the Fancy Carp pond.

234
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,620
Yeah!

235
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,280
Arm!

236
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:31,750
Yes, sir!

237
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,880
You just order it tomorrow.

238
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,150
Right away, sir!

239
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,860
Mr. Tankhun, Calm down.

240
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,780
No.

241
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,590
Noooooooooooooo!

242
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,720
Mr. Tankhun.

243
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,110
Noooooooooooooo!

244
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,630
Mr. Tankhun.

245
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,730
Noooooooooooooo!

246
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,220
Elizabeth. Sebastian.

247
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,090
You.

248
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,380
Bring my children up here!

249
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,510
Bring my children to me now.

250
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,390
Quickly.

251
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,670
Elizabeth.

252
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,550
Sebastian.

253
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,030
My babies.

254
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,790
Come back to Dada.

255
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,350
Who did this?

256
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,870
Who killed my fish?

257
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,670
Rest in peace, Sebastian...Elizabeth.

258
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,750
Pee...I smell pee.

259
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,750
Who peed in my Fancy Carp pond?

260
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,990
I've raised them since they were this tiny.

261
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,230
Will anyone confess?

262
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,230
No one?

263
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,830
Alright.

264
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,550
Arm. Show him!

265
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,750
Zoom in! Make it clear.

266
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,820
Was that you, newbie?

267
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,070
You peed? Yes, you did, obviously.

268
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,630
How could you do it?

269
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,070
You're crude, cruel and mean.

270
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,590
Pol, take him.

271
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,350
I'll make him pay.

272
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,190
Bring him here!

273
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,430
Mr. Tankhun...

274
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,870
What?

275
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,310
Miss Universe pageant competition is today.

276
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,830
Huh?

277
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,830
It's almost time.

278
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,310
Well, you're lucky.

279
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,430
Just you wait!, i'll come back for you later.

280
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,030
Let's go.

281
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,670
This way, Mr. Tankhun.

282
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,030
Pol!

283
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,830
Yes, Mr. Tankhun.

284
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,830
Don't you want to know who will be crowned?

285
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,550
His results of the physical test,

286
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,310
and the weapon test

287
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,190
are below standard.

288
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,190
A person who's good at fighting doesn't mean he could be a bodyguard.

289
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,110
Some people can only be a street thug.

290
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,590
Boss says, "Give Porsche some more time."

291
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,590
He's still very new.

292
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,310
When Big's fully recovered, we'll talk about this again.

293
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,590
Yes, sir.

294
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,910
How is it?

295
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,910
You think you could get away with it.

296
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,710
C'mon, wag your tail.

297
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,150
One.

298
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:13,620
Two.

299
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,150
Three.

300
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,950
Hey, Pete.

301
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,590
Give him some treats.

302
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,110
Mr. Tankhun, that's enough. He didn't mean to.

303
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,310
Shut up or would you do it for him, Pete?

304
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,910
Now!

305
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,590
Here we go!

306
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,990
Hey, i just come up with something.

307
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,990
I'll name him...Elizabeth The Second!

308
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,870
C'mon now, Elizabeth The Second. Eat the treats.

309
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,230
Hey, what are you doing?

310
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,150
Well...

311
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,790
He killed my Elizabeth and Sebastian.

312
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,070
How nice of me that I didn't pee on him.

313
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,510
Damn you, newbie.

314
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,710
That's enough.

315
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,510
I'll buy you new carps.

316
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,230
I think this one isn't good enough to breed.

317
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,270
That's true.

318
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,790
My Elizabeth was much cuter than you.

319
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,070
Then come and get him.

320
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,070
Out of the way.

321
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,830
And don't forget to buy me new carps.

322
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,390
Let's go, guys!

323
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,590
You, keep swimming.

324
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,110
C'mon, let's watch some series.

325
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,310
Hey, Porsche, I think this suits you well.

326
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,510
Swim, C'mon.

327
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,790
The little mermaid.

328
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,910
Nice tail, Porsche.

329
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,310
Thanks.

330
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,350
Do you think i'm helping you?

331
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,910
You're coming to the event with me tonight.

332
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,510
I'm just afraid that you'll die before that.

333
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,110
Let's go, Big.

334
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,910
I'm now believed that your boss is more psychotic.

335
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,430
Hey.

336
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,510
Huh?

337
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,790
Hear me out.

338
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,790
What?

339
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,390
When Mr. Tankhun was little, he was kidnapped.

340
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,590
He was traumatized. That's why he's a little absurd.

341
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,430
I don't think that's little.

342
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,350
And it's not just Mr. Tankhun.

343
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,750
The whole family is absurd.

344
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,590
Why are you whispering?

345
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,590
Just be cautious. Words get around quickly in this house.

346
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,150
I believe you now that they're all weird.

347
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,310
You are weird too.

348
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,110
Hey.

349
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,190
But for Mr. Kinn, he's the least weird.

350
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,390
That's why Mr. Korn let Mr. Kinn succeeded him.

351
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,390
Or else, the whole family would be doomed.

[WELCOME]

353
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,510
Hello. What kind of weapon would you like today?

354
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,510
Hello.

355
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,550
Choose.

356
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,510
Well, you're a newbie.

357
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,750
A glock would do.

358
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,430
One glock, please.

359
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,430
Would you like some bullets and a silencer as well?

360
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,150
Yes, please.

361
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,870
Please.

362
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,070
Come..

363
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,110
Wow.

364
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,630
This is surreal.

365
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,510
It's like James Bond.

366
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,630
And there will be a nerd coming in to hand out the guns.

367
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,630
Like, hey, this is your gun.

368
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,790
So, who's the nerd?

369
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,430
Hey, this is your gun.

370
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,350
And this is for communication.

371
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,390
How to use these?

372
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,710
Didn't you listen when you were training?

373
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,430
Earbuds are used by bodyguards worldwide.

374
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,550
So damn cool!

375
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,150
Just like in a movie.

376
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,270
So, one click is for general communication.

377
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:30,310
Double clicks mean turning off the hearing mode and get ready to send audio signal.

378
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,270
And this is an emergency button.

379
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,270
As soon as you push this, the signal will be sent to the main terminal.

380
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,590
Any questions, ask.

Yes.

C'mon.

Tonight is the opening of a new product.

Taken place in a five-star hotel.

396
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,860
And this doesn't look good enough?

This is the best look I've ever had in my life.

Mr. Kinn, how do you feel after you tasted...

423
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,830
our Royal Farmhouse Sprouted Grain with Germinated Brown Rice bread?

424
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,990
It's very soft.

425
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,710
And the important part is they've got grains.

426

Germinated brown rice is very good for your health.

Don't you remember who's in charge here?

Let me have one.

Certainly, sir.

Oh, yes, sir.

This is so tempting.

And most importantly, I'd like everyone to give it a try.

not my type either!

No, where is he?

00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,190
And...and and...

00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,190
Oh, c'mon man, we gotta go find him.

455
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,150
Porsche, I'll look this way.

456

You, go that way.

Ooh, nice.

She's killing me.

Why did you kick me?

Well, you're in my way.

461
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,310
She's long gone.

462
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,430
She's from the back of Yok's bar, right?

463
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,470
Everyone wants me dead.

464
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,670
Even you.

465
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,630
How's Kinn's new bodyguard?

466
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,030
He's... handsome.

467
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,990
Tell me something that I don't know.

468
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,430
He's a bit playful but kinda skilled.

469
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,270
Thank you.

470
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,510

Hey, get him out of here.

475
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,510
I've done lecturing him.

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,710
What happened?

477
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,910
Why are we in a straight line?

478
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,100
Today, the minor family is having a meeting here.

479
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,390
Oh, the minor family...

480
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,390
I remember them from the presentation.

481
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,070
He Mr. Korn's brother, right?

482
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,990
He's Mr. Kan.

483
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,830
He joins the meeting here once a month.

484
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,310
He's our VIP guest.

485
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,550
Well, that's good. Two families helping each other out.

486
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,910
Well, I don't know about that.

487
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,910
Why is that?

488
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,230
When are they coming?

489
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,230
They are now.

490
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,590
The cars are freaking fanciful.

491
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,270
That is Mr. Kan, the head of the minor family.

492
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,710
And this is Mr. Vegas, the oldest son positioning as Mr. Kinn.

493
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,790
Who did he smile at?

494
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,350
How would I know?

495
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,710
I think because you're handsome.

496
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,550
So he smiled at you.

497
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,550
Of course.

498
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,750
What are you doing?

499
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,750
I said, what do you think you're doing?

500
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,950
Keep your nose out of this.

501
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,150
Hey.

502
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,110
I asked you nicely.

503
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,630
Do your parents work here?

504
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,110
Huh?

505
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,310
Why don't you just leave me alone?

506
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,510
You must be the maid's kid.

507
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,910
Come here, you'll face Mr. Tankhun, shithead.

508
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,430
Oh, asshole.

509
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,900
Shit!

510
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,030
Serves you right, asshole.

511
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,830
What now? Get up! What are you looking at?

512
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,590
I'll smack your eyeballs off.

513
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,750
Oh, still looking?

514
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,790
Don't make me...

515
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,270
Mr. Macau!

516
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,510
What happened here?

517
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,510
Get up.

518
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,990
Mr. Macau...

519
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,190
That's familiar.

520
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,550
Will there be any consequences?

521
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,870
To our main projects, no.

522
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,990
Actually, the procedure will be...

523
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,150
Papa!

524
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,430
This guy hit me!

525
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,430
This shithead hit my head, Papa.

526
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,470
I was just feeding the fish.

527
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,230
And he came out of nowhere...

528
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,510
And pushed me.

529
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,510
He also told me that he's gonna smack my eyeballs off.

530
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,910
Wow. Now, that's the whole different story.

531
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,230
Who told you to speak?

532
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,710
Wait, calm down.

533
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,710
Porsche is our new guy.

534
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:39,790
Bro, why the main family's standard of guard selection has changed?

535
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,790
It's since...

536
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,110
Let me tell you something.

537
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,190
You're not just teaching them how to use guns,

538
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,190
But manners as well.

539
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,550
That's my job.

540
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,550
It's my people, and it's no one else's trouble.

541
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,830
Well, I didn't mean to.

542
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,830
At first, I thought he was a maid's kid.

543
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,510
Papa!

544
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,510
He said I looked like a maid's kid!

545
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,670
Oh, if you don't believe me, I could show you...

546
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,070
There was a maid...

547
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:29,470
It's my fault I can't handle my people.

548
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,190
Shall we carry on with the projects?

549
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:27,830
There's no concern for the overall revenue.

550
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,630
But on the project we're doing,

551
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,310
I'm a little concerned.

552
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,710
Finally.

553
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,830
That piece of shit, Kinn!

554
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,510
Why are you stopping me?

555
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,350
Calm down.

556
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,870
Mr. Kinn just saved your life.

557
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,950
Saving my life?

558
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,910
If Mr. Kinn hadn't done that,

559
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,710
you would've been shot to death by the minor family....

560
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,230
for what you'd done to their son.

561
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,830
Think this through.

562
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:17,630
If Mr. Kinn really thought of killing you,

563
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,750
wouldn't it be easier to just shoot you then?

564
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,270
Why would he let you live and talk to me now?

565
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,830
Mr. Kinn used to be kind in the past.

566
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,830
He loved his people.

567
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:44,230
But the reason he became cruel...

568
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,230
was not totally on him.

569
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,190
And why is that?

570
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,110
drop it.

571
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:58,630
Just know that he saved your life today.

572
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,630
Don't forget to thank him.

573
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,790
I didn't burn your house down this time.

574
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,190
If you don't dare drink it, I'll show you first.

575
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:56,550
I'm just wondering about who you are.

576
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,030
Are you the real Porsche?

577
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,630
I'm wondering the same thing if that was really you?

578
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,230
Because that was real you, you'd have let me killed already.

579
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,110
I just don't like that family too, that's all.

580
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,710
You can really only make alcoholic drinks.

581
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,180
I don't think I have the wrong recipe.

582
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:33,110
It's alright. Keep practicing, one day you'll good at it.

583
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:43,070
Porsche.

584
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,110
Did you bleed Macau's head?

585
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:51,790
Well, I didn't mean to...

586
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:54,150
That's awesome.

587
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,750
I love that.

588
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,230
I really love that.

589
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:01,230
You're like...wow. You're an amazing guy.

590
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,950
Let me have Porsche.

591
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,550
And you can take Pete.

592
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,390
You, go with him.

593
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:12,910
You always dissatisfied me.

594
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:16,550
I told you to tie Macau up but you didn't do it.

595
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,950
So, go with Kinn.

596
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:19,670
Go!

597
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,750
A guy like you wouldn't do me any good.

598
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:24,790
Kinn.

599
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,870
Are you certain, Mr. Tankhun?

600
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,030
Even he has done nothing good...

601
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,510
But Papa chose him for me.

602
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,150
And I don't like to disobey his orders.

603
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,510
C'mon.

604
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,750
But if you really want him, then why not?

605
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,070
You said it.

606
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,150
Yeah!

607
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,590
Come on!

608
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,870
Be with me and it'll be fun, trust me.

609
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:56,870
Let's start! Go!

610
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,070
And for you...

611
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:03,710
C'mon!

612
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:17,950
Are you being too kind to those bodyguards?

613
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,510
Sometimes, people deserve...

614
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,750
a second chance...

615
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,150
or a third chance.

616
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:32,590
And do you ever give chances to everyone?

617
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,110
Papa.

618
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,830
Papa.

619
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:57,110
Are you alright?

620
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,550
Yeah.

621
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:07,430
Keep your eye on the new bodyguard, Porsche.

622
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,910
And report to me.

623
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,190
Why do you suddenly want me to...

624
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:13,670
Just do as I said!

625
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,710
Okay, Papa.

626
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,160
Mr. Korn took a new bodyguard in

627
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,250
to take care of Mr. Kinn.

628
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,670
His skills aren't that good.

629
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,220
Right now, he's taking care of Mr. Tankhun instead.

630
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:32,200
What's his name?

631
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,970
His name is Porsche.

632
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:34,770
KINN
