5
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,030
I'm not going anywhere unless it's necessary.

6
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,280
But if you come with me,

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,190
you will be thrilled.

8
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,390
You're able to take my brother out of this house?

9
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,160
Yes. Aren't I just great?

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,390
You, come with me.

11
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,150
You'll be escorting my friend home.

12
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,550
Mr. Korn took a new bodyguard in to take care of Mr. Kinn.

13
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,780
What's the name?

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,380
His name is Porsche.

15
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,950
Thank you

16
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,950
for saving my life.

17
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,740
Dang, Porsche!

18
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,020
What are you doing?

19
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,300
And, why did you kick me?

20
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm the one who should ask.

21
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,700
What the hell are you doing in my bed?

22
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,820
Oh.

23
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,060
And what happened last night?

24
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,780
I had a feeling that before I passed out, I...

25
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,700
I was by the river somewhere.

26
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,700
Don't ask me.

27
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,860
Your herbal spirit messed me up last night.

28
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,870
All I know is that I'm already in my bed.

29
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,360
And I...

30
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,210
And I felt like I kissed someone.

31
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,720
Would I know that?

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,730
But I know that you were trying to kiss me in your sleep earlier.

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,850
Or was it just a dream?

34
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,850
A dream? A good one? Or a bad one?

35
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,730
Tell me.

36
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,740
So I'll help guess who it might be.

37
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,900
I don't know.

38
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,780
I just knew that

39
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,090
it felt strange.

40
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,750
Mr. Vegas.

41
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,300
No worries.

42
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,310
I'm here to run some errands.

43
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,110
About last time, I'm sorry.

44
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,710
You meant Macau?

45
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,790
Hey, a boy like him deserved that.

46
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,120
Sometimes, I even want to hit him myself.

47
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,110
That's true. I...

48
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,110
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,400
Are you here to take care of Kinn?

50
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,320
So, have you got a hang of it?

51
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,270
Mmm. Not really.

52
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,280
But I'm now tranferred to take care of Mr. Tankhun.

53
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,750
Mr. Tankhun.

54
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,320
Yes.

55
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,270
That one is quite something.

56
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,280
That's true.

57
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,170
Why did you call me?

58
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,210
Sorry.

59
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,910
Did I interrupt?

60
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,370
I saw you two were having a fun conversation.

61
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,490
Oh.

62
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,190
Mr. Vegas?

63
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,170
I just borrowed his lighter.

64
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,330
Hasn't anyone told you

65
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,360
that if it's unnecessary,

66
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,920
leave the minor family alone.

67
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,820
Why's that?

68
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,190
I don't know what's going on with your families.

69
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,909
But if he talked to me nicely, I'd talk to him nicely.

70
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,880
Manners, you know?

71
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Is that all?

72
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,820
Wait.

73
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,420
What?

74
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,100
Uh...

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,110
About last night, are you okay with it?

76
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,350
Of course.

77
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,630
I do this all the time.

78
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,230
That wasn't your first time?

79
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,630
No.

80
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,430
But it seems like it's your first time.

81
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,750
Just seeing you, I know,
it's definitely your first time.

82
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,550
You'd never tried herbal spirits before?

83
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,510
Herbal spirit?

84
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,200
Yeah.

85
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,990
What you do all the time,

86
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,630
you mean, drinking the herbal spirit?

87
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,980
Of course.

88
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,080
What were you trying to say?

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,640
Uh...

90
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,000
I meant, something else

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that we did after drinking the spirit.

92
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,220
I had a blackout last night.
P I don't remember anything.

93
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,850
What is it? What did I do to you?

94
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,540
- What's wrong--
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kinn.

95
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,170
Porsche, Mr. Tankhun is in trouble!

96
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,400
Mr. Tankhun! Mr. Tankhun!

97
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,320
Mr. Tankhun.

98
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,790
What?

99
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,200
Mr. Tankhun.

100
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,800
Where is Mr. Tankhun?

101
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
He's gone!

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,970
- Huh?
- What?

103
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,330
- Mr. Tankhun!
- Huh?

104
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,740
Mr. Tankhun!

105
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,820
Mr. Tankhun!

106
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,890
Mr. Tankhun. Mr. Tankhun!

107
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,450
Mr. Tankhun!

108
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,740
Ahhhhhh!

109
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,350
Why did you step on him?

110
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,470
- Mr. Tankhun, Mr. Tankhun.
- Aw!

111
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,510
- Mr. Tankhun.
- Mr. Tankhun.

112
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,940
- Mr. Tankhun.
- Aw!

113
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,640
Are you alright?

114
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,250
I'm sorry, Mr. Tankhun.

115
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,330
My head hurts.

116
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,850
Who's squeezing my head?

117
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,170
Or could it be a ghost?

118
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,520
A ghost squeezes my head!

119
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,130
A ghost must be squeezing my head for sure!

120
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,460
Mr. Tankhun.

121
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,390
This is called "a hangover".

122
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,670
It'll get better, trust me.

123
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,360
No, I'm doomed every time I trust you.

124
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,400
Get up.

125
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,840
Mr. Tankhun, easy there.

126
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,770
Take me to the spa. I need a fix.

127
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,440
Okay.

128
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,220
Go! Pol! Get the car!

129
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,250
Arm, c'mon.

130
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,340
What? What's with you?

131
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,310
The spa is right underneath the house.

132
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,370
- Alright?
- Yes.

133
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,500
There's a spa downstairs?

134
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,240
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

135
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,000
When I read the house plan,
I saw the spot written as spa.

136
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,300
I thought it was a joke. This is freaking amazing.

137
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,710
There are more surprises in this house, Porsche.

138
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,500
He's right.

139
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,500
- He looks comfy.
- Mmm.

140
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,660
- He snores loudly.
- One man down.

141
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,630
My Mr. Tankhun.

142
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,360
I think it's our time now.

143
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,590
Our time to do what?

144
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,680
Where are you going?

145
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,799
Auntie.

146
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,110
Yes?

147
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,919
Before Mr. Tankhun fell asleep,

148
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,429
he ordered

149
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,970
auntie to take care of us as well.

150
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,650
So our bodies will freshen up

151
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,320
- and we can take a good care of him.
- One moment, Auntie.

152
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,590
Let me have a talk with my friend here.

153
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,290
- I'm talking to Auntie. Manners!
- Are you crazy?

154
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,770
If you're going to do the spa, wait for me at the sauna.

155
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,870
I'm gonna massage Mr. Tankhun first.

156
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,050
What the heck are you doing?

157
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,800
Are you gonna leave him here?

158
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,120
Don't you hear him snore?

159
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
He's like a dead man.

160
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,090
We're free men now.

161
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,590
Fudge, I didn't know we could do something like this.

162
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,800
You look as if you don't wanna go.

163
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,100
Don't be such a good guy.

164
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,640
Actually,

165
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,040
Pol and I,

166
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,860
have been wanting to try onsen for a long time.

167
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,550
Are you in for onsen?

168
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,880
No.

169
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,830
I'm going to sauna.

170
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,160
I don't want my wound to get wet.

171
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,490
What? That's a tiny wound.

172
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,830
No, I don't get to see your balls.

173
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,710
Where's the sauna?

174
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,180
You go straight, turn right and then turn left.

175
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,090
Right?

176
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,010
Just walk out. Someone will tell you where to go.

177
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,870
Go.

178
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,520
Are you living in the same roof?

179
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,770
Go! Go! Go!

180
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,720
This feels so good.

181
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,710
It really feels that good?

182
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,220
Uh...

183
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,950
I'm here to do the check up for Mr. Tankhun.

184
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,030
I'm off.

185
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,240
Wait.

186
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,070
Sit down.

187
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,360
Are you sure?

188
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,390
I'm looking for a company anyway.

189
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,770
Shoot, you're being weird today.

190
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,290
If you feel like you're about
to pass out, you could go rest.

191
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,570
How could you insult me like that?

192
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,570
Look at my tattoo before saying anything like that.

193
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,850
What's that?

194
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,790
The Phoenix.

195
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,460
They say it's an immortal bird.

196
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,830
Why this tattoo?

197
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,110
My Mom liked it.

198
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,910
My Mom used to talk about it a lot when I was little.

199
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,880
Also, she said that

200
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,880
I couldn't die before
my brother finished his degree.

201
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,530
Are you leaving?

202
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,670
What are you doing?

203
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,770
Isn't it hot enough already?

204
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,790
No.

205
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Why? You can't take it anymore?

206
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,990
Of course, I can.

207
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,670
Never been better.

208
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,540
How's your brother?

209
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,090
He should be okay.

210
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,170
I guess, he's playing games while I'm not around.

211
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,030
How about your brother?

212
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I know you got a brother.

213
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,430
It feels as if I don't have one.

214
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,590
We haven't seen each other in ages.

215
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,850
You're being here doesn't
make your girlfriend angry?

216
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,530
A girlfriend? That's nonsense.

217
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,290
Going solo is the best.

218
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,110
How about you? When are you gonna have one?

219
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,540
And how do you know that I don't have one?

220
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Since I've been here, I haven't
seen you with any girls before.

221
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,480
Speaking of it, you're not bad looking.

222
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,760
Just a little too old.

223
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,670
But botox could help you, you know.

224
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,670
Your mouth!

225
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,430
If you were a girl...

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
would you like a guy like me?

227
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,350
Shoot.

228
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,100
When is Porsche gonna be conscious?

229
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,260
I'm starving. This smells so nice.

230
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,820
Whoa!

231
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,140
What's with you?

232
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,050
There he goes, my friend.

233
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,840
What's up, tough guy?

234
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,880
Look at you.

235
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,770
And your pale lips.

236
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,760
Such a tough one, huh?

237
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,070
Where am I?

238
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,400
Disneyland!

239
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,560
Yeah!

240
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Are you crazy?

241
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,380
Don't judge a book by its cover.

242
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,120
What did you say?

243
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,320
What did he say?

244
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,570
We're at the restaurant in the building.

245
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,720
They changed your clothes. Look at it.

246
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,450
Hey, eat up.

247
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,400
You eat up.

248
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,920
Where is Mr. Tankhun?

249
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,590
There. He's in that zone with Mr. Kinn.

250
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,670
That's good, if they're here, I wouldn't be able to eat.

251
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,990
Yeah.

252
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,870
Hey, it's boiling, I'm gonna lift it up now.

253
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,190
I can't take it any longer.

254
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,570
Wow.

255
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,180
Let's eat.

256
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,220
Put the mushroom in too.

257
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,460
Smells so great.

258
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,770
Good afternoon, Mr. Vegas.

259
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,680
Can I join you guys?

260
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,200
Er, Mr. Vegas.

261
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,580
Mr. Kinn is in that zone.

262
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,900
But I want to sit here.

263
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,040
Can I?

264
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,910
Yes, sir.

265
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,330
Of course, sir.

266
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,590
Er...

267
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,390
Let's change the plate. Pete already ate off this one.

268
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,430
- Here.
- Okay.

269
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,220
- Yeah.
- Take it.

270
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,410
Thank you.

271
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,400
Okay.

272
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,830
I'll join you as well.

273
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,970
- I'll give you the new dish set.
- I'll do it.

274
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,150
Please have a seat.

275
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,680
This table looks more enjoyable.

276
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,780
You got cheese.

277
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,860
Yes.

278
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,710
Should I cover it?

279
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,750
No need to.

280
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,020
You can eat it.

281
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,240
Hmm.

282
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,829
It tastes better than what's on that table.

283
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,050
There's a diamond auction coming up this Saturday.

284
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,740
Have you practiced raising your hand?

285
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,250
My papa just wants me to go there for formality.

286
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,000
I heard that it's for your
very first opening to the press.

287
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,010
Words travel fast.

288
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,770
I don't have many responsibilities like you do.

289
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,870
So I got time to...

290
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,240
take a look around.

291
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,110
Mmm, this one is cooked.

292
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,130
Here.

293
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,640
My bodyguard got hands and feet.

294
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,190
He can take care of himself.

295
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,460
Sorry, I forgot that you all
treat your bodyguards differently.

296
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,860
Oh, right.

297
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,100
Kinn said that you can't
adjust yourself working here.

298
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,300
Well, my personal bodyguard just quit.

299
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,950
- What would you say if I--
- No.

300
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,270
Porsche takes care of Tankhun.

301
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,720
He won't give him to you.

302
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,780
Then you go talk to him for me.

303
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,080
I don't like getting into other people' business.

304
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,980
And I don't like others getting into mine.

305
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,140
Why's that?

306
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,730
Oh.

307
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,420
You're afraid that when you open your heart,

308
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,730
you will be hurt again?

309
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,500
Guys!

310
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,790
How could you let him eat with us?

311
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,130
Vegas.

312
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,290
Go home.

313
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,660
What are you looking at?

314
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,550
Mr. Tankhun.

315
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,470
Don't.

316
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,490
Tell me.

317
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,470
Who?

318
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,830
He sat in my spot.

319
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,790
I'm not gonna eat anymore.

320
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,610
Mr. Tankhun, wait.

321
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,440
Go get him.

322
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Yes, sir.

323
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Mr. Tankhun.

324
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,270
More, more, more, more.

325
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,420
Back, back, back, back, back.

326
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,550
Back a bit.

327
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,550
Stop.

328
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,460
Oh.

329
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,540
Hello there.

330
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,180
Hello.

331
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,190
Let's go.

332
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,400
Oh.

333
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,010
Don't you have to watch the series with Mr. Tankhun?

334
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,070
Nope.

335
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,110
Actually, I went to the sauna with Mr. Kinn today.

336
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,250
Huh?

337
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,150
Huh?

338
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,740
Hey, don't tell me that Mr. Kinn's
never asked you to go with him?

339
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,720
It's alright.

340
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,910
I'll invite you next time.

341
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,710
Well,

342
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,290
I guess you're Mr. Kinn's favorite now.

343
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,020
Give this to him.

344
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,350
If he doesn't answer the door,
just leave it in his room.

345
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,430
Mr. Kinn should be showering.

346
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,410
Kinn, what's wrong?

347
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,290
Why did you call me on short notice?

348
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,390
Nothing.

349
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,680
Something's been bothering me a bit.

350
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,970
Oh.

351
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,600
You'll be fine.

352
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,490
I'll get it out of your chest then.

353
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,630
You never seem to change.

354
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,590
Never let me kiss you.

355
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,050
I think we should see the whole view tonight.

356
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Fudge, Porsche!

357
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,900
Sorry.

358
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,020
I...

359
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,060
just have to give you this.

360
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,330
Continue.

361
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,300
What's wrong?

362
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,220
Why do you look so shocked?

363
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,090
Well, I am freaking shocked.

364
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,150
You knew that he had a guest
yet you still told me to get in.

365
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,070
I feel so dumb.

366
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,680
You're shocked because of that?

367
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,350
Of course.

368
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,110
Why?

369
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,490
Oh.

370
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,060
You wanted me to be shocked to know that Kinn's gay?

371
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,740
You're such a jerk.

372
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,330
Don't you know how much this world has progressed?

373
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,400
But I'm shocked that there are still people like you,

374
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,070
who mess with others with this stuff.

375
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,060
You're a low-class jerk.

376
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,930
All the people here know about it.

377
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,210
I thought you knew.

378
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,580
No, I don't. I don't know a darn thing.

379
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,030
Well, that's why

380
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,130
he brought his guy friend home late at night.

381
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,450
- Shoot.
- What?

382
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,230
Do you think people who aren't a couple...

383
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,020
can kiss each other?

384
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,910
What's with you?

385
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,690
Would you wanna kiss me?

386
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,370
Eat my foot.

387
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,280
See?

388
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,850
Kissing is for people that we like only.

389
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,460
Hello, guys and girls!

390
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:09,450
Welcome to the Faculty of Music,
Anantrameka University.

391
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,260
For those of you who haven't made a decision

392
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,670
if you're going to study here or not,

393
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,490
today, we got a kind graduate
that will share his experience with us.

394
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,040
And I gotta tell you that this senior of ours,

395
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,020
is really popular on social media.

396
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,900
Can you guess?

397
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,890
Well, no need to.

398
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,530
Please welcome, Wik!

399
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,380
Who's that?

400
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,160
What?

401
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,660
It's Wik!

402
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,690
How could you not know?

403
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,260
I don't know him. Who's he?

404
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,120
I want to study here because of him.

405
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,620
Oh.

406
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:15,350
♪I've just realized that you're my good memory♪

407
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:21,690
♪The empty calendar is now full of your name♪

408
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,830
♪Every time we sing when we're on a highway♪

409
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,540
♪Your laughter that makes me feel like it's Friday♪

410
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,550
I ask myself all the time

411
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,080
how much do I want my dream to happen?

412
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,440
Is it worth it if I lose something along the way?

413
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,600
But if we love something so much with all our hearts,

414
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,710
don't you think it's worth it?

415
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
So I hope

416
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,110
the story that I shared today
will be useful to all of you.

417
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,780
Good luck, everyone.

418
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,520
And that's not all!

419
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,920
Before we say goodbye,

420
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,620
I got some questions for you all.

421
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,250
Who knows the right answers,

422
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,460
will get the faculty's tee with Wik's autograph!

423
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,480
If you're ready, let's start with the first question.

424
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:33,780
The first question,
what's the first song Wik covered?

425
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,810
Me!

426
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,830
- Please.
- It's "Hug" from Moderndog.

427
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,010
That's correct!

428
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,960
Yeah! I got the shirt!

429
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,230
Way to go!

430
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,130
Moving on to the second question,

431
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:55,250
which is, what Wik's song is the most viewed?

432
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,770
- Me, me!
- Please.

433
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,100
"See You Again".

434
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,060
That's correct!

435
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,100
It's okay, there's another round.

436
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:12,340
And lastly, what song by Wik
features a cat in the video?

437
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,950
"The Beached Whale".

438
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,230
"The Beached Whale" is correct.

439
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,680
No, that's not it!

440
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,380
There are three songs.
"Lost Star", there's a tail of a cat after the hook.

441
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,890
"Shape of You", a paw is seen around the intro.

442
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,230
And, in "I Secretly Like You", there's a cat doll.

443
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,950
Does that count?

444
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,540
Yes! That's correct!

445
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,580
It's correct. Woo-hoo!

446
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,190
He's my friend, he's my friend!

447
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,080
How could you remember all of that?

448
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,810
I'm also a fan, I didn't know that.

449
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,410
Who the hell are you?

450
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,060
I thought I would get another tee, man.

451
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,220
Thank you so much, you all. Thank you.

452
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,730
Thank you.

453
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,850
I'm so happy!

454
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,890
- Congrats.
- Yay!

455
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,490
So?

456
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,520
What?

457
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,230
Huh?

458
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,520
Er...

459
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,680
Oh.

460
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,950
I've run out of t-shirts.

461
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,710
Eh?

462
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,620
I only prepared three shirts for three questions.

463
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,050
I'm so sorry.

464
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,130
That's-that's alright.

465
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,900
- You got more than one answer.
- Huh?

466
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,030
Can I give you something else instead?

467
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,260
Oh, really? Can I?

468
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,210
What do you want?

469
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,170
I really want to get into this faculty.

470
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,000
Can you be my guitar tutor?

471
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
I...I...I'm sorry.

472
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,110
What's your name?

473
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,970
Porchay.

474
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,600
A pen, please.

475
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,970
I wish you get in.

476
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,640
Bye-bye.

477
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,160
Why do I get caught by you every time lately?

478
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,330
Stand up.

479
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,500
Take your shirt off.

480
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,530
No.

481
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,810
Are you gonna take it off by yourself,

482
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,430
or let me do that?

483
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,220
Your wound's healed.

484
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,250
And?

485
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,260
There's a diamond auction tomorrow.

486
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,660
You must be there as my bodyguard.

487
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,320
Don't I have to be Tankhun's bodyguard anymore?

488
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,440
You had a meal with Vegas.

489
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,310
He's mad.

490
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,970
So he returned you to me.

491
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,150
I wanna know

492
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,980
if he didn't return me to you,

493
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,310
would you ever think of taking me back?

494
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,670
Why do you ask?

495
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,800
I'm just asking.

496
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,060
For me,

497
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,830
all of our people are the same.

498
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,120
Excuse me.

499
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,510
This is the information
on Porsche that you asked for.

500
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,720
Lately,

501
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,040
there are lots of incidents happened to Mr. Kinn.

502
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,730
It's like we got a mole.

503
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,949
Mr. Kim, are you thinking about the same thing?

504
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,969
Yeah.

505
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,320
I'm thinking.

506
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:20,610
If you're done, why are you still here?

507
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,820
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

508
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,490
This way, please.

509
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,210
Please enjoy.

510
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
Stage. Clear.

511
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,550
Auction area. Clear.

512
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
Stairs. Clear.

513
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,630
Fire exit. Clear.

514
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
Bar. Clear.

515
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,250
Why didn't you tell me that
the event's gonna be this big, Pete?

516
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,620
I would have picked the right perfume.

517
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,330
This is insane.
It's the biggest event I've ever been in.

518
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,940
Hey, no personal talk.

519
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
So Porsche is back with you?

520
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,190
Well, you had a meal with him.

521
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,130
Khun got mad.

522
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,460
He gave Porsche back to me.

523
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,800
Are you sure that Khun's mad?

524
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,510
Why did I hear that you...

525
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,670
were the one who asked him back? Isn't that right?

526
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,240
Kinn.

527
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,760
Saved by the bell.

528
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,940
Are you alright?

529
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,640
What's going on?

530
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,710
Forget about it.

531
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,250
A drink?

532
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,910
Sure.

533
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,860
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

534
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,590
Welcome to our diamond auction.

535
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,760
I'm Mondue, your host for the night.

536
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,580
Let’s not waste more time.

537
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,650
The diamond in front of me here is called

538
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,140
“The Aurora of Jewelry”.

539
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,210
And now, the auction of the first diamond begins.

540
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,010
Starting at 8 million.

541
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,010
Anyone?

542
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
10 million.

543
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Pidpong, at 10 million.

544
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,610
Right now, it's 10 million. Anyone else?

545
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,520
- 10 million now.
- 11 million.

546
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,600
Alright, 11 million from Ms. Dujmanee.

547
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,000
Wow, no one is letting it go now.

548
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,010
11 million. Going once.

549
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,210
13 million.

550
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,790
13 million now.

551
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,910
If there is no one else,

552
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,860
13 million, going once.

553
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,620
- Going--
- 14 million.

554
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,210
14 million, Ms. Jessica.

555
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,420
Wow, the price is getting higher and higher.

556
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,700
14 million, going once.

557
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,260
14 million, going twice.

558
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,650
15 million!

559
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,060
Ms. Dujmanee...

560
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:36,060
Wow, Porsche looks handsome tonight.

561
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,480
He's like an oppa.

562
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,490
That's why you brought him back.

563
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,690
Brought him back?

564
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,770
Who brought him back?

565
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,070
Khun was mad so he gave Porsche back to me.

566
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,990
He's a tool.

567
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,190
Well, you're a tool to him first.

568
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,950
That's why he got back at you.

569
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,190
Just like what Teh did to me.

570
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Oh, really?

571
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,390
Be kind to him.

572
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,860
Smile at him.

573
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,900
An butt-face like this.

574
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,910
If I were him, I wouldn't give you any respect.

575
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,910
That's true.

576
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,590
Would you care for some water?

577
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,400
What the fudge is he looking at?

578
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,230
C'mon.

579
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,770
Butt-face again.

580
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,770
Smile.

581
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,950
- What?
- Smile.

582
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,380
Okay.

583
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,840
Let the boss finish this.

584
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,300
And the next piece is the highlight
that everyone's been waiting for.

585
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:08,090
Please welcome tonight's king, "King of Night".

586
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,590
Is this what your Papa wants you to buy?

587
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,890
What's he gonna do with it?

588
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,160
Well, he surely isn't gonna wear it.

589
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,260
He's gonna have it for PR, you know?

590
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,300
Oh.

591
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,780
On society's page today...

592
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:28,790
An heir of the renowned Theerapanyakul
wins the luxurious diamond auction.

593
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,920
Let's commence the auction
of the last diamond of the night.

594
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,190
We start at 15 million Baht.

595
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,840
Still, no one?

596
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,210
30 million.

597
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:48,010
Mr. Kinn has doubled the price to 30 million.

598
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,130
Right now, if no one bid, I'm going to--

599
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,800
35 million.

600
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,500
Mr. Vegas, at 35 million.

601
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:00,910
Wow, this means the diamond
is now more than double its worth.

602
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:05,630
If there's no one else,
it'll be for Mr. Vegas at 35 million, going once.

603
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,950
35 million, going twice.

604
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,830
- 35 million--
- 40 million.

605
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,700
40 million. Oh.

606
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,900
No one is backing down.

607
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,830
- Who would get this?
- 50 millions.

608
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,480
Oh! It's 50 millions.

609
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,950
The whole crowd is in silence.

610
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:28,270
Mr. Vegas, at 50 million, going once.

611
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,950
50 millions, going twice.

612
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,100
And, 50 million--

613
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,460
100 million.

614
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,890
- Kinn
- 100 million.

615
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:34,960
That’s too much.

616
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,550
If there's no more bid, I'll start counting.

617
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,280
100 million, going once.

618
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,350
100 million, going twice.

619
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,280
And sold at 100 million!

620
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,540
Congratulations to Mr. Kinn.

621
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,380
- It was a breathtaking auction...
- Pete.

622
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,140
- May I welcome Mr. Kinn to...
- Where is Porsche?

623
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,460
- give a speech.
- I don't know.

624
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,080
First,

625
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,390
I'd like to thank all of you...

626
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,940
Ken, is Porsche there?

627
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,070
Where is Porsche?

628
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,980
who are part of this charity.

629
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,380
Thank you.

630
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,820
Please give an applause to Mr. Kinn.

631
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,610
You want me to come along?

632
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:30,530
What?

633
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,960
What happened?

634
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
I don't know.

635
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,020
Pete.

636
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,660
There's no sign.

637
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
Here.

638
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,090
Check all of the security cameras.

639
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,270
Now!

640
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,980
Don't worry.

641
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,100
I'm not gonna hurt you.

642
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,360
A guy like me doesn't like to force anyone.

643
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,500
Just wanna put a stamp on you for Kinn as a souvenir.

644
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,240
Just that, a paranoid guy like him
would be mad to death.

645
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,540
I've already got all the footages.

646
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,290
They took Porsche to the 30th floor.

647
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,710
Don't worry.

648
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,370
I'll try to be gentle.

649
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,970
So this is how you like it, huh?

650
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,930
Boss.

651
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,640
Kinn's alerted.

652
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,140
Porsche!

653
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,140
Porsche.

654
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,060
There's nothing at the balcony, Mr. Kinn.

655
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,650
Check all cameras.

656
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,180
I must have all of them tonight!

657
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,480
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

658
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,550
Porsche.

659
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,370
Mr. Kinn.

660
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,450
Let's go.

661
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,280
He's okay now.

662
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,110
This way, Mr. Kinn.

663
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,030
You all, get out.

664
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,500
- Porsche.
- Porsche!

665
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,680
Can you get up?

666
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Porsche.

667
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,080
Porsche, are you alright?

668
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,330
Mr…

669
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,080
It's alright.

670
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,270
- Mr. Kinn.
- It's alright.

671
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,190
Mr. Kinn, we'll handle...

672
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,890
Did you not hear what I said?

673
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:52,870
Porsche!

674
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,150
Hey, stay on your feet.

675
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,740
Why did you take my clothes off, huh?

676
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,230
Shower now so you'll get some rest.

677
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,200
Oh, you wanna see me naked?

678
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:32,300
You threw up.

679
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,220
Go take a shower.

680
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,330
This is so beautiful.

681
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,080
Ooh.

682
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,480
Ooh.

683
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,070
Hey, hey, Porsche.

684
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:09,350
Whoa! Whoa! There we go again.

685
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,450
Well.

686
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,500
You like me, don't you?

687
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,220
My type is nice,

688
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,220
not like you.

689
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,260
That's why he's still asleep.

690
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:31,180
Oh, you're mad?

691
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,930
You can touch mine back.

692
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,010
Focus.

693
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:24,840
Punk.

694
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,760
I'll show you

695
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,960
the real deal.

696
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,990
What, Kinn?

697
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:49,310
Oh, boy.

698
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,940
He's awake now, wow.

699
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,690
Just admit it that you like me.

700
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,420
Otherwise, why would you kiss me at the pier?

701
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,220
If your people knew that you didn't finish your work,

702
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,790
and slept with the guy who failed his task,

703
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,460
how would they feel?

704
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:33,930
Eat that!

705
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:35,270
Move.

706
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,030
Is this Porchay's number?

707
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:39,070
Are you still looking for a guitar tutor?
