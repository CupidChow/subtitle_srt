5
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,630
Those two are my parents.

6
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,910
Arthee is the only one who knows about this.

7
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,560
I'll help you find Arthee.

8
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,080
And about five million,

9
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,440
I'll take care of it.

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,550
The truth is your dad and mom didn't die in a car crash.

11
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,550
They were shot.

12
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,670
And the one who shot them was you.

13
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,970
Why would I do that?

14
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,570
Since Namphueng,

15
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,870
was my sister.

16
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,920
You can leave now.

17
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,190
I'll handle the rest.

18
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,320
The main family is getting weaker.

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,120
Especially, the head like Kinn.

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,120
You know what's going to happen after this, right?

21
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,660
So what are you gonna do next?

22
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,340
That's up to my papa.

23
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,340
But I definitely won't let
anyone do anything to Pete.

24
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,270
Just take care of him.

25
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,630
Mom, is my drawing pretty?

26
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,630
- Ooh, it's very pretty.
- Yay!

27
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,060
A little bird means freedom.

28
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,670
Full of happiness.

When you grow up,

30
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,630
you'll get stronger like a phoenix.

31
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,840
Phoenix?

32
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,029
Here, this is a phoenix.

33
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,029
Here.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,730
Grow up and fly with freedom,

35
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,730
be strong and immortal like a phoenix.

36
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,710
Take care of yourself and your brother, alright?

37
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,710
Yes, Mom.

38
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,790
Give me a kiss!

39
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
There, keep drawing.

40
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,940
Go hide! Run away!

41
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
Hey!

42
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,060
It's your fault for knowing too much.

Porsche.

44
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,150
Porsche.

45
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,010
Are you alright, huh?

46
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,390
Calm down.

47
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,390
That's not true, not true. That is not true.

48
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:23,940
That's not true.

49
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,760
Porsche.

50
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,860
Back then, you were just a child.

51
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,220
You might not be able to remember much.

52
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,830
Your mother was...

53
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,830
How dare you do this to my family?

54
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,080
Why did you kill them?

55
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,409
Papa.

56
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,409
What is this all about?

57
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,460
Porsche.

58
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100

59
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,660
And Kinn and I...

60
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,880
How could you do this to us?

61
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,370
You can take that?

62
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Is it true, Papa?

63
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,710
No.

64
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,630
Not all.

65
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,720
Nampheung,

66
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
was my foster sister.

67
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,020
She went out and lived on her own

68
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
with your dad.

69
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,380
I was the one who completely understood her.

70
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,640
But on that day, my papa forced me

71
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,800
to bring Nampheung back.

72
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,840
And I wasn't the one who shot them.

73
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,830
But it was...

74
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,560
You are all bastards.

75
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,540
Nampheung and I know the truth.

76
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,540
And how dare you to ask my wife back to your house?

77
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,330
What the heck are you saying?

78
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,690
Listen to me.

79
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,690
You know, lots of people are targeting our family.

80
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,130
Go back and talk to Papa nicely.

81
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,230
I need peace.

82
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,190
I'm done with all of that bullcrap.

83
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,190
I'm never gonna go back to your darn family.

84
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,630
What the heck did you do, Gun?

85
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,350
A guy like this deserved to die.

86
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
And how would Nampheung feel about that?

87
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,290
Nampheung...

88
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,930
Calm down.

89
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
Listen to me.

90
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
Nampheung. Nampheung.

91
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
When she came home,

92
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,890
she took pills to kill herself.

93
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,590
And why didn't you tell me that in the first place?

94
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,540
I was trying to protect you.

95
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,620
And your brother.

96
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,410
Thee was one of my people
that I sent to look after you.

97
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,200
But he was a gambler.

98
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
That's why you all were dragged down.

99
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
I'm sorry.

100
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,370
Papa.

101
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,280
Go get help.

102
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,390
Now!

103
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,790
Papa.

104
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,190
You don't have time to think
about other stuff anymore, Kinn.

105
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,890
If the minor family finds out,

106
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,220
you know what will happen.

107
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,490
The doctor is here.

108
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,120
I'm sorry. We've done our best.

109
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,790
Mr. Gun. Mr. Gun.

110
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Come here.

111
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,880
Haven't I told you not to interrupt while I rest?

112
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,380
Right, sir.

113
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,330
Mr. Gun.

114
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,580
Yes?

115
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,290
We got intel that Mr. Korn is dead.

116
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,030
Poisoned.

117
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,030
But we don't know who did it, sir.

118
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,790
Tell everyone to get ready.

119
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
We'll bring them down before they know it.

120
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,930
Yes, sir.

121
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,490
Finally, my day has come.

122
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,850
Take a seat.

123
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,210
Yes, sir.

124
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,610
Mr. Kinn.

125
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,950
Boss passed because he was poisoned.

126
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
We must find the one who did this as soon as possible.

127
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,470
One more thing,

128
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,480
the head of our branch
is starting to side with the minor family.

129
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
What are you going to do, Mr. Kinn?

130
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,480
Porsche, be careful.

131
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,060
It's time to choose.

132
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,810
Our business is done here.

133
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,570
Good luck with what you choose.

134
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,250
Mmm.

135
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,190
Greetings, everyone.

136
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,790
We're sorry for your loss.

137
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,150
Thank you.

138
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Shall we begin our meeting?

139
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,750
In three days, Mr. Vadim will sign a contract with us.

140
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,210
I don't know if the main family
has already prepared the documents.

141
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,210
But I think we should wait
until Mr. Korn's funeral is finished.

142
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,550
We should postpone it.

143
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,140
No, we can't wait.

144
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,730
Because it's almost time
to deliver the merchandise.

145
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,710
Hey, it can be postponed.

146
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,090
I know that it's sudden.

147
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,060
But if Mr. Kinn is busy,

148
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,600
maybe Mr. Gun can handle it for you.

149
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,120
Mmm.

150
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,010
Mmm.

151
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,740
I agree.

152
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,870
So do I.

153
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,250
Yes, I think so, Mr. Kinn.

154
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,980
This small matter,

155
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,980
I don't think we need my uncle to handle it.

156
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,660
It's not an easy job, Mr. Kinn.

157
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,790
We've talked to the Russians for many times now.

158
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
And we still haven't got any responses yet.

159
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,390
I think we should get an experienced person
like Mr. Gun to clear things off.

160
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,570
Really?

161
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,250
While the main family is dealing with a problem,

162
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,500
I suggest that the minor family be in charge.

163
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,700
So we won't lose any more interest.

164
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,870
Do we all agree?

165
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,650
Mmm, yes, yes.

166
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,650
No, it's too soon.

167
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,430
Mr. Kinn should give your ring to Mr. Gun.

168
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,730
Temporarily.

169
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,140
In order to make everything easier.

170
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,030
Hmm, does he need to give up his ring?

171
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,560
I think it's...

172
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
too soon?

173
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,430
That's the way it's gotta be.

174
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
So, what do you say, Mr. Kinn?

175
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Does anyone would like to
give me any more suggestion?

176
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Go.

177
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,860
Go.

178
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,590
Go!

179
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,330
Mr. Gun.

180
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Why are you here?

181
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,720
My brother passed. I have to come pay respect.

182
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,500
I didn't get any order to allow you to go up.

183
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,920
I apologize.

184
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,080
Shut the hell up.

185
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Know your place.

186
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,280
That’s why I was speaking.

187
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,770
You will be well advised to turn around and go home.

188
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,780
Don't make this a big deal.

189
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
For me.

190
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,240
I want the big deal. What are you gonna do about that?

191
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,990
Then I'm ready.

192
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,660
Vegas.

193
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
It's your time.

194
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,350
Yes, Papa.

195
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,530
Mr. Kinn.

196
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,340
The minor family has reached upstairs.

197
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
I'm sorry.

198
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,790
Hey, Pol!

199
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,490
Porsche.

200
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,790
Take Mr. Kinn with you.

201
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,510
I didn't poison your Papa.

202
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,380
I know.

203
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,130
You wouldn't do that.

204
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
Then who do you think did that?

205
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
Uncle Gun.

206
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,090
Your Papa told me so.

207
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,950
He also told me that Gun killed my parents.

208
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
And do you believe him?

209
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,340
If you believe him,

210
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,870
you have to be on the main family's side.

211
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,790
If not,

212
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,540
then we're on the different side.

213
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,520
I'm not on the main family's side.

214
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,540
And I'm not on the minor family's side.

215
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,670
But I'm on your side.

216
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,140
I have another gun. Take it.

217
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,270
The gun's here.

218
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Go!

219
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Kinn.

220
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,180
Do you know how long
I've dreamt about this moment?

221
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,790
But I still can't figure out

222
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,770
where to shoot first.

223
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,590
Head.

224
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,970
Chest.

225
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,800
Or the heart.

226
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,420
Don't!

227
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,670
Kinn, Porsche, get outta there!

228
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,510
Darn, Vegas still got away with it.

229
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,690
You got more?

230
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,530
Crushed!

231
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,580
Go!

232
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,190
Darn you, Kinn.

233
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,390
You bastard.

234
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,380
Come out.

235
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,080
Aren't you so great?

236
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,330
Huh?

237
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,710
Come out, I dare you.

238
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,860
Come here.

239
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,790
Kinn's in trouble.

240
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,070
Arm, hurry up.

241
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,140
Yes, Mr. Tankhun.

242
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,750
Activate in three, two, one.

243
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,050
Boom!

244
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
How's that? Woohoo!

245
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,580
There you go, Erika!

246
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,030
What the heck is it?

247
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,260
Don't mess with my masters!

248
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
You die!

249
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,540
There you go! Serves you right!

250
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,650
Hello, are you alright?

251
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,690
I'm okay, I'm dying my hair now.

252
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:29,130
Close the bar nicely, alright. Call me anytime.

253
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,580
It's done, nicely, Yok.

254
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,830
Don't worry.

255
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,990
I can be by myself.

256
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,290
Okay, I'll be back soon.

257
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,670
Yes, goodbye.

258
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,010
What?

259
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,780
Learn how to play.

260
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,070
Don't you see that the bar's closed?

261
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
Let me guess.

262
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
You'll take Porsche's brother as a leverage.

263
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,090
This kind of stupid plan,

264
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,480
I don't even have to ask who sent you.

265
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,590
Come on. C'mon!

266
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,300
Darn it.

267
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,690
Woo!

268
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,790
Victory.

269
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,220
Get Mr. Kinn outta here, hurry, get up!

270
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,640
Erika!

271
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,790
What's up, my beloved nephew?

272
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,730
Uncle, don't do this.

273
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,660
Nowadays, the main family
respects the minor family.

274
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,860
We equally get the same profits.

275
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,080
You have no right to teach me.

276
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,650
I'm not a greedy person like your dad,

277
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,460
who only cares about profits.

278
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,350
Porsche, come stay with me. And you'll be safe.

279
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,720
I don't know what Korn's told you.

280
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,670
But I guess I'm the villain.

281
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,270
You guys are bastards.

282
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,450
Nampheung and I know the truth.

283
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,130
And you dare ask my wife
to go back to that evil family?

284
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,410
What the heck are you saying?

285
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,750
Nampheung didn't come from a foster care.

286
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,810
But it was your papa,

287
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,800
who massacred Nampheung's whole family.

288
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,470
And now, you're hunting my family down, aren't you?

289
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,820
Your evilness runs in your blood.

290
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,520
Shut up!

291
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,290
Pathetic.

292
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,690
You're just a filthy blood who can't accept the truth.

293
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,440
It's your fault for knowing too much.

294
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,710
Korn.

295
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,860
Why did you shoot him?

296
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,110
How would Nampheung feel about that?

297
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,110
Nampheung.

298
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,640
Korn didn't mean to.

299
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,890
He just didn't mean to.

300
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,740
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

301
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,870
Alright?

302
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,560
Nampheung.

303
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,670
Nampheung. Nampheung.

304
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,590
Korn, do you see what you've done? Huh?

305
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,480
Nampheung.

306
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Nampheung.

307
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,390
Wait, wait.

308
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,240
You're gonna be alright.

309
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,050
Take Gun away.

310
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,660
Yes, sir.

311
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,320
No, I'm not going.

312
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,460
Don't come any closer.

313
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,190
Get out!

314
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,530
Nampheung.

315
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,220
Let go!

316
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,190
Nampheung.

317
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,410
Let me go!

318
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:50,180
Nampheung.

319
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,180
Let go!

320
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,500
Get off of me!

321
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,000
Nampheung.

322
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,350
Nampheung.

323
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,350
Let go!

324
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Hey.

325
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,580
Nampheung.

326
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,830
Nampheung.

327
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Nampheung.

328
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,000
I've solved the problem here.

329
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,740
Korn.

330
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,660
You're a bastard.

331
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,440
Take him home and calm him down.

332
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,650
Yes, sir.

333
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,190
Let go of me.

334
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,690
Nampheung.

335
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,850
Nampheung.

336
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,250
Let go.

337
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,750
Korn!

338
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,340
He told me that he killed everyone.

339
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,030
But look, there are still two of you.

340
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,000
What are you talking about?

341
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,830
Your dad is far more evil than you thought.

342
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,070
Till now,

343
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,480
do you know

344
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,480
how many people I loved were killed?

345
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,610
He destroyed everything.

346
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,740
He killed Nampheung.

347
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
Nampheung.

348
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,490
Whom I loved the most.

349
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,590
Get closer.

350
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,160
Yes, Mr. Tankhun.

351
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,890
That will get Kinn.

352
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,550
Mr. Tankhun.

353
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,440
Let me do it.

354
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Wait, Mr. Tankhun.

355
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,450
Hey.

356
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,790
Follow Mr. Kinn.

357
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,210
I'll handle this.

358
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,430
Yes.

359
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,790
I'm sorry for everything.

360
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
Sorry?

361
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,510
If I die today,

362
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,550
could it be you who kill me?

363
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,530
What the heck are you talking about?

364

I love you, Pete.

365

Hey.

366
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,900
Stop.

367
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
Hey.

368
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,750
That's what I thought.

369
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
Nampheung.

370
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
Hey!

371
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,080
What's this all about?

372
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,300
Mom.

373
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:55,750
Papa.

374
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,260
How could you do this to Nampheung?

375
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,200
How could you?

376
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,310
I did this to protect Nampheung.

377
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,590
That's not true.

378
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,230
You told me that Nampheung was dead.

379
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,820
That's all on you, Gun.

380
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,720
You made me lie.

381
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,640
Don't you remember?

382
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,950
You shot Pat that day.

383
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,540
Then we took Nampheung home.

384
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,470
And you molested her.

385
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,410
So she had to take the pills to take her own life.

386
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,020
Luckily, I saved her.

387
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,890
That's why I had to keep
the secret about Nampheung being alive.

388
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,670
Because if you knew,

389
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,260
you wouldn't let it go.

390
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,850
You did all of this because you're selfish.

391
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,930
You lied to everyone.

392
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,380
Korn, stop pretending.

393
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,670
Stop it.

394
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,670
No, you stop!

395
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,590
You just want all the power.

396
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,390
The truth is, you're just as bad as papa was.

397
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:19,120
Nampheung, I love you the most.

398
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,680
Please come back to me.

399
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,680
I'll protect you.

400
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,140
And everyone shall know the truth.

401
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,620
The truth that Namphueng is...

402
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,510
Don't worry.

403
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:48,300

404
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,300
I'll take care of them.

405

You freaking lied!

408

Where's the truth?

409
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,090
I did everything to protect you.

410
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,060
And your brother.

411
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,940
And your mother.

415
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,030
It's my fault,

416
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,440
I lied to Porsche.

417
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,630
But I've been waiting for this day.

418
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,100
The day that Porsche,

419
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,940
meets with his mother once again.

420
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,950
All this time,

421
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,240
I was afraid

422
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,710
that if anyone learned
that Nampheung was still alive,

423
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,560
Gun wouldn't let go.

424
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,270
And I was trying to make Porsche

425
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,700
get closer and closer to his mother.

426
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,750
Everything I did,

427
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,560
I did it for my nephew.

428
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,080
And for my sister.

I rushly took her to the hospital.

483
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,670
But the pills she took,

484
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,010
destroyed some parts of her brain,

485
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,290

Of course.
