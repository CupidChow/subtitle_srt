4
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,470
Mr. Kinn, go!

5
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,350
Help me.

6
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,190
Fifty-thousand...

7
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,270
Fine!

8
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,270
Go ahead.

9
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,350
Thanks.

10
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,190
Give me your back account number.

11
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,190
I'll transfer the money.

12
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,310
The watch was worth 700,000 Baht.

13
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,950
So we get to keep the house?

14
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,270
And the rest could cover Chay's tuition fee.

15
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,910
I think you've been fooled.

16
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,910
This watch should be at least two million Baht.

17
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,630
Where have you been?

18
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,430
Everyone knows he's a regular at my club.

19
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,190
Just leave it.

20
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,150
We could move to somewhere else.

21
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,229
If you really want me to be the bodyguard here,

22
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,470
I must be in charge of these two.

23
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,830
Alright.

24
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,110
Because now Big isn't in the condition...

25
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,110
Papa.

26
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,110
His results of the physical test,

27
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,829
and the weapon test

28
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,630
are all below standard.

29
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,870
Some people can only be a street gangster.

30
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,310
Who killed Elizabeth and Sebastian?

31
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,430
Who peed in my carp pond?

32
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,710
Was that you, newbie?

33
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,950
Take him.

34
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,630
I'll make him pay.

35
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,630
Hey, what are you doing?

36
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,590
Well, he killed my Elizabeth and Sebastian.

37
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,470
That's enough.

38
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,350
When Mr. Tankhul was little, he was kidnapped.

39
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,670
He was traumatized. That's why he's a little absurd.

40
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,670
Tonight is the opening of a new product.

41
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,830
Taken place in a five-star hotel.

42
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,990
Let me have one.

43
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,110
Porsche! Where is Mr. Kinn?

44
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,910
Do you know that you make a fool out of me?

45
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,750
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,830
What are you doing?

47
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,750
Not your business!

48
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,470
Come here.

49
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,630
Shit!

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,430
Serves you right, bastard.

51
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,829
Papa! This shithead broke my head.

52
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,829
It's my fault I can't handle my people.

53
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,470
Shall we carry on with the projects?

54
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,070
Mr. Kinn used to be kind in the past.

55
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,310
He loved his people.

56
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,390
But the reason he became cruel...

57
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,430
was not totally on him.

58
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,470
Did you hit Macau's head?

59
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,630
Well, I didn't mean to...

60
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,430
That's awesome.

61
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,430
Let me have Porsche.

62
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,670
And you can take Pete.

63
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,030
But if you really want him, then why not?

64
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,630
Yeah!

65
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,270
Be with me and it'll be fun!

66
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,870
Let's start!

67
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,470
Huh?

68
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,190
Why?

69
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,750
It's alright.

70
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,670
Who is he again?

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,250
[What! Who are you]

72
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,710
Here we go, here we go!

73
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,029
Hey, hey, hey!

74
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,950
I remember this guy, I remember him!

75
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,310
It's him!

76
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,310
That's right, Mr. Tankhun.

77
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,670
Here he comes!

78
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,350
I can really remember this guy!

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,750
C'mon, c'mon!

80
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,630
Do you think he'll die?

81
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,790
Porsche!

82
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,110
Porsche!

83
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,750
PORSCHE!

84
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,750
Huh?

85
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,670
Do you think he'll die?

86
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,150
I don't know.

87
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,590
What?

88
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,590
You didn't pay attention!

89
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,230
How about this guy, the masked one?

90
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,070
Will he die?

91
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,030
Hmm.

92
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,270
What do you guys think?

93
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,870
I think...

94
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,870
He won't.

95
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,510
You guys said he's not going to die.

96
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,150
Well, he didn't.

97
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,910
The villain did.

98
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,390
That's right. Mr. Tankhun, the villain died.

99
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,630
What?

100
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,390
I think you may have been confused.

101
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,310
What?

102
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,310
I didn't recognize the guy from the beginning?

103
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,030
Guess, we'll have to watch it again.

104
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,630
No!

105
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,070
Aren't you bored?

106
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,270
Porsche! You can't talk like that.

107
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,950
Why not?

108
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,630
You just can't.

109
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,030
Well, no.

110
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,150
Let's start.

111
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,830
You're lucky. He's in a good mood today.

112
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,310
Aren't you bored?

113
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,190
This series, I've watched it three times, man.

114
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,190
What are you gonna do?

115
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,110
Trust me.

116
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,950
Mr. Tankhun.

117
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,990
Huh?

118
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,830
I think this is getting too boring.

119
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,670
I got other series that are more thrilling and exciting.

120
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,430
Are you in?

121
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,830
Better than this?

122
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,630
Wait, why are we watching porn?

123
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,390
Or would you rather watch another soap opera?

124
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,870
I'd rather watch porn.

125
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,870
I...I'll watch this.

126
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,030
Porsche.

127
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,790
Do you think this girl will die?

128
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,790
What are you all watching?

129
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,630
Porn, of course.

130
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,270
Don't act as if you've never watched it.

131
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,390
That's enough.

132
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,909
Who showed this to my brother?

133
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,310
Damn!

134
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,310
It's Porsche.

135
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,110
What?

136
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,590
What's wrong with porn?

137
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,590
Take a look, so gigantic. Have you ever seen anything like that before?

138
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,590
Gosh, gosh, gosh.

139
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,670
Aren't you bored at all?

140
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,150
You've been watching the series all day and night. It's insane.

141
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,150
That's why I said you're better off with Mr. Kinn.

142
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,350
It's kinda fun, actually.

143
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,390
Hey, guys.

144
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,230
Okay.

145
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,030
What? Sit down, you all.

146
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:48,430
Are you done lingering?

147
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,550
I want to watch the series.

148
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,150
C'mon.

149
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,710
Aren't you bored?

150
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,070
There are so many things out there to do.

151
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,070
Out there? I'm not going anywhere unless it's necessary.

152
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,670
But if you come with me,

153
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,150
You will be thrilled.

154
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:14,390
Well, you've never been kidnapped like I was.

155
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,830
What are you afraid of, Mr. Tankhun?

156
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:23,350
You got me, Pete, Arm and Pol.

157
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,670
And that matter has passed a long time ago.

158
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,070
Who would dare do anything to you.

159
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,630
Trust me.

160
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,549
Trust you? You, Porsche?

161
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,789
I heard that you're drunk on your first job.

162
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,350
And Kinn got attacked.

163
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,270
Huh! Porsche, trust you?

164
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,390
That's a long time ago, Mr. Tankhun.

165
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,510
Long time ago?

166
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,550
We both need to give ourselves a chance.

167
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,230
Come with me, for once, please.

168
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,470
I said I wouldn't go anywhere unless it's necessary.

169
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,790
But this is necessary.

170
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,510
Unnecessary.

171
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,310
You're going.

172
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,030
No, I'm not.

173
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,350
Yes, you are.

174
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,630
I said no.

175
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,030
Oh, you're going.

176
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,630
I AM NOT GOING.

177
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,350
Yes, you are.

178
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,190
No!

179
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,870
Yes!

180
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,310
No!

181
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,470
Yes!

182
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,470
I SAID I AM NOT FREAKING GOING!

183
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,990
What's this?

184
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,990
Please sit down, Mr. Tankhun.

185
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,510
You brought me here?

186
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,190
Sit, Mr. Tankhun.

187
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,070
Alright.

188
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,070
Mr. Tankhun, trust me.

189
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,230
Ball.

190
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,110
Yes?

191
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,910
Where's Yok?

192
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,190
Freak!

193
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,180
Hell!

194
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,030
Shit, that scared me.

195
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,190
Hey, Porsche.

196
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,670
C'mon now, I've missed you, baby.

197
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,390
You brought so many people.

198
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,150
I'm going home.

199
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,510
Wait.

200
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,150
Calm down, Mr. Tankhun.

201
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,030
Mr. Tankhun, take a seat, please.

202
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,910
Freak, it's stinky and crowded.

203
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,390
Mr. Tankhun.

204
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,070
Take a look, I think she's a freak.

205
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,590
What?

206
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:32,870
Yok, Yok, Yok...

207
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,990
You are a freak too.

208
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,190
Yok, chill out.

209
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,110
Look at your outfit.

210
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,630
Huh?

211
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,190
This is a VIP customer.

212
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,230
Kinn's brother. He's a little off.

213
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,710
Oh.

214
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,710
Please take care of him.

215
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,750
Tankhun Theerapanyakul.

216
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,990
You know me?

217
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,230
Ah, what a beautiful name.

218
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,830
Well, welcome to Hum Bar!

219
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,190
Alright, Porsche, take a good care of your friends.

220
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,350
Make some drinks, dear, hurry up!

221
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,590
Actually, it's not that bad.

222
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,670
Mr. Tankhun.

223
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,110
This kind of vibe...

224
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,510
You can't find it at home.

225
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,270
So, I've handled everything as you asked.

226
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,270
How could it not be luxurious, huh?

227
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,030
So Mr. Tankhun, how do you like it here?

228
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,030
Are you bored?

229
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,470
It's not fun at all. I'd better leave.

230
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,190
Oh, no, no, Mr. Tankhun.

231
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,430
But we just got here.

232
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,590
Well, it's boring.

233
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,190
Watching series at home is more enjoyable.

234
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,190
Lousy music, I can tell. I'll bring it on!

235
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,910
Porsche knows what he's doing.

236
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,910
Cheers, Mr, Tankhun.

237
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,110
This is not right.

238
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,470
Let me do it.

239
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,660
Oh, shit, wrong one.

240
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,670
Hey, why did you turn that off?

241
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,590
I loved it.

242
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,590
Bring it on!

243
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,190
So, why are y'all standing still? Let's dance!

244
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,430
Mr. Tankhun, be careful.

245
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,070
What's all this?

246
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,270
Kinn, Porsche took me to see the world.

247
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,310
Very...

248
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,150
Fun.

249
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,470
You're able to take my brother out of this house?

250
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,430
Yes. Aren't I just great?

251
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,430
You, come with me.

252
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,350
You're in trouble, Porsche.

253
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,420
Call me anytime.

254
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,310
Good luck, man.

255
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,470
Mr. Tankhun.

256
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,750
Watch out, Mr. Tankhun.

257
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,230
Shooting up the sky! Woohoo!

258
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,430
What am I doing here?

259
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,350
You'll be escorting my friend home.

260
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,310
Pete's already left. I don't wanna bother him.

261
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,470
But you can bother me?

262
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,790
Well, you're free.

263
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,790
Who says so?

264
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,270
My new boss got more exciting things to do than my old boss.

265
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,350
Like what?

266
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,790
Watching series.

267
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,550
Partying.

268
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,430
Excuse me.

269
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,430
I'm done here.

270
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,710
Porsche will drop you off at your place.

271
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,710
Okay, then...see you soon.

272
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,590
Mmm, see you.

273
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,470
Snached!

274
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,470
Fab!

275
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,590
Mr. Tankhun.

276
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,670
Huh?

277
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,390
Arm and Pol are not here.

278
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,030
They must be over-resting. I'll go get them for you, okay?

279
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,550
No need to.

280
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,310
Papa has a meeting outside today.

281
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,270
So the best bodyguards are there to protect him.

282
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,390
Porsche, let's dye our hair!

283
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,910
Here.

284
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,310
I bought you one.

285
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,910
Same color as mine.

286
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,790
Alright? So we'll have the same hair color.

287
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,230
Come on.

288
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,470
What's that face?

289
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,190
Kinn said a kid who failed the tasks like you will die out there for nothing.

290
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,910
So staying home with me is better.

291
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,550
What? Come here. C'mon.

292
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,430
I think I'm gonna do it 3-4 times. I want it to be more reddish.

293
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,950
Like, super snached!

294
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,510
What? C'mon, c'mon now.

295
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,510
Sit. You sit here.

296
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,590
Let me take a look.

297
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,030
Your hair is healthy.

298
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,430
Dye it just once is good enough.

299
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,310
The JSP bullets...

300
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,910
Porsche.

301
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,990
I'm watching the series here.

302
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,990
What's going on now?

303
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,950
The bullet...

304
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,230
Bullets right in your ass.

305
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,830
Get over there and don't make any sound.

306
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,630
Go!

307
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,630
Rewind it now.

308
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,390
Flip! I can't take this anymore!

309
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,390
Mr. Tankhun, please stay calm.

310
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,829
Now!

311
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,510
Ouch!

312
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,630
Porsche!

313
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,150
Do it gently.

314
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,910
Did you burn my head?

315
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,670
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,590
But didn't you just dye your hair?

317
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,710
And you're washing it off now.

318
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,230
Wouldn't that damaged your hair?

319
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,110
What's the problem?

320
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,630
I want the old color.

321
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,310
Can I not?

322
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,630
It's good stuff we got here.

323
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,750
I can wash, I can dye, I can wipe it off as many times as I want.

324
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,750
You don't buy it? Touch it.

325
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,950
See? Is it damaged?

326
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,950
Not a chance.

327
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,110
That's true.

328
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,110
Yeah.

329
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,270
Go, Porsche! Go, Porsche!

330
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,910
Hey.

331
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,630
Nice one.

332
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,630
Loser.

333
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,710
You're alright.

334
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,390
You're the best, man!

335
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,550
It's point four two second delay.

336
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,110
Point four two second?

337
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,390
Time is about life and death.

338
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,390
Four minutes lack of oxygen deficiency will kill your brain cells.

339
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,830
A plane normally flies at 850 kilometers per hour.

340
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,670
Or about 236 meters per second.

341
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,670
But M16 bullet...

342
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,830
Travels at 840 meters per second.

343
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,310
That means...

344
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,750
Just a split second that you're slowing down

345
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,190
Is the chance of having yourself killed.

346
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,150
Therefore, time is imperative for a bodyguard.

347
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,150
You got more to learn, pal.

348
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,270
Mr. Tankhun, can't we just play one game at a time?

349
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,550
No. The series is about to start. I must hurry...

350
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,310
Yeah! one, zero!

351
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,830
How's that? one and zero.

352
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,310
It's your turn, Mr. Tankhun.

353
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,710
My turn?

354
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,630
Your turn now.

355
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,630
Go on.

356
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,070
Porsche!

357
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,430
Huh?

358
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,430
Your turn.

359
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,070
Two zero, two zero, two zero!

360
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,670
Hey!

361
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,230
W-what?

362
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,300
You're done!

363
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,790
I'm gonna get you good.

364
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,990
I'll take a leak.

365
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,470
Keep practicing until you're as good as me.

366
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,270
I'll be back.

367
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,270
Yes, sir.

368
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,710
Oh, you're gonna be so done!

369
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,470
You're so bad, Porsche.

370
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,470
Why should I practice? It's just a stupid game.

371
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,710
Such a waste of time.

372
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,150
C'mon.

373
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,030
This is so comforting.

374
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,990
And you won't have so much in your hands like Pete.

375
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,270
Today, he's collecting debt at a house.

376
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,590
Whose house?

377
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,750
One of Mr. Kinn's work partners's.

378
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,550
If they don't clear things off today,

379
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,630
It's gonna be a big deal.

380
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,910
It's good that I didn't go.

381
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,910
Have they been out for long?

382
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,910
I guess. I don't know.

383
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,630
I'm off.

384
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,910
Hey, Porsche. Where are you going? Mr. Tankhun will...Porsche!

385
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,310
I know it's my fault.

386
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,750
But I'm really in the red.

387
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,750
My kid is still so little.

388
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,230
You owe me millions.

389
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,870
You've embezzled from the company.

390
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,870
Those, I can still let them go.

391
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,670
But you selling my secret...

392
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,270
Isn't just a rumor, is it?

393
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,750
Make him talk!

394
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,310
Please, for the sake of me working with your family for so long.

395
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,990
Then you'll know...

396
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,990
What you'll have to face.

397
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,150
Pete.

398
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,670
You're thinking that you made a wrong desicion coming here?

399
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,430
He must really have no way out.

400
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,430
That's why he's acting stupid.

401
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,950
Is he going to die?

402
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,150
This is just a lesson. We're teaching him a lesson.

403
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,190
I know it very well...

404
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,190
that having no way out could really make you do anything.

405
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,190
My family used to do informal loan.

406
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,990
If we had delay payments, they'd come to teach us a lesson.

407
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,990
They teach us more often than my teachers did.

408
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,030
I freaking hate them.

409
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,030
I never thought that I'd be like one of them today.

410
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,510
When I was little, I used to watch superheroes movie with my friends.

411
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,150
We fought to be this and that hero...

412
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,190
Then I grew up and found out that...

413
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,150
There's no heroes nor villains in this world.

414
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,150
I give you three days.

415
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,990
Kinn!

416
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,630
Stop!

417
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,430
Put the gun down.

418
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,510
I got no choice.

419
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,870
They make me do it.

420
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,270
Who?

421
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,430
I can't tell you.

422
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,710
I just can't.

423
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,550
Let me go.

424
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:29,030
You put the gun down and tell us who...

425
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:33,030
We promise that we won't shoot you.

426
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,230
We promise that we won't do anything to you.

427
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,070
Are you okay?

428
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,550
Tough day, huh?

429
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,190
Yeah.

430
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,590
Then you be still.

431
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,590
I'll handle it.

432
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,830
Please stop.

433
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,390
Get out.

434
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,830
Hey.

435
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,830
What are you doing here?

436
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,220
This place belongs to me. Do I have to tell you everywhere I go, huh?

437
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,190
I'm just asking, Mr. Kinn.

438
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,190
Just a manners, you know?

439
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,630
How's your wound?

440
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,230
It'll heal.

441
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,310
It's just a scratch.

442
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,990
Give it to me.

443
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,990
Ouch.

444
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,750
Sit.

445
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,910
Be gentle!

446
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,510
I heard that you've been training so hard.

447
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,750
I just want to make someone regret.

448
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,030
Regret?

449
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,310
Regret for?

450
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,390
This place belongs to me.

451
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:39,430
So every single thing belongs to me.

452
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,390
There, you're fine.

453
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,590
Wait.

454
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,350
Today,

455
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,150
Mes said someone hired him to kill you...

456
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,190
Can you guess who it may be?

457
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,790
I've told you.

458
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,790
Everyone wants me dead.

459
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,470
But if he or she knows your whereabouts and schedule,...

460
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,430
It couldn't just be anyone.

461
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,830
Are you telling me that...

462
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,310
It's an insider?

463
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,830
Then whom I'll be suspecting the most is...

464
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,830
Look at what I've just been through.

465
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,230
And you're still thinking that it's me?

466
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,510
If you've ever been in my situation,

467
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,670
You'll suspect everyone.

468
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,550
Who is it?

469
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,550
It's me, Mr. Kim.

470
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,950
Are you at the wrong place?

471
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,950
This is not Kinn's.

472
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,470
I happen to be in a cast,

473
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,510
So Mr. Korn's switched me to take care of you instead, Mr. Kim.

474
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,390
And who watches out for Kinn?

475
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,310
Ken?

476
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,190
No, sir.

477
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,190
Mr. Korn took a new bodyguard in to take care of Mr. Kinn.

478
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,150
A new bodyguard? Taking care of Kinn?

479
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,150
Yes, sir. I don't really understand it either.

480
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,430
Normally, when we have new bodyguards,

481
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,990
We'll dig into their backgrounds specifically.

482
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:48,710
But this one, we don't really know...

483
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,270
About who he is, where he's from.

484
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,150
His skills aren't that good.

485
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,150
Now, he's tranferred to take care of Mr. Tankhun.

486
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,110
That's bad.

487
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,550
Actually, it's quite good.

488
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,070
So he doesn't have to be involved with Mr. Kinn.

489
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,270
I mean, bad for you.

490
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,470
Everyone wants to steal Kinn away for themselves.

491
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,390
Do you want one heartbroken song, huh?

492
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:23,950
If Mr. Kim is doing alright, then I won't bother you anymore, sir.

493
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,990
Excuse me, I have to go report to Mr. Korn.

494
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,030
Wait.

495
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:35,070
What's the name of the new bodyguard?

496
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,470
His name is Porsche.

497
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,270
Porsche.

498
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,470
Excuse me.

499
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,340
Guess where I'm bringing you to celebrate!

500
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,430
Yok's bar, Mr. Tankhun.

501
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,429
How could you know that?

502
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,070
Well, do you know any other bar?

503
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,030
I was the one who brought you here.

504
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,510
I'm going home.

505
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,949
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

506
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,469
Well, now that you're here...

507
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,630
What?

508
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,710
Tonight, I'll show you the whole world.

509
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,310
There.

510
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,030
Oh, Kinn!

511
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,870
Why did you follow me?

512
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,870
If you're taking me home, I'm just gonna say I won't.

513
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,750
Porsche said it's so much fun here.

514
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,630
So I want to know if it's true.

515
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,350
Khun, why didn't you invite me?

516
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,030
Hmm, as if you party at this kind of bar.

517
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,989
If Kinn didn't ask us to come, you wouldn't come.

518
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,830
C'mon, don't fight.

519
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,870
The more, the merrier.

520
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,430
But know this, partying with Tankhun...

521
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,870
Do not lower your energy, okay?

522
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,590
Well, well, now that Mr. Kinn and his friends are here,

523
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,990
Tonight, I, Porsche will give you the damn blast...

524
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,670
That you'll never forget.

525
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,150
Very well.

526
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,870
Right?

527
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:25,590
What's up, rockers!

528
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:36,590
Give us Horse's Stomp, Tiger's Power, Elephant Crusher, Lady's Wish, and Daybreak.

529
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,470
Right away!

530
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,590
Mr. Tankhun.

531
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,510
This is so upbeating.

532
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,190
C'mon, drink up!

533
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,460
Drink, drink, drink!

534
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,790
Hey.

535
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,470
If you think this is fun...

536
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,630
There's more!

537
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,630
Come right in!

538
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,110
Porsche, is this your friend? He dresses so crazily.

539
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,550
Yeah, he's a little out of it like that.

540
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,910
You just go along. Have a freaking blast tonight!

541
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,190
Okay!

542
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,190
Mr. Tankhun, this is my friend. Battle him!

543
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,590
Your friend?

544
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,110
Absolutely, for Porsche...

545
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,110
Tonight, it's all on me!

546
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,990
Hey.

547
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,310
That's my song.

548
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,270
Pol.

549
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,950
Where are you, Pol?

550
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,910
Let's dance, Pol.

551
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,710
I'm right under your foot.

552
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,030
What? If you wanna sleep, go home.

553
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,670
C'mon.

554
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,030
What's with you?

555
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,110
Hurry.

556
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,510
Let's lie down together.

557
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,110
It's lonely lying here alone.

558
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,950
Isn't it dirty?

559
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,910
C'mon now, would you?

560
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,910
See? I've already wiped all the dust.

561
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,910
Alright, whatever!

562
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,790
What are you thinking?

563
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,710
Has anyone ever told you that...

564
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,830
When you're drunk...

565
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,430
You're so...

566
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,430
So...what?

567
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,430
So making me wanna kick you.

568
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:30,230
When was the last time you're this happy?

569
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,110
Seconds ago.

570
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,590
Okay.

571
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,310
What are you thinking?

572
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,310
I'm thinking about...

573
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,510
Thinking about...

574
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,550
I'm thinking about my Dad and my Mom.

575
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:16,510
They've passed since I was little.

576
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,750
I had no one to depend on.

577
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,750
So I had to make an informal loan.

578
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,990
They came to collect the freaking debts every month.

579
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,630
Everytime I heard the knocking on my door,

580
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:38,670
I would be terrified if it was them.

581
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,750
No wonder...

582
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:46,750
You're trying to negotiate with Mes.

583
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,990
I'm just sad.

584
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,990
I'm sad that I've done everything that I hate today.

585
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,910
I collected the debt.

586
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,350
I killed someone.

587
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,350
I killed a father.

588
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:27,110
I think his kid would be in much trouble as I was, definitely.

589
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:38,910
You've walked this path for just one month,

590
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,230
yet you feel so much about it.

591
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,230
Now think.

592
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,230
I've lived in this world my whole life.

593
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,230
How can you handle it?

594
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,270
Do I have a choice? Huh?

595
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,750
Thank you...

596
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,790
For saving my life.

597
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,360
And not letting me fight against that family.

598
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,480
Thank you.

599
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:50,550
♫ Tonight, If we're looking into each others' eyes ♫

600
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:57,680
♫ Today, If we're still holding hands ♫

601
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,620
♫ It doesn't matter ♫

602
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,210
♫ even the world falls apart ♫

603
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,790
Tomorrow, there's a diamond auction.

604
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,470
You must be there as my bodyguard.

605
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:42,070
We start at 15 million.

606
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,150
30 million.

607
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,140
35 million.

608
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,910
Pete.

609
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,910
Where is Porsche?
