How could you do this to your families?

00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,500
That filthy family.

7
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,860

how a guy like you should be punished?

14
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,410

15

I told you to keep an eye on Porsche.

The main family has put you on the blacklist.

please tell them that Pete's home.

91

I guess I'll bring a pet to keep me company.

Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

100

Hello, Grandma.

101

C'mon, don't think too much.

111
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,290
I'd love a rest myself.

112

What's going on?

113
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,400

114
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,750
I wanna talk about Porsche.

115
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,980
I'll let him resign.

116
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
What?

117
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,870
You know that in this business,
once you get in, it's hard to get out.

118
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,870
Yes.

119
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,730
I do know that.

120
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,870
But his brother begged him not to work here.

121
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,620
So? What does that have to do with you?

122
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,040
He said being a bodyguard is too dangerous.

123
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,000
C'mon, you hired him to be your bodyguard.

124
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,800
Are you gonna let him stay home
and make flower garlands?

125
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Right?

126
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,790
Getting worried all of a sudden?

127
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,790
Whoa!

128
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,340
Or he's trying to betray us?

129
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,930
Right, or does he get on your nerves?

130
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,930
Or did he make another mistake?

131
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,360
Or do you hate him?

132
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,870
Right, but why would that matter?

133
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,300
Or does he stink?

134
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,890
Or he's afraid of dying in all of a sudden?

135
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,240
Yeah, what is it, Kinn? Huh?

136
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,170
Huh?

137
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,640
I...

138
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,150
I love him.

139
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,600
That's all.

140
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,420
Oh.

141
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
Kinn.

142
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,530
That's it?

143
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,810
Papa would totally be okay with that, right, Papa?

144
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,810
You told us that you loved Porsche.

145
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,850
My Kinn.

146
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,710
That's so cute.

147
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,680
Go! Go!

148
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Go, Porsche!

149
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,870
Hey, don't push.

150
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,310
This is so lit.

151
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,400
A mafia shouts in the meeting room,

152
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,570
"I'm in love with my bodyguard"

153
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,540
Hey, worry about your friend first.

154
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,530
See. We don't know what'll happen to him.

155
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,490
Kinn said he loves you, correct?

156
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
Yes.

157
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,850
Yes, sir.

158
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,630
And you?

159
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,330
Do you love him?

160
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,620
I love him.

161
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,780
Whoa, shoot!

162
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,970
And that bodyguard announces in the meeting room,

163
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,740
"My heat belongs to my boss only"

164
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,330
Actually, there's no rule here,

165
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,510
about the boss and his subordinate to be in love.

166
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,470
But love will be an obstacle to work.

167
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,470
Papa.

168
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,780
I'm not going to let you be Kinn's bodyguard anymore.

169
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,730
What?

170
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,320
Daddy doesn't like it.

171
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Daddy wants a breakup.

172
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,830
But I'll let you and your brother stay here,

173
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,950
as Kinn's boyfriend.

174
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,950
Yeah! Woohoo!!!

175
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,340
If you'd like anything,

176
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,860
you can call me 24/7, sir.

177
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,000
It's alright.

178
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,770
I've got someone to keep me company.

179
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,770
Yes, sir.

180
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,970
Somebody must be hungry.

181
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,970
Right?

182
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,200
Oh.

183
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
I forgot to feed another pet.

184
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,790
Eat it.

185
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,140
You know,

186
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,020
what you did,

187
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,220
is a waste of food.

188
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,890
I told you to eat.

189
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,570
Yummy?

190
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,570
Eat!

191
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,050
How's it?

192
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,570
Alright.

193
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,790
A good pet listens to his owner.

194
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,420
Eat it all.

195
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,730
Sorry about that.

196
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,730
Did I scare you, buddy?

197
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,870
I'm going to introduce you
to the new bodyguards for Mr. Kinn.

198
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,140
I've chosen them myself.

199
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,140
This is the ex-boxing champion, aka The Metal Bones.

200
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,440
And this is the ex-commando.

201
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,680
Here.

202
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,670
This is the bodybuilder champion.

203
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,630
And here.

204
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,090
Ex-assasin of the Bang Nam Preaw.

205
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,100
Aka The Cruel.

206
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,970
Here,

207
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,970
we got a female Taekwondo champion.

208
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,640
Have you seen them before?

209
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,910
Porsche handpicked them himself.

210
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,050
Only five made it to the finals.

211
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Why are there only five left?

212
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,700
Because the good ones were cut out.

213
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,190
What's with this jealousy?

214
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,190
What jealousy?

215
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,070
These five aren't so bad.

216
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,120
- Hey, uncle!
- He just faints.

217
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,040
Hurry up!

218
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,780
Uncle!

219
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
Are you alright?

220
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,380
You said you're okay earlier.

221
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,420
- Uncle!
- Go get him.

222
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,380
Why did you say you're okay earlier?

223

[Car accident. Two rich deaths

224
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,640
Porsche's Dad and Mom?

225
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,920
I heard that they got hit to death by someone wealthy.

226
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,840
And the case was cut loose.

227
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,830
They still haven't found the driver yet.

228
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,820
Find out who did it for me.

232
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,860
Yeah.

233
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,630
Right now, I'm trying to find a new bodyguard for Kinn.

234
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,930
Still haven't found the good ones.

235
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,720
Maybe I was being too picky.

236
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,350
And what made you decide to do this job?

237
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,610
Give me a reason.

238
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,140
All I thought about was you then.

239
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,380
I didn't think that it'd get this far.

240
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,180
All I did was for you, Chay.

241
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,170
All you did?

242
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,510
If all you did was really for me,

243
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,430
then you gotta hear what I have to say.

244
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,890
We got only each other.

245
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,990
What if something happens to you,

246
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,790
whom will I be with?

247
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,120
I promise you,

248
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,860
that I'm gonna be okay.

249
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,590
If something happens to you, I'll...

250
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,680
I'll be so mad and I'll never forgive you.

251
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,310
And I'll...

252
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,820
Listen to me, Chay.

253
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,030
I'm right here.

254
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,110
I'm right in front of you.

255
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,490
I'm not leaving you.

256
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,910
Do you hear me?

257
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,120
But can I ask you something?

258
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,220
Mmm.

259
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,780
Can I take care of both you and Kinn?

260
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
I can't leave anyone behind.

261
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,990
I miss you so much, bro.

262
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
I miss you too.

263
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,390

Mmm.

Well, I'm here.

266

What am I supposed to do, Papa?

267
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,350
Do you think I wanna be here?

268
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,990
What the heck are you looking at?

269
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
Is he crazy?

270
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,630
When you're free,

271
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,290
tell him how to be a good pet.

272
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,470
Whom is he talking to?

273
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,470
Me or the hedgehog?

274
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Why didn't you eat?

275
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,740
I'm not eating.

276
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,290
What?

277
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,290
Not eating?

278
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,490
Do you think you can choose?

279
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,350
I'm not choosing.

280
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,350
I'm just not eating.

281
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,740
You know,

282
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,300
what an untamed pet

283
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,500
would get?

284
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,070
Well, I don't like it.

285
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,060
I'm not hungry.

286
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,920
I'm gonna hurt you.

287
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
So you'll remember.

288
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
You're no fun at all.

289
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,290
Do you think I wouldn't know about your stupid plan?

290
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,560
You think you can get away?

291
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,700
Oh, you're darn good.

So?

294
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,400
What's next?

295
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,350
You know?

296
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:50,950
Huh?

297
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,830
I'm so not used to this room.

298
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,170
You act like you've never spent a night here.

299
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,360
Well, I have.

300
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,440
But this is the first time

301
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,290
when I don't have to hide it from anyone.

302
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,330
When I was little, my mom
used to blow dry my hair like this too.

303
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,590
Then,

304
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,160
tonight, can I be the one to do that?

305
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Just wake him up.

306
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,990
Shoot.

307
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,830

308
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,040
Oh, man!

309
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,940
Now we know why you aren't awake yet.

310
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,220
Rough night, huh?

311
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,140
Tell me about it.

312
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,850
I gotta go.

313
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,850
Hey, where are you going?

314
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,850
We're a couple now. What's there to be shy about?

315
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,100
I told you they'd end up together.

316
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,150
No need to be shy, fool.

317
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,790
Are we celebrating tonight?

318
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,540
Cheers to my friend's last glimpse of freedom,

319
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,020
and to slavery.

320
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,540
I know because I've been there before.

321
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,330
Slavery, my butt!

322
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,590
Porsche!

323
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,320
Drink up! It's on Time tonight.

324
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Because he's lost his bet.

325
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,890
What did you guys bet on?

326
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,150
Well,

327
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,670
that you're gonna be my love slave.

328
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,140
Love slave, love slave!

329
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,770
What love slave?

330
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,890
Can I be the love slave too? Huh, guys?

331
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,720
Your outfit is so sassy.

332
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,860
So, what's up? Tell me. What love slave?

333
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,820
Huh, Mr. Kinn?

334
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,940
You're making my baby your love slave?

335
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,890
Huh?

336
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,610
Have you asked my permission?

337
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,720
He's got an adult watching over him.

338
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,240
Well, let me have a toast for my mother-in-law!

339
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,840
Wow, mother-in-law!

340
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,830
So, you're proposing like this,

341
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,220
do you love my baby?

342
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,600
Huh?

343
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,920
C'mon, let us hear ya.

344
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,790
Oh, he's shy.

345
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,990
I love Porsche.

346
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,440
Man, that's almost muted.

347
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,480
Muted.

348
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,160
I LOVE PORSCHE.

349
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,200
Yeah!

350
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,190
Alright! Cheers!

351
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,180
My baby is taken!

352
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
That's my friend!

353
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,460
Aww, still being so shy.

354
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,460
C'mon, it's on me tonight.

355
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,450
I'll be right back.

356
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,390
Hey, I'll be back.

357
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,350
Where are you going?

358
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,130
Why, are you gonna follow me?

359
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,660
I'm gonna go pee.

360
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,040
Alright, make it quick.

361
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,680
He's got a big smile while going to pee.

362
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,310
Hey, guys!

363
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,580
- Huh?
- Well...

364
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,890
What?

365
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,450
It's Porsche's birthday this Saturday.

366
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,730
And...

367
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,530
I don't know what to get him.

368
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,820
Mmm.

369
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,179
Why don't you bow tie yourself?

370
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,389
You know exactly where to tie, right?

371
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,639
C'mon, man, get real here.

372
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,250
I'm being serious.

373
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,130
This is our first year's gift.

374
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,679
I wanna surprise him.

375
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,650
Then, surprise him.

376
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,880
Do what only you can do.

377
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,940
Okay.

378
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:32,630
Go!

379
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,030
Cheers!

380
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,870
Cheers!

381
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,870
Thank you. Thank you.

382
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,429
Papa, hello.

383
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,300
[Childhood's End Arthur C. Clarke]

384
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,230
The gold mine deal that
you're responsible for is crushed.

385
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,770
Maybe that's because the situation
right now is not so good.

386
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,460
So they ran off.

387
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,910
That's all on you.

388
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,420
You stupid boy!

389
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,300
You only cause disaster.

390
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,770
In this life,

391
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,720
you'll never be able to beat Kinn.

392
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,310
You and Macau,

393
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:38,320
aren't even worthy of being my sons.

394
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,910
Fudge!

395
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,160
Don't pretend like you're alseep.

396
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,430
Get up and laugh at me.

397
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,690
Pete.

398
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,390
Don't get on my nerve.

399
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,760
Pete.

400
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,410
Hey.

401
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,410
Pete.

402
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,140
Hey.

403
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,240
Pete.

404
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
Pete.

405
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,990
Get up.

406
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
Pete.

407
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
Pete.

408
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,230
You want it? You want it?

409
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,120
Fight me!

410
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,350
I told you!

411
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,110
I told you! How's that?

412
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,410
Bring your face here, closer.

413
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,450
- Closer!
- Ouch!

414
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,010
I'm starting to have fun. I'm enjoying this.

415
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:20,880
C'mon.

416
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,960
Hurry.

417
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,800
Come on!

418
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,840
I told you. I'm with luck today!

419
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,830
Come on!

420
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Oh!

421
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,860
You're Porsche's little bro, right?

422
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,820
Yes.

423
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,360
You are...

424
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm Kinn's big brother.

425
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Khun-Tankhun Theerapanyakul.

426
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,400
Er...

427
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,640
Hello.

428
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,840
My name is Porchay-Pichaya Kittisawat.

429
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,900
Oh, you come with a full name too.

430
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,170
Come here, come here! Sit down.

431
00:37:59,170 --> 00:37:59,740
Yes.

432
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:06,470
You look much more polite
than Porsche, you guys think so?

433
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,510
Yes.

434
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,000
Do you like watching the series?

435
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,650
I watch them sometimes.

436
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,900
If you do, have you ever watched this one?

437
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,850
Yes, I have.

438
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,280
You do. Then,

439
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,730
do you think the protagonist will die?

440
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,620
Protagonist? Er...

441
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,510
Nope, he didn't die but the bad guy did.

442
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,110
Wow, excellent!

443
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,910
You really have watched it!

444
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,210
You're smarter than my bodyguards!

445
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,200
You two, take him as your example.

446
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,520
Don't be so stupid.

447
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,860
Yes.

448
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,370
Hey, relax.

449
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,930
Don't be nervous.

450
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,290
Hanging out with Tankhun,

451
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,960
there's only chilling atmosphere.

452
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,410
You know, I've raised my two brothers.

453
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,500
They all turn out well.

454
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,820
And next, it's you I'll be raising.

455
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,040
Right?

456
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,810
Ah, wait.

457
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,530
Isn't there only Kinn?

458
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,810
Why did you say two brothers?

459
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,240
Here.

460
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,800
Here.

461
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,440
Look at this.

462
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,330
How's that?

463
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,330
This is my work.

464
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,220
They're all grown and good-looking like me.

465
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,330
You'll be like me too.

466
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,310
Trust me and it'll all be good.

467
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,700
Remember that, Porchay.

468
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,580
And...

469
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,190
And the other one is...

470
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,490
Kim.

471
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,630
My youngest brother.

472
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,650
I thought you met him already.

473
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,590
He went to the warehouse to help you.

474
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,100
Helped me at the warehouse?

475
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,140
Whatever, man.

476
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,320
Kim's never really around.

477
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,400
He moved out to live on his own a long time ago.

478
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,540
He's kinda like an artist.

479
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,830
But one thing about him is he's nosy.

480
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,200
The nosiest one.

481
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,690
Well, actually, he got that from me.

482
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,990
Take it.

483
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,010
No.

484
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,350
Your wounds are inflamed.

485
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,390
Just take it.

486
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,390
Then just let me die.

487
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,790
You think it's poison?

488
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,230
Why don't you just let me die?

489
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
That's too easy.

490
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,790
You must suffer until I'm satisfied.

491
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,450
What happened to you?

492
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,890
My papa just left.

493
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,420
He scolded me for being suck.

494
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,450
I suck at everything I do.

495
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,290
Well, I deserved that.

496
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,080
Whatever I do, I can't seem to beat your boss.

497
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,990
Why do you have to compare?

498
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,140
Everyone just knows that I'm Vegas.

499
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,200
From the minor family.

500
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
Always under the main family.

501
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,020
Everyone has the good and the bad part.

502
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,980
You're doing it for your papa.

503
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,820
That makes you a good son, doesn't it?

504
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,280
You only look at this world on the bright side.

505
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:58,050
You've never gone through what I have.

506
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,680
Who said so?

507
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,320
When I was little, my dad forced me into boxing.

508
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,750
When I lost, he beat me up.

509
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,840
Until one day, I won.

510
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,780
So he stopped beating you?

511
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,890
No.

512
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,890
He still beat me.

513
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,960
I found out later that

514
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,730
he had been a boxer.

515
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,450
The difference was that

516
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,670
he never won.

517
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,630
And he kept that pain and took it out on me.

518
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,000
You're saying my Papa sucks?

519
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,450
And has he ever beaten Mr. Korn?

520
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,370
Got it now?

521
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,520
They don't beat us because we suck.

522
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,300
They beat us

523
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,380
because they, themselves, suck.

524
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
Nosy.

525
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,140
Hello, Kim.

526
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,370
The youngest brother of the main family.

527
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,410
Are you used to your new home now?

528
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,050
So you knew all along that I'm Porsche's bro?

529
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:55,970
Yes.

530
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,780
If not, why would I tutor you?

531
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,230
How could you say that?

532
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,830
If there's nothing, excuse me.

533
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,570
Let me just ask you this.

534
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,300
Have you ever loved me?

535
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:27,990
Huh?

536
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:30,790
Kim.

537
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:35,990
I'm sorry.

538
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,440
Thank you.

539
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
He did it again?

540
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,750
Are you okay?

541
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,870
Are you not used to it yet?

542
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,950
And are you hurt?

543
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,720
I am hurt.

544
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,720
But I don't know why it's not as bad as before.

545
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:54,830
That's good.

546
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,990
You're still not eating?

547
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,740
Did you make it a while ago? It just doesn't look fresh.

548
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,440
Is this mine?

549
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,440
Are you gonna eat it or not?

550
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,310
Shoot.

551
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,790
Or did he put poison in it?

552
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,790
I can't die like a fool like.

553
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,840
What fricking poison?

554
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,560
Look.

555
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:31,220
Go ahead and eat it.

556
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,220
If you hate me, you'll have energy to kill me later.

557
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,530
What's wrong?

558
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,630
Turbulence.

559
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:19,890
Here.

560
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,970
Bless the flower, joss stick, and candle here

561
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,940
and give them to the monk inside.

562
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,280
Bless the flower, joss stick, and candle here...

563
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,760
Hello, Inspector Manop.

564
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,390
Do you remember your old case?

565
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,390
The wealthy car hit a family 10 years ago?

566
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,890
The whole folder of the case is missing.

567
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,840
A guy of my reputation still couldn't find a name.

568
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,840
Just be honest.

569
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,810
What really happened?

570
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:27,300
Manop has Alzheimer's.

571
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,050
He doesn't remember much.

572
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:33,050
His relatives brought him here
for the temple to take care.

573
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,390
Please, Ms.

574
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,250
It's alright.

575
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,510
Then...

576
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:51,510
Do you remember this woman?

577
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:02,130
Her dad is a policeman working on that case.

578
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:07,060
But suddenly, he quit and got Alzheimer's.

579
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,880
And he moved into the temple.

580
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,160
But after that,

581
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:19,590
There's money transferred
into her account every month.

582
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,200
My guess,

583
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,190
it's the cost for you to play
the role of an old man with Alzheimer's.

584
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,020
What do you want?

585
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,970
If you remember

586
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,580
who ordered you to erase everything about the case,

587
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,210
I will forget

588
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,950
about who the woman in this pic is.

589
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,630
The one who ordered me to erase
everything about that case,

590
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,520
was Mr. Korn, your father.

591
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,510
Hello, Mr. Kinn.

592
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,010
It's been a long time.

593
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:50,440
Everytime I'm in a bad mood,

594
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,640
your eyes say you like it.

595
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,020
Let it out.
