can be told by the pet too.

153
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,090

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,450
That's the last thing my mom and dad have left for me.

175
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,130
What the heck were you thinking?

177
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,130
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,100
I... I...

179
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,310
What the heck did you want, Kinn?

180
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,520
I didn't mean to.

181
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,050
I didn't even know then.

182
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,040
I was just following my papa's order.

183
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,220
And why me?

184
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,340
Answer me.

185
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:41,930
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,060
Don't touch me.

187
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,060
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,700
Back off.

189
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,630
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,030
I promise you.

191
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,510
Whatever you want to know,

192
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,510
I'll find every answer for you.

193
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,210
I promise.

194
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Mr. Kinn.

195
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,720
Boss is resting.

196
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,730
It's alright.

197
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,730
Let them in.

198
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,530
What do you want to know first?

199
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,070
Between,

200
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,440
tricking you to work here as a bodyguard,

201
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,710
or your parents' car crash?

202
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,890
The driver who hit the them,

203
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,230
was my friend.

204
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,070
What did you say?

205
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,150
I didn't know that the victims
had two little children.

206
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,400
So I covered it up.

207
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
In order to help my friend.

208
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
I'd almost forgotten about this,

209
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,610
until...

210
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,500
I saw Porsche once again.

211
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,060
I'm sorry.

212
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Sir.

213
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,470
From the information that I got, I realized,

214
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,530
that you,

215
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,540
were the kid of the victims from that case.

216
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,260
So I'd like to pay for my mistake

217
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,900
by having you work here.

218
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,380
So that I'll get to take care of you and your brother.

219
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,190
But during the two months that we met,

220
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,750
why didn't you tell me then?

221
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,330
If I'd told you directly,

222
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,440
would a stubborn guy like you

223
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
have accepted my help?

224
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,660
But I think that you went too far.

225
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Yes, I think so too.

226
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,580
Then what you think is right.

227
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,080
Thank you,

228
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,070
for trying to help.

229
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,820
But I don't want it.

230
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
Porsche.

231
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,290
What is it?

232
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,620
Vegas.

233
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
Is he sick?

234
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,910
He's been breathing abnormally for a while.

235
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,460
His feces is watery too.

236
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,370
Do you have a medication for him?

237
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,020
Tell the guard outside to take him to the vet?

238
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,230
There's no one.

239
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,090
What are you doing?

240
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,210
I'm taking him to the vet.

241
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:52,810
But it's...

242
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,410
I'm not asking you.

243
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,550
He's dead.

244
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,450
Why didn't you run away?

245
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,140
I don't even know.

246
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,020
My dad had me take care of the hedgehog since little.

247
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,700
One by one, they all died.

248
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,790
Until there was this one left.

249
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,790
He still left me too.

250
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,010
I didn't even get to name him.

251
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
And why do I have to feel so much about this now?

252
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,590
If you're feeling sad,

253
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,390
that means it's important.

254
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,790
Whatever Papa gave me to do, it's all important.

255
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,890
Everything that I love left me.

256
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,370
My life is pathetic, isn't it?

257
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,230
But you still have Macau.

258
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,660
Macau is no different.

259
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,610
It's unfortunate

260
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,330
to be born in the minor family.

261
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,580
A minor means the second.

262
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,210
No matter how well we do, no one sees it.

263
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,660
Vegas.

264
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,980
Why?

265
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,260
Why was I born in this freaking family?

266
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,090
Vegas.

267
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:38,990
Stop.

268
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,100
What the heck are you doing?

269
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
Leave me alone.

270
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
You think it serves me right, huh?

271
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,740
I know that you're sad.

272
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,790
But you're freaking stupid to hurt yourself.

273
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,230
But you like it, don't you?

274
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,230
When I am like this.

275
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,590
What are you doing?

276
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,620
Everytime I get moody,

277
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,990
you eyes tell me,

278
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,990
that you like it.

279
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,180
I know exactly what I want.

280
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,420
How about you, Pete?

281
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,420
How do you like it?

282
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,410
You're a psycho.

283
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,250
Don't try to hold it.

284
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,090
I know you're suffering inside.

285
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,310
Let it out.

286
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,510
But a guy like you,

287
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,510
it's no fun if you don't give in.

288
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,430
You don't have to go back to that house anymore.

289
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,310
Alright.

290
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,150
Are you not gonna ask me what happened?

291
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,670
I don't need to know everything, right?

292
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:22,670
I just want you to be happy, to have peace.

293
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,890
That's all. That's what matters to me.

294
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:39,020
Thank you for making me realize why I'm still alive.

295
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,550
Coming!

296
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,520
Aside from Porchay,

297
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,120
your life means the world to me.

298
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,840
Porchay, do you want some? I'll pour one for you.

299
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
That's alright.

300
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,040
I'd better get to my room.

301
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,770
- What are you looking at?
- Bye-bye.

302
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,390
Does Farmhouse have this flavor?

303
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Yeah.

304
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,990
Are you gonna eat it first?

305
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,170
Or smooch me first?

306
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,010
You didn't have to do all this.

307
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,980
Didn't do what?

308
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,180
You don't have to live like this.

309
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,620
You're already happy living in your own house.

310
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
Yes.

311
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,470
I've been very happy,

312
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,470
since I got you.

313
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,190
I didn't mean it that way.

314
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,010
I mean my house is not comfy.

315
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,160
If you're in your own house,

316
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
just snap your finger and you get what you want.

317
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,990
You won't be able to stay here.

318
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,060
You think I like living like that?

319
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,270
- But you're about to...
- I can be anywhere,

320
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,270
as long as I have you.

321
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,909
Are you sure you won't order in?

322
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,600
If we can't eat it, I'll laugh my butt off.

323
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,760
Well, we're at Porsche's now,
we gotta show off our skills.

324
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Right, Kinn?

325
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,090
Hey, Porsche, let me help you.

326
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,860
It's alright, it's alright.

327
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,820
C'mon, I'm ready.

328
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,740
You're Kinn's boyfriend. That makes you my friend now.

329
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,740
And actually, I knew that
we'd hit it off since the first day.

330
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,350
C'mon, let me help you.

331
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,960
It's really alright.

332
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,150
Thank you, though.

333
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,000
Just wait to eat.

334
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,990
Alright.

335
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,790
I'm really happy,

336
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,320
Huh?

337
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,090
to see Kinn happy today.

338
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,690
How many days could he be happy?

339
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,980
It won't last long.

340
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,020
Hey, he's your boyfriend!

341
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:46,030
The one who's willing to do anything for you.

342
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,820
Porsche, trust me.

343
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,420
A guy like Kinn,

344
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,420
if he loves someone, he doesn't stop loving that easily.

345
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,240
I believe you.

346
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
And I believe him.

347
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,240
But it's so freaking weird,

348
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,690
that he's the one who's doing this
and that for me. I'm not used to it at all.

349
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,650
It's like so freaking weird.

350
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,430
Hey, what the freak are you doing?

351
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,690
Veggies first, fool.

352
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,690
So the soup will be sweet.

353
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,700
What? No, put the meat in first.

354
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,170
That's gonna be freaking fishy.

355
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,580
Trust me. I watched it on YouTube.

356
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,580
I also watched it on YouTube.

357
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,390
I'm doing it my way.

358
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,100
No.

359
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,590
You go wash the dishes.

360
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,740
Jerk.

361
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,670
No, you go wash the dishes.

362
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,470
Moron, go wash the dishes.

363
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,470
Alright, I'll go wash the dishes.

364
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,530
Get used to it.

365
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,520
You're lucky to have Kinn as your boyfriend.

366
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,330
You're lucky too.

367
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,330
Time seems to love you very much.

368
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,330
Not really.

369
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,130
It's not like that.

370
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,260
It's hard to stay in this business.

371
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,320
You two, just hold each other's hands very tightly.

372
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,030
Mmm.

373
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,230
I hold his hand tightly.

374
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,230
But now, we both are out of the business.

375
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,230
You took so long to make just these?

376
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,340
Just?

377
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,590
Coming!

378
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,690
Here it is.

379
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,430
Carbonara Mama instant noodles!

380
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,440
Take look, there's bacon. So yummy.

381
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
I did my best.

382
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,320
I think that dish is the best. The rest is a mess.

383
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,570
Not just these dishes, the kitchen is a mess too.

384
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,130
Mmm.

385
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,120
Well, it looks tastier than Kinn's burned thing.

386
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,700
Hey.

387
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,690
Don't insult my thing.

388
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
My thing is so darn fine.

389
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,340
If not, would Porsche be crazy about it?

390
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,330
Don't say another word.

391
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Who would that be?

392
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,790
Tasty?

393
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,790
Yeah.

394
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,540
It's good.

395
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,880
Your papa is here.

396
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
I think we should head back.

397
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
You guys, go on.

398
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,140
Let's go.

399
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,890
Papa, is there anything?

400
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,690
This is the picture of the driver
who hit your dad and mom.

401
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,050
Why are you giving this to me?

402
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,490
The reason I didn't tell you before,

403
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,680
was I felt guilty and I didn't want to talk about it.

404
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,650
Consider it my apology.

405
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,770
You came all the way here,

406
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,770
just to do this?

407
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,200
There's an address behind the picture.

408
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,890
[66/156 Nisachon village Soi Bangwag 79 Jaransanitwong rd. Klongkwang Phasi Charoen]

409
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,790
Do whatever you want to do with it.

410
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,140
Have you really made up your mind?

411
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,650
Do you want me to go with you?

412
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,920
- Grandpa.
- Yes, honey?

413
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,150
Grandma tells me to get you for dinner.

414
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,950
I'll go after I finish watering the plants.

415
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,270
Let me help you, Grandpa.

416
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,270
Oh, of cause, my good girl. I'll teach you.

417
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:26,470
Spray it all the way! See?

418
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Let's go.

419
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,390
You did the right thing.

420
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,990
Your dad and mom would be proud of you.

421
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,650
I'm proud of you.

422
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,180
Why did you bring me here?

423
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,270
Well, it's the place that we first met.

424
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,110
The beginning of all lies.

425
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Well, you lied too.

426
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
You fooled me.

427
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680
You fooled me too.

428
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,650
You told me your name was Jom.

429
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,210
You told me to go work for you.

430
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,890
Can we start all over?

431
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:46,610
From now on, we'll have no secrets between us.

432
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,750
My name is Kinn.

433
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,310
I'm the head of the main family.

434
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,550
Please be my bodyguard.

435
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,910
My name is Porsche.

436
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,080
I'm the one you love.

437
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,640
And I'm the one who loves you.

446
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,600
Oh.

447
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,920
You came to class?

448
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,330
Nosy.

449
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:41,470
Well, how's that kid?

450
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,290
Why did he disappear?

451
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,330
Who?

452
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,740
The kid that you tutored.

453
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,800
You know that he passed the practical exam,

454
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,120
but he didn't come in for an interview exam.

455
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,270
Huh?

456
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,600
Yeah.

457
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,010
He's the promising one.

458
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,800
The teachers were also confused.

459
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,810
You didn't know?

460
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:07,890
This is so darn cool!

461
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,340
But what makes you wanna change your looks?

462
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:15,350
I told you to do so long ago, and you didn't seem to care.

463
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,240
This color is rad.

464
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,360
You're so rad, my friend.

465
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
Wow.

466
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Let's go, you're ready. C'mon, man.

467
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,720
Alright, guys, let's roll!

468
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,530
- Hey, Chay!
- Let's drink.

469
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,940
- Don't be scared.
- Yeah!

470
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,660
This is my senior's club.
No one's gonna check on your ID.

471
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,200
Chill, man.

472
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,510
Right, I heard that you got your heart broken?

473
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:49,510
From who?

474
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,640
That's right. He's hurt alright.

475
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,180
He changed his look. Let me do his hair.

476
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,010
Got me to find a place to drink.

477
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,540
If Porsche knows, he'll kill me, Chay.

478
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,730
Mmm.

479
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,320
Forget about it.

480
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,530
I don't wanna talk about it.

481
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:06,290
Alright, sorry.

482
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,420
Alright, let's get wasted for our friend today.

483
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,860
- Alright, c'mon, guys, cheers.
- Cheers.

484
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,830
Chay, get your glass.

485
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:16,450
- Cheers! Cheers!
-  Cheers! Woohoo!

486
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,870
So refreshing.

487
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:21,870
Drink up.

488
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,280
How's it?

489
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,670
It's bitter.

490
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,160
Yeah, the first time's always like that.

491
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,160
But if you keep drinking, you'll get used to it.

492
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,870
C'mon, guys. Let's have some fun!

493
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,050
Yeah, let's have some fun!

494
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,250
Hey, I think it's time for the bottoms up!

495
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,860
Oh, earlier wasn't enough. You want the bottoms up?

496
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,670
Yep, all the way up!

497
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,140
Alright, let's do it for our friend.

498
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,670
C'mon, c'mon.

499
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:48,760
Chay, this time, drink it all the way.

500
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,800
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

501
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:53,390
Bottoms up!

502
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:59,070
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

503
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,560
Are you alright?

504
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,320
Chay, let's head back. They're all drunk.

505
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,920
- Let's go.
- Mmm.

506
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,080
Let's go! Get up.

507
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,730
Hey, are you leaving?

508
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,590
Ow!

509
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,590
What? What now?

510
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,930
- Let's go home.
- Mmm.

511
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,020
I got good stuff for you.

512
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:49,340
What the heck?

513
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,760
Don't!

514
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
Kim.

515
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,620
Why are you here?

516
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,320
What the heck do you think you're doing?

517
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,730
What I'm doing is my business.

518
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,950
Why are you doing this?

519
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,310
I've never messed with you.

520
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,310
Don't mess with my business.

521
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,120
From now on, what you do is your darn decision.

522
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,500
This is pretty.

523
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,610
Yeah, pretty.

524
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:07,170
So pretty.

525
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,170
You're pretty too.

526
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,370
I walked all the way just for these.

527
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,210
Ah, alright, c'mon.

528
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,010
Oh, it's good.

529
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,540
Right, there you go!

530
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:32,180
What? You won't taste
anything from eating just that one.

531
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,180
Come here. Here. Here.

532
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,260
Why not?

533
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,940
What are you playing. Feed me.

534
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:42,870
Alright, alright.

535
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,870
I'll tear the mouth out. There.

536
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,870
It's fried with old oil, darn it.

537
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:56,080
I'm gonna go pee, darn it, what the heck was that?

538
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,600
A big boy is afraid of little bugs.

539
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,930
You're done? That was fast.

540
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,060
You seem alright.

541
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,990
It's alright that I don't have you around, Uncle.

542
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:24,890
No. That's not it.

543
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,170
It's good that you're not around, jerk.

544
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,950
You're pretty much the same.

545
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,280
No, you actually seem worse.

546
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,190
Oh, well.

547
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,190
You brought yourself in for an exchange.

548
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,470
But the main family,

549
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,470
do you think it's worth it?

550
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,470
I don't think it's quite worth it.

551
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,990
Why the heck do you come back?

552
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,250
You and I,

553
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,440
we're no longer relate.

554
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:47,250
I just want to send my regards to Korn.

555
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,960
Oh, you didn't know?

556
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,570
Hey!

557
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,690
I raised you for a long time.

558
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,450
I know that you're not clever,

559
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,790
but I didn't think that you'd be this stupid.

560
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,180
I still see you as my nephew.

561
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,380
And I'm very worried about you.

562
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Because the freaking main family
cannot be trusted, not even one member.

563
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,620
If you wanna know more about this.

564
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,480
Give me five million,

565
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,480
I'll put at end to it.

566
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,260
Just five million is not expensive.

567
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,940
Think it through.

568
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,790
[The unncut version of Kinn Porsche: The Series exclusive on iQIYI APP or iQ.COM]

569
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,990
I first thought I was a freak.

570
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,720
What the heck do you think you're doing?

571
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,980
The main family is about to cut my head off.

572
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,250
What would you want me to do, Papa?

573
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,220
You're just as stupid as your mother!

574
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,570
You shouldn't be my son.
