5
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,150
The driver who hit the them,

6
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,430
was my friend.

7
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,120
But during the two months that we met,

8
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,240
why didn't you tell me then?

9
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,700
Porsche.

10
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,539
How's that kid?

11
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,740
You know that he passed the practical exam,

12
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,860
but he didn't come in for an interview exam.

13
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,100
What the heck do you think you're doing?

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,270
I've never messed with you.

15
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,039
Don't mess with my business.

16
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,009
what you do is your darn decision.

17
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,770
I just want to send my regards to Korn.

18
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,440
Oh, you didn't know?

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,690
If you wanna know more about this.

20
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,220
Give me five million,

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,220
I'll put at end to it.

22
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,420
Do you know how sexy you are?

23
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,580
Mmm.

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:05,830
At first, I thought I was a freak.

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,220
Until now.

26
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,370
You just have to accept and be true to who you are.

27
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Like you?

28
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,550
I just live in the present.

29
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,540
What I'm feeling, that's all I think about.

30
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,470
How can you live in this filthy world?

31
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,440
Why? Are you gonna say that I'm a good guy?

32
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440
No, you're just a fool.

33
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,170
Are you sure that you're okay now?

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,150
Mmm.

35
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,230
Papa must be very happy to know that we're back.

36
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
I guess.

37
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,060
Oh.

38
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,510
You're back.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750
Have a seat.

40
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Get the soup for Kinn and Porsche.

41
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,090
How are things?

42
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,579
It's good.

43
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,540
We both have talked about it.

44
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,720
We're gonna let go of the past,

45
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,400
and start anew from today.

46
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,300
Yes.

47
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,020
That's good for both of you.

48
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,270
Go ahead. Eat it.

49
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,269
It's better when it's still hot. Or it'll get cold.

50
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,760
I still see you as my nephew.

51
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,580
And I'm very worried about you.

52
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,570
Because the freaking main family
cannot be trusted, not even one member.

53
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,030
Papa, you like to eat fresh fish maw soup?

54
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,820
Yes, it's good for the health.

55
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
I'm old so I need nourishment.

56
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,630
What a coincidence.

57
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,710
My dad liked fresh fish maw soup too.

58
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,550
Really?

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,920
My dad and Papa have a lot in common.

60
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,740
What the heck do you think you're doing?

61
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,670
The main family is about to cut my head off.

62
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,580
What do you want me to do, Papa?

63
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,070
You're just as stupid as your mother!

64
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,070
You shouldn't be my son.

65
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,510
And you think I wanted to be your son?

66
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,630
What did you just say?

67
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,620
Are you stressed out?

68
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Putting a cigarette in your mouth
doesn't make the stress go away.

69
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,990
You'd better put something else in your mouth.

70
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,610
Now, tell me.

71
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
What's bothering you?

72
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,909
Well, I...

73
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,590
I have something that...

74
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,590
Mr. Kinn, Boss is calling for you.

75
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,120
Give me that. I'll throw it away.

76
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,260
Go ahead.

77
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,640
We'll talk later.

78
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Mmm.

79
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
I'll hurry back.

80
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,160
I've already postponed
the meeting with Mr. Vadim for you.

81
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
I think you should have a little rest.

82
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes, Papa.

83
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,740
If you're free, why don't you two go traveling?

84
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,620
Well, I was thinking about that.

85
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
I wanted to surprise him.

86
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,350
May I join you for a drink?

87
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,830
You've been taking more care of your health?

88
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,840
C'mon, it's just a little smoking.

89
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,320
What did you talk to Papa about?

90
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Nothing. Just general work stuff.

91
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,010
How about you?

92
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,380
What did you want to say earlier?

93
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,630
General work stuff.

94
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,630
Nothing much.

95
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,600
I'll go take a shower first.

96
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,650
I don't like it.

97
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,230
Then why didn’t I say no?

98
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,060
What are you looking at? Eat!

99
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Your papa was here?

100
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,420
Are you gonna eat it or not?

101
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,860
What happened to your face?

102
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,730
Leave it alone!

103
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Is this the way you're supposed to be living?

104
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Give yourself up to
the main family. Mr. Korn is not cruel.

105
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,580
Isn't my freaking life like this because of them?

106
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,290
It's up to you, Vegas. It's your choice.

107
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,990
Don't you ever think that just
we had sex and you could say anything.

108
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,220
Anyhow, you're just my pet.

109
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,430
A guy like you,

110
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,240
will never regret.

111
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,090
Kill me, jerk.

112
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,170
You want to die so much, huh?

113
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,190
I'll kill you as you wish.

114
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,570
Kinn, I had a bad dream.

115
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,570
What about?

116
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,130
Pete's dead.

117
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,010
He went home, I told you.

118
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,880
I called his Grandma.

119
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
She said he didn't.

120
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,650
He might go out and hang with his friends.

121
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,570
Would you stop being stupid?

122
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,160
I've already checked.

123
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,940
Pete didn't go home.

124
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,940
Why are you all suddenly become stupid?

125
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,780
What?

126
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,150
Darn, the last mission,

127
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,860
Pete was sent into the minor family's house.

128
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,390
The freaking minor family's house!

129
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:10,830
Do you think a guy like Pete wouldn't come
back and report himself directly to you?

130
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Why are you all being like this?

131
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,690
If something happened to Pete...

132
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,290
You!

133
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:23,970
You!

134
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,710
I'll never forgive you all.

135
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,310
Pete!

136
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,470
Pete!

137
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,560
Don't think that acting weak and I'll

138
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,730
Come on, Vegas.

139
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,090
Kill me.

140
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,080
I got nothing left.

141
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,490
Not even my humanity.

142
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,270
Right now, I feel useless.

143
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,150
No.

144
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,790
I've always been useless.

145
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,390
I never exist.

146
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,270
I have no feelings.

147
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,060
I don't freaking have anything left within me.

148
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,500
Pete.

149
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,290
I can't take myself anymore, Vegas.

150
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,180
I can't take it anymore.

151
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,540
If you don't kill me today,

152
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,870
I'll do it myself. Argh!

153
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,960
Let go!

154
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,240
Pete.

155
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,630
Pete.

156
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,150
I'm sorry, okay?

157
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Pete.

158
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,089
I'm sorry.

159
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,270
Okay.

160
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,119
I give up, Pete.

161
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
I’m sorry.

162
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,540
Don't leave me, I'm begging you.

163
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,060
I'm a human, Vegas.

164
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,070
I have feelings.

165
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,320
Can we start all over again?

166
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,090
Just you and me.

167
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,470
I need you, Pete.

168
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,230
Just you and me.

169
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,460
Just you and me, Pete.

170
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,660
Need me?

171
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,360
For emotional projection,
like a pet with no feelings?

172
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,550
No.

173
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,630
Then what the heck is this?!

174
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,870
Okay, Pete.

175
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Okay.

176
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,020
But promise me.

177
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,090
You won't leave me.

178
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,690
Just promise me that you won't leave me.

179
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,020
Stay with me.

180
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,990
I'm sorry.

181
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Hey!

182
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,570
Hey!

183
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,010
Help me!

184
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
Pete.

185
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,150
Let me know if you need anything.

186
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,380
You can come tell us in Arm's dream.

187
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,270
Pete.

188
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,590
Khun.

189
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,680
My people are checking.

190
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,800
Could you stop being so dramatic?

191
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
He may be doing just fine.

192
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,570
Fine, my butt, Kinn!

193
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,040
Don't you remember?

194
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,050
Our bodyguards sent into that house,

195
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,520
never came back, not even one.

196
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
And you still sent Pete in...

197
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,970
I don't think he wouldn't make it for sure.

198
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,870
Pete.

199
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,470
Mr. Tankhun, don't cry.

200
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,630
I'm checking to make certain

201
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,040
that if the minor family has done something to Pete,

202
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,800
I'll never let them get away with it.

203
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Stop speaking already.

204
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,910
Right now, his soul
wouldn't be able to find his way home.

205
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,040
So I am trying to lead him home.

206
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Pete.

207
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,490
Don't worry, I have so much money to give you.

208
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,060
Go get the ATM.

209
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,190
There's an ATM?

210
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,190
Yes.

211
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,330
If you want anything, just withdraw
the money from the ATM, no limits.

212
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,550
And if you're lonely,

213
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,080
well, I'm still a little busy.

214
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,230
You can have Yok here to keep you company.

215
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,530
I guarantee you it's gonna be so much fun.

216
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,930
And that's not enough,

217
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,460
Take Arm and Pol with you.

218
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,830
- They're you friends.
- Mr. Tankhun.

219
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,340
Stop whining.

220
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,660
There, there, Pete.

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,520
It's alright.

237
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,130
I happened to fight with a dog along the way.

238
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,130
That's why I look like crap.

239
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,800
That's not funny.

240

00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,230
Just tell me.

Is it the minor family?

00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,370
I know nothing.

337
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,350
And I don't think Kinn knows about it too.

338
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:17,340
I was blinded by the adults,
not different from you, Porsche.

339
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,470
Uncle Thee is the only one who knows about this.

340
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,070
But he cannot be reached.

341
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,680
I'll help you find Uncle Thee.

342
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,970
And about five million,

343
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
I'll take care of it.

344
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,070
Why are you helping me?

345
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,180
Because this is not the first time
I see the pic of your mom.

346
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,180
Where did you see her?

347
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,990
My papa's office.

348
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,400
And?

349
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,450
I'm not so sure.

350
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,990
But this,

351
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,390
I'll handle it.

352
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,390
Hey, Porsche, wait.

353
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
How about my request?

354
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,790
I brought him here.

355
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,030
The rest is on you.

356
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,620
But if you ever do anything to him again,

357
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,620
you and me, we'll meet again.

358
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,790
Get out!

359
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,350
I'm sorry, Pete.

360
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,630
Get the heck out of my life!

361
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,910
Are you gonna shoot me?

362
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,750
Are you?

363
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,750
Why don't you shoot?

364
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,640
Don't you want me to disappear?

365

Shoot me!

367
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,000
I don't think you can.

368
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,510
And you know why.

369
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,690
I'm sorry.

370
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,080
I'll drive today.

371
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,240
You got a meeting with
the shareholders at the Pier in the morning.

372
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,330
And in the afternoon, you gotta go
to the product launch at Prom-Pong.

373
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,540
My papa canceled all those for me.

374
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,990
Why's that?

375
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,790
I'd like you to meet someone.

376
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,510

How did you know?

379
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,900
I did some homework. I asked Porchay.

380
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,550
My papa knows about us.

381
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,550
So I want to meet your parents too.

382

What are you looking at?

384
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,070
Dad. Mom.

385

This is Kinn.

My boss.

00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,990
That's it?

388
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,600
And he's the one I love.

389
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,140
Your son is very stubborn.

390
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,760
The first day that we met,

391
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,610
he took my asset.

392
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,920
The first day he came into my house,

393
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,870
he almost burned it down.
He also peed in the carp pond.

394
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,250
He made my cousin's head bleed.

395
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,680
He was also drunk on duty.

396
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,180
And I got stomped pretty badly.

397
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,470
Are you taking me here
to talk bad things to my parents?

398
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,070
But I'm not such a good boyfriend myself.

399
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,180
I made him sad many times.

400
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,650
But he's sweet.

401
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,570
He still gave me chances.

402
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,320
He made me be able to truly trust someone.

403
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,570
He used to ask me why I put up with living this life.

404
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,460
Actually, I do have an answer.

405
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,280
Just having him by my side, wherever it may be,

406
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,290
I'll be able to live.

407
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,050
That's so cheesy.

408

Aren't you embarrassed,

Yes.

The main family was hunting
him down so he needed to lay low here.

And that assures me that Uncle Thee

Money first, and then the deal is done.

Well, I didn't want to do this, Porsche.

Okay.

I was in that car.

486
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,920
You were in shock that you
couldn't remember anything.

487
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,350
You just believed what I told you.

That's not true.

489

The person who hit Dad and Mom is real.

490
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,970
I went to his place. Mr. Korn gave me the address.

491
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,340
What the heck are you saying?

492
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,340
He's just a scapegoat.

493
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,410
He wanted you to believe that.

494
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,380
How many times did I tell
you that this family was evil?

495
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,740
And why would he do that?

496

00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,170
You're asking me to let my wife
go back to your freaking family?

503
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,160
Your evil runs in your blood.

504
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:13,170
Shut up.

505
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,790
Porsche.

506
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:33,790
Porsche!

507
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,050
Uncle Thee is dead.

508
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,330
What about Porsche?

509
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,130
Porsche has run off.

510
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,220
Take him back, safely.

511
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,380
Yes, sir.

512
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,890
My parents weren't killed in a car crash.

513
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,740
But they were shot to death.

514
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,650
And the one who shot them was you.

515
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,680
You're wrong.

516
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,030
Why are you still not telling the truth?

517
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:21,680
The truth is; why would I do that?

518
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:24,370
Since Namphueng,

519
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:27,280
was my sister.

521
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:17,010
Tell everyone to get ready.

522
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,010
We're going to wake them up.
