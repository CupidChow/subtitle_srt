5
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,070
I'll tell everyone you die in the woods.

6
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,510
Why?

7
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,510
I like it when you're happy.

8
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,510
That's an order!

9
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,820
Mr. Kinn.

10
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,550
You!

11
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,550
No more bets.

12
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,040
Since Mr. Kinn's been in recovery,

13
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,500
other gangs start to rebel.

14
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,890
They've been sending
their people into our territory.

15
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,750
Someone must be pulling the string.

16
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,860
Those small gangs wouldn't dare.

17
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,720
The most suspicious person is Don.

18
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,390
Here's the plan.

19
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,750
You go undercover in the casino.

20
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,870
And get them all.

21
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,579
It's about time we know who's behind this.

22
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,350
The target is on my left.

23
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,850
What the freaking are you...

24
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,300
What? Hey, hey, hey, hey!

25
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,220
You crappy husband, where are you?

26
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,130
When are you coming home? Are you
possessed by a gambling ghost? Have you...

27
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,540
What?

28
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,710
Sorry.

29
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,170
Shoot, he's not the guy.

30
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,840
Help! Help me!

31
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,020
Geez!

32
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,750
Get down!

33
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,840
It's here.

34
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,550
The grenade is here.

35
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,310
Where the heck are you all?

36
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,590
Where?

37
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,470
What should I do?

38
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,470
Follow them.

39
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,910
Help me.

40
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,880
Hey.

41
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,300
Help me first.

42
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,740
Take it away.

43
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,720
Get out of my way!

44
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,760
Go away! Get out of my way!

45
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,590
- Hey!
- What?

46
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,110
- A gun?
- A gun!

47
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,730
Run!

48
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,310
A win for the minor family.

49
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,150
Has he told us who sent them?

50
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,310
Not yet.

51
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,440
But from the tattoo we've seen,
we think he's Don's people.

52
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,700
Want me go get him?

53
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,750
You know where he is?

54
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,750
No, but I guess he's home.

55
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,230
In this businessม

56
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,800
no one knows where the house of head of the gang is.

57
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,960
And now that he's being very cautious,

58
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,410
he only come out if he had appointments.

59
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,330
So what do you want me to do next?

60
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,690
Keep making him talk.

61
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,920
Until you get the information linking to Don.

62
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,140
Alright.

63
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,060
I'll call you in case I find more information.

64
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,310
Mmm.

65
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,070
You, take care.

66
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,510
Here.

67
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,460
Are you gonna talk or not?

68
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,630
No...

69
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,480
Ow! Ow! Ow!

70
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,710
Hey, that's enough!

71
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,450
He could die.

72
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,740
Let me try.

73
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,550
What are you doing, Mr. Vegas?

74
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,550
I've got my own method.

75
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,970
I think you all should go wait outside.

76
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,180
You could lose your appetite.

77
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,830
He spoke.

78
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,030
You didn't tell me

79
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,330
that you'd let outsiders be involved.

80
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,910
I see that it's an urgent matter,

81
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,700
so I didn't have time to tell you first.

82
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,800
If Vegas wasn't there to help,
who'd knew what would happen?

83
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,230
You should take some rest and recover soon.

84
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,230
If you persist, and thing happens,

85
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,230
it's not worth it.

86
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,670
After all, we are family.

87
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,070
It doesn't matter who finishes the job.

88
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,070
Isn't that right, bro?

89
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,670
So what information have we got?

90
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,830
He doesn't know where Don lives.

91
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,290
But he knows that Don is about to
buy a lot of drugs from Big Wang.

92
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,680
Big Wang.

93
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,070
I believe that it's gonna be a huge deal now.

94
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,950
The minor family has some strings.

95
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,410
I think it won't be difficult to find Big Wang.

96
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,000
What will we do after that?

97
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,350
About that, I got a plan.

98
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,870
But in order for the mission to succeed,

99
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,870
I have one thing to ask.

100
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,860
He asked for you to be his assistant.

101
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,510
Huh?

102
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,070
I rejected that.

103
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,390
But I had to follow my Papa's order.

104
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,350
Why me?

105
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,110
He wants everything that belongs to me.

106
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,670
Do you know,

107
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,310
why we have the major and minor family?

108
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,710
Because competitions make us stronger.

109
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,430
If they succeed,

110
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,860
I'll be remembered as a loser.

111
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,270
But if the mission fails,

112
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,310
you might not get to come back.

113
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,390
This is the first time in my life,

114
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,870
that I wish they successfully complete the task.

115
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,090
Promise me.

116
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,070
No matter what happens,

117
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,310
you must return to me.

118
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,590
I promise.

119
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,390
Give me a hug.

120
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,110
You pick me up yourself?

121
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,270
Of course.

122
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,980
Kinn lent me his favorite man.

123
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,100
But I'm not here alone.

124
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,690
Mr. Kinn's afraid that Porsche alone
wouldn't be able to handle everything.

125
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,150
Come.

126
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,070
Hello.

127
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,230
Hello.

128
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,430
Hello, sir.

129
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,990
Hey.

130
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,710
There's grilled pork.

131
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,150
Looks yummy.

132
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,070
- Hello there.
- Would you like some?

133
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,390
Here.

134
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,510
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

135
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,430
At ease.

136
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,870
Make yourselves at home.

137
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,200
Do tell if you need anything.

138
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,070
Why do they look so relaxed here?

139
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,070
I think it's warm, don't you think?

140
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,310
Mr. Vegas and the main
family's people just got inside.

141
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,760
- Here we go!
- Quick! Quick!

142
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,310
Are you hungry?

143
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,510
Yes.

144
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,990
We can wait and eat with everyone.

145
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,150
I'll get you some food.

146
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,020
Well, I'm hungry.

147
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,830
Hello, Mr. Vegas.

148
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,870
This is the main courtyard.

149
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,790
These rooms down here,

150
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,390
are the bodyguards' quarters.

151
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,870
From the first floor up.

152
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,250
And at the top, those are our rooms.

153
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,670
Oh.

154
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,750
They've set up the dining table.

155
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,020
Hungry?

156
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,670
Er...

157
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,650
You don't need a schedule to eat here.

158
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,190
You can eat whenever you want.

159
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,750
C'mon, let's eat!

160
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,750
Hey, cheers!

161
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,850
Eat all you want! Today's a special day.

162
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,870
Hey, he hasn't touched his glass yet.

163
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,030
C'mon, man.

164
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,930
Pete.

165
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,930
Look at those food.

166
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,710
Geez!

167
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,110
Hey.

168
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,190
How's school today?

169
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,920
Hey, bro. It's good. It's good.

170
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,630
Hello there.

171
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,590
Hello.

172
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,270
Look at all the food.

173
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,910
This is luxurious.

174
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,670
I'm not surprised,

175
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,670
why the heirs of this family turn out like this.

176
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,500
I've just realized how well you treat your people.

177
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,390
All bodyguards here give their lives for me.

178
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,230
All this in return? Still seems too little.

179
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,590
Pete.

180
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,590
He's looking at you.

181
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,510
Is he going to eat his meal or eat me?

182
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,230
He keeps staring at me, man.

183
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,470
Hello, Kim.

184
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,310
Hey.

185
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,570
I know we have tutoring next week,

186
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,370
but can we change it to today?

187
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,550
Today?

188
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,110
Oh, yes, of course.

189
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,150
Should I go to the rehearsal room like last time?

190
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,470
Oh, it's reserved today.

191
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,070
I'll come over to tutor you at your place.

192
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,870
My place?

193
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,580
Oh, man.

194
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,110
Er, it's...

195
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,630
It's not very convenient.

196
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,130
The thing is,

197
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,620
My place...

198
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,250
the power has been cut.

199
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh?

200
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,940
Mmm, but I'm in front of your place now.

201
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,820
I'll come help you fix that.

202
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,590
You'll tear your wound.

203
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,670
Even if I don't do anything,

204
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,520
there are people waiting to tear me apart.

205
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,770
Relax.

206
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,760
If you want to recover fast,
you need to get a lot of rest.

207
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,670
And how are you feeling?

208
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,270
I'm feeling better.

209
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,030
I'm not talking about your wound.

210
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,270
Since you got out of the woods,

211
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,270
your eyes have changed.

212
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,310
The last time I saw you like this,

213
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,350
was when you were dating...

214
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,240
Tawan.

215
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,070
In the past,

216
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,070
I had a lucky knife kept with me, very sharp.

217
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,270
It even split the coin.

218
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,300
But I liked to use that knife
to cut an apple for your Mama.

219
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,480
The next thing I knew,

220
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,860
The apple juice got the knife all rusty.

221
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,090
It never could cut anything ever since.

222
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,150
Do you understand what I'm saying?

223
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,470
Yes.

224
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,270
Come back to your old self soon.

225
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,270
Our family is waiting for you.

226
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,750
Hey!

227
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,330
Yes.

228
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,150
It's about to fall, so I...

229
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,310
- I...
- Hey, it's no problem.

230
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,910
Enjoy, man.

231
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,070
I know you like motorcycles.

232
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,740
Go on. Come on.

233
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,710
Yes, it's pretty nice.

234
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,950
Er...

235
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,450
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,350
About the other day.

237
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,830
That I got you punished.

238
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,090
Let's forget it. We're good now.

239
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,350
So I'll see you then.

240
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,190
I told him to come apologize.

241
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,590
We're on the same team now, you and I.

242
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,070
I don't want any dispute between us.

243
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,350
What if I fail?

244
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,310
Then don't fail.

245
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,580
Or else the gift I've prepared won't have its rider.

246
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,230
Er,

247
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,470
Actually,

248
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,400
The reason I lied,

249
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,680
was because my house's a mess,

250
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,370
and it might make you uncomfortable.

251
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,310
It's not a mess.

252
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,430
Oh.

253
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,630
My bro doesn't know how to keep it clean.

254
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,230
Are these your Mom and Dad?

255
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,910
Oh, yes.

256
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,560
They were in a car accident.

257
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,520
They passed since I was little.

258
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,230
I'm sorry.

259
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,710
Oh, right, I got you something.

260
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,270
Here.

261
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,670
Huh?

262
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,590
That's for me?

263
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,980
I think this one sounds warmer.

264
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,570
And it suits you.

265
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,130
You lend me this, right?

266
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,650
No.

267
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,190
I'm giving it to you.

268
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,930
Giving it to me?

269
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,670
Huh?

270
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,970
Open it.

271
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,570
Hey!

272
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,430
This is the top model.

273
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,950
But I...

274
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,270
I can't take it.

275
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,670
Don't think too much.

276
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,740
Better the guitar, more winning chance.

277
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,870
But it's...

278
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,870
Can I use your restroom?

279
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,470
Restroom?

280
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,230
Oh, it's not working on this floor.

281
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,530
You need to go upstairs.

282
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,800
Alright.

283
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,810
Okay.

284
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,990
Kim!

285
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,910
Thank you.

286
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,830
Darn!

287
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,510
Kim! Kim!

288
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,990
It's not that room.

289
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,470
It's upstairs.

290
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,630
Oh?

291
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,710
Hmm, that's good.

292
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,820
Ending with E chord.

293
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,680
But I think you need to work
on the beginning of the song.

294
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,130
And still, it's not the right tempo yet.

295
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,450
Take a break first and we'll come back to fix it.

296
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,390
Are you hungry?

297
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,180
Er...

298
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,360
Not really.

299
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,470
Oh?

300
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,750
But I am.

301
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,590
Actually,

302
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,320
I'm starting to get a bit hungry.

303
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,830
What's good to eat here normally?

304
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,540
There's a noodle place at the front of the alley.

305
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,360
You wanna join me?

306
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,990
I think I'll have you get some for me.

307
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,760
I need to clear some business.

308
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,480
So you buy it and we're gonna
eat and tutor at the same time.

309
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,150
Sure, okay.

310
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,660
I'll be right back.

311
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,680
I'll take that.

312
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:14,850
[WIK]

313
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,790
Here.

314
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,270
Oh, watch out.

315
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,270
Thank you.

316
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,950
Looks good.

317
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,590
Hmm.

318
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,670
I have homework for you to do.

319
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,060
I'll let you try writing a love song.

320
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,360
A love song?

321
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,080
Why?

322
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,400
Don't tell me you've never been in love?

323
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,440
Hmmmmm.

324
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,390
Well,

325
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,990
Yeah.

326
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,460
But...

327
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,440
I like that person and...

328
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,230
And?

329
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,390
And...

330
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,840
That means you've never been in love, right?

331
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,720
How about now?

332
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,160
Do you like anyone?

333
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,920
Well, yeah.

334
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,320
I like someone.

335
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,020
Who is it?

336
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,990
You wouldn't know.

337
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,420
And,

338
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,640
what's this person like?

339
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,750
Well, this person is...

340
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,170
cool.

341
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,030
Plays musical instruments well.

342
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,830
And,

343
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,830
very kind.

344
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,740
Hmm.

345
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,910
Then let's start by thinking that
you're writing a song for that person.

346
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,470
And,

347
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,810
I'll look forward to listening to it.

348
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,260
Go ahead and eat,

349
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,130
while it's still hot.

350
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,950
Here.

351
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,510
You're recovering, Mr. Kinn.

352
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,990
This is the last saline solution.

353
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,470
Excuse me.

354
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,870
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

355
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,750
How are you feeling?

356
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,020
Good.

357
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,730
But not as good as you.

358
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,610
What's this about?

359
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,230
I heard that that family treated you well.

360
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,910
Had some beer for you to drink.

361
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:17,980
Did Pete tell you?

362
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,240
And is it true?

363
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,740
Yeah, it's true.

364
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,820
That family treats their bodyguards like friends.

365
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,430
So heartwarming.

366
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,750
And most importantly,

367
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,600
if I complete my task,

368
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,800
he'll give me a big bike.

369
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,830
He's so generous.

370
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,660
Is he taking you as his bodyguard or a wife?

371
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,720
And the reason you're saying this,

372
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,980
is because you really wanna
know or you're just jealous?

373
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,750
Sorry to interrupt.

374
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,360
May I have your bodyguard back?

375
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,870
We have a meeting afterwards.

376
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,350
But if you haven't finished talking,...

377
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,890
Suit yourself.

378
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,170
Right now, he's yours.

379
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,460
Do whatever you want.

380
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,550
Porsche.

381
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,190
Let's go.

382
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,630
Thank you.

383
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,710
No need to think too much.

384
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,150
Kinn is like this.

385
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,460
He thinks I may steal you away.

386
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,190
That's not it.

387
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,870
But I understand.

388
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,870
A guy who's been through stuff like that.

389
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,190
Stuff like what?

390
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,350
I've heard this so many times now.

391
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,389
What really happened?

392
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,429
Kinn used to have a boyfriend named Tawan.

393
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,679
He's the first one that Kinn got really serious with.

394
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,710
At first, they seemed sweet.

395
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,750
But after that,

396
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,110
as Kinn's always like,

397
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,270
he started being paranoid,

398
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,670
that Tawan might be a spy sent
by other gangs to collect information.

399
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,469
So they broke up.

400
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,530
And after that, he became cold.

401
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,360
So childish.

402
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,830
No.

403
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,120
Kinn shot Tawan to death.

404
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,500
And after that, he trusts no one.

405
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,950
Hey.

406
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,790
Are you not gonna eat that?

407
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,790
If not, I will.

408
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,790
How are things, man?

409
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,890
Not much.

410
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,510
You mean your health or your heart?

411
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,750
Feelings,

412
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,790
you can't resist them.

413
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,220
Love is love.

414
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,340
Or you haven't forgotten?

415
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,340
What are you talking about?

416
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,780
We've been friends for a long time.

417
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,640
Just by looking into your eyes,
I know right away.

418
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,860
Right.

419
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,330
Love isn't complicated.

420
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,780
But what's complicated is you.

421
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,630
Agreed.

422
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,590
Mine isn't complicated.

423
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,650
Why do you think so much?

424
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,950
I don't want to be like the old me.

425
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,440
Let you heart fly.

426
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,210
You've caged it for too long.

427
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,310
I'll ask just one thing.

428
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,330
Don't replace someone with another one.

429
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,590
Hey.

430
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,910
Don't ruin Big Wang's name.

431
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,850
This time, Mr. Don has ordered a huge batch.

432
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,590
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

433
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,830
Hey.

434
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,630
Duck, sir.

435
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,240
Who's that?

436
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:09,890
Hide, sir.

437
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,700
Hide.

438
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,520
Calm down.

439
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,590
Hey, relax.

440
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,750
Sit down.

441
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,610
Who the heck are you guys?

442
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,110
What do you want?

443
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,630
I can give you everything.

444
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,170
Just please.

445
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,980
Don't kill me.

446
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,670
I'm begging you.

447
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,950
What do you want?

448
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,450
I've sent you everything on time. Huh?

449
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,080
I'm not gonna do anything to you.

450
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,100
I just want your help to get me to Don.

451
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,670
And we'll handle the rest.

452
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,430
Why would I risk my life with you all?

453
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,150
Huh?

454
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,150
I won't be a part of this.

455
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,970
Well, if you don't wanna take a risk,

456
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,320
you can join his side.

457
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,710
Choose.

458
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,640
[KINN]

459

[Big Wang spoke]

460
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,700
[The handoff is tomorrow]

461
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:04,980
[Then we only have tonight]

462
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,570
[What for?]

463
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:13,260
[I'm starting to think that a mole has sent
some info to Vegas. I'll leave that to you to check]

464
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,110
Looking for something?

465
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,200
I'm looking for...

466
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,010
I can't find my way back to my room, Mr. Vegas.

467
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,230
Your house is very big. I'm not used to it at all.

468
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,670
Why didn't you say so?

469
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,600
C'mon, I'll walk you.

470
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,450
C'mon. C'mon.

471
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,660
I'm sorry.

472
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,430
C'mon.

473
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,350
C'mon.

474
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,410
What are you doing?

475
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,370
About to go to sleep, what's up?

476
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,630
I'm just calling.

477
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,430
You can't sleep, can you?

478
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,750
Just go to sleep.

479
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,790
So you'll have energy tomorrow.

480
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,390
Kinn.

481
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,990
Hey.

482
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,030
Aren't you gonna say something supportive to me?

483
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,910
I'm hanging up.

484
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,950
Hey, Kinn!

485
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,470
What?

486
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,830
When I see you next time, I'll freaking...

487
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,040
Freaking what?

488
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,890
How did you come here?

489
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,870
I escaped.

490
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,630
Are you dumb?

491
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,610
I have something for you.

492
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,600
This is my lucky gun.

493
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,900
I have it with me every time

494
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,940
when I have important events.

495
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,630
What if I can't take good care of it?

496
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,730
Are you giving it to me?

497
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,910
Who said so?

498
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,850
When you're done, you return it to me.

499
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,670
The gun.

500
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,750
And yourself.

501
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,960
I'm not carrying just one gun, you know.

502
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,550
This is another gun of mine.

503
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,530
And about this gun,

504
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,140
if I'm done with it, do I need to return it quickly?

505
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,910
Or can it be used over and over?

506
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:33,400
If you wanna know, you gotta try,

507
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,360
maybe three or four rounds,

508
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,810
Why was it first a pocket pistol,

509
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,340
but now it's a Magnum pistol?

Where is Mr. Wang?

516
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,100
Where is he?

517
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,830
The plan is that Pete and I, stick with Big Wang.

518
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,550
Get passed the security.

519
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,090
Hey, we're here as promised.

520
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,090
Wait, you.

521
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:21,950
Hey.

522
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,900
You don't look familiar.

523
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,430
Hey, can't I have new goons working for me?

524
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,020
Tell Mr. Don.

525
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,500
Big Wang is here.

526
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,350
Your work is done.

527
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,020
Thanks for your help.

528
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:54,550
Okay?

529
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:55,550
Mr. Vegas.

530
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,670
He betrayed you.

531
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,910
Sold your information to us.

532
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,910
So we decided to return the favor.

533
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,030
What do you want? Huh?

534
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:23,450
The major clan sent me here
to resolve the issues at the casino.

535
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,990
Let bygones by bygones.

536
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:33,030
Do you think that I'm foolish?

537
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,670
At this point,

538
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,930
this story is ending very bad.

539
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,790
Do you think that we are foolish enough

540
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:49,110
to create enemies while our leader is still weak?

541
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,620
As a sign of good faith,

542
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,420
we'll give you these drugs free of charge.

543
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:00,550
Consider it, compensation

544
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,210
for wasting your time.

545
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,430
Do we have a deal?

546
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,990
Let me show you your product.

547
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,590
We're here.

548
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:43,590
Check your weapon.

549
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,090
Porsche will lead the B team.

550
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,410
When Don checks his product,

551
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,450
we finish the job.

552
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:22,790
Traitor.

553
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,190
Rest in peace.

554
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:28,840
Amen.

555
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,750
I'll be back.

556
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,100
Where are you going?

557
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,790
- Toilet.
- I'm gonna smoke.

558
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:50,790
Hey, I'm coming too.

559
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:51,810
C’mon.

560
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,630
Hey, wait, where are you going?

561
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:55,770
Getting some fresh air outside.

562
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,280
Let's clink our glasses first.

563
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,230
Oh, yeah, I was gonna ask you.

564
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:10,210
Why did you dare talk to them?

565
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,870
And you knew when#

566
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,870
we were going to shoot them all.

567
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:18,870
That's because I'm not like Kinn.

568
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,040
I trust my team.

569
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,350
Just like you trusted me that I'd duck in time.

570
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,710
This is the first time that we worked together.

571
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,530
Stuff like this,

572
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,870
if it's right,

573
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,870
you know when you see it.

574
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,240
Mr. Kinn.

575
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,430
They're looking into each other's eyes.

576
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:54,990
I don't know.

577
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:56,400
Porsche seems shy.

578
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,850
Come work with me.

579
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,350
Me?

580
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:11,470
Yes.

581
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,470
Here, you have freedom.

582
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,110
You do whatever you want.

583
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,750
Even,

584
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,690
opening a small bar by the beach.

585
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,190
How did you know I wanted to open a bar?

586
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,470
A guy like me,

587
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,750
if I'm interested in someone,

588
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,750
there's nothing I wouldn't know.

589
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,390
Just think about it.

590
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,910
Oh.

591
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,640
C'mon, let's get you another one.

592
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,710
Mr. Kinn.

593
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,910
They're holding hands now!

594
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:54,910
Mr. Kinn.

595
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,750
Mr. Kinn!

596
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,270
Shoot!

597
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,270
It's dead.

598
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,870
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

599
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,390
Are you alright?

600
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,250
You wanna sit down?

601
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,350
I'm alright.

602
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,020
Come on. Let's go outside.

603
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:02,830
Where did they go?

604
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,270
Are you alright?

605
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,590
I thought you said you're a heavy drinker.

606
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,190
Here, I'll help you take it off.

607
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,870
Arms up.

608
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:30,980
That one.

609
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,590
Darn you!

610
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,010
Do you see the ring on my finger?

611
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,730
Get the heck out!

612
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,540
You all! Out!

613
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:24,870
What the heck were you doing?

614
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,550
What the heck were you doing, huh?

615
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,150
I haven't done anything.

616
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,270
You never trust me.

617
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:43,590
Shoot me already.

618
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,120
Just like how you shot your ex.

619
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:08,470
You're....

620
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,870
way more loose than I thought.

621
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,850
I shouldn't have loved a crappy guy like you.

622
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,170
I'm sorry.

[The unncut version of Kinn Porsche: The Series exclusive on iQIYI APP or iQ.COM]

633
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,760
There's someone stalking Mr. Kinn lately.

634
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,390
But I'm just not sure if you know him or not.

635
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:17,250
Are you certain that it's this guy you saw?

636
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,020
Yeah.

637
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,790
Well,

638
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:23,450
It's Tawan, Kinn's deceased ex.
