Qingyun's antidote is a secret

that we never give outsiders.

Get up.

00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,600
Father, she bewitched Bai Ze.

You must not be muddled-headed.

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,480
We must never give the antidote
to an outsider of unknown origin.

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,360
Why did Qinghuan
go to the forbidden area

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,120
and get poisoned?

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,200
Don't you know?

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,720
What does it have to do with me?

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,680
Are you sure it's not related to you?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,320
Martial Sister, you let Miss Qinghuan
send food to the dungeon on purpose.

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,800
She almost died because of you.

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
Stop lying anymore.

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,600
You're the one lying.

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,720
Master, I can swear.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,480
I was with Martial Sister.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,600
I saw everything with my own eyes.

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,400
After what happened,

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,000
do you still want to deny it?

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,760
Linyue,

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,200
what do you have to say?

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
Father, I didn't do it.

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,320
I only want to see her trespass
to the forbidden area

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,800
and drive her down the mountain.

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,400
I didn't know she would trigger
the mechanism of Qingyun Mist.

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,280
You...

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
Master, Qinghuan was poisoned
because of Linyue.

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,800
Please save her
by granting the antidote.

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,000
She was poisoned

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,160
because of Linyue.

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,680
I should give her the antidote.

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,400
But

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,800
the sect rules forbid

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,600
giving out the antidote to outsiders.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
So

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,720
I can't give the antidote.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,520
Master!

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,360
Enough said.

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
I've made up my mind.

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,400
Master,

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,400
I have another request.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,000
I, Bai Ze, want
to take Qinghuan as my wife.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
Please fulfill my wish.

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,000
What?

48
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,200
After I take her as my wife,

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,720
she'll be part of the Qingyun Sect.

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,120
That means she's qualified
to take the antidote.

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,000
You!

52
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,600
Please fulfill my wish.

I'll ask you one last time.
