Bai Ze!

Bai Ze,

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,280
I planted all these flowers.

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,360
Do you like them?

9
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,840
Ah! My flowers!

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,520
Why didn't you stay in Heaven?

11
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,880
Why must you come down
and suffer with me?

12
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,920
Immortal Bai Ze,
congratulations on your return.

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
Didn't you say

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,160
I have to go through three love ordeals?

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,160
I've only gone through two.

16
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,560
And,

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,280
what about Qinghuan?

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Be patient.

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,320
Why did she end up like this?

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,160
Because she descended from Heaven
to join you in your ordeals.

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,680
Whenever she goes through
one ordeal with you,

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,320
one of her petals will fall.

23
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,800
She has one petal left.

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,800
That's right.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,480
That petal

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
will be your last ordeal.

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,280
What do you mean?

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Back then,

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
this flower was saved by
the blood from your finger.

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,680
Due to that, you fell for her

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
and had to go through
three love ordeals.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
Right now, you have to remove

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
the last petal yourself

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,800
and make her vanish

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,720
so that you can finish
all three of your ordeals

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,520
and return to your cultivation.

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,280
Haha.

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,680
What are you laughing at?

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,600
Could it be that you're elated
about the third ordeal

40
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,800
being too easy for you?

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm laughing at myself
for getting my heart broken thrice

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
due to fate.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,800
And now, you want me
to destroy her myself?

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,080
Is being the Heavenly Emperor

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,760
that important?

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,360
Look closely.

47
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,400
Love is but an illusion.

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,360
She's just a flower.

49
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
No.

50
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,960
She's Qinghuan.

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,160
She's the woman I loved
for three lifetimes.

52
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,560
What are you doing?

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,720
Are you trying to save her?

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,920
You're only one step away
from being the Heavenly Emperor.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,160
Why must you waste all
of your effort at the very last step?

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,280
I told you this before.

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,960
I couldn't care less

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,200
about the Heavenly Emperor's throne.

59
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,520
What do you care about then?

60
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
I want to stay together with her

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
forever.

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,080
Why hasn't she returned to normal yet?

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,600
You've defied fate twice for her sake.

64
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,520
She should consider herself
lucky for being alive.

65
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,600

66

67

You're going to bring her home?

69

Wait, what do you mean by that?

70

Explain yourself!

71
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,960
What an ill-fated relationship.

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,960
