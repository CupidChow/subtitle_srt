Don't tell me

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,880
you're clueless about such things.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,480
Who says I'm clueless about it?

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,080
What are you trying to do?

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,560
Here I am lying by your side.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,520
We have reached the point
where we have to do it.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,880
What are you waiting for?

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,960
Until you become my husband,

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,440
it won't be too late for us
to do this and that.

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,480
This

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,200
and that.

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,480
What do you mean by that?

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,640
You ordered me to serve in the palace.

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,440
It's a long night.

17
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,760
Are you saying I don't have
to do anything?

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,400
Just stay with me

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,440
as you are now

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,800
so I can see you.

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,280
Alright.

22
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,520
Do you like it, Your Majesty?

23
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,720
Can you guess the song

24
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,400
I played just now?

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
I only know how to fight and kill.

26
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know anything

27
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,120
about these elegant things.

28
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,280
It's all right.

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,240
If you want to learn,

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,960
I can teach you.

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,440
No need.

32
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,440
I tried when I was young.

33
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
I find it boring.

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,640
It's not as interesting as using swords.

35
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
That was because the tutor
made it boring.

36
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,560
How about this?

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,360
Let's play a game.

38
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,680
You'll listen
and differentiate the notes.

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,280
If you make the wrong guess,

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,640
you'll have to drink a cup of wine.

41
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
All right.

42
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,360
What if I make the right guess?

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,800
What can

44
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,360
you give me?

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
If you make the right guess,

46
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,880
I'll kiss you.

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,160
What do you think?

48
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,600
Sounds fun.

49
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,400
It's "Gong."

50
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,880
You made the wrong guess.

51
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,880
It was "Shang."

52
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,480
Again.

53
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,240
It's "Zhi."

54
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,880
It's wrong again, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,200
The correct answer

56
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,040
is "Yu."

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,520
It's a pity you didn't guess
any of them correctly.

58
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,640
How about this?

59
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,680
I'll drink this cup

60
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,640
for you.

61
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,440
That's more like it.

62
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,440
Are you upset?

63
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,040
What's there to be upset about?

64
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,440
The dignified Crown Prince
of the Ling Empire

65
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,680
is proficient in such decadent music.

66
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,000
No wonder Ling Empire

67
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,080
can't defeat Great Sheng.

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,080
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
- Please stop.

69
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,880
I have a jar of great wine

70
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,280
to share with you.

71
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,240
You ignorant man of the Ling Empire!

72
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,960
Believe it or not, I'll cut you!

73
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Insolence.

74
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,240
You ignored the instructions
of the eunuchs

75
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,760
and barged into the Imperial Garden.

76
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,240
What's your intention?

77
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,040
You put aside my loyalty

78
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,880
and favor a hostage from Ling Empire!

79
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,240
What's the meaning of this then?

80
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,360
You're not in a position

81
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,280
to meddle in what happens in my chamber.

82
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,080
I'm the only Lord
with a different surname in Great Sheng.

83
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,280
You're nothing but a pretty boy
from Ling Empire.

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,000
You don't even deserve
to carry my shoes!

85
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,520
Guards!

86
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,240
Take Lord Yong away!

87
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,120
I can walk myself!

88
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,240
Get out of my way!

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,200
Are you done reflecting on your mistake?

90
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,720
I did nothing wrong.

91
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,640
If I did anything wrong,

92
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,640
it was loving you too much,
Your Majesty.

93
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm the ruler and you're a subject.

94
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,480
If I want you dead,

95
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,920
you'll have to die.

96
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,440
As a subject,

97
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,600
you barged into the sleeping chambers

98
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,800
and defied my orders.

99
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,640
You claimed to love me.

100
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,120
Are you saying your feelings for me

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,680
mean you can place yourself
above loyalty?

102
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,640
It was

103
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,800
a moment of confusion.

104
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
Never mind.

105
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,720
If you realized your mistake,

106
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
I won't pursue it anymore.

107
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,520
When I was the Crown Heir,

108
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,200
it was you who strongly supported me
to ascend the throne.

109
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,720
I have fought side by side
with you over the years.

110
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,240
I do

111
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,440
have feelings for you.

112
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240
Your Majesty...

113
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
But I only see you as a brother,

114
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,720
not a romantic partner.

115
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,480
In the end,

116
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,200
I still can't be compared
to the pretty boy from Ling Empire.

117
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
You don't need
to compare yourself to Bai Ze.

118
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
He's just someone who sleeps next to me.

119
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,720
But you're

120
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,800
