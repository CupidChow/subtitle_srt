Bai Ze, I...

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,120
Immortal Bai Ze.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,320
Bai Ze, I don't like her.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,040
Besides, we don't even know who she is.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,320
If you bring her back
without much thought,

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,160
my father won't allow it.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,520
Master has a benevolent heart.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,040
He took care of an orphan like me
since I was a child.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,560
How could he not welcome
a vulnerable girl?

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,960
I'll bring her back first.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,360
I'll be responsible if anything happens.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,000
Bai Ze,

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
is this Qingyun Sect?

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,720
Yes, take this place
as your own home from now on.

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,600
I wonder if Bai Ze likes flower baths.

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,720
I don't want you
to treat me like a sister.

19
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,600
If you're grateful to my father
for raising you,

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,720
you should marry me,

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,600
love me, dote on me,
and take care of me for life.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
I've told you so many times.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,240
I only see you as a sibling.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,520
I have no romantic feelings
toward you at all.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,880
What about Qinghuan?

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,560
What does this have to do with Qinghuan?

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,160
Mount Qingyun is my territory.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,640
If she keeps harassing you,

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,760
I'll drive her down the mountain.

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
I'm in trouble.

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm going to take my bath.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
So please stop following me.

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,040
What's wrong with Martial Brother?

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Who's there?

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,800
You wretch.

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,960
Why are you here?

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,400
I wanted to prepare
a flower bath for you.

38
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,160
But I overheard Miss Linyue wants
to drive me down the mountain.

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
So I... I tried to...

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,760
Don't worry.

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,520
Linyue may appear arrogant and willful.

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,240
But she's kind and honest.

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
She won't drive you away.

44

has bewitched Eldest Martial Brother.)

48
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,080
Bai Ze, I want to go with you.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,320
Why are you following me again?

50
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
I've told you so many times

51
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,800
Heavenly Dungeon is a forbidden area.
No one can enter freely.

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,440
You should go back now.

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,240
No.

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,360
That old fogey of the Demonic Sect
is very tight-lipped.

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,760
If we interrogate him together,

56
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,560
we may find out the whereabouts
of the Secret Art of Youming.

57
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,720
Who's there?

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640
Why are you here?

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, you trespassed
the forbidden area of Qingyun Sect.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,720
I've finally caught you red-handed.

61
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,200
We should get it straight
before accusing her.

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Forbidden area?

63
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,600
I didn't know this was a forbidden area.

64
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,000
Bai Ze,

65
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
I only want to follow you.

66
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,640
It was my fault for not telling you.

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Why don't you go back first?

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,400
It's dangerous here.

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,240
She can't leave.

70
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,640
She trespassed into the forbidden area
without any reason.

71
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,440
Even disciples
will be kicked out of the sect.

72
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,360
We ought to punish
an outsider like her severely.

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,160
Bai Ze, I'll tell Father about this

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,360
if you let her go today.

75
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,320
Those who don't know are not at fault.

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,840
I brought her back here.

77
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,600
So I'll be responsible
if anything happens.

78
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,520
We have trouble, Eldest Martial Brother!

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,480
The Nangong Family
came here with rage looking for you,

80
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,760
saying they want
to settle scores with you.

81
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,840
Master.

82
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,240
Bai Ze of the Qingyun Sect!

83
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,960
A lad like you sure is arrogant.

84
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,080
Did you pick on the Nangong Family,
thinking we're weak?

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,440
Elder He,

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,440
Nangong Jun didn't hesitate
to kill innocent young women

87
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,640
to sacrifice them as the bride
for Ghost Bridegroom.

88
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,640
As a disciple of the Qingyun Sect,

89
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,920
how can I do nothing about it?

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,520
Are you trying to cover up for him?

91
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,040
Outrageous! You have no evidence.

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,640
That's what you said.

93
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,040
Jun would never collude
with Ghost Bridegroom.

94
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,440
To offer the women as ghost brides,

95
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,560
he shook the Soul-Calling Bell
to control the villagers.

96
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,440
Evil energy would enter anyone's lungs

97
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,520
who shakes the Soul-Calling Bell.

98
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,440
It'll also remain within the chest.

99
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,240
If we want to confirm this matter,

100
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
we'll know the truth once we check him.

101
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
Nangong,

102
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,760
it looks like it's indeed...

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,960
Your disciple hurt

104
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,400
the Nangong Family's
only son ruthlessly,

105
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,320
and my son is paralyzed in bed now.

106
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,200
How are you going to solve this?

107
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Are you serious?

108
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,880
Master, I would never do anything
against my conscience.

109
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,280
I don't regret my action.

110
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,640
But it's my fault
for implicating Qingyun Sect.

111
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

112
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,160
Bai Ze, the eldest disciple
of the Qingyun Sect,

113
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,760
disrespected his elders

114
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,920
and took the punishment
into his own hands.

115
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,280
He shall be punished with three lashes.

116
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,600
He must capture Ghost Bridegroom
within half a month

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,920
to atone for his misdeeds.

118
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,440
Yes, Master.

119
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Nangong,

120
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
what do you think?

121
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,680
(The barrier of Qingyun's
forbidden area is too powerful.)

124

Bai Ze!

125
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,880
Bai Ze.

126
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,720
Let's go.

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Bai Ze.

128
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,160
Please bear it for a while.

129
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm almost done.

130
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
That must've hurt.

131
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,640
Master needs to appease Senior He.

132
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,360
It may look serious.

133
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,720
But these are just flesh wounds.
It's nothing serious.

134
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,640
Why are you crying?

135
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
Bai Ze,

136
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,720
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
You don't have to suffer this pain

138
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
if it wasn't for me.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
Helping the weak

140
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,160
is what the disciples
of the Qingyun Sect ought to do.

141
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
You think too highly of me.

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,040
No, you're the nicest to me
in this world.

143
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,120
Chief Bai wants you
to capture Ghost Bridegroom.

144
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,040
Take me with you.

145
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,240
I can help you.

146
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,880
No, you don't know any martial arts.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's too dangerous.

148
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,120
Just wait in Mount Qingyun
for my return.

149
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,880
Don't worry.
I'll capture Ghost Bridegroom.
