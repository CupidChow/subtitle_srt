that today's my last time lying to you.

and the life after?

43
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
I trusted you.

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
I hid nothing from you.

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,360
However,
you weren't sincere with me at all!

46
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,840
The Ling Empire and Great Sheng
have been rivals for generations.

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,120
How could we not plot
against each other?

48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
You've deceived me too, haven't you?

49
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,440
Yes.

50
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,160
I did deceive you regarding
the incident with the Third Prince.

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,760
However, what about

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,240
the moments we enjoyed together?

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,400
Were they all fake?

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,800
I loved you from
the start until the end!

55
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,720
My plan could only succeed

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,760
due to your love for me.

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,760
You're truly something else.

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,080
Weren't you afraid that I would
slay you out of spite

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,960
during the uprising of Lord Yong?

61
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,840
No pain, no gain.

62
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,360
It was a risky move to begin with.

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
How could I win your trust

64
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
and make you give me the tiger tally

65
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,000
if I didn't put myself
in a risky situation as such?

66
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,400
I'm not as ruthless as you.

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,080
I've lost.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,280
No.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,080
Qinghuan, you didn't lose.

70
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,560
I love you.

71
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,800
After all that I've been through,

72
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,840
you led my army against me

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,000
and put your sword against my neck.

74
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,680
Now, you're saying that you love me?

75
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,760
That's not it.

76
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,960
Qinghuan,

77
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,800
you and I are members
of the imperial family.

78
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,120
We understand the responsibility
we need to bear.

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,840
Yes.

80
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,960
At most, I was faking it.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,400
But after that, I truly fell for you.

82
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,920
Maybe it was because
you let me kiss you.

83
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,480
Maybe it was because you fended off
the assassins for me.

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,360
Maybe it was because

85
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,640
what we did on the bed.

86
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,040
I once thought

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,560
that I, Bai Ze, was born
for the sake of the Ling Empire

88
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
and its people.

89
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
But when I met you,

90
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,920
I realized

91
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
that I wanted to be selfish for once.

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
I no longer wanted to
live for their sake.

93
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
I wish to live for myself.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,680
I wish to be your husband.

95
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,640
I wish to grow old together with you,

96
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,840
until death do us part.

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720
It has already come to this.

98
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,240
Why are you still pretending?

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,520
Qinghuan, I'm serious.

100
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,320
I truly love you!

101
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,520
As long as you surrender,

102
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,960
I'll elect you
as the Empress of Great Ling.

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,840
If we truly love each other,

104
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,280
what's the difference
between me making you my empress

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
and you making me your monarch?

106
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,760
You're asking me what's the difference?

107
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,400
This is the difference.

108
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,080
Qinghuan,

109
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,240
it's too late.

110
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,240
It's pointless for you to kill me.

111
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,200
Your Majesty!

112
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,160
Your Majesty!

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,800
The prisoner army has already
surrounded the capital of Sheng!

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,240
The imperial army

115
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,240
has been annihilated!

116
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,880
Qinghuan,

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,400
just stop.

118
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,920
Just let me love you, okay?

119
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,440
If I kill you right now,

120
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,080
the prisoner army will fall apart

121
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,440
as they have no leader.

122
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,200
Even if you kill me,

123
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,800
Third Prince will avenge me.

124
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,880
By then, the people will be
the only ones who suffer.

125
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,960
So, even the Third Prince
was one of your pawns?

126
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,840
Ever since you stepped into
the state of Great Sheng,

127
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,160
all of your moves

128
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,760
were planned out in advance!

129
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,000
Qinghuan, that's not true.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,760
I truly love you! Please believe me!

131
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
I'll treat you well

132
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,960
as long as you surrender

133
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,240
the throne to me,

134
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,920
okay?

135
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,280
Qinghuan, please trust me.

136
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,080
Qinghuan,

137
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,760
trust me one last time.

138
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
I don't need you to treat me well.

139
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,160
Just treat my people well.

140
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,280
All right.

141
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
I promise you.

142
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,480
I'll treat the subjects and people of

143
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
Great Sheng well
if you become my empress.

144
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,000
I swear.

145
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,400
Fine.

146
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,680
Thank you,
