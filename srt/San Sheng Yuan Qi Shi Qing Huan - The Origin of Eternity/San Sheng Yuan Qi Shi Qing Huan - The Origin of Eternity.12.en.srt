Greetings, Your Majesty.

5
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
Does this jog your memory?

6
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,280
100,000 taels.

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,000
How generous of you.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,480
However, I don't get it

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,880
why

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,520
you offered 100,000 taels bribery

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,160
to Bai Shi

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,400
for putting in good words for you?

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,880
I'm held hostage here.

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,920
But I engage with the court official
without permission.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,280
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,240
Sure.

17
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,080
No, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Bai Ze.

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,480
Can't you think through this

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,440
with your smart brain?

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,120
In the entire Great Sheng,

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,440
the most powerful person

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,840
is now standing before you.

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,800
Why did you bribe Bai Shi

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,120
who is far away from you?

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,360
The 100,000 Ling soldiers

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,880
are captured

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,160
after they fought
to protect the Ling Empire.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,840
The imperial regime of the Ling Empire
owed them a lot.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
I will try any possible way,

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,840
even to bribe the court officials

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,200
to save their lives.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
I don't have any other intentions.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,080
Please investigate this, Your Majesty.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,120
I know.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,480
I will do the same as you

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,360
if I were in your shoes.

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,480
About the 100,000 Ling soldiers,

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,040
I will spare their lives.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
I appreciate your grace

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,760
on behalf of them, Your Majesty.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,240
Is a word of appreciation

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,920
enough to repay such a great grace?

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,240
What do you want, Your Majesty?

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
In return,

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,120
give yourself to me.

47
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,240
If you

48
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,120
can make me happy,

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,600
it's enough to show your appreciation.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,480
It matters the life
of the 100,000 soldiers.

51
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,840
This is not child's play.

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,480
Think about this carefully.

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
If you don't agree with this,

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,040
maybe I will regret this decision soon.

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,880
And it will be late

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,680
if you plead with me again.

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,840
You were saying

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,200
that you would try any possible way

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,000
for the sake of the soldiers.

60
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,640
But now, you only have to...

61
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
Bai Ze.

62
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,000
Have you kissed many women before?

63
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,800
You're the first one.

64
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
I

65
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,240
have changed my mind.

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
I want to be your first

67
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,480
and last woman.

68
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,280
As long as you become my companion,

69
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,720
I will recruit the 100,000 soldiers

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,680
into the prisoner army.

71
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,440
Empress shouldn't renege on her words.

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,680
Just now, you only requested me

73
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,520
to make you happy.

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
No, I said I would spare their lives.

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,400
Whether they are becoming

76
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,280
the slaves

77
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,600
or warriors,

78
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
it will be decided by your answer.

79
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,320
Do consider it well.

80
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,680
Hang it well.

81
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
Hang this on that side.

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,280
Make sure they're aligned.

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,400
Help him.

84
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
Do it properly.

85
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,800
Don't let it fall.

86
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,480
What are you doing?

87
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,080
You're here, Your Majesty.

88
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,200
Do you like the decoration?

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,680
After we get married...

90
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm not going to marry you.

91
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,800
Your Majesty,
I'm a highly decorated general

92
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,440
who is purely loyal to you.

93
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,080
Besides, I have been loving you
for years.

94
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,720
Is taking me as your principal husband

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
too much to ask?

96
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,960
Yes, it is.

97
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,200
I have conferred the title
of Lord Yong on you

98
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,360
for your military achievement.

99
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,280
Out the Sheng,

100
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,560
you're the only lord
who's not of royal descent.

101
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,440
Except for me,

102
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,480
is there anyone who deserves you?

103
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,800
Are you going to take that wimp
as your consort

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
instead of me?

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,480
You have ten minutes

106
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,840
to clean this place up.

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,800
Otherwise, you're doomed.

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,760
Your Majesty.

109
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,640
Bai Ze, the Crown Prince
of the Ling Empire is here.

110
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,480
I, Bai Ze

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,840
