Lord Yong, this wine

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,560
will be my farewell to you.

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,400
Your Majesty!

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,640
Your Majesty,

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,640
we have trouble.

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,720
Lord Yong...

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Lord Yong, he...

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,840
He...

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,160
What about Lord Yong?

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,000
Lord Yong

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
killed himself.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,200
What?

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,920
(Before Lord Yong killed himself,)

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,600
(only Official Bai Shi visited him.)

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,680
(After I arrived
at Official Bai Shi's residence,)

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
(he has already taken poison
to end his life.)

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,680
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,120
Even if you're in a foul mood,

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
you must not harm your health.

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
Does this expression

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,000
show you feeling sad for me?

24
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,880
Do you find me ridiculous?

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,880
I have the riches of the world.

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,960
Yet, I couldn't see through
the one close to me.

27
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,280
Your Majesty, don't overthink.

28
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
I only want you to be well.

29
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I'll go and take the medicine for you.

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
Do you know

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,520
the sword you used in the dance

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,720
was a birthday gift

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,880
Lord Yong gave me?

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
I haven't been here for long.

35
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
I didn't know that.

36
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Yes,

37
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,760
you've only been here

38
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,880
for several months.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But you managed

40
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,520
to drive discord
between me and my ministers

41
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
and get rid of my capable ministers.

42
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,080
Such a meticulous design

43
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,920
and ruthless means!

44
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Guards!

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,400
Throw Bai Ze into the dungeon!

46
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
You refused to confess

47
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,280
but only asked to see me.

48
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,640
Here I am.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So tell me.

50
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
Your Majesty,

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,680
just kill me.

52
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
Why did you call me here
if you want to die?

53
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,880
Do you expect me to feel sad

54
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,760
after seeing you covered in injuries?

55
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,160
Father warned me before.

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,080
A ruler

57
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,760
should be merciless

58
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,880
and address one as a ruler.

59
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
But I refused to listen.

60
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,120
I gave you my heart.

61
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,920
But what did you give me in return?

62
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,200
I know you won't believe

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
anything I say now.

64
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
I

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
don't fear death.

66
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,680
I only ask

67
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,040
you

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,040
one thing.

69
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,080
Please release

70
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,680
the war prisoners from Ling Empire.

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,960
They took part in the rebellion

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,720
because they were coerced by Lord Yong.

73
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,160
They had no choice but to do that.

74
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,480
Do you know

75
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,120
how many war prisoners died
under my command these five days?

76
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
It was you

77
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,600
who used Bai Shi

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,480
to provoke Lord Yong to rebel.

79
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,280
That's why they died in vain!

80
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,760
Don't you think you're funny

81
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,280
to tell me all these now?

82
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,760
Bai Shi and I

83
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,320
are only involved
in that 100 thousand silver taels notes.

84
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,000
You already know

85
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,760
about this.

86
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,280
Besides this,

87
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm not involved

88
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,560
in anything else.

89
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,800
Do you really think

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm a fatuous ruler
who's obsessed with beauty?

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,920
The day you entered Great Sheng
as a hostage,

92
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,080
you must have deliberately planned
how to get rid of Lord Yong.

93
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,920
Since you think I'm guilty,

94
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,120
why do you still

95
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,880
interrogate me

96
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,080
so I would admit it myself?

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
I want you to admit it yourself

98
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,280
so I can give up on my feelings.

99
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,120
I feel the same too.

100
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,920
I can only give up

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,080
after seeing you.

102
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,520
What did you say?

103
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
When it comes to political strategy,

104
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,760
no one in Great Sheng

105
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,520
can surpass me.

106
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
If I truly

107
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,920
intend of harming Lord Yong,

108
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,120
it would be meticulously planned.

109
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,760
How could I let you easily find out

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
that it's related to me?

111
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,320
It doesn't matter
if you believe me or not,

112
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,400
I

113
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,880
have no secret plans with Bai Shi

114
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,680
to harm Lord Yong.

115
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,720
Do you think I would believe

116
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
what you say now?

117
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,240
Why would I lie

118
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,880
when I'm dying?

119
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,000
Your Majesty,

120
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,680
someone set the study room on fire
after Bai Shi died.

121
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,120
They intend to destroy evidence.

122
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,680
Luckily, I've searched Bai's Residence
under order

123
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,880
and managed to retrieve
the letters in time.

124
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Someone set fire to the study room?

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,760
Bai Shi didn't kill himself
out of guilt?

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,160
Who sent the letters?

127
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,040
In my opinion,

128
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,960
Bai Shi was poisoned.

129
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,400
The one who sent him the letters
is the Third Prince of the Ling Empire.

130
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
In the letter, it stated

131
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,360
if Bai Shi managed to kill Lord Yong

132
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,040
and let Ling Empire's Crown Prince
take the fall,

133
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,400
Bai Shi
will receive 10 thousand gold taels.

134
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,600
