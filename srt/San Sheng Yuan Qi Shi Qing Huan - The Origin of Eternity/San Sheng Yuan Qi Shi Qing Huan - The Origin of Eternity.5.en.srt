Eldest Martial Brother,
have you eliminated Ghost Bridegroom?

That's great.

Congratulations, Eldest Martial Brother.

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,400
I have to thank Qinghuan
for her contribution

to helping me complete this task.

Bai Ze,

72
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
my father obviously sent you
to take on Ghost Bridegroom alone.

73
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,640
Why did she go with you?

74
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,720
I went down the mountain secretly.

75
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,800
Bai Ze didn't know beforehand.

76
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,160
Shut up! It was your fault
Bai Ze had to kill Ghost Bridegroom

77
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,760
to atone for his misdeeds.

78
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,160
Yet, you cause more trouble
by going down the mountain.

79
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,400
How can you be worthy of him?

80
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,800
Martial Sister,
why are you scolding Miss Qinghuan?

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,720
It's not like you completed the tasks

82

Can you discipline her?

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,760
Linyue, I told you

87
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,320
to send him food and water
before I left.

88
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,400
Why didn't you do it?

89
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,920
I want to starve him.

90
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
So that he knows

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,920
he's no longer the leader
of the Demonic Sect.

92
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,280
If he doesn't hand over
the Secret Arts of Youming...

don't be upset.

This is between Bai Ze and me!

98

I don't need an outsider
like you to interfere!

99
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
Qinghuan is not an outsider.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,240
I've already proposed to her.

101
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,760
Soon, she'll be my wife.

102
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
Really?
Congratulations, Eldest Martial Brother.

103
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,400
I forbid it!

104
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,120
You proposed to her
without Father's permission

105
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,320
and violated the sect's rules

106
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,560
for planning your life privately.

107
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,360
I'll ask for Master's permission.

108
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,760
What about me if you marry her?

109
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,360
Linyue, stop being ridiculous.

110
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,960

111

Martial Sister! Martial Sister!

112
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Martial Sister, are you all right?

113
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
Wake up! Open your eyes, Martial Sister!

Master,

116
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
how's Linyue?

117
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,320
I've been teaching her
the Qingyun Sect's mental cultivation.

118
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,320
She was careless in her cultivation,

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,680
which imbalanced her life energy
caused by energy disorders in her body.

120
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,840
Imbalance of life energy?

121
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,720
Is there a way to help her?

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,120
She's safe for now.

123
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,240
But

124
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,320
I need someone to heal her vessels
with internal power.

125
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,480
But I'm too busy
with the countless matters of the sect.

126
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,320
Bai Ze, can you take care
of Linyue for me?

127

it's my duty as an elder brother.

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Good.

130
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,760
Martial Sister, do you feel better now?

131
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,880
I still feel unwell, Bai Ze.

132
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
Bai Ze, you always heal me
whenever I'm hurt.

133
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,680
You're so kind to me.

134
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
You're my Martial Sister.

135
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,160
I ought to take care of you
as your Martial Brother.

136
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,960
But I don't want
to be your Martial Sister.

137
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Martial Sister.

138

I can't hear you! No, I can't!

145
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,360
Go and make out with Miss Linyue!

146
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,360
I wasn't making out with her.

147
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,800
Why are you denying it when I saw it?

148
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,040
Are you jealous?

149
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,280
I'm not jealous.

150
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,280
You're jealous.

151
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm not.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,440
I don't want to have a sty in my eye

You knew

156
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,600
Linyue is injured.

157
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,080
I was treating her injuries.

158
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,840
You're lying.

159
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,360
Why do you have to hug her
when treating her injuries?

160
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,000
Qinghuan.

161

Let me explain.

163
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,560
Get out of the way.

164
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,560
Put me down!

165
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,560
I'll prove there's nothing
between Linyue and me.
