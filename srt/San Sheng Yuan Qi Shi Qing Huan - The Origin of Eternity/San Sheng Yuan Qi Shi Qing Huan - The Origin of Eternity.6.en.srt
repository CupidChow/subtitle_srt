I want to save her.

90

This is the forbidden area.

You can't just break into it.

Are you insane?
Qinghuan trespassed in the area

93
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,120
out of evil intentions. She must be...

No, she won't.

The forbidden area is set up
with dangerous machinations.

You will get hurt severely.
