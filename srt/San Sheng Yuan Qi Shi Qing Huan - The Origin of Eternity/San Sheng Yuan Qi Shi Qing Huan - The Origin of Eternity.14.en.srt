3
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,480
My Lord.

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,480
Her Majesty placed me
in a period of solitude.

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,680
Why do you come here?

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,680
My Lord, you failed to notice
that someone is making fool of you.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,560
If I don't come to remind you,

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,360
the Great Sheng

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,920
is soon to be overthrown
by the Ling Empire.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
We had a strife at the court

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,080
because of the 100,000 Ling soldiers.

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,800
Have you ever thought

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,080
that the lives of the Ling soldiers

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,240
were what I asked for?

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,480
What do you mean?

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,480
If it wasn't your idea,

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,000
was it Her Majesty?

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,400
Her Majesty became besotted
with the Crown Prince.

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,680
So the said soldiers' lives were saved

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
because she was blinded
by her obsession.

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,280
However,

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,880
if Her Majesty were to give birth
to a son or a daughter

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,160
of that Crown Prince,

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,360
then,

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,600
he will become the Emperor Emeritus
of the Sheng Empire.

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Shut it.

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,480
Her Majesty is of noble royal descent

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,960
and can never be sullied
by the Ling people.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,280
True. I always think

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,240
that you're the best candidate
for the consort.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Yet Bai Ze turns up out of nowhere.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,080
Her Majesty likes him.

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,240
What can I do?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,960
True though.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,840
Her Majesty is the monarch

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,360
and we are her subjects.

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
Only monarch can act as they wish

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,680
and love whoever they love.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,960
What are you trying to get at?

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
Nothing.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,560
I just feel bad for you.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,440
Your sincerity has turned in vain.

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
Look at what you have done.

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,400
You left your soldiers out of discipline

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,640
and stay shut in here.

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,080
The soldiers are cheering for Lord Yong
in the encampment.

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,840
Do you want to rebel?

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,960
Your Majesty.

49
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,480
Why do you prefer that useless wimp?

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,440
I'm superior to him all over.

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
Have many times should I repeat this?

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Both of you are different to me.

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,640
Deep inside you,

54
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,640
I have nothing on him.

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
Right?

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,680
Fine.

57
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,200
I admit this.

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Can I be your secondary husband?

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,280
Stop forcing me.

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,880
Is that really too much to ask?

61
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,600
Fine.

62
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
A paramour or a bedmate?

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,360
Just give me the position.

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,920
You're only Lord Yong.

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,640
I don't want it.

66
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,480
All I ask for is you.

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,080
Are you insane?

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
As long as you try it,

69
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,440
you will know I'm a real man

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,400
who is way better than
that darned Bai Ze.

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,160
Look at what you have done now.

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,640
You don't even deserve
to compare with him.

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,840
Don't force my hand.

74
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,200
My Lord, I have passed down your order.

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,400
All soldiers will not report for duty

76
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,840
as long as Her Majesty doesn't resume
you back to the court.

77
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,280
Well done.

78
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,320
Go and get some money

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,080
to treat a great feast to the soldiers

80
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,600
and send my thanks to them.

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,960
Thank you, My Lord.

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,560
Your Majesty.

83
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,880
I want you to know

84
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,600
that who is more important to you,

85
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,040
that wimp or me.

86
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
My Lord.

87
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Why are you still sitting here

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
when trouble is soon befalling you?

89
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,080
Hmph, I sit here

90
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,680
because of Her Majesty's order.

91
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,080
The soldiers refuse to report for duty

92
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,400
and appeal for your sake.

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,800
Is that your idea?

94
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,760
My Lord, you're sending yourself
to your demise.

95
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,480
No monarch can tolerate

96
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,480
if the soldiers refuse
to listen to them,

97
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,760
but a general.

98
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
(I want her to know)

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,320
(she will only be regarded
as the empress)

100
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
(if I approve of her.)

101
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,440
(Her Majesty has already
been bewitched by Bai Ze)

102
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,720
(and neglected the states.)

103
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,400
(All the officials have disapproved
of her for long.)

104
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
(Why don't I take this opportunity)

105
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
(to take over her throne?)

106
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,320
(I will kill Bai Ze)

107
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
(and confer her as my empress consort.)

108
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,000
(Kill two birds with one stone.)

109
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,440
Have you done reviewing the memorandums?

110
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,160
Not yet.

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
Because

112
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,640
there is a beauty

113
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
sitting beside me,

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
my mind

115
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,600
is distracted.

116
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,760
To not distract you,

117
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,560
I shall take my leave.

118
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,960
Don't be shy.

119
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,360
Bad news, Your Majesty!

120
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,480
How bad?

121
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Go on.

122
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,800
Lord Yong claimed that he will
clean up the evils beside the empress.

123
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,280
He led the prisoner army
and surrounded the palace.

124
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,960
Clean up the evil?

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,120
Who is the so-called evil?

126
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,160
The person I have been tolerant

127
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,280
turned out to be the enemy.

128
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,520
How could you turn your back on me
and rebel

129
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,360
just because of Bai Ze?

130
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,600
The one who turned her back on me first

131
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,120
is you.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,440
I've promoted you as Lord Yong

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
who has the most powerful person
below me.

134
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,440
Isn't that enough?

135
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,440
No.

136
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,000
It's nowhere near enough.

137
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,560
You only peg me as your dog
to fight wars

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,600
if I'm only Lord Yong.

139
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,720
You will never peg me as a man.

140
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,720
You're my bosom friend who
has gone through hardships with me.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,120
I want to be your man.

142
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,240
Seeing you stay so close

143
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,200
to Bai Ze,

144
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
I wish I could die.

145
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,400
Go on, then.

146
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,320
(Unification Hall)

147
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,560
I wonder why you ask for me,
Your Majesty.

148
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
Issue a decree on my behalf.

149
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,320
Lord Yong will be stripped of his title

150
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,760
and exiled to the boundary

151
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,440
and is never allowed to return.

152
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,440
Your Majesty, Lord Yong
has committed treason.

153
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,280
It's better to destroy the evil forever.

154
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,240
I have made up my mind.

155
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,720
Say no more.

156
00:08:58,301 --> 00:08:59,240
Leave now.

157
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Yes.

158
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,360
This liquor is
from the Fuchun restaurant.

159
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,080
And these are your favourite dishes.

160
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,640
So, this is my last meal.

161
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,240
Her Majesty is determined
to kill you before the public

162
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,560
as intimidation for others.

163
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,920
We have tried our best
to beg for your sake.

164
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,880
But Her Majesty didn't change her mind.

165
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,320
I can't believe she wants
to humiliate me like this.

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,680
I finally come to realise

167
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,920
that I mean nothing to her.

168
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,640
