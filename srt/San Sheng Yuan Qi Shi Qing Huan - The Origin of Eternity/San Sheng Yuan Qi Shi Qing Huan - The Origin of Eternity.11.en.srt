00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,900
Come forward and let me see you.

4
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,060
I was thinking of the same thing too.

5
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,540
You're as radiant as the sun
and the moon.

6
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,900
Handsome and unrestrained.

7
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,380
You have a gentle manner too.

8
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,620
Your reputation precedes you.

9
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,020
Crown Prince of Ling Empire,

10
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,100
are you willing

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,820
to enter my Imperial Harem?

12
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,700
Are you recommending yourself

13
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,540
to be my Crown Princess, Your Majesty?

14
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,060
How dare you!

15
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,060
Stop.

16
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,060
Are you trying to revolt

17
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,500
by drawing your sword in the palace?

18
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,980
I dare not.

19
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,660
Your Majesty,

20
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,660
he's merely a hostage
from the Ling Empire.

21
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,820
Yet, he has an improper desire
toward Your Majesty.

22
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,460
I just can't accept that.

23
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,140
But he's so handsome.

24
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,780
If I don't let him serve me,

25
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,580
are you going to serve me?

26
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,940
If Your Majesty has the intention,

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,740
I shall remove my armor right away
and enter your Imperial Harem.

28
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,420
Never mind.

29
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,260
You have spoiled the banquet
for no reason.

30
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,380
Let's keep drinking.

31
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,020
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

32
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,540
I've heard a lot about you, Lord Yong.

33
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,940
After meeting you,
you sure deserve your reputation.

34
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,700
I guess you've heard
of my great strength.

35
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,140
Just conceited and lack of composure.

36
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,140
Don't try flattering me
with that genteel manner.

37
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,500
I'm a military officer.

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,500
A gentleman should be composed
and not arrogant.

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,060
A vile person is conceited
and lack of composure.

40
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,940
Lord Yong,

41
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,300
you should read more.

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,700
Why you!

43
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,540
Anping,

44
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,340
do you remember

45
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,500
the dream I always had?

46
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,900
Do you mean the dream

47
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,740
where you were a martial arts hero
of a famous sect

48
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,620
and the demon girl of a cult?

49
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,980
She looks exactly

50
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,700
like the one in my dreams.

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,260
Who?

52
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,860
The high and mighty Crown Prince
of Ling Empire

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,740
is nothing

54
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,780
but a weak man with a pretty face.

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,500
He's beautiful enough to feast the eyes

56
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,940
to forget hunger.

57
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,020
Your Majesty,

58
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,820
don't tell me you're interested
in that pretty boy.

59
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,220
How should I express my love to him

60
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,300
so

61
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,340
he can be grateful to me?

62
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,940
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

63
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,460
Your Majesty!

64
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,540
I've turned into a wicked demon girl
beyond forgiveness.

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,540
No, you're not.

66
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,540
You're innocent.

67
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,020
No matter what,

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,340
you're the one I love the most.

69
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,660
We'll bear

70
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,620
all responsibility together.

71
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,780
Can we? It'll be all right.

72
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,740
Qinghuan!

73
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:10,940
Qinghuan!

74
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,900
Master, let me go!

75
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,460
Let me go!

76
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,940
Qinghuan! Qinghuan!

77
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,380
Qinghuan.

78
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,100
Qinghuan.

79
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,820
Qinghuan!

80
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Qinghuan

81
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,380
is my name.

82
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,620
How did you know that?

83
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,900
Your Majesty?

84
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,100
Anping, dress me!

85
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,300
Anping.

86
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,340
Anping, where are you?

87
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,620
Crown Prince, are you behaving this way

88
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,340
because you're afraid
I'd do something to you?

89
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,780
You must be kidding, Your Majesty.

90
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

91
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,540
That's not how

92
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,460
you addressed me in your dream.

93
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,020
It looks like you dreamed of me

94
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,260
because you desire me.

95
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,540
Why do you want me

96
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,060
to enter your Imperial Harem?

97
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,460
Because

98
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,340
I like you.

99
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,420
I don't believe you.

100
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,620
You made Sheng Empire dominate the north

101
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,460
less than a year
after you ascended the throne.

102
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,060
Your remarkable talent and wisdom
are rare in this world.

103
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,060
You're not the kind of fatuous monarch
who would be misled by beauty.

104
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,420
So do you

105
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,820
prefer my talents and wisdom

106
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,620
or

107
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,900
a fatuous ruler
who's obsessed with beauty?

108
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,620
Your Majesty, please watch your conduct.

109
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,500
I didn't even touch you.

110
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,060
How am I supposed to watch my conduct?

111
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,940
I don't like overbearing people
like Lord Yong.

112
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,900
I'll wait for you

113
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,460
to beg me

114
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,820
to want you.

115
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Your Majesty,

116
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,020
those 100 thousand Ling people

117
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,420
are war prisoners my soldiers captured

118
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,740
when they attacked Great Sheng.

119
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,820
Since they're war prisoners,

120
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,860
why can't I kill them?

121
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,380
Lord Yong,

122
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,020
that's 100 thousand human lives.

123
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,260
Even if you're not afraid carrying
the sins of too much killing,

124
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,060
you should accumulate virtue
for Her Majesty.

125
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,900
Then tell me

126
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,540
what are we supposed to do with them?

127
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,300
Don't tell me we should release them.

128
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,180
Your Majesty,

129
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,340
I think

130
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,740
we can offer amnesty and recruit them

131
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,460
under the command of Lord Yong.

132
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,420
Absolutely not!

133
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,220
Those Ling people

134
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,700
are a bunch of vengeful ingrates.

135
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,940
I will not have any of them.

136
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,100
Your Majesty.

137
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,380
Enough said.

138
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,260
Let's end it here today.

139
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,380
I'm tired.

140
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,500
Your Majesty.

141
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,740
The Empress of Great Sheng
didn't say anything.

142
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,340
What should we do now?

143
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,540
It's an honor for 100 thousand soldiers

144
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
to die in battle

145
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,660
while defending the country.

146
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,540
But it's not worth if they are beheaded

147
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,140
after being defeated and captured.

148
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,700
I must do all I can

149
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,780
for them.

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,180
Prepare another lavish gift

151
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,980
and send it...
