Your Majesty, you were so happy

when you were preparing
your wedding gown.

you're finally my empress now.

Back then,

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Your Majesty was always patient

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,400
and didn't dare to
attempt anything indecent.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,200
Why are you doing the opposite

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
now that you're the emperor?

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400

Your Majesty, do you still remember

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,480
what you promised me before our wedding?

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Of course.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,400
I said that I would belong to you
in this life,

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,360
next life, and the life after.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,040
I wasn't referring to that.

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Which one are you referring to?

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,520
Your Majesty, you promised me

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,120
that you would treat the subjects
and people of Great Sheng well.

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,760
Of course I remember that.

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,120
All of your subjects are witnessing
our wedding.

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,760
And, the Sheng Empire will be
exempted from tax for three years.

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,200
Don't worry.

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,520
Alright.

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,920
Your Majesty, I believe that
you're a wise ruler

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
and a man of your word.

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
You will never go back
on your word, right?

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,520
Naturally.

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,120
Huh?

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,400

of the 13th Sheng Dynasty,

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,600
has caused the destruction
of our nation due to personal feelings.

58
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,920
I have no way to face my ancestors.

59
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,400
I shall

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,320
never love anyone again.

61

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Qinghuan, I was wrong!

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,360
Why are you doing this to me?

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,760
It was a shame that
I was born into the imperial family.

66

I...

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,760
I'll return the throne to you!

68
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,400
I'll be your monarch!

69
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,160
Can you please forgive me?

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,480
Can you please not leave me?

71
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,120
Are you deceiving me again?

73
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,920
Qinghuan,
I'm not deceiving you this time!

74
