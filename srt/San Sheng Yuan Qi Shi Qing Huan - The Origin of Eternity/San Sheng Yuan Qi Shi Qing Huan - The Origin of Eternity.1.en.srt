00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,400
It has been ten thousand years

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,040
since you ascended as an immortal.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,960
After experiencing three lifetimes
of tribulations in the mortal world,

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,960
you'll definitely ascend
to the Heavenly Palace

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,240
as the Heavenly Emperor.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,120
The position of the Heavenly Emperor
is not what I want.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,320
Facing tribulations in the mortal world
is even more unnecessary.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,720
Now, don't be too mean with your words.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,560
Fate had already been decided.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,480
We only wait for it to realize.

13
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,389
Immortal Bai Ze, you sure have
a profound cultivation.

14
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:24,829
With just a slight touch of your robe,

15
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:27,589
the iris has taken the form of a human.

16
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,309
It's something to celebrate about.

17
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,709
Not only do you look handsome,

18
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:33,989
but your name is also nice.

19
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,149
I'm Qinghuan.

20
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,309
Immortal Bai Ze, wait for me.

21
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,149
Speaking of fate,

22
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,149
his fate is here.

23
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,109
This will be interesting.

24
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:54,880
Immortal Bai Ze.

25
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,265
Why do you keep following me?

26
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,320
You transformed me into an immortal.

27
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:05,139
I would naturally set my mind on you

28
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:07,208
and serve you

29
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,168
forever.

30
00:02:11,688 --> 00:02:13,328
I didn't mean to transform you.

31
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:14,648
I don't need you to serve me too.

32
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,208
From now on,
don't show up in front of me.

33
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:18,248
What?

34
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,005
Immortal Bai Ze!

35
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:34,245

in following you for the past year.
