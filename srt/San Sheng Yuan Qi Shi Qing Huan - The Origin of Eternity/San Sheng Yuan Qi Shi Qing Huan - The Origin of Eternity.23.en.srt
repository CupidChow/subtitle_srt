00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,640
It's me. Bai Ze has left.

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,240
He finally left.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,320
Do you detest him that much?

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,960
Bai Ze was pretty nice to you.

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,320
He's looking after you
in every way possible.

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,360
That's the bad thing.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,720
He's only one step away
from being the Heavenly Emperor.

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,120
Why is he following me around

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,920
instead of cultivating his powers?

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,560
I'm just a normal-looking fairy

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,160
with low cultivation.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,320
How could he give up on his cultivation

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,560
because of me?

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,120
Don't you think he's good-looking?

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,640
Huh?

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,040
His name sounds nice too.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Hmm.

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,360
He's good-looking.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,960
However, he's over 10,000 years old.
I'm only 300 years old.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,960
Anyway...

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,840
Anyway, I won't fall for an old man

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,920
who doesn't strive to improve himself.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,800
Bai Ze, oh, Bai Ze,

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,760
this is truly unexpected.

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,920
Siming Deity,

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm only sharing
my heartfelt thoughts with you.

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,560
Don't tell Immortal Bai Ze about this.

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,760
Hmm.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,320
Sir, what do you mean by this?

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,720
Wait.

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,160
This is for you.

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,520
Hmm?

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,640
No thanks.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,040
I thought you loved it?

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
I no longer love it.

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,640
Your spiritual root is very weak.

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,320
You need to enhance it
with some peaches.

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,240
Hmm?

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,720
No thanks. Having tonics
is just a temporary solution.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,120
Focusing on one's cultivation
is the permanent solution here.

43
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,320
Although that's the case,

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,920
you must remember not to be hasty.

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Hmm?

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,960
I don't need your help.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,640
I've been cultivating my powers
for a long time.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,000
It should be time now.

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,600
That old man didn't allow me
to go through the thunder strikes.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,520
I'll show him what I'm made of
once I pass this ordeal.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,720
Hmph.

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Why isn't it over yet?

53
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,120
Qinghuan, you'll be fine.

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm here. I'll protect you.

55
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,840
You must live on.

56
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,720

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
Are you deceiving me again?

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,480
I'm serious!

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,880
Qinghuan, I'm serious!
I'm not deceiving you!

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Qinghuan, come back!

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,560
Qinghuan!

68
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Qinghuan!
