Your Majesty, I'm grateful

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
that you're willing

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
to appoint me as the monarch.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,120
However,

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,680
I'm already tired of the mind games
they play here.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,240
Your Majesty, it's better for you
to seek another partner.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,240
Are you saying

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,840
that the night we spent together

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,000
was just you repaying me

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,240
with your body?

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,440
Bai Ze,

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,080
are you joking with me?

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,240
I did so in order to repay
my debt of gratitude.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,160
That is all.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,880
I treated you with all my heart.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,880
I treated you as my lover.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,400
Who did you take me for?

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,320
You think I'm just a client
that lusts for your body?

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,240
Now, you have two choices.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,320
First, remain in Great Sheng
as my monarch.

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,840
We can enjoy our lives here.

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,680
I'll treat it as if
that conversation never happened.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,000
However, if you wish to
abandon yourself to vice,

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,640
you should get out of the palace.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,600
You better think twice.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,680
If you leave the palace,

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,240
you'll be severing your ties with me.

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,920
If you come to me next time,

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,680
I'll treat you as a prostitute.

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,800
If you desire something,

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,000
you can exchange it with your body.

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,200
Your Majesty, take care.

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,240
The days are long.

Your Highness.

I...

I finally met you.

66

Your Majesty,

67
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,680
the assassin who tried
to assassinate the crown prince

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,200
is the subordinate
of Ling Empire's Third Prince.

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
He was the one who killed Bai Shi too.

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,120
Seems like the Third Prince thinks
that his throne hasn't been secured.

71
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,480
Hmm.

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,800
Kill him.

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,800
Send his head to the Third Prince.

74
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,200
Your Majesty,

76
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,040
Bai Ze knocked on
the palace gate last night

77
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,960
and was seeking an audience with you.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,520
Bai Ze?

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,360
Yes.

80
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,360
He'll never come to me
without any important reasons.

81
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,200
Tell him to come in.

82
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,200
Your Majesty,
I'm willing to be your monarch.

84
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,280
What do you take me for?

85
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,840
Do you think I'm your plaything
that's always at your disposal?

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,280
If you don't want to make me
your monarch,

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,360
you can make me your concubine, guard,

88
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,840
even your boy toy!

89
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:56,960
Stop!

90
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,600
Are you out of your mind?

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,080
Do you know what you're doing?

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,560
Your Majesty, I'm just
following your instruction.

93
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
I'm using my body to exchange
the things I desire.

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,040
What do you desire?

95
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,120
Military power.

96
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,080
You desire military power?

97
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,240
Guangan!

98
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,880
Guangan, what happened?

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,760
The Third Prince ran out of patience.

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,600
He poisoned both His Majesty
and Her Majesty!

101
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,320
Now, he has usurped the throne!

102
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,960
Your Highness, you must
reclaim our empire

103
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,160
and avenge the late emperor and Empress!

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,560
We mustn't let the Ling Empire

105
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,640
fall into

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,240
the hands of a tyrant!

107
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,560
Third Prince failed to assassinate me
after all this while.

108
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,800
After that, he actually poisoned
both of my parents!

109
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,520
I will avenge them!

110
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,080
Your Majesty, please lend me
your military power

111
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,960
so that I can avenge my parents.

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,280
Giving you military power
is not a small matter.

113
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,160
I cannot make the decision on my own.

114
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,280
As long as
you're willing to help me out,

115
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,400
I will agree to your every request.

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
Your body alone

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
isn't worth it for me
to attack the Ling Empire.

118
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,440
My body alone isn't worth it?

119
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,040
What about my love for you then?

120
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,360
Your Majesty,

121
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,960
now, both of my parents are gone.

122

I've already lost everything.
