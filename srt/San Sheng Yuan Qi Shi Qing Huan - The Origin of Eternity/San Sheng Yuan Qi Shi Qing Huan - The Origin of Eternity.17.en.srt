00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,060
(Immense Bliss)

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
You're still not willing to see me?

5
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,560
I've been learning

6
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,560
how to play guqin from
the guqin expert in the palace.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,920
Only then,

8
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,680
I found out

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,360
that the song you played for me

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,800
was called Song of Courtship.

11
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,000
You're finally willing to see me now.

12
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,960
Your Majesty, you should stop playing

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,120
such decadent music.

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,120
So, the crown prince of the Ling Empire

15
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,200
is actually well-versed
in such decadent music.

16
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,760
It's no wonder the Ling Empire

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,480
couldn't defeat the Great Sheng.

18
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,160
I thought

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
you would feel happier

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,200
when you listen to my playing.

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,200
Your Majesty, you visit
the courier hostel every day.

22
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Aren't you afraid that people
might gossip about you?

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
I just wanted to see you.

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,720
Your Majesty, you've seen me now.

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
Please return.

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,040
(I wonder if he has taken his
medicine on time for the past few days?)

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
(I wonder how his recovery is going?)

28
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,680
There's an assassin.

29
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,600
Don't be afraid.

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,720
I'll protect you.

31
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,400
However, you need to give me
something in return.

32
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,360
Someone!

33
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Take him to the imperial cell!

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,960
Yes, Your Majesty!

35
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,240
Your Majesty,

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
you're hurt.

37
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm fine.

the incident about the Third Prince

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,800
will be my last time lying to you.

41
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,040
Can you forgive me?

42
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,360
I still cannot bring myself to hate you.

43
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,000
Return to the palace with me.

44
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
This place is unsafe.

45
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,520
You are?

46
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,920
Your Majesty, you once said

47
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,720
that you wanted me to stay with you.

48
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,080
I have no way to repay you

49
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,440
for saving my life.

50
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,240
I can only offer myself to you.

51
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,400
Your Majesty,

52
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,000
are you willing to accept me?
