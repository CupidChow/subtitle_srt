Bai Ze.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,720
Qinghuan?

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,720
This is dangerous.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,560
Why are you here?

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,160
I'm not afraid because you're here.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,760
Ghost Bridegroom is cruel.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,760
Don't deem it as child's play.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,240
I will take you out of here now.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,720
Let's leave.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,840
I know this place is perilous.

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,560
That's why I left the mountain for you.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,840
I heard from the villagers

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,480
that Ghost Bridegroom wouldn't turn up
unless he spotted a bride.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,760
So, I'm here to lure him out
as the bride.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
It's Ghost Bridegroom.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:53,840
Let's go.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,720
Here you are, Ghost Bridegroom.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,160
Stick with me.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,840
Let's go.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,960
This way.

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,960
It's odd.

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,320
What's wrong?

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,480
I find this place fishy.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,160
Is this the Ghost Valley Formation?

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,040
That villain masters the Skills of
Five-Phases and Eight-Trigrams.

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,680
Rumour has it that
the Ghost Valley Formation

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,640
is a machination
which can be accessed easily.

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,160
I'm afraid

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
that we're already in his trap

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,440
as we went in here accidentally.

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,040
Bai Ze.

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,560
I can find the exit with my skill.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Will you trust me?

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,920
Really?

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,480
To the west of Fulong Mountain,

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,600
mountains stand irregularly

40
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,840
and the peaks sprawl vastly

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,720
like the encampment set up
on the flat sands.

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,240
This is a fun formation.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
The Skill of Five-Phases is intricate.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,760
I can't see it through.

45
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,040
How do you master this?

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,120
My father...

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,440
He used to study these skills

48
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,120
and he would teach me
on setting the formations.

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,920
Naturally, I get the hang of it.

50
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
I see.

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,400
Bai Ze, follow me.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,760
To the Kun direction.

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,600
This way.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
To the Qian direction.

55
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,680
This way.

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,680

57
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Kan direction.

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,160
Bai Ze.

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,560
The exit is ahead of us.

60
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,320
Bai Ze, we're out of the formation.

61
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,840
What a mere nobody.

62

the Ghost Valley Formation.

This is amusing.

a mere nobody is more than enough.
