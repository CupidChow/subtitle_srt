(for having this night.)

(Heavenly Dungeon)

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Father.

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,440
Qinghuan?

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,680
Qingyun Sect has never expected

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,960
that you're the daughter of Nie Youming.

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Father.

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Qinghuan.

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,880
Why are you here?

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,000
This is the Heavenly Dungeon of the Qingyun Sect.

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,080
The priority now is

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,440
to take you out of here.

22
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,880
No.

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,960
This Heavenly Dungeon

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,920
will release the secretive Qingyun Mist

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,680
which will freeze the inner power
of the poisoned

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,800
and drain their skills off them.

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,240
Did they use poison on you?

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,240
This is ridiculous.

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,600
Even the so-called rightful sect
uses such dirty tricks.

30
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Qinghuan.

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,280
You can't outforce them

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,280
by yourself.

33
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,160
In that case,

34
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,960
I will outwit them.

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,880
Father.

36
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,040
Where is the machination?

37
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,920
Father.

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm deprived of
all martial arts skills now.

39
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
Concerning those skilful elites
in Qingyun Sect,

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm afraid

41
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,760
we can't leave Mount Qingyun.

42
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,040
Father.

43
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
I will risk my life

44
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,960
to get you out of here.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,840
I have put my heart and soul into you.

46
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,440
I won't let you die.

47
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,760
Use the Freezing skill.

48
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,120
Qinghuan.

49
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
What are you waiting for?

50
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,960
Kill him since he's alone here.

51
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,040
Father.

52
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,280
I can't.

53
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,480
He's the First Disciple of
the Qingyun Sect, Bai Ze.

54
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,280
Now,

55
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,080
he's my husband

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
and your son-in-law.

57
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,280
Who are you?

58
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,840
The Holy Priestess of Youming Cult,

59
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,720
Nie Qinghuan.

60
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,760
Who is commonly known as

61
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
the Demonic Maiden.

62
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,960
Nie Qinghuan.

63
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,200
Out of so many lies,

64
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
at least your name is real.

65
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,680
Dear.

66
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Don't call me that.

67
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,280
Bai Ze.

68
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,960
I didn't mean to deceive you.

69
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
No need to explain that.

70
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,880
After all, you did.

71
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,920
True though.

72
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,200
Deceiving is an easy trick

73
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
for those of Demonic Sect.

74
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,280
I will settle our scores later.

75
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,720
He

76
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,440
is the felon in Qingyun Sect

77
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,000
and a scourge to the martial arts world.

78
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,960
You can't take him to leave.

79
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,200
Bai Ze.

80
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,520
I...

81
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,200
We tied the knot with our hair

82
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,240
representing our pure love.

83
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,760
Now that the hair is broken,

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,080
our love ends.

85
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,000
(The benign and evil are always
at cross purposes.)

86
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,720
(Plus, I have infuriated him with lies.)

87
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,160
(He will never forgive me again.)

88
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,200
I did lie to you.

89
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,960
Please kill me.

90
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,040
Do you think I won't?

91
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,360
Bai Ze.

92
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,760
You're the great young hero

93
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,440
of the rightful sect

94
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,400
who claims to uphold justice.

95
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,080
You will abide by the conventions

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,040
of not involving the foes' ladyfolk,
won't you?

97
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,200
She's the Holy Priestess of
the Demonic Sect.

98
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,840
She's not innocent.

99
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,800
Ever since my father became the leader,

100
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,840
both Qingyun Sect

101
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,560
and Youming Cult never mess
with each other.

102
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,680
Qingyun Sect imprisoned my father

103
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
because they covet
the secret skill of ours.

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,840
Save it.

105
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,680
That vicious skills are acquired
at the cost of human lives.

106
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,760
It is a huge disaster for the world.

107
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm sure my master has told you

108
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,400
that your sect wouldn't
have been wiped out

109
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800
if you had handed out the skill.

110
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,000
I have told you many times.

111
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,680
The secret skill is a mythical thing
that doesn't exist.

112
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,440
I have never seen it before.

113
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,880
Bai Ze.

114
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,400
I can see you're unlike

115
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,280
your master.

116
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,080
I, Nie Youming swear on oath to you.

117
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,480
As long as you release me
and my daughter,

118
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,560
from this day on,

119
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,400
I will dismiss my people

120
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,000
and go into seclusion.

121
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,400
Is that fine?

122
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,080
Why should I trust you?

123
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,960
Because of me.

124
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,040
Do you think I will believe you again?

125
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,280
At least, I'm sincere with you

126
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,360
yesterday night.

127
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,840
I didn't lie to you.

128
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,280
