3
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,440
Actually, repaying you with my body

4
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,520
was just the excuse I used
for not being able to control myself.

5
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,040
I told you to exchange
your body with the things you desire

6
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,480
out of spite too.

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,440
Bai Ze is a hostage from
the Ling Empire.

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,800
The prisoner army had experienced
the uprising of Lord Yong.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,720
There are still 80,000
prisoners of war from the Ling Empire.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,760
Your Majesty, if you grant Bai Ze
the tiger tally now,

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,200
you'll be releasing the captured tiger
back to its den.

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,080
Please think twice!

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,720
Bai Ze will go to war against
the Ling Empire

14
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,080
to avenge his parents.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,200
His motive is understandable.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,040
He requested the prisoner army from me
for two reasons.

17
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,480
First, those prisoners of war are
familiar with the Ling Empire's tactics.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,160
Second, he's unwilling to sacrifice
the army of Great Sheng.

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,760
Do not make groundless conclusions.

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,080
Your Majesty, Bai Ze isn't one of us.

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,920
I'm sure he has an ulterior motive.

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,480
Your Majesty, please think twice!

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,800
The uprising of Lord Yong
has already proven

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,640
that Bai Ze is loyal to me.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,760
Right now, the Ling Empire is in chaos.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,120
Unexpected things might happen.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,120
Your Majesty, even if you wish
to aid Bai Ze,

28
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,800
why don't you do so after the
internal struggle is over?

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Speed is the soldier's asset.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,360
How could we only attack them after
Third Prince has stabilized his throne?

31
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,840
Anyway,

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,440
I've already made up my mind.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,760
Save your breath.

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,120
Your Majesty, if you insist on doing so,

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,240
I...

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,400
I will take my own life!

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,440
Sir, please stop!

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,520
Enough!

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,080
Bai Ze, the hostage of Ling Empire,
seeks an audience!

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,400
You...

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
You devious scum

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,480
who tried to bewitch our empress here!

44
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
How dare you taint the imperial court

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
with your presence!

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,240
The Third Prince of the Ling Empire
had usurped the throne

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,520
and murdered my mother.

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,520
He and I are sworn enemies now.

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
Your Majesty, if you grant me
the tiger tally,

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
after I've avenged my parents,

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
I will use my empire as our dowry

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,600
to marry you

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
and stay by your side forever!

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,640
This!

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,640
If I go against my promise,

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,360
I shall suffer a terrible death!

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,440
There's no need for such a vicious vow.

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,080
Ever since what happened
within the Heavenly Dungeon,

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,440
I'd decided

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,480
that I'd trust you forever.

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,200
Say no more.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,200
Bai Ze,

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,320
I'll grant you the tiger tally
to the prisoner army.

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,880
May you return early

66
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840
and marry me.

67
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,620
(Unification Hall)

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,720
War

69
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,000
is dangerous.

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
Please mind your safety.

71
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,560
All right.

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,240
Remember to write to me

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,000
so that I can know your progress.

74
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,160
All right.

75
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,240
Your Majesty.

76
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,240
Don't you have anything

77
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,320
to say to me?

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,720
This time, you do intend to marry me,

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,520
right?

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,720
Prepare your wedding gown

81
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,400
and wait for my return.

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,640
Watching red turn to green,

83
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,560
my thoughts entangled and scattered.

84
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
Your Majesty,
it's already past midnight.

85
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,440
It's time for you to sleep.

86
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,840
What do you think
Bai Ze is doing right now?

87
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,480
Is he thinking about me too?

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,840
Reports from the borders
have been quick in arriving.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,240
I assume the monarch had already
broken through the capital.

90
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,480
I'm sure he'll return soon
and marry you, Your Majesty.

91
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,560
Your Majesty.

92
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,040
Your Majesty, congratulations.

93
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
What do you mean?

94
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,720
Your Majesty, please take a look.

98

(and they were fearless.)

99

(We took down the capital
within three days.)

100

Great Sheng.)

Bai Ze

108
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,720
has already conquered
the capital of the Ling Empire.

109
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,320
He killed the Third Prince too.

110
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,040
And, he also conquered
numerous other nations

111
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,400
and expanded the territory
of Great Sheng.

112

He's on his way back

113

to marry me.

114

Congratulations, Your Majesty.

115

Your Majesty, you look so happy.

116
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,720
What did the monarch say in his letter?

117
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,320
He'll reach the capital
within two hours.

118
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
You should hurry.

119
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
I can't wait any longer.
