3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
I'm still alive.

4
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,900
Immortal Bai Ze saved me.

5
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,700
Immortal Bai Ze.

6
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,580
Immortal Bai Ze.

7
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,820
Stop looking. He's not here.

8
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,180
Where has he gone?

9
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,420
I don't think
I can reveal his whereabouts.

10
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,340
But for the sake of your sincerity,

11
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,740
I will tell you, then.

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,620
He went down to the mortal realms
for the ordeal.

13
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,460
Ordeal?

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,660
Does Immortal Bai Ze
have to encounter that?

15
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,580
He has three love ordeals.

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,460
That is, separation from his loved one,

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,980
association with the hated one,

18
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,380
and unattainable desires.

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,460
Siming Deity.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,780
I transformed into a fairy
after Bai Ze's enlightenment

21
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,620
and I managed to revive
as he saved me from the thunder strikes.

22
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,860
Siming Deity, I beg of you.

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,660
Allow me to assist him
to overcome the ordeals.

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,260
That can be arranged.

25
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,620
However, you're an iris

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,460
with only three flower petals.

27
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,460
You will lose one in each life.

28
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,300
After assisting him for three lives,

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,900
the petals fall and
blend into the earth,

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,340
then perish eventually.

31
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,100
I'm not afraid of that.

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,500
Since you're committed to this,

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,340
I shall grant your wish.

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,620
(Three lives of love ordeal)

35
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,420
(will be by fate.)

36
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,940
Are you all right?

37
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,940
I'm good.

38
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,020
Master.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,220
Linyue, Bai Ze.

40
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,700
Did you get hurt?

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,340
Master, the entire Demonic Sect
is eliminated.

42
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,500
Father, Eldest Martial Brother
made this happen.

43
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,260
You must reward him handsomely.

44
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,900
This is not a place to dawdle.

45
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Let's leave now.

46
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,980
This is the sinister ringing
of the Soul-Calling Bell.

47
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,820
Run the inner qi to shield the ringing.

48
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,940
Don't let it control your mind.

49
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,500
Halt.

50
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,780
Bai Ze.

51
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,300
How dare a wimp

52
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,980
stop the wedding procession
of Ghost Bridegroom?

53
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,020
Are you seeking your death wish?

54
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,860
I'm Bai Ze of Qingyun Sect.

55
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,580
I'm the young master of
the prestigious Nangong family,

56
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,380
Nangong Jun.

57
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,740
Even your sect leader
has to get out of the way

58
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,300
when he sees me.

59
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,180
I heard about the wayward son
from the Nangong family.

60
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,460
To my surprise,
you're the puppet of Ghost Bridegroom.

61
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,100
Many young ladies have died
because of you.

62
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,460
I bought her

63
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,980
and I can decide on her life.

64
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,460
That's none of your business.

65
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,700
Run now!

66
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,380
Don't be afraid, miss.

67
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,500
I'm here to save you.

68
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,180
Ghost Bridegroom is here.

69
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,380
Help me!

70
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,180
Qingyun Sect is a rightful clan
that brings evil down

71
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,980
and upholds justice.

72
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,900
Don't worry.

73
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,020
I won't leave you behind.

74
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,540
Bai Ze, what should we do now?

75
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,340
It's Skeleton Grip.

76
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,060
My apologies.

77
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,460
Thank you for saving my life, Hero Bai.

78
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,860
I, Qinghuan

79
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,780
have nothing to repay your kindness,

80
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,780
but myself.

81
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,140
In your dream!

82
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,780
No need to do that.

83
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,580
Helping those in need
is the duty of Qingyun Sect.

84
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,580
Miss, where do you stay?

85
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,100
I will send you home.

86
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,220
I have no place to go.

87
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,180
Hero Bai,
if you were to abandon me here,

88
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,380
I'm afraid

89
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,780
I will fall prey
to Ghost Bridegroom again.

90
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,340
Shame on you!

91
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,460
Don't pester him.

92
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,100
Yue, behave yourself.

93
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,980
