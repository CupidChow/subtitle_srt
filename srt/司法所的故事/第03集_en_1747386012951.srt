1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
The

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,600
The

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,000
The

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,640
The

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,080
Uncle is missing.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,120
I'll go out and find him.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,160
I'm his sister.

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,960
What's wrong with him?

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,360
What's wrong?

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,400
Tell me.

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,840
Uncle...

12
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,640
He fell down.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Hello.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,040
Doctor, how is he?

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,320
He's not in danger yet.

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,000
But if we discuss the spine,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,440
it might cause a paralyzed.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,200
What?

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Why does it hurt?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,960
You can discuss it.

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,160
I'll go over first.

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you, doctor.

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,200
Why...

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,800
Dad.

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,080
How did our good life

26
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,840
get so complicated?

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
I...

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,280
You...

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,320
Your dad can't live

30
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,360
if you keep on making trouble.

31
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,040
Don't ask me.

32
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,240
What did the police say?

33
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,000
My dad jumped off the building.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,880
The police just called.

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,240
Your dad jumped off the building.

36
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
They checked the surveillance.

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,200
If there's no rain

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,960
at the building,

39
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,400
your dad would be dead.

40
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,200
He would be dead.

41
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,800
You know?

42
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,800
What did you tell him?

43
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,240
Nothing.

44
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,160
I'll talk to him later.

45
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,280
You're old.

46
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,800
You...

47
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,480
Oh my god.

48
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,640
Fine.

49
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,960
Beifei, you're here.

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,600
Come on.

51
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,960
Sit down.

52
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,640
How's business?

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
Good.

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,880
I didn't expect

55
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,400
Tongtong to come.

56
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
How do you know my name?

57
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,120
I not only know your name,

58
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,920
but I also know

59
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,920
you like lamb skewers, right?

60
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,200
What's your name

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,800
if I call you uncle?

62
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,640
My name is Uncle.

63
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,480
Uncle.

64
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,160
Good.

65
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,640
I'll grill skewers for you.

66
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
I'll help you.

67
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,520
Okay.

68
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,000
It's my fault.

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,600
If I could get a call from my uncle

70
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
to comfort him,

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,880
things wouldn't have happened.

72
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,720
If your mom knew about it,

73
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,800
I would be so mad.

74
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,240
It's okay.

75
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,760
It's Yu Bo's fault.

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,560
He's been like this all his life.

77
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,120
He's been an accountant for years.

78
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,480
He's been in jail for years.

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
He lost his job and his wife.

80
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,680
He lost his only place to live.

81
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,320
He's a loser.

82
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,600
I'd be in trouble if I were him.

83
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,600
Yu Bo must have something to hide from us.

84
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,440
The money for the demolition of the house

85
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,840
can't be here until now.

86
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,440
There must be something wrong

87
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,240
with it.

88
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,320
Yes.

89
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,920
Maybe this guy has already taken care of it.

90
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,760
Otherwise, my uncle wouldn't

91
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,040
be in such a state.

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,640
Fang.

93
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,200
Yu Bo.

94
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,600
Yu Bo.

95
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,760
Come on.

96
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,800
This skewer is just right.

97
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,280
Your skewers.

98
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,920
It's just baked.

99
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
Let me rub it for you.

100
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,320
Come on.

101
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,520
You can eat it when it's hot.

102
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,000
Come on.

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,040
Zui Wei, help him grill it.

104
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,560
Okay.

105
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,640
Okay.

106
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,320
Come on.

107
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
This should be edible.

108
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,040
Try it.

109
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,520
This must be boiled now.

110
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
Yes.

111
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,080
Jingjing.

112
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Is this strong?

113
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,400
I'll go and ask about

114
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
how to disperse the money for the house.

115
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
But we can't let

116
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,920
this Yu Bo kill us right away.

117
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,680
It's so pitiful.

118
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,720
Come on.

119
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,640
If he really doesn't care

120
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,880
about his dad's death,

121
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,520
I won't be able to forgive him.

122
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,080
Hey.

123
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,240
What?

124
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,400
What?

125
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,960
Are you busy?

126
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,560
I didn't have dinner all night.

127
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,200
Are you hungry?

128
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,440
Hey.

129
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,680
Stop messing around.

130
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm sorry.

131
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,960
I'm sorry.

132
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,760
Tongtong, why are you here?

133
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,200
Mr. Fang.

134
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,920
Sister.

135
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,280
What a coincidence!

136
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,840
You know each other?

137
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,760
Let me introduce.

138
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
This is Han Chao's father.

139
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
This is Mr. Fang.

140
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,200
This is his husband.

141
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,760
Hello, Mr. Han.

142
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,960
Mr. Fang.

143
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,920
You're so troublesome.

144
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Sit down.

145
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,760
I'll make you some food.

146
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,480
Okay.

147
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,960
Sister Duan Xing.

148
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
Han Chao's mother

149
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,160
had a stroke last month.

150
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,480
She hasn't recovered yet.

151
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,320
Why didn't she tell us?

152
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
She was worried about us.

153
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,680
Here.

154
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,920
Put it here for a while.

155
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,400
Okay, thank you.

156
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,360
I'll make more.

157
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
Two yuan and five yuan.

158
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
Ten yuan in total.

159
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,480
Can I scan the code?

160
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,920
Sure.

161
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,720
Sit here.

162
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,200
Come on.

163
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,520
Okay.

164
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,880
Sit.

165
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,560
Tongtong.

166
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,640
Why did your sister

167
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,720
bring you here?

168
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,640
My sister told me

169
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,760
she would bring me to

170
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,040
join the social event.

171
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,640
I have to let her know

172
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,480
that money

173
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,880
is earned by labor, right?

174
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,880
Yes.

175
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,360
Is it good?

176
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,160
Here, eat more.

177
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,800
Brother-in-law, how does it taste?

178
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,920
Very good.

179
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,920
I won't

180
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,200
record the video today.

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,560
Go to bed early.

182
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,480
It's rare for you to sleep on time today.

183
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,480
I'm going to bed.

184
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,120
Sleep.

185
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,800
Good night.

186
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,520
Love you.

187
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,240
Tong.

188
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm sleepy now.

189
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,240
Talk to me.

190
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,080
Well,

191
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,360
You're the one who ate my dinner.

192
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
It's been six hours since we had dinner.

193
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,760
You just remembered to ask me what I ate.

194
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,480
We're old friends.

195
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,600
What's wrong with that?

196
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,520
I don't need to care about that.

197
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,560
You don't even know how to talk to me now.

198
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,640
What are you going to do with your life?

199
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,200
Just let it go.

200
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,440
Let it go.

201
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,960
We're having a good time, aren't we?

202
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,400
Hello?

203
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,680
Chen, this is Fu Lanfang.

204
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,160
Hua Xiaorong from Xiaorong Bar in your neighborhood

205
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,760
was blocked by her ex-husband

206
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,200
and didn't let her go home.

207
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
She's been there for six hours.

208
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,200
So...

209
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,920
So she can call the police, right?

210
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,680
But she's her ex-husband after all.

211
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,760
She doesn't want to be too rude.

212
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,600
She called me.

213
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,160
I have to go there for more than half an hour.

214
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,640
Okay then.

215
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,880
I'll go there right away.

216
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,640
Okay.

217
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
I'll go there right away.

218
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,960
This...

219
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,080
Look at this.

220
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,600
I have to go there for this.

221
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Then...

222
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
I'll go there for a while.

223
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,720
Get out of the way.

224
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,440
No.

225
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,360
You don't give me money today.

226
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,400
Don't let me go out of this door.

227
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,440
Why are you so rude?

228
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,320
I owe you.

229
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,640
You're the one who owes me.

230
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
You...

231
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
What's going on?

232
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
Let go.

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let go.

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let go.

235
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,880
It's midnight.

236
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,200
Can't you just tell me tomorrow?

237
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
You're making a scene and I can't sleep.

238
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,640
What are you doing here?

239
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm just saying, look at him.

240
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,040
What are you doing here?

241
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,440
Who are you angry at?

242
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,760
I'm angry at him.

243
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Who is he?

244
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,600
Who is he?

245
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
He is...

246
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
That's right.

247
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,640
He once lived with you for a period of time.

248
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,600
He is your relative.

249
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,920
You torture him like this.

250
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,720
You also torture yourself.

251
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,680
Besides,

252
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,240
we're all old men.

253
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
Look at him.

254
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,920
Look, everyone is watching.

255
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,320
Isn't it embarrassing?

256
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,720
He doesn't think it's embarrassing.

257
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,880
Why should I be embarrassed?

258
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,840
I'm telling you.

259
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,320
If you don't pay me my mental damage fee today,

260
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
don't you dare to go out of this door.

261
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,160
You still have the nerve to say it?

262
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,360
It's good that we asked you to pay me my mental damage fee.

263
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,720
You're the one who wants to divorce.

264
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,040
You've already sold your house.

265
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
You're so ungrateful.

266
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,920
What do you mean I sold my house?

267
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
That's an investment.

268
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,720
Enough.

269
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
Just tell me tomorrow.

270
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,520
We won't settle this bill tonight.

271
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,080
Let's settle it tomorrow, okay?

272
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,520
Uncle Chen.

273
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,400
He went abroad to gamble.

274
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,840
What do you mean gambling?

275
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,480
That's an investment.

276
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,360
Uncle Chen, look at him.

277
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,600
It's useless to tell him.

278
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,520
You didn't pay me today.

279
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,920
Why did you go abroad?

280
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,680
What are you doing?

281
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,400
I don't believe it.

282
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,040
What do you believe?

283
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,760
I'm gambling.

284
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,920
I'm a gambler.

285
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,800
You've never seen it.

286
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,720
How can you say that?

287
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,880
You've been gambling all day.

288
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,920
You've been gambling all night.

289
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,680
You're a gambler.

290
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,000
How can I tell you?

291
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,800
I said that Song Tao was in a hurry to see you.

292
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,920
You didn't have to rush to call me

293
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,480
and hired Luo Dapeng.

294
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,880
But what happened?

295
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,120
Something happened.

296
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
The truth has come out.

297
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,840
Why are you counting me?

298
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,080
I'm not counting you.

299
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,360
I just want to remind you

300
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,720
that you should divide the main and secondary.

301
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
Chen.

302
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,160
What is the main and what is the secondary?

303
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,480
You're doing more than I am.

304
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,840
Tell me.

305
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,760
How many days have you been

306
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,680
going home on time for meals?

307
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm telling you.

308
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
I'm embarrassed to see your Bai Lan.

309
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,880
Your sister-in-law.

310
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,400
She...

311
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,080
She's still more reasonable.

312
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,040
You're getting lower and lower.

313
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,760
Yes.

314
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
You think I don't know?

315
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
She's reasonable.

316
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,160
I feel guilty.

317
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,760
Why are you guilty?

318
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,000
Isn't this the nature of our job?

319
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,640
We're always busy.

320
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,760
Sometimes,

321
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,360
we'll waste our time.

322
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,240
But our job at the judicial office

323
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,720
is to ensure the safety of society.

324
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,920
I often tell your sister-in-law

325
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,240
that half of my salary

326
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,480
is on my pay.

327
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,920
And the other half is on you.

328
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,840
Okay.

329
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,960
I've asked Manager Liu of

330
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,000
the Meili Star Museum

331
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
to arrange a repairman for Luo Dapeng.

332
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,440
He didn't say no.

333
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,600
Look.

334
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
You can go to him again

335
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,720
and bring Luo Dapeng with you.

336
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,760
They're embarrassed to refuse

337
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,080
in front of him.

338
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,720
Okay.

339
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll go now.

340
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,920
Okay.

341
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,120
Manager Liu.

342
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,920
Chen.

343
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,400
Hello.

344
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,120
What's up?

345
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
About what we said yesterday

346
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,960
about Luo Dapeng.

347
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,120
I've told you.

348
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,480
What happened two days ago?

349
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,840
Manager,

350
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,880
don't mention the past two days.

351
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,120
That's the most embarrassing thing

352
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,280
I've done in my life.

353
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,720
I'm sorry.

354
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,400
Okay.

355
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,960
Sit down.

356
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Sit down and talk.

357
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,400
Fine.

358
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,840
I don't care if you're sorry or sorry.

359
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,200
When you come to me,

360
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,880
don't say sorry again.

361
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,680
Got it?

362
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,560
Got it.

363
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,120
If I say sorry again,

364
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
you can fire me.

365
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,600
Xiaoshi.

366
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,280
Xiaoshi.

367
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,040
Yes.

368
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,800
Come here.

369
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,120
Manager, you're looking for me?

370
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Yes.

371
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,280
A new person is here.

372
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,840
Go to fix the gift.

373
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,240
Okay.

374
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,200
Where is he?

375
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm right behind you.

376
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,320
Okay.

377
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,800
I...

378
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,120
It's you.

379
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,760
It's you.

380
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
We're not the first time to meet.

381
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,840
Take care of me.

382
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,320
Okay.

383
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,240
Manager Liu,

384
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,880
thank you very much.

385
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,080
You're welcome.

386
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,520
In the future,

387
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,560
ask your boss and colleagues.

388
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,480
It's not easy to get a job.

389
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,800
Do your best.

390
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,240
I will.

391
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,480
I'll try my best.

392
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,120
Okay.

393
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,360
I'll leave now.

394
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,680
Take care.

395
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,640
Thank you, Brother Chen.

396
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,720
I'll report to you later.

397
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,360
Okay.

398
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,160
Okay.

399
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,240
Thank you, Manager.

400
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,720
Let's go.

401
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
Let's go.

402
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,680
Let's go to fix the gift.

403
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,240
Okay.

404
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Let's go.

405
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,680
Is it here?

406
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,320
Who is it?

407
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,440
I'm He Beibei.

408
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
I didn't expect she would come back here.

409
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
This is the place

410
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,120
where you and Liangyin lived together.

411
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,000
There must be a lot of memories.

412
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
Open the door.

413
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,200
We can tell you about Liangyin's situation.

414
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,280
You have to know

415
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,720
about her illness.

416
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,400
A couple of hundred people a day.

417
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Even if you want to divorce Liangyin,

418
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,640
you have to pay her medical bills first.

419
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,840
Liangyin's illness can't be delayed.

420
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,640
Stop talking nonsense.

421
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,600
I can accept the conditions.

422
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,360
As long as she says she's divorcing,

423
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,600
she'll sign the divorce papers.

424
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,240
You're a legal king.

425
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
Don't talk nonsense.

426
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm here to divorce.

427
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,640
Divorce, okay?

428
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,120
Otherwise, I'll go back to England tomorrow.

429
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,800
If I don't,

430
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,280
do you think you're illegal?

431
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
Okay.

432
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,240
We'll transfer your will

433
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,120
to Liangyin's.

434
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,360
Of course, we still hope

435
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
you can go to the hospital to solve the problem.

436
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,560
Let's go.

437
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,240
That's it?

438
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,520
No.

439
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,240
If we keep forcing her,

440
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,560
she'll go back to England.

441
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,720
What about Liangyin?

442
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,920
She can't go back.

443
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,280
I have an idea.

444
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,040
She's in a hurry to divorce

445
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,800
because she's in a hurry

446
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,520
to marry her mentor's daughter.

447
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,280
Can we find this woman

448
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,640
and tell her about Liangyin's situation?

449
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,040
That's a good idea.

450
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,240
Let's go back

451
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,520
as soon as possible.

452
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,960
As a legal company,

453
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,160
we should maintain the justice of society.

454
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,320
What's the law?

455
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,360
The law is to maintain

456
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,600
the last limit of legal rights.

457
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
The lowest level.

458
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,640
Push it to the cliff.

459
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,120
The law is to keep the channel under the cliff.

460
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,640
Don't fall down.

461
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
We should move forward.

462
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,240
This is the pursuit of our legal work.

463
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,600
That's the justice of society.

464
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,440
Let's start.

465
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,440
I'm going to kiss you.

466
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,320
I'm going to kiss you.

467
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,040
No.

468
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm not.

469
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,680
No.

470
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,440
Sit here.

471
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,520
I really liked the barbecue restaurant that day.

472
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,040
So I was excited the night before.

473
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,400
But I didn't get

474
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,120
a single shot

475
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,040
or a single camera

476
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,400
that I wanted.

477
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Time was too hasty.

478
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,440
I didn't get

479
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,560
what I wanted.

480
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm going to kiss you.

481
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
I'm going to kiss you.

482
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm going to kiss you.

483
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm going to kiss you.

484
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
I'm going to kiss you.

485
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
I'm going to kiss you.

486
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm going to kiss you.

487
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm going to kiss you.

488
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm going to kiss you.

489
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm going to kiss you.

490
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm going to kiss you.

491
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I'm going to kiss you.

492
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm going to kiss you.

493
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm going to kiss you.

494
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm going to kiss you.

495
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm going to kiss you.

496
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm going to kiss you.

497
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm going to kiss you.

498
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm going to kiss you.

499
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I'm going to kiss you.

500
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm going to kiss you.

501
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
I'm going to kiss you.

502
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm going to kiss you.

503
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
I'm going to kiss you.
