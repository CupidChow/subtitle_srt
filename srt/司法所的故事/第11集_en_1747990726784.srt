1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Str Olympics

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,680
What the heck are you doing

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What's going on?

4
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,240
There's one more thing.

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,240
It's the Ma Fushun of the noodle shop.

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,560
The neighbor said he's a family man.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
Really?

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,160
No wonder Chen is so insensitive today.

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,160
He went to the market again last night.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,160
Yes, he did a big job.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,120
The neighbor said

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Ma Fushun is always on his wife and son.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,600
He fights every day.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,800
He fights every three days.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
How can he win if he goes on like this?

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,440
To be honest,

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,560
I've never seen someone so annoying.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,600
The snake-shaped cat shop.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,800
It's too much for a pervert.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
What?

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,280
What is the snake-shaped cat shop?

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,600
Snake-shaped cat is a cow-head.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Cat shop.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,840
You've never seen a cat walk?

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,240
It's a straight line.

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,280
And my friend told me

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,600
if you meet a man with a snake-shaped cat shop,

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,840
you must be far away.

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,440
Ma Fushun is walking like this.

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,840
Let me check it out.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,280
Okay, stop talking.

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,000
What else do you have to say?

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,600
The neighbors are talking too much.

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,840
I'm going to kill you.

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,640
Stop it.

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,400
Go.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
Stop it.

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,000
Go.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,120
Stop it.

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,000
What's the point of fighting in the middle of the night?

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If you keep fighting, I'll call 110.

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,400
These people are not going to go.

43
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
They're going to fight in the middle of the night.

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
Mom, I'm going to school.

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,000
You...

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,840
You should hide away from him.

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,360
Don't make him fight.

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,320
Mom, it's okay.

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Go.

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,560
You're making trouble again.

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,960
I'm not moving.

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Where's my phone?

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,400
Go away.

54
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Come here.

55
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,440
Go away.

56
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,760
Why are you so stubborn?

57
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,160
You can't talk properly.

58
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
You're so unruly.

59
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,040
You're so unruly.

60
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,600
This is a crime.

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,560
How long has the violence card been in the house?

62
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,600
It should be recorded when he was hitting people.

63
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,640
It's a proof.

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,040
There are always

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,480
similar things.

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,640
Ma Fushun is a coward.

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,360
But we can only persuade him

68
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,200
about this.

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
If his family doesn't pursue him,

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,160
he won't even go to jail.

71
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,440
And these are just the neighbors.

72
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,480
There must be a lot of neighbors

73
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,720
who can't see him.

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,240
Why didn't we divorce him?

75
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,240
It's so simple to form a family.

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,680
Even if Ma Fushun

77
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,200
gets divorced,

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,360
he may not be able to let Wu Ying go.

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,840
What should we do?

80
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,160
We can't control him.

81
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,840
We don't know where to start.

82
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,200
We can't control him.

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,800
The neighbor said

84
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,960
Ma Lei is a sensible child.

85
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,520
His father's behavior

86
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,000
caused him a heavy burden.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,240
He usually doesn't talk much.

88
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,320
He looks at his father's eyes.

89
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,960
He's just a coward.

90
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,400
We must

91
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,120
take care of these children.

92
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,200
Yes.

93
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,320
We can think of a way

94
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,040
to deal with this.

95
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,680
Including Ma Fushun.

96
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,320
Yes.

97
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,000
But Ma Fushun

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
won't admit

99
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,560
he's a heart-to-heart patient.

100
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
It's time to eat.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,280
Let's have noodles

102
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,840
for lunch.

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's have a look at Ma Fushun.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,280
Okay.

105
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,600
Did you drink water?

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,080
No.

107
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,320
You look at the color.

108
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,800
You look at the little you've got.

109
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,320
You're such a loser.

110
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,080
No, I'm not.

111
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,920
What's the difference?

112
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,120
Are you going to make a meal?

113
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,800
Ma.

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,480
Mr. Fang.

115
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,480
I heard you're very busy these days.

116
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,680
Let me see.

117
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,320
The restaurant.

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,720
I heard you often make a big meal.

119
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,840
I don't want to hear them talk.

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,360
They're so silly.

121
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
Please sit down.

122
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,480
I don't know how to cook.

123
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,440
Unless I'm a cook.

124
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,800
I don't know how to cook.

125
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,680
What would you like?

126
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,720
I heard you're good at making noodles.

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,560
What noodles do you have?

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,440
Pee noodles.

129
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,000
Meat noodles.

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,880
Egg noodles.

131
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,200
I'll have pee noodles.

132
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,920
I'll have meat noodles.

133
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,120
Egg noodles.

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,480
Okay.

135
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,000
Wait a minute.

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I want three noodles.

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,880
Okay.

138
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Three noodles.

139
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,440
What's three noodles?

140
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520
There are pita, meat and eggs in three noodles.

141
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,440
Three noodles are delicious.

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
I love three noodles.

143
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm full.

144
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Ma.

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
How's your business?

146
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,960
Not bad.

147
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,440
Thanks to you, I have a free place.

148
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
Don't be so ungrateful.

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm not ungrateful.

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,120
Right.

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
Ma.

152
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,920
You're so capable.

153
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,440
I heard you have a son.

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,480
He came to help you when he was in school.

155
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,880
Ma.

156
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,560
You're a lucky man.

157
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,480
Ma.

158
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,560
See?

159
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,640
We're all jealous of you.

160
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,720
We're all in love.

161
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,360
Right?

162
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,960
Yes.

163
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,960
Hurry up.

164
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,040
It's on the table.

165
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,080
Here.

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,880
No.

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,960
Thank you.

168
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,760
See?

169
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,600
Wu Yin doesn't even dare to look at me.

170
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
Thank you.

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,120
You want me to say it?

172
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,360
What are you doing?

173
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,560
We don't have a place to go.

174
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,080
Just tell him.

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,280
I can't do anything.

176
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm done.

177
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,240
I support you.

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,640
But we can't talk to him.

179
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,280
What if he finds Wu Yin?

180
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,040
We should know him better.

181
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,000
Why is he so arrogant?

182
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,080
He's just a bastard.

183
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,160
We can't make a conclusion too early.

184
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,800
Li Ben.

185
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,960
You and Han Chao will go to the school in Malay

186
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,240
to talk to the kids.

187
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,480
Ask him about his family.

188
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,640
See what happens.

189
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Okay.

190
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,120
Let's check.

191
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,000
Move them to the back side.

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
Annihilated faces are delicious.

193
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,760
Before the pig giddy days,

194
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,720
eat bigger ones.

195
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,280
Got it.

196
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,760
I told you

197
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,200
when the security agency will come here

198
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,560
to investigate us.

199
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,040
Hurry up.

200
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,720
Get ready for the illegals.

201
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,880
Now,

202
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,720
check until you are確 그 듦.

203
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,360
It's climbed very high.

204
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Be careful. Don't shoot.

205
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I told you. I'll get the house back.

206
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
I promise you won't come back.

207
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
What else do you want?

208
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
What else do I want?

209
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
No.

210
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,640
What are you doing now?

211
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Don't worry. I'm a newbie to you.

212
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,640
When you put the noodles to Hua Xiaorong,

213
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,640
you were so worried about her.

214
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
I was worried about her.

215
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,640
When you put the noodles to Hua Xiaorong,

216
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
did you discuss it with me?

217
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,640
I was just a fool.

218
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Duan, tell me the truth.

219
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Did she find you or her?

220
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
She must have found me.

221
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Then tell me more.

222
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
How did you two meet?

223
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
How did she find you?

224
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
I went to cut my hair.

225
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
She was a hair stylist.

226
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,640
She was working in another shop.

227
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
What happened next?

228
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Next...

229
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Next...

230
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Next...

231
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Then...

232
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Then you went to Hua Xiaorong's house, right?

233
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,640
She was going to follow me.

234
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
What can I do?

235
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,640
She wanted to write me the truth.

236
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
She said she wouldn't give me the house.

237
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
She came to you.

238
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
I was afraid you would know.

239
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
So she gave it to her.

240
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Why did you say that?

241
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
What did you say?

242
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,640
I've been thinking about you for years.

243
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,640
You're a man who has the right to be a man.

244
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,640
I didn't expect you to be like this.

245
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
How did I do?

246
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I went to see Hua Xiaorong today.

247
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
She showed me...

248
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,640
She showed me all of your chat records.

249
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,640
You told her you were single.

250
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Your wife died of illness.

251
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,640
You said you were a married couple.

252
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
We didn't...

253
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Stop it.

254
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Where are you now?

255
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Why did she read that information to you?

256
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,640
She wanted to understand us.

257
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Duan, you're so mean.

258
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Hua Xiaorong didn't say anything about you.

259
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,640
She took all the blame on her.

260
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,640
Why did she show you that information?

261
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,640
She showed me that information.

262
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
She wanted me to know the truth.

263
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
I don't want to hear you talk about it.

264
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,640
I'll take the house back.

265
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
It's over.

266
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
We'll live a happy life.

267
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Okay?

268
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Xiao Fan, come here and take your wife back.

269
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
No need.

270
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,640
I'll go by myself.

271
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
I'll go.

272
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Take care.

273
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Come and have some ribs.

274
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
No.

275
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
What do you mean?

276
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm not welcoming you.

277
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I'm just opening the store.

278
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,640
If you don't want to welcome me, you have to.

279
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I'm not welcoming you.

280
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm not welcoming you.

281
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
I'm not welcoming you.

282
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
I'm not welcoming you.

283
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
I'm not welcoming you.

284
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
I'm not welcoming you.

285
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
I'm not welcoming you.

286
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
This is it.

287
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
The skin is on the skin.

288
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Okay.

289
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Boss, why do you have a hairpin?

290
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
I'm so hungry.

291
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
You ate it all.

292
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Boss, you're too poor in the store.

293
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,640
You have to pay me for my health loss.

294
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Maybe.

295
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Look at yourself.

296
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Is this hairpin mine?

297
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Is it hers?

298
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
It's obviously her hairpin.

299
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,640
No way.

300
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm wearing a hat.

301
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
What's wrong with wearing a hat?

302
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
You can't fall into the trap with a hat.

303
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
It's impossible to fall into the trap.

304
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
It's impossible.

305
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
You're so mean.

306
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Let's go.

307
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
What are you doing?

308
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
What are you doing?

309
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Why are you so annoying?

310
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Boss, why are you hitting me?

311
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Why are you holding me?

312
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I'm holding you.

313
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Okay, call the police.

314
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Who did the police catch?

315
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Your family's evidence is still on the other side.

316
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
I'm the witness.

317
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
The police came.

318
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
I just invited you to the police station to have tea and talk to you.

319
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Okay, I'll help you.

320
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm not going to explain to you.

321
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
You're holding me.

322
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
What are you looking at?

323
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Don't be so scared.

324
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Go away.

325
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
She can't be said.

326
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
What's wrong with you?

327
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
She's angry at me.

328
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I'm going to die here.

329
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I'll die here.

330
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
I'll see what I can do.

331
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
I'm going to be locked up in the prison.

332
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
We're in the city.

333
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
We're going to the law firm.

334
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
We're going to the police station.

335
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
We're going to the police station.

336
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
I'm going to the street.

337
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
I'm in the village.

338
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
If she can solve the crime,

339
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
it's best if she can.

340
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,640
She can also ask the police to give her to the police.

341
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
I'll go get some tea.

342
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Go.

343
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
You bastard.

344
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
What are you doing?

345
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
I'm going to...

346
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
I'm going to die here.

347
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
She wants to come to work with me.

348
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
I didn't agree.

349
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
She's a real man.

350
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Every one of them

351
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
can't be perfect.

352
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,640
I'm so sad about this.
