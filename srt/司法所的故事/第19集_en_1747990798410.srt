Episode 1

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Unless I don't do my job now.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't think you're in a hurry about this kid.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not in a hurry.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Go to sleep.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Go to sleep.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You're not answering my call.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What time is it?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I have to open the door at 24.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I've decided not to.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Your mom.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My mom.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Mom, what's up?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Lan Xin, are you asleep?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, I'm ready.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My medicine is over.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You said you'd opened it for me.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Can you send it to me now?

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Or I can't sleep well.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll let Song Tao send it to you.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's late.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Song Tao is tired.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He's going to work tomorrow.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Dad, it's Saturday tomorrow.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're not going to work.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can send it to me.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll send it to you.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's wrong?

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll let Lan Xin send me medicine.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What are you doing?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I forgot.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Look at you.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You've offended your mom for me.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Are you a human?

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll go.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I told you not to.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You're going to sleep.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Don't move.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She's your mom.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
She's old.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
She must have forgotten it.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Go to sleep.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll go.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Wait for me.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll have to get married if I have to.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm so sad.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Dad, look.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She asked me what I was laughing at.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't drink it.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Stop it.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's chat.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's chat.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
She asked me what I was laughing at.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Look.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Bai Lan said I went out for a trip.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Dad, what's your problem?

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I said

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
why didn't you wait for me?

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You went out with me.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My dad would say that.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What's your problem?

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What's wrong?

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He's not going out.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He's going out.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why don't you say something?

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's just listening to you.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're so...

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Right.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's his problem?

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What's the problem?

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's the problem?

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Look.

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Dad, what's your problem?

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If I go back,

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll say

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it's a trip for two people.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If I don't say it,

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
what's the problem?

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll leave a comment.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll make a business trip.

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're so nice.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Chen,

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you brought Bai here.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We'll have a barbecue together.

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We'll have a drink.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We'll have a chat.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's too much.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's it.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're right.

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Chen,

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you're not married yet.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're not a family.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're single.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're a good girl.

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're a good girl.

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're going to play more.

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're going to be more single.

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Right?

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Of course.

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm not married.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But I'm not single.

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Uncle Hu,

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we'll bring Mom

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
back to live with us.

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He can do whatever he wants.

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The age is getting older.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He lives alone

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and doesn't live in the city.

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's worried about others.

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Isn't your mom living alone?

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My mom is different.

114
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We're just on his side.

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He's always with Aunt and Aunt.

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And your friend Qu Jing.

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
She always comes to visit him.

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
She doesn't need anyone.

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Qu Jing...

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
is she not going to get married?

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
She's a way of life.

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We have to respect her.

123
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I always have a feeling

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that I can't go back.

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What feeling?

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why do I think

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
you're the one who's going to take care of her?

128
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't say that.

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're a kind of

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
anti-sacrifice.

131
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How can I be anti-sacrifice?

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What do you mean?

133
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I mean

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you're giving her

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
a good idea

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
in your system.

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can introduce her to him

138
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
if you see something appropriate.

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going to scold her.

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She's the one

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
who wants to introduce her

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and I'm going to introduce her to her.

143
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She's a professional.

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She likes to take care of

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
other people's business.

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Another day

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Mom.

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
My precious daughter is back.

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think you're doing well today.

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why're you always

151
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
leaving me?

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
and didn't tell me in advance.

153
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I'll tell you in advance

154
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,200
if you're ready to cry.

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
I'm at home again.

156
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll cook something delicious for you.

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm tired.

158
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,400
Mom, you can talk.

159
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,200
I'll go cook.

160
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,800
Okay.

161
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,400
Lan Xin.

162
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Go and see

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,600
how beautiful

164
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,400
Mom raised that lady.

165
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,000
How can you raise her so well?

166
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
This lady

167
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
is the birthday gift

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,200
for Mom when Mom was born.

169
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
It's been 15 years.

170
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Look at the little ones next to her.

171
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
They're all her birthday gifts.

172
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
They're all here every year.

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,800
I've sent them to the neighbors.

174
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
They're many boxes.

175
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,400
What flower is that?

176
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,400
That's a sea candy flower.

177
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
I bought it a month ago.

178
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
And it's blooming.

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Mom,

180
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
you should buy more flowers

181
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,600
like a sea candy.

182
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,400
It'll make you feel happy.

183
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,200
Look,

184
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,800
it's happy and energetic.

185
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,600
You're right.

186
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,000
Your dad gave me that sea candy flower.

187
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
It's called

188
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,200
the white land sea candy.

189
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
It's blooming beautifully.

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
Like you said,

191
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200
the flower I saw

192
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
made me feel so happy.

193
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But this spring,

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
I don't know what happened.

195
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,200
I was so nervous.

196
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
I bought another one

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
and made it up.

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Make it up?

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Are you afraid he'll say you?

200
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
Your dad won't say it.

201
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
I just think

202
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
if he saw the flower

203
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,800
he bought me

204
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,600
when he went home,

205
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,200
he'd feel uncomfortable.

206
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
He went home?

207
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,000
On the second Friday,

208
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
your dad took your mom to dinner.

209
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,200
After dinner,

210
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
he took me to the downstairs.

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,200
He didn't come?

212
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,000
He said he had something to do

213
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
and he was still on the way.

214
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,200
He said he was on the way on Friday.

215
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,600
He said he was on the way on Saturday.

216
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Who did he go to?

217
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,200
I didn't ask him.

218
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
I didn't ask him.

219
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Mom,

220
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Song Tao said

221
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
he wanted you to go back with us.

222
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
I can take care of you.

223
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,000
Look, we're in the same city.

224
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,400
If you get sick,

225
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
we can't be in a hurry.

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Your dad is still here.

227
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
He won't go home.

228
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,800
He's not like him.

229
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
No.

230
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,800
When he has something to do,

231
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
he still comes to help.

232
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
You're all back today.

233
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Should I ask your dad to come over

234
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
and have dinner with you?

235
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
No.

236
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,400
Na Xin,

237
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,800
give me your hand.

238
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Sit down first.

239
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
What do you want to wash?

240
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll just pick up the flower.

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Then give it to me.

242
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mom, sit down.

243
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
But I don't think I'm wrong.

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm wrong.

245
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
I'm just working.

246
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
Why are you so good at this?

247
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,400
Right?

248
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I know that's work.

249
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,000
But you said that

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
the husband and wife

251
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,800
are the best in the world.

252
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,800
That's not necessarily true.

253
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
I have an old classmate.

254
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,200
His husband is probably

255
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
over 50 years old.

256
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
They quarreled and quarreled.

257
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,400
His husband was so mad that he didn't care.

258
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,000
He could have been away for more than half a month.

259
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,800
But he was still happy

260
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,200
when he was mad at his husband.

261
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
Okay, Mom.

262
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,600
We're not that lucky.

263
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Okay, stop talking about that.

264
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
Come on.

265
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,400
Besides,

266
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
I don't think

267
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,800
our family is abnormal.

268
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,200
Right?

269
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,000
No, it's not.

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,400
I went out for a few nights

271
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,600
to fix the divorce.

272
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
It's abnormal.

273
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,200
Actually,

274
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
your mom understands.

275
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Yes.

276
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
She's just a little girl.

277
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Mom,

278
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,400
I guess when you liked my mom,

279
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,200
you liked her little strength.

280
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
I forgot.

281
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,400
I forgot.

282
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,600
I think it's just 8 out of 10.

283
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,400
Dad, I know that

284
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,200
once a girl is a little girl,

285
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,400
she likes to be a little girl.

286
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,800
A little girl can't stand men.

287
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
You have to blame yourself.

288
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,800
Why didn't you

289
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
make my mom's test?

290
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,800
Dad, if you find a career,

291
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
you'll be the one

292
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
who's rational and emotional.

293
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,600
Maybe you're the one

294
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,400
who's being emotional at home.

295
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,200
You see,

296
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,000
she's going out for a few nights

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,600
to earn money.

298
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,400
You can't stand

299
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,200
being emotional at home.

300
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,200
Are you talking about your girlfriend?

301
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,600
What girlfriend?

302
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,200
Where are you going?

303
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,400
You think it's a business conversation?

304
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,400
Dad,

305
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,000
why are you still so curious?

306
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Listen,

307
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,400
you still have to persuade your mom.

308
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't always look at our family

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
without looking at it.

310
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
You're so impatient.

311
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
If she marries me,

312
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
she'll be like this

313
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
when she's married.

314
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Do you believe that?

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Family is like this.

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,600
Every family is the same.

317
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Usually,

318
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,000
we're busy with our own business.

319
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
We go home after work,

320
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,200
right?

321
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
We eat together,

322
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
chat, and sleep.

323
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Such a normal life.

324
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
You're tired today.

325
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
I'll cook for you.

326
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,400
I'll clean the floor tomorrow.

327
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,200
Right?

328
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,600
You're home late today.

329
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I'll clean the house.

330
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Life is like this.

331
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,200
We're always together.

332
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,000
We have to adapt to life.

333
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,200
To live a life like this

334
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,800
is a kind of enjoyment.

335
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Sometimes,

336
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
we're too tired.

337
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
That's a little bit of a waste of life.

338
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
That's the point of life.

339
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,000
Enough.

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,400
Chen Chunyang,

341
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,600
I'm reminding you.

342
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
There's no point in life.

343
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
It's just a matter of experience.

344
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,200
There is.

345
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
I was in my 40s.

346
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
What's wrong?

347
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,200
You don't need to be in your 40s anymore.

348
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,600
No, I don't need to.

349
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,400
Life has become a burden.

350
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,200
It's hard to keep up.

351
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
You're still doing this every day.

352
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,400
You still can't stand it.

353
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,600
I'm not asking you to do it every day.

354
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,000
I mean,

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,600
for example, the treasure you mentioned.

356
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
On the window,

357
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
every month,

358
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,600
we put flowers on it.

359
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Every month, we don't overdo it.

360
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Women always need a little sense of ceremony.

361
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,000
Right?

362
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,600
Look at this.

363
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
Is our family more warm?

364
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
You little brat.

365
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,200
This mouth is really good.

366
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
You taught me this.

367
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,800
You can pick up your dad later.

368
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,000
Baby, we're leaving.

369
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Take care of your brother.

370
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay.

371
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know how many times I've heard this.

372
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm going out with your dad and your old classmates.

373
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
We'll be back in a few days.

374
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Bye.

375
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,200
Bye.

376
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,400
What's the occasion?

377
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
You're going to work.

378
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,000
Old sister,

379
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,400
can you do it for me tomorrow?

380
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,800
No.

381
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
I still want to support you.

382
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
How about this?

383
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,600
If you can finish your sentence in two hours,

384
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
I'll take you to eat.

385
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,800
Okay?

386
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
You can do it.

387
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,200
Thank you.

388
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Not bad.

389
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Okay.

390
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
What do you want to do for the time of the meeting?

391
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Let me hear it.

392
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Go to Han Da's birthday party.

393
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
You just want to eat a birthday party?

394
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Then go to the birthday party in the mall.

395
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Aren't you going to play?

396
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Then where are you going?

397
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Let's go to help a friend.

398
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
What do you want to do?

399
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
My friend has a bar.

400
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
The bar is about to open.

401
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
But they are not very good at it.

402
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Let's go to help them pack up.

403
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Okay.

404
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
I think you are very good at it.

405
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Very good.

406
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Sister.

407
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Here you are.

408
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Sit inside.

409
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
No need.

410
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Sit inside.

411
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Come on.

412
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Let me help you pack up.

413
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
You can rest here.

414
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
You can go in.

415
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
This way.

416
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Okay.

417
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
You can do it.

418
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
You see.

419
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
It's going to stay inside me.

420
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
It takes the first look when I behave myself.

421
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
You see,

422
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
if you want to suffer for half a month

423
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
or more,

424
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
you will keep going.

425
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
You can perform of the marriage on these days.

426
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
But if you are not in that mood today,

427
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
even if you are off work,

428
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
you can't do it tomorrow.

429
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,960
So I went straight to the procedure of our dormitory

430
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,000
The boss said I was dead

431
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,280
Actually I was dead for four years

432
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,560
Four years

433
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
I just give you

434
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,680
You are a criminal

435
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,840
I went down and told him that I was wrong

436
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,680
I was wrong

437
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,640
If I saw me wrong

438
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,240
I didn't say

439
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,360
In fact, that word is

440
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,400
Especially for his double-eyelid

441
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,880
It's you

442
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,840
Those feelings between you

443
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,800
Maybe it's just a good thing

444
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,240
Yes, you can't fix this feeling

445
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,760
Come on, come on

446
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,120
Don't touch it

447
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,320
Okay, don't move

448
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,240
So put it on

449
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,400
Come on, add a look

450
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,120
Look

451
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,560
You are good

452
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:21,680
Right

453
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,960
It's like who

454
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
Just for a minute

455
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
Don't say we are wrong

456
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,680
Don't ask any questions

457
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:42,760
We can
