Episode 1

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
Maybe something is bothering you.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,200
I still can't come back today.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,600
Can you please take care of him for me?

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm in the building.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,000
The bell is ringing.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,000
The city is ringing.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
The wind is blowing.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,600
The military flag is shining.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
It's dinner time.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,200
Where is Mr. Fang?

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
They went to the warehouse.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,600
He went to find the manager.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,600
What's so good?

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,200
Fried noodles.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,200
I love this.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
This is Korean.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,200
This is your fried rice.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,800
It's so sweet.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Finally, I'm back.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,600
Great.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
I didn't have lunch this weekend.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,000
This.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,000
This?

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,600
Thank you.

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,200
Listen.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
This is a special dish for you.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
I want to smell it.

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,200
I think this is a good dish.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,000
Fei Fei, did you see that?

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
It's not a good dish.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Don't eat it. Give it back to me.

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,200
Give it back.

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
I love fried noodles the most.

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm kidding.

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
You don't know that.

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,400
Have you had lunch?

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,400
Yes.

39
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Do you have my dinner?

40
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Of course.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Let's have a chat.

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
We need to talk.

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,800
Tell me.

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,800
What's the punishment for Ma Fushun?

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Ma Fushun is not a good person.

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
She should be taught.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,400
Will she be a part of this family?

48
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
She won't be.

49
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,200
I don't know.

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,400
She has something to do.

51
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,600
I just checked the room.

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
She said she's ready to cancel the divorce.

53
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Please let her get a divorce.

54
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
Boss is injured.

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
The company is preparing for her.

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
She must reward her.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,600
Boss is not good at it.

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,600
You should know that.

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,200
How is Weiwei's wife?

60
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
She's on a business trip.

61
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000
I have a meeting with her tonight.

62
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,200
I didn't expect that

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,800
the blind date will be a condition.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We'll meet online.

65
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,400
Shall we go with Weiwei?

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,600
No.

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
She's a condition.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She's a private matter.

69
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,800
She doesn't want others to know.

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
She's just a little shy.

71
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Let Weiwei go.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Let's talk.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Look.

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
This is the copy of

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the painting of the lotus and the painting of the dragon?

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,400
Yes.

77
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
The lotus is a kind person.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
She agreed to our agreement

79
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,200
on the interview.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
So she signed

81
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
the agreement with the painting of the dragon.

82
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Li Fa is still

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
a painter.

84
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,400
She will pay

85
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
the rent for the painting of the lotus.

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
That's too much.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,600
The painting of the dragon is really good.

88
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
Fang Suo, what are you so angry about?

89
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,000
We've been in a long relationship for so many years.

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,600
I should be happy.

91
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,600
How can you be angry?

92
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,400
Wang Linhuan is going to divorce Duan Baohua.

93
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
She deserves it.

94
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,400
The person who changed her life

95
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
will pay the rent for her.

96
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,000
But we have to think for Wang Linhuan.

97
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
She's already this old.

98
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,000
How can divorce be the best choice?

99
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
We can't just stand and watch.

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
That's right.

101
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,200
She's a young couple.

102
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
She's old.

103
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,000
She's divorced.

104
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
She's very sad.

105
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
That's enough.

106
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,000
Here's the book.

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
See?

108
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Fine.

109
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,200
I told you this.

110
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,700
Staying on my side,

111
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,660
old man is actually

112
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
not my mother.

113
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,960
Hello.

114
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,680
I'm fine.

115
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,080
Thanks.

116
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Sure.

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,640
Have a look.

118
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,360
My family is territory

119
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
pretty much settled.

120
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,600
I miss the elderly in my hometown.

121
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,520
As for the law,

122
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,120
it has nothing to do with me.

123
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
But from Xueyan, it's my biological mother.

124
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
She gave birth to me, but didn't adopt me.

125
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,200
So I think that raising her is my older sister's business.

126
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
It has nothing to do with me.

127
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Then how did you grow up?

128
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,200
I was passed down by my biological mother since I was a child.

129
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
I was a distant uncle.

130
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Thank you.

131
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Thank you.

132
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,200
After she married me, she had a baby in East and West.

133
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
She had five children.

134
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
I had a brother and three sisters.

135
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I was a child with you.

136
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
When I was two,

137
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
she died in the construction site.

138
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,200
After that, my mother was no longer at home.

139
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
A woman had five children.

140
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
It was too hard to sleep.

141
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,200
My youngest sister and I were passed down to her distant brother.

142
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
He was my adopted father.

143
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I was 70 years old.

144
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,200
He was so worried that he raised my brother and two sisters.

145
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
He went to college and raised them as a family.

146
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
He also helped them with their children.

147
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
So I think that mother Shanghai should do things.

148
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
They think that my business is very good.

149
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
So they gave birth to my mother.

150
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Do you think that's reasonable?

151
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
I'm not a cruel person.

152
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,200
So I opened the door and exposed my life.

153
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,200
But it's very likely that my older brothers and sisters

154
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
don't care about their old ladies.

155
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I think it's unfair to me.

156
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
It's not fair to my adopted father.

157
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I didn't expect that kind of situation in your family.

158
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I can understand.

159
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
After all, it's snowing.

160
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
You did nothing wrong.

161
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
As far as you are concerned,

162
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
if you accept your mother,

163
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
your older brothers and sisters will kill you.

164
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I think you can trust the law.

165
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
You mean,

166
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
if they don't adopt an old lady,

167
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
can the old lady tell them?

168
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
If necessary,

169
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
it's also a kind of plan.

170
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Don't worry.

171
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
The old lady won't do that.

172
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
But we can't tolerate this selfishness,

173
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
ungrateful behavior of not being kind to the old lady.

174
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
What's happening in our eyes?

175
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
The old lady has worked hard for a lifetime.

176
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
She shouldn't have been treated like this.

177
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Sorry to trouble you.

178
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
We're not afraid of trouble.

179
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
How about this?

180
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
The old lady is in your place now.

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
You can ask the police to help you.

182
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
We'll ask the police to help you.

183
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
We'll do the work for your brothers and sisters.

184
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
We'll find out about this.

185
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Thank you.

186
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
My sister is here.

187
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
I'll talk to her now.

188
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Chen Hao, let me tell you.

189
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm not answering your phone.

190
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I want to make it clear to you.

191
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I know how difficult it is for me to meet you.

192
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm still a little capable.

193
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
I don't care about my mom.

194
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Are you listening?

195
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm listening.

196
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
It's good that you're listening.

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm in a difficult life now.

198
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
My son is getting married.

199
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
He lives at home.

200
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
But there's no house.

201
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
The house is full of houses.

202
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Where's the old lady?

203
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,200
It's not the reason that your wife comes in.

204
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Who is this?

205
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
No wonder you don't want to take care of your family.

206
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
You have a wife.

207
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Don't misunderstand.

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm the person in charge of the hotel.

209
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
You put the old lady alone in the filming location.

210
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
You don't care about her.

211
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
You don't want her to be in danger.

212
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
It's good that you care about her.

213
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
We sent her to the police station.

214
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
She doesn't like the old lady.

215
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Why are you asking us?

216
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
It's none of your business.

217
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
You didn't give the old lady the number.

218
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
If she's in danger,

219
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
you'll be punished.

220
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
You just say it.

221
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
What are you doing here?

222
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
What right do you have to teach me?

223
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
After your mother was abandoned by you,

224
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
she's always been in charge of the street and the police station.

225
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Do you think I have no right to recommend you?

226
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
That's good.

227
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm relieved that the old lady is taking care of someone.

228
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Don't worry.

229
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Xia Hao,

230
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
write down the family address and family member

231
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
of your brothers and sisters' family,

232
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
the work unit and the income source.

233
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,200
We'll find a way to get them to come here early.

234
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Okay.

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Don't panic, Xia Hao.

236
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I see you're in a hurry.

237
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
You don't understand.

238
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
This sofa is the most comfortable place.

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
It's a little bit...

240
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
It feels like...

241
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm still in a panic.

242
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
You're so annoying.

243
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
You're in such a big house.

244
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
You're making a sofa for a girl.

245
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Why do you call it a love?

246
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
This sofa is made of...

247
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
I'm the one who's made of this.

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
That's why I feel like a family.

249
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Right?

250
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
The whole style of decoration is so elegant.

251
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
You should buy a sofa in this color.

252
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Exactly.

253
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
It's not as good as my brother's.

254
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Why do you buy it in this color?

255
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
No,

256
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
it's because it's too elegant.

257
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm using this color.

258
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
This is called warm color.

259
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I use it to make it look warm.

260
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Right?

261
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
It's okay to use warm color.

262
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
You said

263
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
this is the living room of the Aishibara.

264
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Right, it's not a big deal.

265
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Look,

266
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
there are many people here.

267
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Who are you?

268
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
You're the one who's in charge of this.

269
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Your mom is in charge of this.

270
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Don't mind me.

271
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm the one who's in charge of this.

272
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm the staff of the Aishibara.

273
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I'm the professional.

274
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
This is my sofa.

275
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
When we watch TV,

276
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm the fourth brother of nature.

277
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Is there anything wrong with the unit?

278
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Is there anything wrong with the superior leader of the unit?

279
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I didn't say anything.

280
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
What are you talking about?

281
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Why can you keep watching TV?

282
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I can't rest for a while.

283
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Let's take a picture of Han Chao.

284
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Okay, I won't tell her.

285
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Let me take a picture.

286
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Sister.

287
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Who is this?

288
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
I don't know you.

289
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I told you that you're not a big deal.

290
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
I just went to...

291
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
to introduce you to...

292
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Mingzhu, we've made the adjustment.

293
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
What about the adjustment success?

294
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
The adjustment success is not because

295
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
we're now in the agreement of the adjustment.

296
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
We have to really...

297
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
make this thing happen.

298
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
So we will also...

299
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
put it on a platform and socialize.

300
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Socializing also has a adjustment committee.

301
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
We also have a network committee to communicate.

302
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
So in order to go back to the past year,

303
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
and to get some points,

304
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
we also hope that the community...

305
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
will have more relationships.

306
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
We really have to do this.

307
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
20.

308
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
I should wear this.

309
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,200
It's a little peach-colored.

310
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Because I...

311
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
this color is completely non-conceivable.

312
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm just talking to you.

313
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
So that color is actually a little...

314
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Yeah, a little offensive.

315
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
17.

316
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
20.

317
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Let's do it first.
