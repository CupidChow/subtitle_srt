00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,920
Here, click click

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,400
HeLilian

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,040
Every moment of this

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,000
RED for you

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,720
Uncle Jiahua

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,480
I've known what you said

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,920
We'll go and check on each other.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,120
We'll see what each other's attitude is.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,480
Then we'll have a reasonable arrangement.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,080
Okay?

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,680
I'll give you both a satisfactory solution.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,880
What I said is true.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
I know.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,680
Okay, Uncle Da, you go back first.

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,080
We'll talk to you later, okay?

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
Mr. Feng,

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,080
I was on the floor to leak water.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,480
How did the floor get damaged?

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,080
Why didn't you come to repair it?

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,480
Don't worry, Mrs. Liu.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,280
The property was checked.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,280
It wasn't the water pipe on the floor.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,480
It's the old water pipe leak on your apartment.

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
Is the leak on the floor also their responsibility?

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,880
This can't be considered the responsibility of the floor.

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,080
This is the public water pipe leak.

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,280
We're also communicating with that property

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
on a solution.

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,480
Then I'll let you know, okay?

31
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,480
I don't think it's leaking now.

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,280
It's not leaking, but the leak isn't fixed.

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,680
I know.

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,280
I'll let you know when the solution is out.

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,680
Okay, okay.

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
I'll give you a discount.

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
It's okay, okay.

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,880
See you later, Mrs. Liu.

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Xiao Dong.

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,080
Mrs. Fang,

41
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,880
it's not that the water pipe leak is not leaking.

42
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,680
You should take care of it.

43
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,080
You're not the water pipe.

44
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Of course I'm not the water pipe.

45
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,680
But this forestry room

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,880
has been damaged because of the leak.

47
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,680
Should I take care of it?

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,080
It's annoying.

49
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,280
It's not annoying either.

50
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,080
I'll let everyone solve the problem.

51
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Be happy.

52
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,680
Tell me if you have anything.

53
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,080
I still feel the same way as last time.

54
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,680
I think she's very strange.

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,080
But there's a根據.

56
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,280
What is it?

57
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,080
She quarreled with my mom the other day.

58
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
She quarreled so hard.

59
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
When I came back, they were already arguing.

60
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,680
What did they quarrel?

61
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
They quarreled very strangely.

62
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,280
You're lying to me, Sun Ming.

63
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,680
Who are you?

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
What do you mean? I'm your husband.

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Husband? We haven't got married yet.

66
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,880
Whose illness is this?

67
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,680
What? Let me see.

68
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,480
You ask me who it is.

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
How do I know whose illness it is?

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
How do you know?

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,880
I found it from your bottom of my heart.

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,280
You're messing with my stuff.

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
What are you arguing about?

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
You can't break it.

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,480
Xiaotong is back.

76
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,680
Your mom is just kidding.

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,480
She doesn't know where she got her illness.

78
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,280
She said it was mine.

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,080
Nonsense.

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,280
Let me see whose illness it is.

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,480
Fine.

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
I don't care if you don't show me.

83
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,680
If you think it's weird, you can throw it away.

84
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,480
But I want to tell you

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,680
that this illness is really not mine.

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,880
Really.

87
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,080
And Xiaotong,

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,880
you should persuade your mom

89
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,480
to stay away from the doctor's and the ghost's business.

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,680
Let's go.

91
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,880
Xiaotong,

92
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,680
go out.

93
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
Xiaotong,

94
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,680
go out.

95
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,440
I found you a needle.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,880
What needle?

97
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,080
Drink.

98
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,080
Mr. Jia,

99
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,680
you might be lying skinned ifあー changed.

100
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,080
How do I know who it is?

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,480
Is it true or two hundred?

102
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,280
I don't have any idea.

103
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,840
Why there's two miles away?

104
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
I've read it before doing everything.

105
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,480
This time,

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,280
you can't tell it's fake.

107
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
I believe that

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,080
Xiaotong knew me but figured

109
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,480
it was made up by a Ra쌤ож batch

110
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,480
agreed with me to be afl looks and eyes.

111
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,080
You're a child.

112
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Tell me honestly.

113
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,480
Do you want to help your parents get married?

114
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,280
Aunt Fang,

115
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,680
don't tell my mom about Binli.

116
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,280
My mom doesn't want me to take care of him.

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,080
I know.

118
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:51,440
Goodbye,

119
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
Then let's go.

120
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,080
I can go. You can go.

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,680
I'm fine.

122
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
I can go by myself.

123
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
Don't worry about me.

124
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,680
Let's go.

125
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,480
Okay, let's go.

126
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Let's go. You're so naughty.

127
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Hello,

128
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,280
it's okay. Chen is a wrong person.

129
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
You can come back here.

130
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
Bye.

131
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,280
Go. Don't worry about me.

132
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I can go by myself.

133
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
I can go by myself.

134
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,680
He can eat me by himself.

135
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,680
What?

136
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
What are you cooking?

137
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Beef ribs.

138
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
I love beef ribs.

139
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
What kind of taste?

140
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,880
It's just meat.

141
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,680
Meat?

142
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
It's good.

143
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm back late.

144
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
Why are you late than me?

145
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,480
I'm back to eat the meat.

146
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
What?

147
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,880
Mom gave it to you.

148
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
She gave it to you.

149
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,880
Really?

150
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
What did you buy?

151
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,480
Why are the words of old lady all medicine?

152
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,480
It's not medicine. It's a health product.

153
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
This is your mom's unspeakable reminder.

154
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
What?

155
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,480
It's just...

156
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
It's delicious.

157
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
My mom.

158
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Did you find the fish?

159
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,880
Yes.

160
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,880
This guy.

161
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
He has 300,000 yuan in his family.

162
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
What should we do?

163
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,280
Whatever.

164
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,080
How about...

165
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
asking him...

166
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,280
which loan he borrowed from which company?

167
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,480
Ask him directly.

168
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Let's talk about it.

169
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,480
Let's go out more.

170
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,080
Don't go out too much.

171
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,680
We eat dinner every day.

172
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,280
We just come out and surround our neighborhood.

173
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,680
It's enough to make a round trip.

174
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,480
It's so light.

175
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,280
I'm back.

176
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Have you eaten?

177
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,480
Not yet. Let's go home first.

178
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,480
It's so late. You don't eat yet?

179
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,880
If you're late next time,

180
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
you should do some exercise.

181
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
You should do some noodles.

182
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,480
Okay.

183
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,680
Look. Look at his old attitude.

184
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm telling you.

185
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,680
You're now a young man.

186
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
You're old like this in the past two years.

187
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Your stomach is broken.

188
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,080
I was going to eat noodles.

189
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,680
But I really want to come back today.

190
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,880
I want to eat with you.

191
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
You should have told me earlier.

192
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,680
I've finished eating with your mom.

193
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,880
It's okay. I'll eat with you.

194
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,880
Okay. I'll eat with you.

195
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,680
Let's go home.

196
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,280
Let's go home.

197
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,480
Your legs are getting more and more firm.

198
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,880
It's not as firm as it looks.

199
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Yes.

200
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
In a short time,

201
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
I can eat with your dad.

202
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,680
You're too early.

203
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
It's too early to eat with me.

204
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,080
Okay.

205
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
What do you want to eat?

206
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,080
What do you want to eat at home?

207
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,680
There's an old hen at home.

208
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
I'll cook it for you.

209
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,280
Okay.

210
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,080
Okay?

211
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
It's not too late.

212
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
I'll eat with you.

213
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,480
You're old.

214
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm so rich.

215
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Come here.

216
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,480
Let me go.

217
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Let me go.

218
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,280
Let me go.

219
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,680
Xiaoshi.

220
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,880
I'll go to the 120.

221
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,880
Hit the head.

222
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,680
Hit the head.

223
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,080
Hit the head.

224
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,680
Hit the head.

225
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Hit the head.

226
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Hit the head.

227
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Hit the head.

228
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Hit the head.

229
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,080
You're done.

230
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Let me go.

231
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,480
Big Fatty.

232
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,280
Where's Xiaoshi?

233
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,880
Hit the head.

234
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,280
Are you okay?

235
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,480
He really hit me.

236
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,280
He'll come back in 10 minutes.

237
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,280
Mom.

238
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,080
You're in trouble.

239
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,880
The chief is coming soon.

240
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,680
Stop talking.

241
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,480
What's the matter?

242
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,280
The matter is coming again.

243
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,480
I...

244
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,480
Who hit him?

245
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,680
Hello?

246
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,480
Xiaoshi.

247
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,280
What's the matter?

248
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,680
The car was hit by a big fan.

249
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,480
It's in the hospital.

250
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Who hit him?

251
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Ma Fushun.

252
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Where's Ma Fushun?

253
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
He's in the police station.

254
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,080
Okay.

255
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,680
Wait here.

256
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
I'll be right back.

257
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,080
Hello?

258
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,480
Mr. Fang.

259
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,680
Ma Fushun is in the hospital.

260
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,680
Why?

261
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,680
He hit Luo Da Peng.

262
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Where's Luo Da Peng?

263
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,680
In the hospital.

264
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
I'll be right back.

265
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,080
What?

266
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,680
Ma Fushun hit Luo Da Peng.

267
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
I need to see him.

268
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,880
I'll see you out.

269
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,280
Mom.

270
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,480
Don't stop

271
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
when you're in trouble.

272
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,080
I can't stop him.

273
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,280
I'm afraid he'll hurt you.

274
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,880
I won't let him hit me again.

275
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,680
I won't let him hit you.

276
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,880
Mom.

277
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,280
I should grow up.

278
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,680
Son.

279
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,880
Don't repeat that.

280
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
No matter what,

281
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
he's your father.

282
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,280
Son.

283
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Tell me.

284
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
Do you really have the money?

285
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,080
I've been in the police station

286
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
for 30 years.

287
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,680
If you have such a problem,

288
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
tell me.

289
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,680
I'll give it to you.

290
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,080
Mom.

291
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,680
Get divorced with him.

292
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,280
We can't live

293
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,480
this life anymore.

294
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,880
Let's end this problem.

295
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,080
Saw Brother Chen's line.

296
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,860
I won,

297
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,880
how's the situation?

298
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,800
Da Peng.

299
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,360
Da Peng.

300
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,960
Mr. Cheng,

301
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,840
I need to talk to you.

302
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,880
What are you doing?

303
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,640
Are you okay?

304
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,120
I'm fine.

305
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,920
I'm fine.

306
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,000
I've been fine for two days.

307
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,600
You're so nice.

308
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,360
Why are you so busy?

309
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,960
Don't stare at me like that.

310
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,600
Our work is like a spring rain.

311
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,520
It's not easy to do it.

312
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,160
The more we adjust, the more success.

313
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,080
The pressure of the court is also small.

314
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,760
The court is not as small as my work.

315
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,680
The court is a little smaller than the public.

316
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,040
But the wind is good.

317
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,680
The case of adjustment

318
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,920
and the case of trial

319
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,720
are not completely different from the two.

320
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,120
So we said that we were in the city of Siwa

321
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,080
and the strength of the city is relatively strong.

322
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,920
I want to go down here.

323
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,640
Go down here.

324
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,560
Then I want to grab it.

325
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
You want me to grab it over there.

326
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,160
I'll grab it here.

327
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,120
Then you go.

328
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,400
Don't do that.

329
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,640
So I'll just grab it.

330
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,360
Give me a child.

331
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm not your brother.

332
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,560
I understand.

333
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,520
Let me go.

334
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
You just do this.

335
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,480
Then I'll help you.

336
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,320
So...

337
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,080
Hurry up.

338
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,840
Hurry up.

339
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,520
Hurry up.

340
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,080
Hurry up.

341
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,720
He's here to catch it.

342
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,400
Come and catch it.

343
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,280
Come on.

344
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Hit your head.

345
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,080
Yes.

346
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,760
Start.
