2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
Why isn't there anyone who answers?

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Why is Lei Yibo also in your house?

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,720
My dad is even on the phone and I can't find it.

5
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,520
Hello, I'm here.

6
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,480
Who did you say Zhe invert?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm here.

8
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,600
Sister-in-law.

9
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,240
The loan company

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,400
has called me

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,520
to come here.

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,880
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,280
Whose house did you mortgage?

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,760
My mom's.

15
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,440
You're so good.

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,280
How much did you mortgage?

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,000
200,000.

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,240
If you pay back the 200,000,

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,680
can you redeem your mortgage?

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,080
But...

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,040
But I still have the money.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,760
I'm warning you.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,960
From now on,

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,240
don't lend me money.

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,880
I think

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,920
we should

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
tell Liang Yin

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,280
Zhou Hang's current attitude.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,040
We can't keep it a secret.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,400
Let Liang Yin

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,960
have a fantasy about Cheng Hang.

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,960
Zhou Hang wants to divorce Liang Yin.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,360
He'll face it sooner or later.

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,080
By then,

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,320
his fantasy will be shattered.

36
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,280
What will he do?

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,800
I didn't say I'll keep it a secret.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,920
I'm thinking

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,160
when he's done with the surgery,

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
and he's recovered,

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,080
I'll tell him.

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,960
Then he'll be in good health

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,760
and overcome the difficulty of illness.

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,840
Then his psychological load will be higher.

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
But...

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,920
I agree with Bei Wei's opinion.

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,080
If the same thing

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,600
happens to the same person,

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
but the time

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,480
and the place

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,960
are different,

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,760
and the mood,

53
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,280
health and other factors are different,

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,320
the effect will be different.

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,200
Zhou Hang.

56
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,520
Hello?

57
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,040
You're so despicable.

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,400
What do you mean by looking for a lawyer?

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,080
You...

60
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,680
Why are you so excited?

61
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
How long can you keep lying?

62
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,440
You stay here.

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,400
I'll be there soon.

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,360
Okay?

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
It's good if you did it earlier.

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,800
It's not a good idea to hide, right?

67
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,480
You're so stubborn.

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,600
Good thing.

69
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,080
You finally come to talk.

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,120
Wen Xin.

71
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
Zhou Hang is coming.

72
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
You heard her?

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

74
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,480
She has suffered a di desenvolute.

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,220
But look at you.

76
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,840
It's good that

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,920
show up.

78
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,620
That Close to You.

79
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,200
It's good that

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,000
we've discussed this matter hard today.

81
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,240
However delicious she's brainwas mine these days,

82
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,480
we must ahead of her

83
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,160
and make sure she pays the medical bills.

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
What do you think?

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,280
How about

86
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,840
we ask Zhu Lian

87
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,560
Then I...

88
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,820
Gotta go back.

89
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,680
Just forget it.

90
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,280
',

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,120
This is called...

92
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,840
Already gone.

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,280
Don't mind me.

94
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,280
Well.

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,000
It's done, huh?

96
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,120
It' se afhe origin...

97
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,520
Boss,

98
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,320
Supose I choreograph...

99
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,820
to our group queen right?

100
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,800
We're dismissed.

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,080
The medical expenses for paying for the hospital bills

102
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,520
should be enough, right?

103
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,160
Yes.

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,120
He's rich.

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,960
I know him.

106
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,880
That's great.

107
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,960
Let's put aside what we have today.

108
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,720
Do our best.

109
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,880
Make it up.

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720
Okay.

111
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,160
Do our best.

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,840
Is it fun to be so hard?

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,240
We've been together for so many years.

114
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,000
Am I that kind of person?

115
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
Besides,

116
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,200
who told you

117
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I gave the door and the room to Hua Xiaorong?

118
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,280
Don't worry about who told me.

119
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,800
Did you give it to her or not?

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,200
I didn't.

121
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,280
Then how did Xiao Du say you gave it to her?

122
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,000
Hua Xiaorong divorced her.

123
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
She's framing and framing.

124
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,680
Framing and framing?

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,960
Then why didn't she frame and frame someone else

126
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,080
to frame you?

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,080
She wanted to come to my place to work.

128
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,120
I didn't agree.

129
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
She's just playing around.

130
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,800
Do you know that?

131
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,560
Is that really true?

132
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
Of course.

133
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,520
How complicated the society is now.

134
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,320
There's no one.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
Okay, go back.

136
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,440
Take care of the child.

137
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,440
Xiao Fan.

138
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,360
Boss.

139
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,000
Send your sister-in-law back.

140
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,080
You're not going back with me?

141
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
I have so many things to do. How can I go back?

142
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,200
Sister-in-law, let's go.

143
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,120
I'll go back first.

144
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,160
Go.

145
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,160
As for最近,

146
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm so 40 stars'

147
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,000
mainist of the party,

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,000
located around Dow Detroit regionalitchens,

149
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,400
overseas.

150
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,880
Jin和迅

151
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm here too.

152
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,440
Let's doze off first.

153
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,280
Alright.

154
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,920
I...

155
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,680
Why don't you talk?

156
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,760
Wait for me at home tonight.

157
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,440
Don't go out.

158
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,480
Han Chao,

159
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,960
have you seen this person?

160
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,880
He was here two days ago.

161
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,800
Is it Zhou Hang?

162
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
We've been waiting for you.

163
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,440
Come in and sit.

164
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,960
I'll take him to the meeting room.

165
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,800
Come on.

166
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,640
Please come with me to the meeting room.

167
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,720
Come on.

168
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,360
Let's sit down.

169
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,920
Come on.

170
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,880
Come on.

171
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,880
What should we do now?

172
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,680
Take the carpet here.

173
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,400
Let's go and see.

174
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's give them the hot cup.

175
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm sick of it.

176
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,640
How can we let her go?

177
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,400
Yubei,

178
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,360
make him some tea.

179
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,720
Yes.

180
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
Good luck.

181
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,560
That's our boy.

182
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,840
Come in first.

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm making a big deal.

184
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,480
I have to cause you a lot of trouble.

185
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,280
I don't know

186
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,880
You're really afraid of two people before and after you go abroad.

187
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,320
For Liao Ying, what's the point of going abroad to study?

188
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm not going abroad to study for her.

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But she gave up studying because of you.

190
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,600
Look, Zhou Han.

191
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,600
You're now a doctor.

192
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,360
In the eyes of the average person,

193
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,760
your moral values and your education should match each other.

194
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,200
Your relationship and your moral values

195
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,240
sometimes conflict.

196
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,200
You have to admit it.

197
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,960
And what age is this?

198
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,160
I don't love Liao Ying anymore.

199
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,800
What right do you have to force me to continue loving her?

200
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,640
We don't have the right to ask you to love anyone.

201
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,920
But we have responsibilities and obligations to ask you to abide by the law.

202
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,040
Why am I not following the law?

203
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
Freedom to marry and divorce.

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,400
Which law did I violate?

205
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,600
Liao Ying is seriously ill now.

206
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,200
She can't live on her own.

207
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,480
And you know very well

208
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,200
that Liao Ying is doing this for you.

209
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,360
If you insist on saying that,

210
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,360
then there are more people in this world who care about her.

211
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,520
Moreover, you don't think it's easy for me to go abroad to study, right?

212
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,120
You have to follow your teacher every day.

213
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,440
You have to follow your own studies.

214
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,320
Isn't that what you should do?

215
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
But Liao Ying?

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,960
She has to work four jobs in China alone.

217
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,800
She not only has to support herself,

218
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,640
but also has to earn your rent abroad.

219
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,760
So you also said

220
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,080
that she works to support herself.

221
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,840
You are not grateful because you are so rich, right?

222
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,280
If I were ten years younger,

223
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
I would really want to teach you a lesson for your father.

224
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,360
Don't mention that old bastard.

225
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,840
Zhou Hao.

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,800
When you and Liao Ying were married,

227
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,680
you were in a relationship.

228
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,080
This has reached the edge of the law.

229
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,720
Okay.

230
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,840
You two don't need to say anything else.

231
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,720
My attitude is very clear.

232
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,080
As long as Liao Ying agrees to divorce,

233
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,560
I can pay for this medical fee.

234
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,520
I'm afraid even if she doesn't agree to divorce,

235
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,440
you have to pay for this medical fee.

236
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,960
You can't do this.

237
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,040
Why?

238
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,160
The law.

239
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,200
You have to pay her a fine for the civil law.

240
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,080
Listen up.

241
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,720
According to the rule of Article 1059 of the Civil Law,

242
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
a couple has the obligation to support each other.

243
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,520
If one side needs to support,

244
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,160
the other side has the right to pay for the medical fee

245
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,520
if they don't fulfill the obligation.

246
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,120
The law here is not the law of support.

247
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
It's the law of support.

248
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,360
This is the law.

249
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,800
For people aged, young, sick,

250
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,040
and those who can't live independently,

251
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
those who refuse to support

252
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,200
and are in a bad situation

253
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
have to be responsible for the situation.

254
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
Do you understand?

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,080
Look at the letter of reconciliation.

256
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,280
So far,

257
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,440
we still have hope for you.

258
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,640
I hope you don't be ashamed.

259
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Zhong Hao, I'm Zhu Li.

260
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
I believe you can make the right decision.

261
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,560
I still think

262
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,960
you're a responsible man.

263
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,840
Thank you for your hard work.

264
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,680
You saved a person's life

265
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,560
and two people's.

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,880
Zhong Hao,

267
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,560
do you remember this?

268
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,800
This paper ring

269
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,520
contains your true love for Liang Yin.

270
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,960
We hope you can remember

271
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,120
what you said.

272
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,200
Isn't this just a paper ring?

273
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,960
It's a diamond ring wrapped in a paper ring.

274
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,240
Because it's too small,

275
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,200
he didn't dare to take it out.

276
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,680
He worked so hard to earn money to buy it for me.

277
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,440
The ring is on the heart of his heart.

278
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,000
When you accept this paper ring,

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
you will see

280
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,920
the love I have for you hidden in it.

281
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,400
Although this ring is small,

282
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,320
it was bought by me.

283
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,640
Marry me, dear.

284
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,400
You worked so hard to earn money

285
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,200
to buy a diamond ring for me

286
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,800
even in such a big situation.

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,200
He won't break his promise.

288
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
He didn't come to see me.

289
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,400
He must be angry.

290
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,400
He blames me.

291
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,600
I should have worked so hard

292
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,400
to break my body.

293
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,800
He knows I'm doing this for his own good.

294
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,600
He knows I can suffer less

295
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,200
and feel less in foreign countries.

296
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,800
You must read this paper.

297
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,200
He will understand me.

298
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,520
Yep, go out

299
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,800
Our regulations

300
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,880
are difficult to Circuit Chamber to consider.

301
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,200
Many people grasp us

302
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
for pointing inside the map.

303
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,660
To REAL speaking, we have to X like

304
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,800
and X like,

305
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
it should be fair and APPLAUSE until no one green light came into our sight.

306
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,200
Second thing is

307
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
that judicial regulations

308
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,160
have common interests that

309
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
I just want to find the other

310
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
First of all, time is too rushed

311
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,080
The team is different

312
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
The things he does must be different

313
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
There are differences in the ability to understand

314
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
So even if you have a

315
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
The strength you want to use to achieve something

316
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
You will definitely get the picture you want

317
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
The key is that you don't have time to entangle

318
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
You don't have time to fight with each department

319
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Ready

320
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
The relationship between the two is strong

321
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
I'll call you back

322
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
I think it's time to be together

323
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
To be able to be a

324
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Like a sea king

325
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You can have one

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
A group of people who are completely in the same boat with you

327
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's good to work together

328
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Take your time
