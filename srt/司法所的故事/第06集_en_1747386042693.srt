00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,560
According to what Xiaohong said

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,360
He is a money-saving thief

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,760
He has no money these two days

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,320
So go to the bar

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,720
Go to make trouble

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,480
He is a thief

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,200
Little three

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,080
Beautiful behavior

11
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,160
His mask

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,560
You go to inquire

13
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,760
Who gave him

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,480
Check – in

Fired

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
Allow it

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,640
Janet

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,800
Nothing.

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,480
This door is your rent?

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,680
This door is mine.

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,560
Yours?

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,800
You bought it?

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,600
I don't have money to buy it.

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,560
My boyfriend gave it to me.

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,000
Your boyfriend?

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,600
He's a construction worker.

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,680
What kind of construction?

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,560
It's for decoration.

32
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,400
He can do whatever he wants.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,520
Uncle Chen,

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,760
are you going to decorate it?

35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,680
No, I'm not.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,360
Well, Xiaolong,

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,520
you should get to know each other

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,600
more.

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,920
Know your roots.

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
Then you'll feel at ease.

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,480
Right?

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,440
Yes.

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,440
Duan is fine.

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,840
He told me everything.

45
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,280
But he's quite pitiful.

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,440
How is he pitiful?

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,440
He's afraid that his parents died early

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,960
and no one loves him.

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,120
He finally got married.

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,880
His wife died.

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
He's been lonely these years.

52
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,080
He told you all these?

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,200
Yes.

54
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,120
How else would I know?

55
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,920
Right.

56
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,400
It's the same old saying.

57
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,360
You need to know

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,760
a process to know someone.

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,760
You need to be careful.

60
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,160
Right.

61
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,760
Okay, get back to your work.

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,640
Take care, Uncle Chen.

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,600
Okay.

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,960
The passage.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,040
Hallway1 ,

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,360
Hallway1 ,

No. 7, En Chinese Sabre,

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,840
Building Building Officer Liu,

69
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,400
Organization,

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,200
Hallway1 ,

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,360
The law is to

72
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,480
demolish the building

73
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,080
and demolish the building.

74
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,120
I know

75
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
about Ms. Zhou's family.

76
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,680
Ms. Zhou and her husband

77
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,160
are half-wifes.

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,960
Ms. Zhou's son

79
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,880
is living with them now.

80
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,800
Her relationship with her stepfather

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,120
is still the same.

82
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,120
I've been to

83
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,480
Ms. Zhou's family.

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
Their house is on the second floor.

85
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,640
It's relatively small.

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,760
They just put a piece of the balcony

87
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,560
on the first floor.

88
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,400
This way,

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,320
the balcony

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,280
will be expanded into a small room.

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,800
Ms. Zhou and her husband

92
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,160
will live in this small balcony.

93
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,600
It's safe and safe.

94
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,480
After today's meeting,

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,720
we'll have our notice and persuasion

96
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,160
in front of us.

97
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,640
If you want to do it, let him do it himself.

98
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,960
Chen,

99
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,080
you should communicate with the law enforcement.

100
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,320
No matter how they do it,

101
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,760
you should do the persuasion.

102
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,680
Okay.

103
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,480
Okay.

104
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,960
That's all for today's meeting.

105
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
We'll go back first.

106
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,840
Take care.

107
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,120
Pei,

108
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,200
Han Cheong,

109
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,960
have you contacted

110
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,880
the law enforcement?

111
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
Yes.

112
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,400
He really doesn't know

113
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,880
about Ms. Zhou's wife.

114
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,080
How is his attitude?

115
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,360
Will he cooperate with us

116
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,800
to persuade Zhou Heng?

117
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,800
She is a

118
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,440
mature girl.

119
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,000
After she learned about the marriage,

120
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,960
she didn't have too much

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
over-emotional.

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,800
But she didn't express her feelings.

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,600
She just said that she wanted to ask Zhou Heng first

124
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600
and then make her own decision.

125
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,480
She is better than a smart girl.

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,000
Pei, please continue to follow up.

127
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
Han Cheong,

128
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,800
you should contact Zhou Heng again.

129
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,240
If he doesn't want to come to the hospital,

130
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,440
please invite him to this room.

131
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,640
Okay.

132
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,280
By the way,

133
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,120
you should hurry to draft

134
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,260
Zhou Heng's

135
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,560
draft letter.

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,920
Very good.

137
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,480
There is a noodle restaurant

138
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,080
that makes delicious noodles.

139
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,080
Let's go together.

140
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,360
I'll treat you.

141
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,000
I have something to do.

142
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,640
You go first.

143
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,920
You have something to do?

144
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,360
Hello?

145
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm not feeling well.

146
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,880
I'll go and have a look.

147
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,640
I'll go and have a look.

148
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I have something to do.

149
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,240
You have something to do?

150
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,560
Are you going to say

151
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,320
that you have something to do?

152
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,320
No.

153
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm calling you early.

154
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,760
Let's go. I'll go and have noodles.

155
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,520
That's too much.

156
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,320
Let's go.

157
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,360
Brother Chen is here.

158
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,880
Come on.

159
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,360
Come on.

160
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,880
Sit inside.

161
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,640
Okay.

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,400
Come on.

163
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,560
Okay.

164
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,240
I'm busy.

165
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,120
Thank you.

166
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,320
There is a noodle with skin and belly.

167
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Two bowls of noodles with skin and belly.

168
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,280
Wait.

169
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,560
You also eat noodles with skin and belly?

170
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,240
What's wrong?

171
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,640
Isn't this the sign of the noodles with the little master?

172
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,960
I heard that girls don't usually eat noodles with skin and belly.

173
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,840
It's okay.

174
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Let me have two bowls of noodles with skin and belly.

175
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,480
Okay.

176
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,200
There's no danger.

177
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,560
It's the no-do list after adding to our share.

178
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,200
What are you looking at?

179
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,200
Old Chen.

180
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,240
The look of boss

181
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,320
is really miserable.

182
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:26,120
I also have остę Decay

183
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,000
It's pretty good

184
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,080
Thank you

185
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Come on

186
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,800
Come, your noodles

187
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,000
Come again later

188
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,880
no problem

189
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,000
Chuan is here

190
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,840
how about it

191
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,040
I have something to do with you

192
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,240
Go go go

193
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,800
what happened

194
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,480
Nothing, there is something

195
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,280
There is something

196
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
Later, later

197
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,400
That doctor just came

198
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,480
Said the next stage was going to pay

199
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,560
That I took a look

200
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,840
There are quite a lot of part of the self-pay

201
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
You helped me with this

202
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,560
Row

203
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,000
Ok, take it

204
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,120
That mom

205
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
I'll go out first

206
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,320
Thank you, she's busy

207
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,720
Sister

208
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
The boyfriend's matter

209
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,000
Haven't fallen

210
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
You, I'm not in a hurry

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,080
What are you in a hurry

212
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,080
Not small

213
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Wait a few more years

214
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,120
What's wrong with having a baby

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,920
Isn't it warm-hearted?

216
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
You are talking about this

217
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,240
mom

218
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,080
What's up

219
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,920
Come in, you are here too

220
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,200
I just passed by

221
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,120
Come up and see aunt

222
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,440
mom

223
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,160
What's wrong with you

224
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
I'm not in a hurry

225
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,440
Nothing

226
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,720
Just a word in my heart

227
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,680
Say mom

228
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,480
I'll call you

229
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,760
Nothing

230
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,640
I just need to take a break

231
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm going to add some water to you

232
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,560
sister

233
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,360
When I was in college

234
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,840
Every time I didn't miss us

235
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,680
Song Tao

236
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,160
How can I compare with warm-hearted?

237
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,840
When you went to college

238
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
Song Tao's eyes are full of warmth

239
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
Run to the dormitory every day

240
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,720
Then they two are good

241
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,120
I can't even get in

242
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,800
mom

243
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,880
Why don't you sleep for a while

244
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,800
Take a break

245
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,680
May be better

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,760
I know you don't have to worry

247
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,720
Then I'll go back to the dormitory first

248
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,520
I still have a case to talk about this afternoon

249
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,000
it is good

250
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,440
I won't delay work

251
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:46,960
aunt

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,120
I happen to have an appointment with my client

253
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Come to see you another day

254
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
Come over when you have time

255
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,040
warm-hearted

256
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,640
A few days ago

257
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,160
You went to the hospital to check the results

258
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,640
The doctor said I have no problem

259
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,880
Just too nervous

260
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Too nervous

261
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
What are you nervous about

262
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,600
What did you go to the hospital for?

263
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,320
I am not willing to

264
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,640
I thought it was you two

265
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,680
Don't want children

266
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,320
Then you have no problem

267
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,280
No problem

268
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
That's Lin Fengtao's problem

269
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,760
He has no problem

270
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,800
What's going on

271
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
I tell you

272
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm just too nervous

273
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll send you

274
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,760
No, I'll take the subway

275
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,120
Slow down

276
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,520
Bye bye

277
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,880
The boss's two hands are really good

278
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,000
Then you two

279
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:15,220
Can the floe have

280
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
Please ask

281
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,520
What's wrong?

282
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,920
There's a power outage in the small room.

283
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,160
It seems that her ex-husband is making trouble again.

284
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,680
Let's go and have a look.

285
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,080
I wonder if he seduced your Duan first

286
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,280
or your Duan seduced him first.

287
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,800
Look at this mask room.

288
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
Your Duan bought it.

289
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,120
Now it's for him.

290
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,840
You...

291
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,160
Du,

292
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,000
can you stop

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,080
looking for someone to mess around with?

294
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,360
Duan is single.

295
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,520
Where did he get the wife?

296
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,160
Stop pretending.

297
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,240
Sister Wang,

298
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,560
let's wait here today.

299
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,840
Your Duan will definitely come.

300
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,720
No.

301
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,120
Don't...

302
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't blame Duan for this.

303
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
Duan is not that kind of person.

304
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,600
Don't talk nonsense.

305
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,320
He's so young.

306
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,400
Sister Wang,

307
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,240
you...

308
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,440
Tell me.

309
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
Du.

310
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
Didn't we agree

311
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,280
to talk about it in the police station?

312
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,440
Why are you hiding here again?

313
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,520
Talk in the police station?

314
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,440
What?

315
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,880
You want me to find a serious job?

316
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,080
This is my private affair.

317
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,720
I don't need your trouble.

318
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,640
You can't

319
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,360
mess around in the public place.

320
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
You're here to meddle in other people's business again.

321
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,160
I'm bored.

322
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,640
Why do you keep staring at me?

323
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,920
You don't care about

324
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,480
Hua Xiaorong destroying her family.

325
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,920
Why do you keep staring at me?

326
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,840
I want to care about it,

327
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
but I don't care about it here.

328
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,160
You care about it in this way.

329
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,400
We sit down in the dormitory.

330
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,840
Isn't it good to think about it?

331
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,960
I'm not going.

332
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,200
I want to talk here.

333
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll tell all the neighbors to listen.

334
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,640
Hua Xiaorong destroying her family.

335
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,520
Why don't you tell them?

336
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,320
Stop talking nonsense.

337
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
Duan is not that kind of person.

338
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,680
Duan, don't talk nonsense here.

339
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,560
Let me see who's here.

340
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
Tell me who's here.

341
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,400
Duan, what are you doing here?

342
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Well, I'm here to cut my hair.

343
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,120
Come on.

344
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,400
Duan just said

345
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,560
this hair salon

346
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,760
is for the girl you gave to.

347
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,640
I don't believe it.

348
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,280
Why are you so...

349
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,200
No.

350
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,360
I don't know who this hair salon is.

351
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,920
I'm here to cut my hair.

352
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,000
Is your hair long?

353
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
Do you want money?

354
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
Do you want to be embarrassed?

355
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,360
I want to cut my hair.

356
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,080
What are you doing here?

357
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,640
Why are you crying?

358
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,600
Duan, why are you talking to me?

359
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,760
I married into your family when I was 19.

360
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,000
I've been crying with you for decades.

361
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm tired.

362
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,400
You're rich now.

363
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
You just do what you want.

364
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,480
You do sorry to me.

365
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,880
You're still a girl.

366
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,520
What are you doing?

367
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,120
Let's go home and talk, okay?

368
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,840
Tell me clearly.

369
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,040
What are you talking about?

370
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,880
Let's go home and talk.

371
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,960
Go home.

372
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,600
Boss Duan.

373
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,320
Don't pretend to be a model, okay?

374
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,240
Go home.

375
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,520
Sister Wang.

376
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,440
This hair salon is bought by your boss.

377
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,480
Go home.

378
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,760
Go home.

379
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Go home.

380
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,400
What?

381
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,640
You don't agree with my conditions?

382
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,080
You make me feel embarrassed.

383
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,160
You should feel embarrassed too.

384
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,320
What?

385
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,200
What are you staring at me for?

386
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,880
Am I wrong?

387
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,280
I...

388
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,080
What?

389
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,920
You...

390
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,120
You...

391
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,960
What?

392
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,040
What?

393
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,200
I'll bring it.

394
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,800
Hua Xiaorong.

395
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,720
Hua Xiaorong.

396
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,520
Hua Xiaorong.

397
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,320
He can't be angry, can he?

398
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Hua Xiaorong.

399
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Are you okay?

400
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,000
Uncle Chen.

401
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm fine.

402
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
You can go home.

403
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,040
If you're fine,

404
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,480
we'll go.

405
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,720
If you have anything to say,

406
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,240
remember to come to the hair salon.

407
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,920
The hair salon

408
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,760
will solve the problem

409
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,880
in the United States.

410
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,520
In addition,

411
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,920
through this kind of adjustment,

412
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,040
we can reduce the number of miscarriage cases.

413
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,880
The hair salon

414
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,040
can not only solve the problem

415
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:28,880
through the

416
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,920
This is the office of a single person.

417
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,760
The desk of the director

418
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,360
is the same as our window.

419
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,640
There is a small sofa here.

420
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,800
There is a shelf here.

421
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,120
You can put your favorite green pool here.

422
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
The table is green.

423
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,120
Green pool.

424
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,480
Okay.

425
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:40,920
Right?

426
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,520
And then this side,

427
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,280
we can drink water

428
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,240
in the office.

429
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,560
He thinks the sofa

430
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,040
doesn't fit his character.

431
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
It doesn't fit.

432
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,800
Their attitude

433
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,760
is a little high-profile.

434
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
A little high-profile.
