00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Episode 1

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,920
Look at this mask.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,520
This is bought by Duan.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,920
He gave it to her now.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,560
It's very likely that

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,520
he told her this.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,960
But the mask

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,280
must be returned.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,680
You said this mask

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,320
was given to you by Duan Bao Hua?

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,720
Yes.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,640
But I have to tell you now.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,040
This agreement is invalid.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,640
How could it be invalid?

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,600
Duan Bao Hua was in trouble at that time.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,400
He wanted to give us the mask

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,320
and asked me to come in.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,600
He was afraid that I wouldn't believe him.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,240
He even wrote this gift

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,320
and agreement to me.

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,600
But he has a marriage.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,080
He lied to me.

23
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,160
I just knew he wasn't single.

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,240
I was worried that he would

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,280
take the mask back.

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,680
Can he take the gift back?

27
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,680
Isn't it like he gave me a painting

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,280
and a cake?

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,200
This is a gift.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,240
Let me tell you this.

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,000
Hua Xiaorong.

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,280
If Duan Bao Hua is single,

33
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,000
then it's okay to give you the mask.

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,840
From the law,

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,440
Duan Bao Hua's mask

36
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
is their common property.

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,120
Can you understand that?

38
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,840
He gave you the mask

39
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,560
and he had the right to marry you.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,200
So,

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,400
he is invalid in the law

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,560
for the agreement he gave you.

43
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,280
Li Er.

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,520
Then...

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,560
What should I do?

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I just need to pay my brother's tuition

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,880
and pay my brother's medical expenses

48
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,880
with the income of this Li Fa shop.

49
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,400
Even if my brother goes to work in the university,

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,160
but my medical expenses...

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,840
he can't delay me.

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,600
Without this Li Fa shop,

53
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,520
what should I do?

54
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,720
Don't worry.

55
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,800
Listen to me,

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,680
listen to me.

57
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,880
Keep!

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,240
You asked for so much.

59
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,360
Come!

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,920
Wait.

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
I think he's going to say

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,320
that Duan Bo Hua's the perfect match.

63
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,520
He won't lose this round either.

64
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,800
Let's reconvene.

65
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,220
I won't lose.

66
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
You can still judge obsunta.

67
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,240
Better bet on it or not

68
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,500
or that скорее he won't win.

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,640
He'd not give me any newû

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,360
25 yu Patriarchy.

71
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,200
Refuge.

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,520
He only paid Fuchu the gift of the academy.

73
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,920
I think you're a bit complicated.

74
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,520
Don't be too specific about this.

75
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Han Chao, let's not make any more judgments.

76
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,120
We should know more about the problem of the portrait honor.

77
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
Let's make more judgments.

78
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,120
Then, Chen, you and...

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,320
Let me do it.

80
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,120
Okay, then. Chen and Han Chao.

81
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
You can go and check on all the aspects.

82
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,520
We'll study how to adjust the back.

83
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,120
Okay.

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,720
The qi is ready. Take a look.

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,120
Thank you, Xiao Bei.

86
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,520
What are you looking at?

87
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,320
Why are you back?

88
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,120
My wife is back.

89
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,120
You came back suddenly and scared me.

90
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,520
I'll eat at home.

91
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,720
At home?

92
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
Then I'll cook some small dishes.

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,320
Ah Di! Ah Di!

94
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll buy you some wine.

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,520
No need. I'll bring some wine.

96
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,520
Good boy. He's taller now.

97
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,920
It's been five years. I won't grow up without a brother.

98
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,520
Don't move.

99
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I bought you a new phone.

100
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Come on.

101
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Put it in the warehouse. Go and get it.

102
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
You bought him something again?

103
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,920
This brat. I still have to be proud of him.

104
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,120
Only when I have time can I be as filial as him.

105
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,520
It's his fault.

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,120
You haven't seen a child for a long time.

107
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
You said you're not far from home.

108
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,320
You have a car.

109
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,120
You don't want to come back to see my face.

110
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,520
You don't want to see your son.

111
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,520
It's different. Your son looks more and more like you.

112
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,520
It's true.

113
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,120
Drink some water first. I'll go get the machine.

114
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,920
Did Zhou Hang come to pay for the expenses?

115
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,120
Not yet.

116
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
I'll call him.

117
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
You're just here.

118
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,920
Yang Yi's payment for the surgery has been received.

119
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,120
The surgery is three days later.

120
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,520
When did he come to pay for it?

121
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,720
Just now.

122
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,920
Where's the patient?

123
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
He left after the call.

124
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Zhou Hang!

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
You just left like that?

126
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,120
Didn't you go see Yang Yi? He's been waiting for you.

127
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
Thank you.

128
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,520
Zhou Hang!

129
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,120
Sister Lan Jin.

130
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
Zhou Hang just came to pay for the medical expenses.

131
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,520
They said thank us.

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Did he see Yang Yi in his room?

133
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
No. He left after paying.

134
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Okay. I understand.

135
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,320
Call me.

136
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Okay.

137
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Call me, okay?

138
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,520
Sure.

139
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,120
I'm Chen Chunyang, the assistant director of the Human Rights Commission.

140
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
I have a survey report here.

141
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Please take a look at the situation.

142
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Hello, can you introduce me to the person you know?

143
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Hua Xiaoguang.

144
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
I know Xiaoguang.

145
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Someone is calling you.

146
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Hello.

147
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Xiaoguang.

148
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,120
I'm Han Chao, the assistant director of the Human Rights Commission.

149
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
I'll ask you to understand the situation.

150
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Okay.

151
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Take your phone.

152
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Okay.

153
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Sister Zhong Mei.

154
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Sister, are you going out?

155
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
I went to the hospital to see a person.

156
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Sit down. I'll get you some water.

157
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Here.

158
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Thank you.

159
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
I'll get it for you later.

160
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
Well, Beibei.

161
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Thanks to your personal help,

162
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
you helped Da Peng.

163
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
We should understand him.

164
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Look at Da Peng.

165
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
He's doing a great job now.

166
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,120
I know he's blaming me for being wrong.

167
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Sister Zhong Mei.

168
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
I have something to do with your dad.

169
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Your dad?

170
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Then,

171
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
do you have a chance to cooperate with Da Peng?

172
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
I have a boyfriend now.

173
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
That one?

174
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Did you see it?

175
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
But I only have a back.

176
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,120
You two are going to get married.

177
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Let's go.

178
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Let's go one by one.

179
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
It's natural.

180
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
What kind of job does he do?

181
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
I'm not sure about that.

182
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Sister, you're too generous.

183
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
You don't know what kind of job your boyfriend does.

184
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
He's a very good guy.

185
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
He's a very good guy.

186
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Why don't you know what kind of job he does?

187
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,120
He's a handsome guy.

188
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
He's good to me.

189
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
When did you put this flower here?

190
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
It's pretty.

191
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Pretty?

192
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
I knew it was pretty.

193
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,120
But I don't know what kind of flower it is.

194
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
It's a butterfly basket.

195
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
It's a color.

196
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
It's pretty unique.

197
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
Sister, you guys go first.

198
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I'll go first.

199
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Okay.

200
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
I'll go first.

201
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Take care, bye.

202
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Bye.

203
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Who's that?

204
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Siva Suo He.

205
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
It's still in the car.

206
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Lao Chen.

207
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Chang Wan, get in the car.

208
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Where are we going?

209
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
Who's the car?

210
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
We're going to a friend's car.

211
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
We're going to a car.

212
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
We're going to a Chinese car.

213
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Okay.

214
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Come on.

215
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Let's go.

216
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
It's good.

217
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Okay.

218
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Dad,

219
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
if you don't come back,

220
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
I'll be like this when I come back.

221
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Mom's already old.

222
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
She's still waiting for you to wash her feet.

223
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Mom, you're right.

224
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
When did you come back?

225
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
You even washed her feet for men.

226
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Isn't dad rich now?

227
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Go to the washroom and wash her feet.

228
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Go.

229
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Go.

230
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Go.

231
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
I said I wouldn't let you wash her feet.

232
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
You're going to wash her feet.

233
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
It's good.

234
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
I've made a team with my son.

235
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
It's okay.

236
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Don't listen to him.

237
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
You're so tired out there.

238
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
It's hard to get back to your place.

239
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
I'll help you wash your feet.

240
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Take a good rest at home.

241
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
That's not right.

242
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
It's not right.

243
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Dad,

244
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
don't wash your feet.

245
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
What's wrong?

246
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
I have something to tell you.

247
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
What is it?

248
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
What's going on?

249
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
It's just...

250
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
I think someone's here.

251
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Who's here?

252
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
I'll go check.

253
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Who are you looking for?

254
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
You're the eldest sister of Wang.

255
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
I'm from Chengxin Court of Justice.

256
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
My name is Chen Chunyang.

257
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Boss Duan, you're here.

258
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
You're looking for him?

259
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
He's here.

260
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Come in.

261
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Okay.

262
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
It's late.

263
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
You're going to work?

264
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Duan.

265
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Yes.

266
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I'm looking for you.

267
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
You're from the Court of Justice?

268
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Yes.

269
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
We're from Chengxin Court of Justice.

270
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,120
We have something to talk to Boss Duan.

271
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
What's the matter?

272
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Why are you looking for him?

273
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Do you know what we're going to talk to you?

274
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
We're going to talk about everything.

275
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,120
It's not appropriate to go to the company to talk about this, is it?

276
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Duan,

277
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
they're all here for the middle of the night.

278
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
They're looking for him.

279
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Just sit down and talk.

280
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
We're going to talk about

281
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
the matter about the small-scale hair salon.

282
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
You're going to talk about the small-scale hair salon?

283
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
You...

284
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Don't you want to get some tea?

285
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Come inside.

286
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
What tea?

287
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Where are you from?

288
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
What hair salon?

289
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
What's your relationship with our family?

290
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Get out.

291
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Dad, you go back to your room.

292
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Take mom in.

293
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Go, go, go.

294
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Go, go, go.

295
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Okay, let's go.

296
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Let's go.

297
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Don't think like that.

298
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Talk to my mom.

299
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Okay, okay.

300
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
I...

301
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
I...

302
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
I did do something foolish.

303
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
That house...

304
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,120
I did give it to Huai Yourong.

305
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
It's all my fault.

306
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
I was so angry at him.

307
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
But...

308
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
But he can't blame me for everything.

309
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Huai Yourong,

310
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Huai Yourong...

311
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
It's not you.

312
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Don't worry.

313
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
I won't take it back.

314
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
The school's door is locked in the window.

315
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
The school's president is in a corner.

316
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
How can I live?

317
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
I remember it was summer.

318
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
I was in the summer.

319
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
I was wearing a pair of glasses.

320
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
And everyone went to the classroom.

321
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,120
So I called the girl's neighbor.

322
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
I sat there and gave her a pair of glasses.

323
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
You did something for the old woman.

324
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,120
You're also a person who can solve a big problem.

325
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
I was in the classroom.

326
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
I was so happy.

327
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
I was so happy.

328
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
And then...

329
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Can I wear this?

330
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Sure.

331
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
You can wear it.

332
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
We...

333
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
We...

334
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
I was there.

335
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I was in the classroom.

336
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
I was there.

337
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
I asked her which one is the one with the small picture.

338
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
And she said that the one with the small picture is the one with the small picture.

339
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
I said that she liked you.

340
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
And she...

341
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
She came over.

342
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
And you guys went to the classroom.

343
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
We went to the classroom.
