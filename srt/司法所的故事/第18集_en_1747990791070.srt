Episode 1

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You can't even talk to me now?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What's going on?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He's getting old.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He's getting old.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He's not happy.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Bai Lan.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Bai Lan.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why aren't you taking a photo?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Sorry.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Bai Lan.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Bai Lan.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Bai Lan.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hello, Bai Lan.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm waiting for my mom to call.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I thought your mom called.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was waiting for her call.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Have you eaten?

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, I don't want to eat.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Dad, I've reminded you before.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't let my mom spend so much time on video.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She's an adult.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I...

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How can I say?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not telling you to tell her.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm telling you to keep her company.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Where did she tell you to go?

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
She didn't tell me where to go.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
She told me to stay with you.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
She wants to divorce you.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What are you laughing at?

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, I'll say it.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll hang up.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Episode 19

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What time is Shen Lan and Shen Ni's appointment?

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They're about 9 o'clock.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then we'll be there soon.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
When we're stuck here,

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Lu Lu is going to die.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We can't be late.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You said we'd be late.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We have to be on time.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Can't we just save our time?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's convenient for you.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I didn't expect you to be late.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Who's not here today?

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why are there only two cups?

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We're here to discuss with you.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What about Boss?

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We'll discuss it first.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then we'll ask for your understanding.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Today is the first time

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
we've talked to your sister.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We've already gone to Boss's.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What's her opinion?

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She said

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
she was unwell that day.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We didn't stay.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you have something to talk to her,

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
she'll be unwell.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you have nothing to talk to her,

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you can just ask her.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She's more stupid than anyone.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sister is here.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Brother-in-law is here too.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My company is quite busy today.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a budget.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where's my brother-in-law?

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My brother-in-law is here.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
My brother-in-law is here, too.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
My brother-in-law is here, too.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Where's my brother-in-law?

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's here.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hello, Mr. Su.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you back?

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Shen Hao is here already.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He's so unwell.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll wait for you here.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,140
Is a bit scared of her飢

84
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,600
manager

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,360
said that after so long

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,320
pastel

87
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,020
is moreeta

88
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,980
I saw the

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,460
voice Ingucker

90
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,740
被交四

91
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,740
OK

92
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,420
Who do you think he is

93
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,340
I think he's

94
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,460
I say stay in the prison.

95
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,100
Case closed.

96
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,100
This one is Director Fang.

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,860
We were just together in a divorce report,

98
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,620
so we were sent here in a特別 courtesy.

99
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,900
I don't think they want to have a göra donde anymore.

100
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,580
If you want to be open and truly feel free,

101
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,220
make them wish all their dreams come true.

102
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,140
Usually must you say something something.

103
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,100
But I came here

104
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,620
for my mother's sake.

105
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,340
We have to arrange your mom's nightlife.

106
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,340
We only have one purpose today.

107
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,340
We can express our thoughts.

108
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,340
Isn't mom at the interrogation?

109
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,340
We've solved this problem.

110
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,340
What's wrong? What's wrong?

111
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,340
You guys just threw your wife to the interrogation's door.

112
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,340
Have you ever asked for the interrogation's opinion?

113
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,340
Shen Qiu, what's your purpose today?

114
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,340
If you want to give your wife a smile, that's the best.

115
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,340
If you don't have this intention, don't do it.

116
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
I'm asking you.

117
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Have you ever asked for Shen Hao's opinion?

118
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
Please.

119
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,340
You have your own opinion.

120
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,340
When we sent mom to Shen Hao,

121
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,340
he didn't say anything.

122
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,340
We called him, but he didn't answer.

123
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,340
We want to ask for his opinion.

124
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,340
We can't ask for it.

125
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,340
I'll talk about it in front of the Comrade of the Court.

126
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,340
In the past decades, I've been taking care of Mrs. Shen.

127
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,340
But she's always been a part of it.

128
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,340
Shen Hao and Shen Qiu didn't get involved in this.

129
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,340
I don't have any.

130
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,340
Shen Qiu, you want to talk about conscience?

131
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,340
If your wife doesn't want you, you can be a piece of cake.

132
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
I don't have conscience. It's my business.

133
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,340
It's all because of you, your conscience.

134
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,340
You should give your wife a raise.

135
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Your house is still her house, right?

136
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,340
Why did you kick her out of her house?

137
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,340
You're the eldest in the family.

138
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,340
You should give it a try.

139
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,340
You should give your wife a raise.

140
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,340
Come on.

141
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,340
You're not just a beauty.

142
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,340
You're a tourist.

143
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,340
You should take care of your wife.

144
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,340
Qiu, you didn't take care of your wife.

145
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,340
You don't understand the hard work of taking care of your wife.

146
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,340
For example, my mom takes care of me.

147
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,340
My mom takes care of me.

148
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,340
I'm the only one who takes care of my wife.

149
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,340
I'm the only one who takes care of my wife.

150
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,340
Shen Ni, you're the best.

151
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,340
You should have sent her back.

152
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,340
My wife is sick.

153
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,340
She's not like my eldest sister.

154
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,340
Don't talk too much.

155
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,340
I didn't hit you, but I have to be honest.

156
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,340
My eldest sister and my eldest brother should take care of their mom.

157
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
They live in their mom's house.

158
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,340
I didn't live in their house.

159
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,340
What's the word?

160
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,340
A son with a son.

161
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,340
My eldest brother, you should behave well.

162
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,340
I don't care about my own son.

163
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,340
What's the point of my son?

164
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,340
What are you arguing about?

165
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,340
My wife should take care of her.

166
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,340
She's the eldest.

167
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
She's been working for her for many years.

168
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,340
She's too old to do it.

169
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,340
She's too old to do it.

170
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,340
We don't use these old tools.

171
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
We can't avoid the hard work of you.

172
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
That's right.

173
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,340
We can't do it without a lot of tools.

174
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,340
Okay, let's talk about the truth.

175
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:48,340
Is it right for Mrs. Shen and Shen Hao to take care of their mom?

176
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,340
This is also our topic today.

177
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,340
Then your topic today is for me and Shen Mi?

178
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,340
Big sister Shen, big brother Shen, big sister Shen.

179
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,340
You guys are here to debate and argue.

180
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,340
I feel bad for you to be responsible for each other.

181
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:20,340
Have you ever thought that you're not neighbors or colleagues?

182
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,340
You're family.

183
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,340
Even if you're neighbors or colleagues,

184
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,340
they will help each other.

185
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,340
What about you?

186
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,340
Yes.

187
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,340
And what were you discussing just now?

188
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,340
It's your mom.

189
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,340
You're the family of the bones of the snake.

190
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,340
You still have a family in your heart.

191
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,340
Why are they so serious and so ungrateful?

192
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,340
I'm so lucky that I'm not here today.

193
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,340
Otherwise, I would be angry.

194
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
Don't worry.

195
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,340
This is not something that can be solved by one or two times.

196
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,340
If you have another time, please take part in it.

197
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,340
If you have another time, please take part in it.

198
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,340
Where is Chen?

199
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Chen's number is 202.

200
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
Is he on the scene?

201
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,340
Don't you think that he's not in a good mood recently?

202
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,340
No. What do you think?

203
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:42,340
I think that he's been in a good mood recently.

204
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,340
Then he should be in a good mood.

205
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,340
He's that kind of person.

206
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,340
It seems that he's experienced in all these things.

207
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,340
I found out the same thing.

208
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,340
I just wanted to ask him.

209
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Really?

210
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
Then I have to ask him.

211
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
If Chen is so kind, if he really has something to do,

212
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,340
you have to help him.

213
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Yes.

214
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,340
Yang Xinjie, look at this.

215
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,340
You asked him about the leadership.

216
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,340
It's different from what I asked him.

217
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,340
You asked him, he didn't necessarily say it.

218
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
I asked him, he was a friend.

219
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
He was a friend.

220
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,340
He was a friend.

221
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,340
You all are the top of the world.

222
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Okay, I'll talk to him.

223
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
It's not okay.

224
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,340
What are you doing?

225
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,340
I'm looking for someone.

226
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,340
Who are you looking for?

227
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,340
What should I do?

228
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,340
Today you are not looking for me.

229
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,340
You are going home to cook?

230
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
Yes.

231
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
Have a meal with him?

232
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Not necessarily.

233
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
Not necessarily?

234
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,300
What's wrong?

235
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,700
Sister-in-law Bai is ready.

236
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,900
You are on duty.

237
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,300
She's not at home.

238
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,500
She's not at home.

239
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Then...

240
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,300
We'll go to the barbecue.

241
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,900
Okay.

242
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,500
Let's go.

243
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Let's go.

244
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,100
I feel good to bring this friend over.

245
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,700
Write a comment for us.

246
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,860
Brother Han.

247
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
I'm so sorry.

248
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
I'm here.

249
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,460
My dad is here.

250
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,460
I'm here.

251
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,220
Have a look at him.

252
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,060
Brother Han.

253
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,660
Brother Han.

254
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,420
Sister-in-law.

255
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,060
Sister-in-law.

256
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Sister-in-law.

257
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
Sit inside.

258
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,660
Brother, I didn't bother you.

259
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,700
You didn't bother him much.

260
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,820
Come on.

261
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,100
Who's talking?

262
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,260
Just give him a smile.

263
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,300
Sit inside.

264
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,820
Sit here.

265
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,300
Okay.

266
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
Sit here.

267
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,460
Okay.

268
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,300
My parents especially like to be obedient.

269
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,700
Yes, one day and three times.

270
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,580
They said after the good guy came,

271
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,260
they were trying to stop them.

272
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Yes.

273
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
I'll get you some wine.

274
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Stop inside.

275
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Stop inside.

276
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,780
Today is your first time here.

277
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,540
I'm inviting you.

278
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
Don't be like this.

279
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,980
We are still the A.A. leaders.

280
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,540
Next time, we will be in the A.A.

281
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,780
Tomorrow is Saturday.

282
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,300
We can have two drinks.

283
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,100
Okay.

284
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,700
Come on.

285
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,500
Come inside.

286
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,100
Sit inside.

287
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,620
Sit inside.

288
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,820
Every day, you have a good mood.

289
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
Cheers.

290
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,140
You are back.

291
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,140
Why are you still not asleep?

292
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,940
I'm waiting for you.

293
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
I'm tired.

294
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,340
Can you come back early?

295
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,740
Take your mom to work.

296
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,540
Okay.

297
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,740
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,340
Chen, don't worry.

299
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,740
I'll do the job for you.

300
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
I'll do it.

301
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,340
Come on.

302
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,340
You are so lucky.

303
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,740
You...

304
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,340
You...

305
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,940
You didn't finish your job.

306
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,540
You are here to take care of my heart.

307
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
You...

308
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,740
You don't even have to mention the milk.

309
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,140
You...

310
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,940
You are so hard-working.

311
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,740
No.

312
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,940
It's not that thinking problem.

313
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Let me tell you.

314
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,140
Unless...

315
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,140
I don't do this job now.

316
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,940
But how is that possible?

317
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,540
How can I...

318
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,740
I can't do the job I'm doing now?

319
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,740
You...

320
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,340
You are so low-witted.

321
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,940
How can you send me the news of Bai Lan's wife?

322
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
Let me see.

323
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Let me see how you send it.

324
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Let me see.

325
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,340
Let me see.

326
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Let me see.

327
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Where is it?

328
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,540
Here.

329
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
Why are you laughing?

330
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,140
Why are you laughing?

331
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,940
Why are you laughing?

332
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Why are you laughing?

333
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,140
You just send it like this.

334
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,940
Really?

335
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,940
I... I... I'll save you.

336
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,340
You are so good.

337
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,740
I've never seen you so good.

338
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,140
Let me blow it for you.

339
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,540
Go ahead.

340
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,540
I'll save you.

341
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
This...

342
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,740
This...

343
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,940
Why is it so loud?

344
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
You have to blow it.

345
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,740
It's...

346
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,540
I can do it too.

347
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,940
You are so good.

348
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,540
You are blowing it out.

349
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,940
Every case has its own story.

350
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,340
There are also the stories of the real person.

351
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,140
For example, the mountain goat.

352
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,340
It has a mountain goat.

353
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,140
There are mountain goats.

354
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,140
If you don't follow the law,

355
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,540
you have to go to the mountain goat's parents.

356
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,740
You can't go to the mountain goat's parents.

357
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,140
Right?

358
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
You have to go to the mountain goat's parents.

359
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,340
But there is a reason.

360
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,740
The mountain goat is so good.

361
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,740
It can express two stories.

362
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,340
I can't just blow it out.

363
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,340
I have to go to the mountain goat's parents.

364
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,340
For the mother's car.

365
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,140
Oh.

366
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,140
For the mother's car.

367
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,540
Starry sky, starry sky.

368
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,140
Starry sky, starry sky.

369
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Starry sky.

370
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Starry sky.

371
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,140
Oh.

372
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,340
Starry sky.

373
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
Starry sky.

374
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,540
