00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
Punishing Pabouts

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,920
Hello.

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,200
She is a good friend of Ma Lei.

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,120
Her name is Liu Bing.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,600
You two can have a good talk.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,360
I have something to do.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,920
I'll leave first.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,400
You can talk.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,200
Thank you, Teacher.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,160
Don't ask me about Ma Lei's matter.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,440
She doesn't want others to know about her family.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,760
So I won't tell you anything.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,960
You are Ma Lei's good friend.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
You should hope she lives happily.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Of course.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,560
Our department is very busy.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,760
We can't talk about it.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,400
Of course.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,720
Our purpose is the same.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,240
We all want to help her.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,080
If she is in trouble now,

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,960
and she is in a big mental burden,

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,200
then shouldn't we help her

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
to relieve this pressure?

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Okay.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,880
I tell you.

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
You should be careful.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,280
Don't worry about that.

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,400
We won't tell her

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,480
that you told us.

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,600
Ma Lei hates her father very much.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,120
Because he always beats her

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,720
because of a little thing.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,840
He beats her mother.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,280
And he beats her very hard.

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,720
When Ma Lei beat her mother,

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,200
he was so mad.

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
So he must go to college.

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,000
He must go to an outside college.

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,080
This way, he can take his mother away.

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,920
He will always leave his father.

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,200
Ma Lei is here.

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,480
I won't tell you.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,840
I think Wu Yin should divorce.

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,520
Even if he has to do this for Ma Lei,

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,720
I think so too.

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,240
So we have to help him

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,360
to overcome this.

49
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,880
Look.

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
When he was with his classmates,

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,880
he looked like a young girl.

52
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,560
When we are not busy,

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,160
we will go to play football with him

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,560
and make friends.

55
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,960
We will also go on a trip.

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,480
When are we not busy?

57
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,080
I told you.

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,880
Time is like the sea.

59
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,400
Hello, Ma.

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,920
What's up?

61
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,760
I am busy.

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,240
You are like Liu An.

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,960
I want to introduce you to the emperor.

64
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Don't bother him.

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,240
Don't bother me.

66
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,120
What?

67
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,960
I haven't finished my words.

68
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,400
I have promised to meet him.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,240
Then you go to meet him.

70
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,680
How can I talk to you?

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,720
I am not good for you.

72
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,080
Shen Hao,

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,880
no matter which side you are from,

74
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,800
the conditions are good.

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,320
I have already met you

76
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,680
at night.

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,240
I am not far from the office.

78
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
I am not in the office.

79
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,960
Which store did you find?

80
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,840
I will send you the location immediately.

81
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,760
You can go to work at the moment.

82
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,080
From now on,

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,720
you don't need to pick up the phone.

84
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,560
Did you hear me?

85
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,400
No.

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,160
Did you hear me?

87
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,600
What do you mean?

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,360
According to my experience,

89
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,680
I will never be with the elder.

90
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,640
I will let you go to the blind date.

91
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,480
You can decide if you want to fight or not.

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,520
If I really want to fight,

93
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,080
you won't be worried at all.

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,320
I still have confidence.

95
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,120
Then do you want to...

96
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,080
No.

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,320
I...

98
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,360
It's not appropriate.

99
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,480
Why not?

100
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,640
We should be friends.

101
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,520
And I don't want to go there myself.

102
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,360
Then I will let the elder accompany me.

103
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,840
Okay, that's fine.

104
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,080
Okay.

105
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,600
Okay.

106
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,680
Hello.

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,560
The number you are calling is...

108
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,400
Xiaofan.

109
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
Xiaofan.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,240
Boss, you want to see me?

111
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
What is that Huai Xiaorong doing?

112
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,760
I don't know what he is doing.

113
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,320
He asked the private police to go to my house.

114
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Why is he going to lock me up?

115
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
I don't know.

116
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,720
What is that private police doing?

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know.

118
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,960
Well.

119
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,000
How can I ask you?

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
You don't know anything.

121
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,000
Didn't you know everything before?

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,360
Why don't you know it now?

123
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,520
I...

124
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
I guessed it before.

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
You guessed it?

126
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,320
Hurry up.

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Let me introduce you.

128
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,320
I need to introduce you.

129
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,520
Aren't you from the private police?

130
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,760
I still need to introduce you.

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
This is our private police.

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,520
Fang Nansin, the chief of the group.

133
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,920
Okay, okay.

134
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,520
The chief of the group has moved out.

135
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Please sit down.

136
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,720
Xiaofan, have some tea.

137
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,720
No need.

138
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,120
We'll leave in a minute.

139
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,120
Go.

140
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
Just say it if you have something to say.

141
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm not a person now.

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,320
Mr. Duan, don't be so formal.

143
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,520
I heard you asked your subordinate

144
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,320
what is our private police doing.

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
I can answer your question first.

146
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,480
When you understand our position in the private police,

147
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,080
maybe in your future work,

148
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,080
you will need us to provide the right opinion.

149
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,480
Fang Nansin,

150
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
this is so interesting.

151
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,480
He pushed everything to his wife.

152
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,480
He said that the front door is his wife's.

153
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,680
Why didn't he say that

154
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,280
he was his wife before?

155
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,280
I don't want him.

156
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm just afraid.

157
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Didn't he say that

158
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,040
he agreed to our decision as long as his wife agrees?

159
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,840
He didn't agree.

160
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
I'll listen to you.

161
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,440
I got in the car today.

162
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,440
One more.

163
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,440
No need, Nanyin.

164
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
I'm going back to the dorm.

165
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Back to the dorm?

166
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,440
What for?

167
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,840
I have an appointment with Chen.

168
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,680
What good thing?

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,840
You don't want to take me?

170
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,440
Well, well, well.

171
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,080
This matter.

172
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,840
This matter.

173
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
I really can't take you.

174
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,640
Well, I'll let Bebe tell you tomorrow.

175
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Let's go.

176
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,000
What? What's going on?

177
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,400
You'll know tomorrow.

178
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,200
Chen.

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,000
Can I wear this?

180
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,600
You're not my blind date.

181
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,200
What are you looking at?

182
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Well, my wife.

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,320
She said she has something to do.

184
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
She won't come with us.

185
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,960
Don't.

186
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
I'll call her.

187
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
Don't. Don't.

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,360
She said she has something to do.

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,200
She must have something to do.

190
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,960
Let's go.

191
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,360
No.

192
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,160
Just the two of us.

193
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,560
Okay.

194
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,160
You want us to be the electric bulb, right?

195
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,960
Yes.

196
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,760
No wonder you asked Bai Lan to come.

197
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,960
You want to have more electric bulbs in front of her, right?

198
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,560
This is Bebe's idea.

199
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,160
Okay.

200
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
I know.

201
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,560
You probably know my situation.

202
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm from the computer industry.

203
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
He's right here.

204
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
He works in the computer industry.

205
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,720
This environment is good.

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
It's elegant.

207
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
The manager.

208
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,120
Bebe.

209
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Bebe is here.

210
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,720
Let's go with Bebe.

211
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Is this suitable?

212
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
This is so suitable.

213
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
These two are my colleagues.

214
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
This is the Italian bakery.

215
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,120
Let's eat at your house.

216
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
We eat together.

217
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,520
We are A's.

218
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,320
It's okay.

219
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,120
I'll do it.

220
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,520
I'll do it.

221
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
It's okay.

222
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
It's okay.

223
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,320
PI, Mongt, IGP.

224
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,920
Really.

225
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Yes.

226
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,160
K-star fruit.

227
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
K-star fruit.

228
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm not good at making cakes.

229
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,120
You order it.

230
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
I'll do it like her.

231
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
You're not...

232
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Introducing him?

233
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
He...

234
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
He...

235
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Yes.

236
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
He's called He Bebe.

237
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I'll introduce him to you.

238
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I know the situation of Bebe.

239
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Okay.

240
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
So fast.

241
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
What's Bebe?

242
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,720
You just called me Bebe.

243
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Yes.

244
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
You said he's the boss.

245
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
He's the boss.

246
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
He's the boss.

247
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
I'm not.

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,040
Yes.

249
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
You said he's He Bebe.

250
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,240
We usually call him He Bebe.

251
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,720
Right?

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,480
He Bebe.

253
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,280
Okay.

254
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,920
Don't judge.

255
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,240
He's like this.

256
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Just try it.

257
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,720
What's the topic today?

258
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,840
Chen.

259
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,320
I'm asking you.

260
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,640
Look at the color of my hand.

261
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,240
It's more fresh.

262
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,640
I know.

263
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,560
Fresh?

264
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Fresh.

265
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
You're...

266
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
My name is Shen Hao.

267
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Shen Hao.

268
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Shen.

269
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,400
Shen.

270
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,160
Since you're close to Bebe,

271
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,600
we should know each other.

272
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Right?

273
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,240
Yes.

274
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
That's right.

275
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
You seem to be curious about me.

276
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,640
What do you want to know?

277
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
We want to know everything.

278
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
You're close to Bebe.

279
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
He Bebe.

280
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
He Bebe.

281
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,960
He Bebe.

282
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Okay.

283
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,960
You're close to He Bebe.

284
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,640
We'll investigate you.

285
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
You should report to the family.

286
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,760
My name is Shen Hao.

287
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,640
I'm 32 years old.

288
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,840
I'm from a small company

289
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
with a large-scale business.

290
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,040
I own 130 houses.

291
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,240
I own a car.

292
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,640
I think I'm a good match for Bebe.

293
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,640
Good.

294
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
Good.

295
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Good.

296
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Chao.

297
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
You're under pressure.

298
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
Who?

299
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Pick up the phone.

300
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Chao.

301
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Don't be too much.

302
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,040
It's too obvious.

303
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,840
Don't look at me.

304
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,240
You're too much.

305
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
How can I be?

306
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Don't be too much.

307
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Shen Hao.

308
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,640
I'm your sister Shen Lan.

309
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Hello?

310
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Hello?

311
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,240
Talk to me.

312
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,640
I'm just calling you.

313
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,840
I have something to tell you.

314
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,640
What do you mean?

315
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Tell me.

316
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,240
I'm in a bad mood.

317
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Mrs. Chen has been living here for three months.

318
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,840
She was supposed to be in charge of the house this month.

319
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,240
But her husband said

320
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,840
they're going to the door this month.

321
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,240
She's not going to let Mrs. Chen live.

322
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Shen Ni is also a good match for her.

323
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
What should I do?

324
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,040
I think you're the only one who's single now.

325
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,240
How about she stay with you?

326
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,040
Want to see me?

327
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,840
Yes.

328
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,640
Let's talk.

329
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Make the call.

330
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,040
Hello.

331
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,920
Deciphering there are so many proposals that he still has to save more money USSR,

332
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,280
trailing a half Ho Be Olympic people.

333
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,120
The songs that he separately composed in the privateざ鹑的 3448筒,

334
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,200
I will not abandon him and stay at版 ấyg.

335
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,240
It's right.

336
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,360
He's the one who's talking about class.( flame다ash competition China stage 6),

337
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,000
Nagedog and Lying Soy wondered whether his family members...

338
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,840
want to southwest them?

339
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
I'm responsible for it.

340
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,360
What are you writing?

341
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,160
I'm just

342
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,560
imagining things for your uncle.

343
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,400
If you don't call me father,

344
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,000
your uncle won't let you get a divorce.

345
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,680
Your mom is just like that.

346
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,120
Everything is out.

347
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,600
We can't solve it.

348
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,720
How?

349
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
How can we solve it?

350
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,200
We can pay for it.

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Do we have the strength to pay for it?

352
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
How much is it?

353
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,560
He said he owed 200,000 yuan.

354
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,880
It's just we didn't

355
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
end up together.

356
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,160
You're divorced.

357
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:58,060
That's

358
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
Who is she?

359
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
What are you doing?

360
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,060
Come here, Jiajia.

361
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,060
Do you want to wash?

362
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
What are you doing? It's nothing.

363
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,060
We are family.

364
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Since we know each other today,

365
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,060
we can help you to solve the problem.

366
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,060
We can help you to solve it.

367
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,060
That's right.

368
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
We can't be together.

369
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,060
Right, Beibei?

370
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
Which four-way station are you from?

371
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060
We are from Chengxin.

372
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
We are next to the beautiful Starry Sky.

373
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,060
We are neighbors.

374
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,060
I live in the beautiful Starry Sky.

375
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
Really?

376
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
Yes.

377
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,060
We are neighbors.

378
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,060
I have never seen you before.

379
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,060
I moved here for half a month.

380
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
How many houses do you live in?

381
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
Six.

382
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Six houses?

383
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,060
The room is more than 100 square meters.

384
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,060
130 square meters.

385
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,060
In the future,

386
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,060
you will be in trouble.

387
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,060
Don't be polite.

388
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,060
Don't be polite.

389
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
Just take care of me.

390
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,060
You are a big-bag.

391
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,060
Maybe something is bothering you.

392
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Okay.

393
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
It's okay.

394
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Which one?

395
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
Eight.

396
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,060
Why do you live here?

397
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,060
I am not safe here.

398
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
You live in this house,

399
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,300
and you don't have any money to offer.

400
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,060
I live here mainly.

401
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,460
identity.

402
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,060
Skills.

403
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,900
to keep themselves safe.

404
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,900
Friend?

405
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,300
Save myself.

406
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,560
Up to this moment,

407
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,080
You don't have money to pay the debt here.

408
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,680
You're talking like you're in debt.

409
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,680
You have such a high-end small group of money,

410
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
I don't need to worry about you anymore.

411
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,480
What are you doing?

412
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,720
I'm borrowing from other people's prices.

413
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm not hiding from those debts.

414
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,400
Tell me the truth.

415
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,360
How much do you owe?

416
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,240
20 yuan.

417
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,520
How about interest?

418
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,680
10 yuan.

419
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,640
10 yuan?

420
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,520
I'm going.

421
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm going.

422
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,920
What are you doing here?

423
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,520
I'm going to make you a soup.

424
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,080
Who?

425
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,200
What are you doing down there?

426
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,400
Go back first. I'll go upstairs.

427
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,480
Let's go.

428
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,160
Wait.

429
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,720
Stop.

430
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,200
Hey.

431
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,040
Brother.

432
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,840
My girlfriend is here.

433
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,040
Don't worry about her.

434
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,560
Brother.

435
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,000
You bought my uncle's money.

436
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,200
You bought a house, right?

437
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,320
Where is the house?

438
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,240
Take me there.

439
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,480
I told you.

440
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,200
That's the kitchen.

441
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,080
I can't see it now.

442
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,720
The kitchen?

443
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,800
There's a樓 table.

444
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,880
Take me to the living room.

445
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,680
No.

446
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,320
I'm going first.

447
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,960
You and your brother.

448
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,440
Let's go.

449
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,760
Wait.

450
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,320
You didn't answer the phone.

451
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,040
Go to your brother's house.

452
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,440
Brother.

453
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,160
You're going to eat me.

454
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,200
Go away.

455
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,880
I don't care about you.

456
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,480
What do you mean?

457
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,280
I don't care about you.

458
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,840
Brother.

459
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,080
Then you can't ignore me.

460
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
In reality,

461
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,600
there's a common problem.

462
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,360
There's a common problem.

463
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,120
You have to go through this.

464
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,080
One thing is the same.

465
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,440
You have to go through this.

466
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,800
Who can you listen to?

467
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,000
This is a common problem.

468
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,960
It's all in the morning.

469
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,320
It's better to be in the morning.

470
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,520
People are better.

471
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,040
Then you have to work.

472
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,880
Then he accepts you.

473
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,680
He's not a big deal to you.

474
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,320
He's not a big deal to you.

475
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,920
Hello, brother.

476
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,760
That means

477
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,240
the phone is always ringing.

478
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,800
Yes.

479
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,320
A phone is always ringing.

480
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,440
The machine is going to use the phone.

481
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,800
The phone is not ringing.

482
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,200
It doesn't know what to do for anyone.

483
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,480
But it's on the phone.

484
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,680
Then it's on the back.

485
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,320
Then it knows.

486
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,440
Then it's on the phone.

487
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,600
Then it becomes a world.

488
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,640
It's not a melody.

489
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,920
Yes.

490
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,800
I press it again.

491
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,200
Yes.

492
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,240
Because it's too hasty.

493
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,440
We don't have time to do things we don't want.

494
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,120
So I keep mixing with myself.

495
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,560
It's a process of self-mixing.
