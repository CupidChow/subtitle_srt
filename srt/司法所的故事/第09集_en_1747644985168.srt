1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,920
The boss looks so uncomfortable

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,200
at that moment

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,280
He can work hard

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,680
to earn money

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,200
and buy me a diamond ring

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,080
He won't break his promise

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,760
Chen

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,480
Next time you meet Liang Yan

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,600
and Zhou Hang

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,640
you should go to

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,360
an experienced person like us

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,400
to make adjustments

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,640
He Beibei

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,800
is inexperienced

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,640
You are experienced

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,600
I think you are not experienced

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,200
but have a sense of crisis

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,000
What sense of crisis do I have?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,520
You are afraid that you will have more contact with such cases

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,560
which will hurt Beibei's confidence in love

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,200
Right?

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,640
Don't worry

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,280
It's just an example

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,560
The beauty of the world can be seen anywhere

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,640
We just

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,920
decide that

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
we will have more contact with such things

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,160
because of our work nature

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,440
You just want to be nice to Beibei

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
Why do you think so much?

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,440
Of course I am nice to her

33
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,120
If I promise to be nice to her

34
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,560
it will last forever

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,840
That's good

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,320
Today

37
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,760
we meet another

38
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,920
unpleasant person

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,760
Who?

40
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,080
The boyfriend of

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
Hua Xiaorong from Xiaorong's hair salon

42
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Duan

43
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,760
is a rich man

44
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,840
How do you know?

45
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,200
He made a scene at the hair salon

46
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
Beibei and I saw it

47
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,200
What did you say?

48
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,680
Nothing

49
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,320
Nothing

50
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,040
Nothing

51
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,400
You two talk

52
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,320
I am off work

53
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,880
Bye

54
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,600
Bye

55
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,560
What is this?

56
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,360
What is this?

57
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,560
Nothing

58
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,200
I will go to the park with you today

59
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,440
to see aunt

60
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,960
You don't need to pick me up today

61
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,440
No need

62
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,280
My parents will pick me up

63
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,000
Great

64
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Let's buy some fruit

65
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,360
and bring it to them

66
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,360
She can't eat this

67
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,480
It's okay to make it a new year

68
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,400
She can eat it

69
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,720
Right

70
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,520
I will go to buy it

71
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,960
Hello, aunt

72
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,920
I have no time

73
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,120
to pick up Tongtong today

74
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
How do you know

75
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,440
I want you to pick up Tongtong?

76
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,560
You call me at this time

77
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,720
What else can I do

78
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,320
except picking her up?

79
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,320
I really want you to pick up Tongtong

80
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,000
Your dad's old comrade-in-arms

81
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,040
came from the United States

82
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,320
and invited us to dinner

83
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,840
They are far away

84
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
We don't refuse, right?

85
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,960
No, it's so close to home

86
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,240
Can't you send Tongtong home first

87
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,200
and then go there?

88
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,880
The place to eat is far away

89
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,960
If we don't go

90
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,560
we will block the road

91
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,360
Okay, bye

92
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
Mom

93
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't eat it today

94
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,600
I heard you

95
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,960
It's okay

96
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm happy

97
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,480
to hear your blessing

98
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,600
Okay

99
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Aunt, go home

100
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,480
You cook

101
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,720
I'll take you back

102
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,400
No, no, no

103
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Don't be polite

104
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Thank you, thank you

105
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,160
No, no, thank you

106
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,240
Okay, then

107
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,640
call me if you need help

108
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
Uncle, where are you coming back from?

109
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,480
What are you doing?

110
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,840
I'll take you to the box

111
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
No need, I have my own way

112
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,240
I have my own way

113
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,320
Then be careful

114
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,760
Uncle, what are you carrying?

115
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,240
Do you need help?

116
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,000
No, no, no

117
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,920
It's okay, don't be shy

118
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,640
No, no, no

119
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,080
Dapeng

120
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,720
Come on

121
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,000
Brother Chen

122
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,160
I went to Xiaorong Lihua Store

123
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,920
for something

124
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,480
This is the food I bought

125
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,960
Please help me take it to my house

126
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,360
Come on

127
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,240
Okay, this is the key to my house

128
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
Bai Lan is not at home today

129
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,720
Give me the key later

130
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,360
Okay?

131
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,680
OK, leave it to me, no problem

132
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,680
You are busy

133
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,160
Busy

134
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,760
Okay, okay

135
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm leaving

136
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,960
You said Xiaorong Lihua's ex-husband

137
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,040
How did he know?

138
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,080
How did he find your sister-in-law?

139
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,440
Boss

140
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,120
Every time you go to find Xiaorong Lihua

141
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,560
you don't avoid this

142
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,400
When her ex-husband saw you

143
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,040
and followed you

144
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
he knew everything

145
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,640
How did he know?

146
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,480
How did he know

147
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,240
I transferred the house to Xiaorong Lihua?

148
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
It's very likely

149
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
that he told her ex-husband himself

150
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,520
No way

151
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,400
He

152
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,200
He did it

153
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,560
to make trouble for himself

154
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,200
It's trouble for you

155
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
Maybe it's a good thing for him

156
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,120
What do you mean?

157
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
He might

158
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,960
know that you have a wife

159
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,600
from his ex-husband

160
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,440
So he told her ex-husband

161
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,120
about the house

162
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,760
Why did he do that?

163
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,560
This

164
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,240
It's obvious

165
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,200
He found out that you lied to him

166
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
You have a wife

167
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,880
He wanted to marry you

168
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
Boss, think about it

169
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,760
If the boss and the boss are not noisy

170
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,320
and your family is peaceful

171
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,920
you will definitely not divorce your wife

172
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,800
Then he will be in a relationship with you

173
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,000
and have a good time

174
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,280
Dad, I'm back

175
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,640
I know you are back

176
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,200
Dad

177
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,560
I have to pay

178
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,760
the tuition fee tomorrow

179
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,840
Where is the money I gave you yesterday?

180
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,640
Well

181
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,480
I applied for an art class

182
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:54,920
Yes

183
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,640
Yes

184
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
Let's go

185
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,400
What the hell?

186
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,360
Are you crying?

187
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,440
Do you want to tell our kids?

188
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
You try to drink more

189
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:17,960
moneday

190
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,760
give us the money back

191
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,420
No

192
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,000
What do you want from us?

193
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,840
It's illegal to beat people, you know?

194
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,880
I beat my son, so what?

195
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,200
It's not fair to beat anyone.

196
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,240
Get him back.

197
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,280
He's a lunatic.

198
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
He's a bad guy.

199
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,480
He beats his wife and his child

200
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,240
for hours.

201
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,040
Everyone has tried to persuade him.

202
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,440
But the more he tried, the more he beat him.

203
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
It's too much.

204
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,080
He's a bad guy.

205
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,320
How can he

206
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,760
beat such a good girl?

207
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,280
It's a family matter.

208
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,640
We can't say more.

209
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,920
His wife and son are so poor.

210
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,320
Hello, Mr. Chen.

211
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
Hello, you're exercising?

212
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,640
Go out.

213
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,240
Sit here and rest.

214
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,440
Good girl.

215
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,480
Fighting.

216
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,520
Dan Peng.

217
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,440
What's up?

218
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
remedies.

219
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,400
Nothing is happening.

220
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,160
I don't know about this.

221
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,960
Why did you come here for?

222
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
What's embarrassing?

223
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,880
It's just...

224
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,960
It's just that I think...

225
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
I think my mom's boyfriend is not a good person.

226
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,840
Let me explain it to you.

227
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,480
I want to be quiet.

228
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,800
No, today they...

229
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,400
She...

230
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,560
You should go home and explain it.

231
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,960
I don't need you to explain it here.

232
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,760
Xiaorou,

233
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
what are you doing?

234
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800
Even if she's a criminal,

235
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,880
even if she's a criminal,

236
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,400
she still has a chance to appeal.

237
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,560
You should give me a chance.

238
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,680
You told me you were single.

239
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,920
You told me your wife was sick.

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,520
Then who came to the door today?

241
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,400
Is it a ghost?

242
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,200
You have a family.

243
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
You have a wife.

244
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,480
You should go home.

245
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,400
Let's not see each other again.

246
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,080
Xiaorou,

247
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,760
no,

248
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,400
am I not good to you?

249
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,040
I...

250
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
I sent you to the noodle house

251
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,840
and took care of you.

252
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
You can't break up with me just like that.

253
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,160
What else can I do?

254
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,600
Our relationship

255
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,280
is only one way.

256
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,160
That is to break up.

257
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,360
Hua Xiaorou,

258
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,480
you knew I had a wife long ago, right?

259
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,840
Did you arrange

260
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,720
this trouble today?

261
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
I have nothing to say to you.

262
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,320
Get out. Get out.

263
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
Get out. Get out.

264
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,080
All right, Hua Xiaorou,

265
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,320
I'll tell you.

266
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,920
Breaking up is fine,

267
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,720
but the way to get married

268
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,960
must be changed.

269
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,760
I'm sorry.

270
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,560
I'm sorry.

271
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,360
Xiaodong,

272
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,640
what you told me

273
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,840
is just your speculation.

274
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,160
Then,

275
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,120
don't mention it

276
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,560
to others, okay?

277
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,680
Will you help me investigate?

278
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,480
Have you ever thought about

279
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,440
whether it's because you don't like Sun Ming

280
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,560
that you don't like him?

281
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,640
That is to say,

282
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,280
you won't help me investigate.

283
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,680
Let me think about it, okay?

284
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,800
Xiaodong?

285
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,520
Why don't you go home?

286
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
I bought you two some food.

287
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,960
Go home now.

288
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
He is Sun Ming?

289
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,080
Think for your mother.

290
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,600
Don't make the relationship too hard.

291
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Your mother will be embarrassed.

292
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,520
Go back. I'm leaving.

293
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,080
Take care.

294
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,240
petty ;)

295
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
I made breakfast for you.

296
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,800
Try it.

297
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,320
Me?

298
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,000
Look.

299
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,120
It's yours.

300
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,080
You made it?

301
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,040
Really?

302
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,440
You can make breakfast?

303
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Of course.

304
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,920
I make breakfast for my brother every day.

305
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,840
I made too much today.

306
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,600
You don't like it.

307
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,880
Where's the toilet?

308
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,920
I just went in.

309
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,920
Okay.

310
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,640
Lin Xing.

311
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,320
Try my breakfast.

312
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,920
You're so good at it.

313
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,720
Look.

314
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,400
You...

315
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,120
Hello, Chen Xing, Sivaso.

316
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Hua Xiaorong, right?

317
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,240
Why don't you come here

318
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,360
and tell us the situation now?

319
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,800
You can do it now. We're all here.

320
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,480
Okay, bye.

321
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,520
What's wrong?

322
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,560
I met Hua Xiaorong at Xiaorong's place.

323
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,840
Chen and I passed by from her place the other day.

324
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,480
We saw her ex-husband

325
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,880
and they were having a fight.

326
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,320
This type of thing

327
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,320
I had picked it up

328
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,160
They made a mess again

329
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,800
Please call Old Chen in

330
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,640
to ask him

331
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,240
Ok

332
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,480
Old Chen

333
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,960
Fang Suo is looking for you

334
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
He wants the stuff from Mr. Qiao's prop dolls

335
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,120
I'll be right over

336
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,040
Beibei

337
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,880
Why not

338
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,800
I have something to do.

339
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
I have to go to Fang Suo

340
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,600
to ask about Hua Xiaorong.

341
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,200
Mr. Tang.

342
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,640
I'm more familiar with Hua Xiaorong than you.

343
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,880
I'll go with Chen.

344
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,640
Come on.

345
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,200
Hua Xiaorong.

346
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,160
When are you more familiar than me?

347
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,080
I'm in a hurry.

348
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,920
Help me to clean up.

349
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,640
Thank you.

350
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,280
I'm leaving.

351
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,640
The documents.

352
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,480
Fang Suo, what's up?

353
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,480
Mr. Sheng.

354
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,520
Sister,

355
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,280
you want the documents?

356
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,240
What's up?

357
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,080
Hua Xiaorong called

358
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,240
and said she was in trouble.

359
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
She knows her ex-husband wants money from her again.

360
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,240
It's not that simple.

361
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,480
Tell me.

362
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,120
Let's get rid of her ex-husband first.

363
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,600
Hua Xiaorong

364
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,280
is the third one

365
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,080
who did it

366
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,760
when she didn't know.

367
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,000
My daughter has been at home

368
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,520
for a long time.

369
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,600
She didn't dare to do it.

370
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,360
Because of this,

371
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,160
I was divorced,

372
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,480
or I lost my child,

373
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,720
or I lost my parents.

374
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,480
I can bear it.

375
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,520
If you really get beaten up,

376
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,560
I'll tell you first

377
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,320
to collect some evidence.

378
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,800
Even if I don't do that now,

379
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,720
you have to

380
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,640
keep your evidence.

381
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,480
Whether you want to

382
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,280
make it better,

383
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,080
or you want to sue for divorce,

384
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,480
or you want to

385
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,080
cut off the relationship,

386
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
it's all a

387
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,720
proof of protection.

388
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,880
Now, if it's such a platform,

389
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,080
we don't have a platform.

390
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,280
There is no platform.

391
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,960
A platform is very upright.

392
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,480
Yes.

393
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,080
Very upright and upright.

394
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,880
There are two Chinese laws below.

395
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,640
There are four people sitting on it.

396
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,480
There is nothing behind it.

397
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Then we can have

398
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,880
the history of the law firm above.

399
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,680
Yes.

400
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,880
Then we can make a green house

401
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
and make a car.

402
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,680
That's okay.

403
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,200
Right?

404
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,680
Yes.
