00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
The First Episode

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,040
The First Episode

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,720
In the past decades,

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,800
Shen Ni and I took care of

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,320
Mrs. Chen's care.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,600
Shen Hao and Shen Qiu

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,320
didn't get to see this.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,880
I have a duty.

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,000
You're all back today.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,880
Should I ask your dad

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,000
to come over and have a meal?

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,720
No.

13
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,320
Look, I told you.

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,520
I can't

15
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,480
persuade my mom

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,400
to come with us.

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,680
I just don't understand.

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,880
Maybe it's

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,080
my dad's charm to my mom.

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
If it's your mom,

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,160
it's not a problem to not go home.

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
Are you that busy?

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,400
Who knows?

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,400
I've been a Fang's daughter for seven years.

25
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,720
I've seen your dad's number.

26
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,440
I can count on him.

27
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,400
I'll count on you.

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,600
Do you think he will

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,720
come over?

30
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,920
I can't ask

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,320
if he doesn't mention this tea.

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Don't ask.

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,560
He didn't mention divorce.

34
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,960
He just doesn't go home.

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,360
That's enough.

36
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,960
My mom

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,920
can find a husband

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
to take care of her.

39
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,560
Look, he's so stubborn.

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,840
He's so innocent.

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
My mom can only

42
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,920
live alone.

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,560
But mom's personality

44
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,960
is different.

45
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,600
She needs to find a husband

46
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,560
to be with her husband.

47
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,040
So we still have to

48
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,520
bring her here

49
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
to live with us.

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,240
I have an idea.

51
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,560
What?

52
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
You said you were pregnant

53
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
and asked her to come with you.

54
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

55
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,560
My mom knows I'm pregnant

56
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,800
and she's gone with me.

57
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,640
She'll meet your mom.

58
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,200
Your mom knows

59
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,240
I'm not pregnant.

60
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,600
That's not a big deal.

61
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
You're so naive.

62
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
What are you thinking about?

63
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,000
Think about other people's problems.

64
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,320
Anyway,

65
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,000
I can't think of any other way.

66
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,760
Why don't you go find your dad

67
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,280
and let him come home often?

68
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,360
It's no use.

69
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,040
Besides,

70
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,200
I don't want to see him.

71
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,200
Look at you.

72
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,040
You're so close to other people's problems.

73
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,240
You're so close to our family.

74
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,680
Okay, okay.

75
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
Don't mention it.

76
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
A bunch of people

77
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,600
are waiting for me at work.

78
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,680
Hello, Fei Fei.

79
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Have you contacted

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,000
the people in their house?

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes, I have.

82
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,360
I'll bring you over.

83
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,920
Okay.

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Han Chong,

85
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,520
you and the people in their house

86
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
must keep in touch.

87
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
If you're in a hurry,

88
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,040
let them have a heart-to-heart conversation.

89
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,520
Okay?

90
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,360
Don't worry.

91
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,480
Here, here.

92
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,200
Here, here.

93
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Please.

94
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,640
Come on.

95
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,200
Come on.

96
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,920
Come on.

97
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,480
Come on.

98
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,200
Come on.

99
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,840
Come on.

100
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,480
Come on.

101
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,240
Come on.

102
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,800
You...

103
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,560
Let's go.

104
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,480
Please have a seat.

105
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,120
I invited you here this year

106
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
to solve your mother's

107
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,880
late-year life of your mother.

108
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,120
What do you think?

109
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,880
I hope

110
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,960
you don't just want to

111
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,240
think about it.

112
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,440
It's the attitude

113
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,600
you're in charge of.

114
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,840
You have to make your decision.

115
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,880
Besides,

116
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,440
if we continue to do this,

117
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,040
it'll be a good thing

118
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,440
for your health

119
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,400
and your work life.

120
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,040
Right?

121
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,320
Before today,

122
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,240
our colleagues

123
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,040
have already

124
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,960
reached your home.

125
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,680
I think

126
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
you should think it over.

127
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then, let's talk about it.

128
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,520
Yes.

129
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,120
Let's talk.

130
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,440
I'll say two words first.

131
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,200
Today,

132
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,040
we're the children of our ancestors.

133
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,480
We should understand.

134
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,640
We can't avoid any of them.

135
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,320
Your mother

136
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
raised you

137
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
and you two.

138
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,880
Now, she's old.

139
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,360
She can't do it anymore.

140
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,640
She doesn't use any value.

141
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,400
If you're old,

142
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,080
they'll be like you now

143
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,400
and don't care about their parents.

144
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,360
Don't you feel sad?

145
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,720
Today,

146
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm not asking for your grandfather's

147
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,240
or grandmother's help.

148
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
This is your business.

149
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,160
I'll give you

150
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,000
some legal knowledge.

151
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,440
To raise your parents.

152
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,160
This is the legal obligation of your son and daughter.

153
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,400
Do you understand?

154
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,440
If you don't follow your own obligation,

155
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,480
you'll have to bear the responsibility of the two.

156
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,800
If you're evil,

157
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,440
if you break the law,

158
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,280
you'll have to bear the responsibility of the two.

159
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,800
This is not a joke.

160
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,280
I've read it too.

161
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,640
Everyone we've done

162
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,920
is a good person.

163
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
A few days ago,

164
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,160
my mother left the neighborhood.

165
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,320
This kind of behavior

166
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,680
can't be happening anymore.

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,800
This has caused a lot of anger.

168
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,480
It's also a blackout

169
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
for your personal interests.

170
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
If this is spread to your unit

171
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,200
and your relatives' ears,

172
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,040
it will affect your personal interests.

173
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,080
And I believe everyone

174
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
is a good person.

175
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,160
Right?

176
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
Right?

177
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,640
The business we should do

178
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,680
is not to be said.

179
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
My mother

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,320
lived in our house

181
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,200
for the longest time.

182
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,440
Now, our family is in trouble.

183
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
My son is getting married soon.

184
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,960
The house is not enough for him.

185
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,680
I hope my two sisters

186
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,840
can take the mother

187
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,640
to your place for a while.

188
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,000
When we get back to our place,

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,440
we'll take the mother back.

190
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,200
Okay?

191
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
Your son is getting married.

192
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,320
My son is getting married too.

193
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,840
The house is so tense.

194
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Brother, let me ask you.

195
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,560
The idea of letting my mother live in my house

196
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,560
is your idea or your sister-in-law's idea?

197
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,040
Don't make me ask.

198
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm not making a mistake.

199
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,240
Right.

200
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,320
Don't make a big mistake.

201
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,600
You don't want to accept

202
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,720
your mother living in your house.

203
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
Is your idea

204
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,600
or Xie Dongliang's idea?

205
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,960
If you're not satisfied with me,

206
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,480
we can go out and discuss.

207
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,320
What do you mean?

208
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,280
You want to fight with her?

209
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,520
Are we afraid of you?

210
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,920
Let's go and try.

211
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,320
You're the mother-in-law.

212
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,160
Who dares to touch her?

213
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,280
You two are not my mother-in-law.

214
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,600
I'm not going to fight with her.

215
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm not going to fight with her.

216
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm not going to fight with her.

217
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
I'm not going to fight with her.

218
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,120
Don't fight with her.

219
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,560
No, no, no.

220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,160
Come, sit down.

221
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,200
Sit down.

222
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay, sit down.

223
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,640
Be nice to me.

224
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,440
You're a murderer.

225
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,680
You're a family.

226
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,360
Why are you embarrassing me?

227
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,360
You know it's embarrassing.

228
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,640
You didn't take the idea of

229
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,120
sending your wife to Shenhao's house.

230
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,840
Sister, why did you say that?

231
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,560
I thought we were all good friends.

232
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,200
Sister, don't say that.

233
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,520
If you really think for your brother and sister,

234
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,120
you should take your mother

235
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,760
and take her home.

236
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,720
Didn't you have a son?

237
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,320
You have a house in your house.

238
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,760
It's a wide range.

239
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,960
Brother, you're wrong.

240
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm a daughter.

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm the daughter of the family.

242
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
I'm the water.

243
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,760
Besides, I have a wife.

244
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,200
My mother is a lifetime advantage.

245
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,640
You have to pay more.

246
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,680
Exactly.

247
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
You don't know where you are.

248
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,920
All the good things in the world

249
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,440
are a family.

250
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,560
I don't have a common thing with you.

251
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,160
You two are crazy.

252
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,360
You go home and take a mirror

253
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,320
and look at your face.

254
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,040
Why do you look like a woman?

255
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,520
Look at your face.

256
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
Don't you look like a woman?

257
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,360
We are actually not like women.

258
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,840
You, you find a ugly wife.

259
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,560
Like a woman?

260
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,920
You're ugly.

261
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,840
I'm beautiful.

262
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,600
You're so ridiculous.

263
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
To be honest,

264
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,280
you're a father.

265
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,240
If you're married,

266
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
I'll drag you out.

267
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,080
What are you doing?

268
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,520
Just take it.

269
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,400
Don't take it.

270
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,640
Don't take it.

271
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,520
Don't take it.

272
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,840
Stop it.

273
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
Don't take it.

274
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
Stop it.

275
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,880
You don't want your grandma.

276
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,920
We want her.

277
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,320
Dad, I'm the eldest grandma.

278
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,520
I want her to be with us forever.

279
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
I don't understand.

280
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Mom, don't worry.

281
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
When you get to grandma's age,

282
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,080
Hui Hui and I will make sure

283
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,840
you will have a happy and happy life.

284
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,360
I have no worries.

285
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,520
I won't let you stay in the dorm.

286
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,000
Mom, you're here to fight with my dad.

287
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill Gao Xueya?

288
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,360
What are you doing?

289
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,200
You said you're always

290
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,600
fighting with your sister.

291
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,240
Forget it.

292
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't care.

293
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,160
But today,

294
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,520
you're so embarrassed.

295
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,080
I hate your behavior.

296
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,680
Yang Yu, you saw what happened today.

297
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,320
You're willing to marry me

298
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,920
in this family.

299
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,760
I don't want it.

300
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,040
Yang Yu, let's go.

301
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Hui Hui, let's go.

302
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,160
Er Da.

303
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,880
Shi Wei.

304
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,120
Er Da.

305
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,720
You're back.

306
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,280
Shen Qiu, thank you for coming

307
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,040
to our discussion today.

308
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,320
We'll help you

309
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,800
if you need anything.

310
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,480
Just say it.

311
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,560
Don't be shy.

312
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,120
When I become a mother,

313
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,520
I can understand

314
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,360
mom's feelings.

315
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,000
So, I'm proud of her

316
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,320
for doing this.

317
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,360
I won't say it out.

318
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,000
Even if the three of us don't care,

319
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,480
I'll care about my brother.

320
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,960
Everyone has his own business.

321
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,520
No one can do it without responsibility.

322
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,840
Anyway, thank you very much

323
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,000
for giving me the right

324
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,320
to ask for her.

325
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,040
You can go.

326
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,240
Take care.

327
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Let's go.

328
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,880
I'm old.

329
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,600
I can't say

330
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,280
I'm a man of my word.

331
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,560
But I've been

332
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,160
in the judicial office for more than 20 years.

333
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
Like the three brothers of the Shen family,

334
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,000
they treat their mother

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,240
so affectionately.

336
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,920
They're so ungrateful.

337
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,800
You're so selfish.

338
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,360
Shen Hao and Shen Qiu

339
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,440
are very understanding.

340
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
They don't have

341
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,280
any kind of kindness to their old madam.

342
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,320
But they've made a lot of

343
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,600
kindness

344
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
and stronger than their three brothers.

345
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,200
Anyway,

346
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
they've made a lot of kindness

347
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,560
and stronger than their three brothers.

348
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,000
It's a great honor

349
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
to have my mother and my sister-in-law.

350
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
With such results,

351
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,720
young people's actions

352
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,800
can't be ignored.

353
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,240
What do I mean?

354
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,440
This is called the life of the generations.

355
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,640
Let young people

356
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,080
be their parents.

357
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,120
This kind of kindness

358
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,040
seems fair.

359
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
But do you think

360
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,400
he's really a person?

361
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,360
If my mother knew

362
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,000
that her life

363
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,280
is to be saved by this agreement,

364
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,440
not by the money,

365
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,520
what would she feel?

366
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,520
So,

367
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,360
we have to

368
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,440
take the responsibility

369
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,520
and try to ensure

370
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,000
the lives of the old people.

371
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,200
So that we can live

372
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,760
more honorably.

373
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
What's that?

374
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,920
You're here.

375
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,760
What's that?

376
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,800
We're here today

377
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,120
to see you.

378
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,800
And then

379
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
we'll inform you

380
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,280
about your charity agreement.

381
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,040
From now on,

382
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,560
you'll be happy.

383
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,120
I'm

384
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,080
free to help you

385
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,680
with my own things.

386
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm so grateful to you.

387
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,360
Thank you

388
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,600
for your kind words.

389
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,520
Or

390
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,720
I'll be an old sister.

391
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,240
Don't say that.

392
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,400
We should do it.

393
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,880
As long as we see you

394
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,760
live a full life,

395
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,080
and be happy and healthy,

396
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,280
we'll be relieved.

397
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,200
Good boy.

398
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,400
Thank you.

399
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,240
You're welcome.

400
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,000
We're leaving.

401
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay.

402
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
Goodbye.

403
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,360
Chen.

404
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,000
Bai Lan's trip is over.

405
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,120
Yes.

406
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,600
What did Xiao Yang tell you?

407
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
I sent her a letter.

408
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
She won't reply.

409
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,840
Chen.

410
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Don't be like this.

411
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,800
You can't show your concern

412
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
and lose anything.

413
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
You can also show

414
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,720
your manly emotions.

415
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,960
Men can't be too small.

416
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,160
Don't be so mean.

417
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,360
I'll buy her a bouquet

418
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,920
after work.

419
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,880
Okay?

420
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,040
Yes.

421
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
That's enough.

422
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,520
Fang Ze.

423
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,240
It's time for me to go to my office.

424
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,040
Okay.

425
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,000
Fang Ze.

426
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,880
Chen.

427
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,000
Hello, Miss Lan.

428
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,480
You need to sign this document.

429
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
I have to send it to Sister Fu.

430
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,960
Okay.

431
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,680
You're all here.

432
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,280
I have something to tell you.

433
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,880
Officer Song just came.

434
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,400
He said Ma Fushun's tissue is full.

435
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,040
He kept it for so many days.

436
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,040
Although he taught her,

437
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,960
she doesn't know

438
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,080
what she's been thinking about.

439
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,520
Her emotions are not stable now.

440
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,520
So she can't see Wu Ying.

441
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,640
Oh, right.

442
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,320
Wu Ying has proposed to her

443
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,160
and asked her to divorce her.

444
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,040
She can't let them meet at this time.

445
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,520
She's going to be separated from her family.

446
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
I hope she can be a good wife.

447
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,600
Chen.

448
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,920
Song Tao said that

449
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,520
he wants to ask you and Sister Bai Lan

450
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,480
to go to our house to have a drink and tea.

451
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,080
He made steak. How is it?

452
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,640
Fang Ze.

453
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,400
I don't think Song Tao said that.

454
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,840
You said it.

455
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,560
These two young people

456
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
have already made me a big hit.

457
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
When I was off work this afternoon,

458
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
I went to buy her some roses.

459
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,800
Is that okay?

460
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,000
That's right.

461
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,320
Ming Tian.

462
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,840
I want to have steak, too.

463
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
What's wrong?

464
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,800
I like to eat cold steak,

465
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,600
and meat, and rice noodles.

466
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,680
Will Song Tao do it?

467
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,720
I'll do it myself.

468
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,920
Your cake's ready.

469
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,960
Sing mana.

470
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,880
You're the last one to sit on the chair.

471
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,440
Hurry up.

472
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,840
Your dad's here.

473
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,000
Your colleague gave this to you.

474
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,420
Who did?

475
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,360
Oh.

476
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Dad, you're so handsome.

477
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You look good.

478
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You look pretty good.

479
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Look.

480
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm almost done with my task.

481
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay, I'll go back now.

482
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You're leaving after finishing your meal?

483
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No, I have work to do.

484
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll come back next week to see you.

485
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, right.

486
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I've prepared the things for you.

487
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I have to do the homework myself.

488
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's up to you.

489
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You're so mean.

490
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm going to go back to my room.

491
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm going to go back to my room.

492
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm going to go back to my room.

493
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
We'll take their children together.

494
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We'll exchange them with each other.

495
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We'll think about how you treat your brain.

496
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Will everyone have brain problems?

497
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Will you think about your children?

498
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You have to treat them with your right hand.

499
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Of course, in the problem of the brain,

500
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I think about the brain.

501
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The brain has a lot of problems.

502
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
For example, brain brain problems,

503
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
you know, there are problems with the brain.

504
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We will also take some social workers and network members

505
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
to the local sites to visit.

506
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We will continue to take care of them

507
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and love them as much as possible

508
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
to solve the problem of the brain.
