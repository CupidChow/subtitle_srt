00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The First Episode

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
Luo Dapeng stole my phone from my mother.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,200
What are you doing?

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,400
Luo Dapeng!

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,800
He's a good man!

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,600
I'll get you back!

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,800
Ms. Li, hello.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm the director of the Chen Jun Siwa's

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
office in Xiaodong.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
I'm Fang.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,400
Xiaodong left her mother after she left her letter.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,600
How is it?

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,400
Is she still okay when she was in school?

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
She might have some misunderstandings with her mother.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're not in a hurry now.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,200
Do you know where she might be?

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,800
Her parents are in a hurry now.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
What should they do?

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
If they care about this child earlier,

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,800
Luo Xiaodong won't be like this.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,200
There are some special cases in her family.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
Do you know that?

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,000
I know.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
That's why I care about this child.

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,200
Even if I keep an eye on her,

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,400
there are so many students in our class.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,800
I can't help but look at her.

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,600
She's about to leave.

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,800
Do you know what kind of classmate

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,600
is especially close to her?

32
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,600
She's not close to our classmate.

33
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,800
And she knows how to mess things up.

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,800
A girl would fight.

35
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,600
If she doesn't come to class,

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
she'll be fine for a while.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
She doesn't have any close friends.

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,900
The only friend is

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,400
the girl named Yingzi in our class.

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Only her and Luo Xiaodong are close.

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,000
How about this? I'll call her.

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,000
Hello, Yingzi?

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Do you know where Luo Xiaodong is?

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,200
She didn't tell me where she went.

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,800
Wait a minute.

46
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,200
There's an auntie here to talk to you.

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Wait a minute.

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,000
Yingzi.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Hello, Yingzi.

50
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,400
I'm Fang Suo from the private law firm.

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, I'm Xiaodong's good friend.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,600
Xiaodong and her parents have some misunderstandings.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Her parents want to explain to her.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,400
If you can contact her,

55
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,000
you can tell her.

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If she doesn't want to go home,

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
she can stay at my place.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,400
Okay.

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll remember what you said.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
If Xiaodong contacts me,

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
I'll tell her.

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Okay, bye.

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
When I told her about Luo Xiaodong leaving home,

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,600
she didn't show any concern.

65
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,800
As a good friend, she must be worried.

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,400
I think she's hesitating to tell me.

67
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm sure that

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,200
she'll tell me Xiaodong's whereabouts tomorrow.

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
Let's talk about it.

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,200
These kids don't let people be sad.

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,600
It's been a month.

72
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
You have to tell me the details.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
Otherwise, I won't be able to find it.

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,000
This...

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,200
The old lady's mother died on the 7th of last month.

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,200
The next day, it should be the 9th.

77
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Then let's check the date.

78
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
The last month's 9th.

79
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Then after 7 a.m.

80
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,200
Then we'll check the details of the old lady's house.

81
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Look at this.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Put it slower.

83
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
Okay.

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,000
Put it slower.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,600
What's on her hand?

86
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,800
It seems to be a phone.

87
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,600
That's right.

88
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
The ring.

89
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
It's not the ring.

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
It's the move to remove the ring.

91
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,400
Then I'll remove the whole video for you.

92
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,200
That's right.

93
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Yes, the video is a little bit more detailed.

94
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,400
Did you take it back?

95
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
I did.

96
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I knew that Big Sister wouldn't do this kind of thing again.

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,000
She did her job as a post-work worker.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,400
She did her best.

99
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,800
You must explain it to the old lady.

100
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,400
The old lady, you know that she will be out of the house

101
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,800
if she makes a big mouth.

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,400
Don't worry.

103
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,200
We'll report to Fang Suo when we get back.

104
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,000
We'll explain it to her as soon as possible.

105
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,400
Who is it?

106
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,600
It's me.

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm Xiao Shi.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
Fang Suo from Sifa Suo is here to see you.

109
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
Open the door.

110
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
Fang Suo.

111
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,600
Did you find out?

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I said it's the old lady.

113
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
She's not a big deal.

114
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Is there any evidence?

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
Boss, look.

116
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,600
Can you let us in first?

117
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
Please.

118
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,600
Please.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
After our investigation,

120
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
the phone is indeed from Luo Dapeng

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
who has been on the streets since he was little.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
That's impossible.

123
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
My eldest son is in the bag.

124
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
He's also in the bag.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,600
My daughter saw it too.

126
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,200
But the phone indeed fell to the grass.

127
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,400
There's a piece of evidence.

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,200
Xiao Shi gave it to you.

129
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Is this the phone?

130
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Look.

131
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
It's clearly visible.

132
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
It's the phone.

133
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,800
You just put it on the phone.

134
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,000
He should also put things in the back.

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,400
Take other people's things as his own.

136
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,200
What's the difference between stealing and stealing?

137
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,000
What's the difference between the one who's picked up and stolen?

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,400
You can't say that.

139
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
This will create a reputation for one person.

140
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,800
I've got his reputation.

141
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
He took my phone and didn't give it back to me.

142
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Luo Dapeng picked up this phone.

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
He didn't find any useful information in the phone.

144
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
He couldn't contact the owner.

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
He was afraid that the phone would be missing.

146
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
The owner couldn't pick up the phone.

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
He went to the place where the phone was missing.

148
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
He matched the charger of your old phone.

149
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,600
If he didn't charge it every day,

150
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,800
would you be able to connect to the phone in a month?

151
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
I connected to the phone.

152
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,600
He didn't give it back to me.

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,200
What did you say when you connected to the phone?

154
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,800
I said,

155
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
Hello, mom,

156
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
did you pick up the phone?

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,600
How do you know that you're the owner?

158
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Then why did he turn off the phone when I called him?

159
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,000
That's the reputation.

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't you want to give it back to me?

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,200
Uncle Dai,

162
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
your phone is too old.

163
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,000
It can last for eight hours.

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,600
Didn't you call the phone and lost it?

165
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,600
I don't care.

166
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
This matter

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is too serious for my injury.

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,200
He has to compensate me.

169
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,600
Then how do you want him to compensate you?

170
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,800
Did I buy that phone for three thousand dollars?

171
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
Then he compensated me three thousand dollars.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
Why should I compensate you three thousand dollars?

173
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,200
I called you Uncle Dai. Don't be rude.

174
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
How do you say that?

175
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Isn't this a broken marriage?

176
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
We're just reminding you.

177
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,000
Sometimes, people can't say no.

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,600
Sometimes, they're too lazy.

179
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,400
This phone

180
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,800
seems to have been a second-hand product for a long time.

181
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,000
The most of it is one hundred dollars.

182
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,200
You're framing others.

183
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Now that things have been cleared,

184
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,600
you still have to buy a second-hand product for three thousand dollars.

185
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Do you think it's appropriate?

186
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Old Dai, tomorrow, you guys come to the lock room.

187
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
We'll invite Mr. Luo to come too.

188
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,600
You two have solved this misunderstanding.

189
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
The phone is now ready to be used.

190
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,800
You can use this to fix the pair of shoes.

191
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
That's too much.

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
If not, then forget it.

193
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,600
Anyway, she has no loss.

194
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,200
There's no need to make it so troublesome.

195
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
It's because you didn't investigate the situation clearly.

196
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,600
You put the name of the thief on Luo Dapeng's head.

197
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,200
But his daughter thought that she was doing something bad again.

198
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,200
She left home and didn't find anyone until now.

199
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,000
What does this have to do with me?

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,600
If she encounters danger,

201
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,200
you have to take responsibility.

202
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Old Dai,

203
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,800
we all have to take responsibility for what we've said.

204
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,200
We can give others a bad definition.

205
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,600
It's very likely that we'll hurt her and her family.

206
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,400
After this, you guys have to continue to teach.

207
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Mr. Luo will continue to teach.

208
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,400
Let go. I'm coming.

209
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
Sit down.

210
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,400
Mr. Luo, we've already known about the phone.

211
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,600
You did pick it up on the way to the small area.

212
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,600
We also investigated the phone charger.

213
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
The owner had an impression of you.

214
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,000
The situation was the same as you described.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,600
We also told the driver that he was very understanding.

216
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,800
I was wrong.

217
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,400
I was too impulsive.

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I almost got in the wrong place.

219
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
No, Old Dai.

221
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm also thankful to you.

222
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,400
You've given me a lesson.

223
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,000
I really didn't do well in this matter.

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,800
Even the students know that you have to teach when you pick up something.

225
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,600
Look at me.

226
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm so smart and annoying.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
I promise you that

228
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,800
I won't do this again.

229
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,400
Old Dai, look at the phone.

230
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Do you have any problems?

231
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,000
No, I don't. You're all the same.

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
That's not the same.

233
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
We're adjusting the score.

234
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,000
Any details must be realized to the actual point.

235
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,600
Sorry.

236
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,200
Then you guys have a look at the score.

237
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
If it's not meaningful, please go ahead.

238
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Old Dai, I...

239
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
No, I really don't know.

240
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,200
Your phone is for my mom.

241
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I'll take it to that place.

242
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,200
If I knew, I wouldn't have been so worried about your phone call.

243
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,600
Please, Old Dai.

244
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
When my mom gave me a box of incense,

245
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
I helped her bring a sentence to her.

246
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
She said that I, Luo Da Peng,

247
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
was sorry to her teacher.

248
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
Our old lady,

249
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
she was always with us.

250
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
If she knew that I was wronged,

251
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,000
she would have scolded me.

252
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
It's okay. Don't worry.

253
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Hello?

254
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,400
Auntie Song, I'm Yin Zi.

255
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,000
I know where Xiaodong is.

256
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,400
That's great. Where is he?

257
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,200
He's in the small town. I'll take you to him.

258
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
Hurry up.

259
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,200
I think Xiaodong's mood is very bad.

260
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
I'll wait for you at the door.

261
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,600
Okay. Okay, wait for me.

262
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,000
You already know what's going on.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,400
Just write down your situation right now.

264
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,000
Let's go out for a while.

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Old Dai, go out with me.

266
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,400
Okay.

267
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,000
Is there any news?

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
There's news. He contacted me.

269
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,800
That's great.

270
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Let me go. I'll go with you.

271
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,000
No need. I'll bring him back to you.

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We'll talk later.

273
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,600
If there's any news, just contact me at 70.

274
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
Okay.

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Hello? Xiaodong?

276
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm already in the small town.

277
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Where are you?

278
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,400
Tell me your specific location.

279
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm looking for you.

280
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,500
Okay.

281
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,200
Then you stay there.

282
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,800
I didn't tell your parents.

283
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,600
I didn't tell you either.

284
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
Okay. See you later.

285
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,700
Bye.

286
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
How is he?

287
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,600
He said he's at the square in Binhai.

288
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
He's back to the big town.

289
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Xiaodong!

290
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,400
Xiaodong!

291
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
Is this the place he said he's at?

292
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes.

293
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Xiaodong!

294
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,400
Hey, kids! It's dangerous here.

295
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Over there!

296
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
Xiaodong!

297
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Xiaodong, what are you doing?

298
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Fang, Pei Mi, you're here just in time.

299
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,600
Let's put this hat on.

300
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,400
You scared me to death.

301
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Xiaodong, what do you want?

302
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,600
I want to put the hat on.

303
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,400
He must be angry with someone.

304
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,600
If I don't save him, he'll be starved to death.

305
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Next Episode

306
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,120
This area here is just intense.

307
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,800
There is a facial cleansing hall on the square.

308
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
What the criminal police or Magistrate calling

309
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,960
police officers does

310
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,400
requires treatment.

311
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,520
They sweep the whole building

312
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,320
and put in the small city.

313
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,600
They can be seen through their head拜拜

314
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,960
as a facial cleansing at every corner.

315
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,560
hide

316
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,160
no
