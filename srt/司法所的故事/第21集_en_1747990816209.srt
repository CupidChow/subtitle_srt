to eat any resting instead of going to a place to sleep.

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,540
Is this the Qilin Bovee auspicious place?

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,340
Why do you call this a reference to the Qilin Bovee auspicious place?

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,040
There must be a place called the Qilin Route.

14
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,600
We've got some people here.

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,540
What are they doing?

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,720
I love the people of Qilin Bovee.

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,320
I love them.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,040
Fake plankals of Jade are reallyפ Yay Aayi where there is peace.

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
Bless retreat from Ru rise

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,080
I may see theäll

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,340
That's so good

22
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,000
They say

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,400
Right.

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,560
Lu Xiaodong,

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,160
what are you doing here?

26
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,200
I...

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
have plan to do this.

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,880
Come on. Come on.

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,960
Lan Xin.

30
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,360
This kid is here to see you again.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,240
Xiao Dong, I'm not in a hurry to see your mom.

32
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,640
Sit.

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,280
What's wrong? What do you want to see me about?

34
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,160
Aunt Fang, I also want my mom and that person to be separated sooner.

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,400
Your mom is actually a little better these days.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,040
She hasn't fought with Su Ming, right?

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,840
She hasn't come back for several days.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,240
They are so different.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
Or...

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,920
How can I break up with you?

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,040
I don't know anymore. It's better to break up with you.

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,760
You are a little kid.

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,840
Aunt Fang, you won't treat me as a kid.

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,120
You won't treat me as a bad thing, right?

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,840
What you said is a bad thing, right?

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,600
Yes.

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,000
How is that possible? I'm a reporter.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
Then Aunt Fang, I'll leave first.

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,560
Have a good day.

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Goodbye, Aunt Fang.

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,920
Director.

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,440
Boss.

53
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,160
Luo Dapeng.

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,200
You two should teach him a lesson.

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,080
What's wrong?

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,120
Come, come.

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,720
Sit down and talk slowly.

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,960
Don't be angry.

59
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,720
What's wrong with Luo Dapeng?

60
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,200
Luo Dapeng stole my mom's phone.

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,360
You can't do that.

62
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,000
No, no.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,280
Boss, you drink some water first.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,160
Be stable.

65
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,920
Then you can tell us what's going on.

66
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,040
Thank you.

67
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,240
You left the chicken.

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,760
You can talk slowly. Don't be angry.

69
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm not feeling well.

70
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,440
Talk slowly.

71
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,080
Come.

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,600
My mom passed away on July 7th.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,120
We were all my mom's men.

74
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
We were both parents and mom's men.

75
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,800
It's not easy.

76
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,080
I couldn't see her when I thought about it.

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,480
I couldn't hear her voice.

78
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,760
My heart was like a knife to her.

79
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,840
I bought her a new phone.

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,880
I thought I'd be her companion.

81
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,080
If I think about it,

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,080
I'll call her.

83
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,600
I'll talk to my mom.

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,720
I'll talk to my mom.

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
Uncle Dai, don't be angry.

86
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,560
We can understand your mind.

87
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,120
You can tell us.

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,680
Yesterday,

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,440
my mom gave birth to me.

90
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,720
I said I'd call my mom.

91
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
She said she was happy.

92
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,840
She hit her phone.

93
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,400
Right?

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,960
She said to her phone,

95
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,520
Mom, happy birthday.

96
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,880
Look.

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Look.

98
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,840
She called.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,680
Mom.

100
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Mom, you're awake.

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,040
She called.

102
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,240
She said she was a man.

103
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,480
A man?

104
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,160
She said,

105
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,320
What's the name of the man?

106
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,120
Who are you?

107
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
She called my mom.

108
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
She talked to me.

109
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,200
She asked who I am.

110
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,120
She asked who I am.

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,760
Didn't you say

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,520
that phone was broken?

113
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,560
It was broken that day.

114
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,720
I took my mom's ashes

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,920
and took it to her house.

116
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
I made a circle.

117
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
She left.

118
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,120
I took it as my room.

119
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,280
I should go there.

120
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,400
Right.

121
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,960
Did your mom help you

122
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,320
the day she was in the funeral?

123
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,360
That's the Roda Peng.

124
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,400
She must have been there.

125
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
I remember.

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,920
I remember.

127
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,200
I went to the building of Ma Gu Hui's house.

128
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,440
I met Roda Peng

129
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,240
in the garden.

130
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,800
She talked to me.

131
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
She told me not to be too sad.

132
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
You can't say

133
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,600
that this is Roda Peng's head.

134
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,760
I thought that

135
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,160
the sound was familiar.

136
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,360
I thought that

137
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,920
Roda Peng

138
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
was definitely Roda Peng.

139
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,720
He must have been there.

140
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,120
Do you want to try again

141
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
when you go back?

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,120
Turn off the camera.

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,560
Yes, that's Roda Peng.

144
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,200
It must be Roda Peng.

145
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Boss, don't worry.

146
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,320
We can't break the record now.

147
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,600
Roda Peng stole this phone.

148
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,560
This stolen phone

149
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,760
is not good for

150
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
a little thing.

151
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,360
We need to be more careful.

152
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,600
How about this?

153
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
Go back first.

154
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,040
Then give your number to Chen.

155
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,120
We will help you

156
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,080
to investigate and understand.

157
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
Yes, yes.

158
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,200
We need to make sure

159
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,120
if the person who answered the phone is Roda Peng.

160
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,960
If it's him,

161
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,240
how will his phone come?

162
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,800
Right?

163
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,880
We need to know this.

164
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,160
We need to be sure.

165
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
He stole it.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,440
He stole it.

167
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,640
Boss, let me tell you again.

168
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,720
We can't break the record now.

169
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,040
Okay, I...

170
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,120
I'll go back first.

171
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,640
Thank you.

172
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,000
Thank you.

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,920
I'll go back to you.

174
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,320
I'll go back to you.

175
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,120
Don't bother.

176
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,480
Don't bother.

177
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,920
Thank you.

178
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,680
Take care.

179
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,360
I heard about this

180
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,640
a few times.

181
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,360
But I...

182
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,960
I didn't show it.

183
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,480
This...

184
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,840
This old man is a big thief.

185
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,280
Look at him.

186
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,440
This is a little too weird.

187
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,040
He has everything.

188
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,800
I think

189
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
we must be careful

190
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,000
about this.

191
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,240
We must find this person

192
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,120
to find the truth.

193
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,360
We must investigate it.

194
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,520
Before we find out,

195
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
how can we break the record?

196
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,040
Who stole it?

197
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,240
This old man is too impulsive.

198
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
Right?

199
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,120
Let's stay here.

200
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,840
Chen,

201
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,400
go find Roda Peng.

202
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
We need to know

203
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,440
some details.

204
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
We need to know what Roda Peng said.

205
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

206
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,560
Okay, I'll go now.

207
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Hello.

208
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Hello.

209
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,040
How are you?

210
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,960
You're here.

211
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,280
It's 50 meters up.

212
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,080
It's turning.

213
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
If you don't cross it,

214
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
you'll turn right away.

215
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
If you continue to turn right,

216
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
you'll be lost.

217
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Don't you think

218
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,680
it's a circle?

219
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,280
Yes, it is.

220
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,960
But if you go from here,

221
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,920
there's a gap.

222
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
You can't go there.

223
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,960
Do you understand?

224
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,920
I don't know where it is.

225
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,520
You...

226
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:21,920
You...

227
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
I'll take you there.

228
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,320
Okay.

229
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,920
Okay.

230
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,520
Okay.

231
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,920
Okay.

232
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,320
Okay.

233
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,920
Okay.

234
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,560
Okay.

235
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,200
Okay.

236
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,920
I'll take you there.

237
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,120
Okay.

238
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,720
Okay.

239
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,200
Okay.

240
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,000
I have something to ask you.

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,520
No, Chen Xiao Ge,

242
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm on the way.

243
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,800
Wait a minute.

244
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,640
Hey,

245
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,520
you're still using your way

246
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
to sell the small brother.

247
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,160
Come on.

248
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,080
There's a key.

249
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,160
Then remember,

250
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,760
you can use it again.

251
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,440
Use it again.

252
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Okay, thank you, master.

253
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,960
Fang Suo is looking for you.

254
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,600
Fang Suo,

255
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,520
what's the matter?

256
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,440
Han Chao brought a stool.

257
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,080
No, no, no.

258
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,640
Don't talk.

259
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,680
I'll give

260
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,880
Li Song Huajiao later.

261
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,640
I just...

262
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,240
Why are you so serious?

263
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
I've been working hard lately.

264
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,600
Da Peng,

265
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
have you changed your phone lately?

266
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,760
No.

267
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,600
What's wrong?

268
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
How many phones do you have?

269
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,080
Just one.

270
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,120
Are you sure?

271
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,440
Wait a minute.

272
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,560
I'll take this phone.

273
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,520
Hello?

274
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,000
Hello?

275
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,680
Stop playing.

276
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,000
What's this?

277
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,680
I played it.

278
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll play it.

279
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,760
This phone is for Brother Chen.

280
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,480
I finally got the owner.

281
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,440
Put it on the table.

282
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,840
Let me explain.

283
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,320
What do you mean?

284
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,400
Where did you get the phone?

285
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,840
No, I picked it up.

286
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,120
No,

287
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Brother Chen

288
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,720
lost it on the lawn.

289
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,000
I was

290
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,920
fixing it on the lawn.

291
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,280
This phone is not mine.

292
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Even if you picked up this phone,

293
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,480
you should be paid.

294
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,280
You should be the owner of the house.

295
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,360
You even know the truth.

296
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,600
Don't you know?

297
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,080
Why are you so muddleheaded?

298
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,960
No.

299
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:05,920
Wait.

300
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,560
This phone is not yours.

301
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,440
How do you know

302
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,000
who picked up this phone?

303
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,840
The mastermind told me.

304
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,520
Fang Suo,

305
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,760
I've been using my ancestors' 8 times.

306
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
This phone is really expensive.

307
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,400
No.

308
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,960
There is no information

309
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,640
in this phone.

310
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,480
Look.

311
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,360
There is no information.

312
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
I also want to be the owner.

313
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,600
I'll give it back to anyone.

314
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,480
I don't even have a number.

315
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,000
I...

316
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,960
There is indeed a space inside.

317
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,240
There is no information.

318
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,040
Right?

319
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,240
When I picked up this phone,

320
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,840
I thought

321
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,040
who would want it.

322
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,080
Right? The team is too old.

323
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,000
He threw it away.

324
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,080
But I thought about it later.

325
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,840
I think

326
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
it's a little bit of a loss.

327
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,560
The possibility is bigger.

328
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,600
So I'm waiting.

329
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,720
Waiting for the mastermind to call me.

330
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,120
You're waiting for something.

331
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,200
Do you know?

332
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,440
If Fang Suo didn't stop you,

333
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,480
you would have been in a hurry.

334
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,840
No.

335
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,040
This...

336
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,680
What's going on?

337
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,640
The mastermind came.

338
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,920
He thinks you stole this phone.

339
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,280
This...

340
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,240
I want to steal it.

341
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,440
Why do you want to steal this phone?

342
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,880
You said this is a broken phone.

343
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,480
But for the mastermind,

344
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,280
it's a big deal.

345
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,320
A big deal?

346
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,520
Right.

347
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,120
I picked up this phone

348
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,840
and called it.

349
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,440
And the person asked me

350
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,640
if it's a ghost.

351
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,120
I was so confused.

352
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,240
You don't know who he is, right?

353
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,200
But he heard your voice.

354
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,760
Who is he?

355
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,080
The mastermind.

356
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,680
The mastermind?

357
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,360
That's good.

358
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,800
I'll give him back my phone.

359
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
His phone is too old.

360
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,960
I called him for his sake.

361
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,680
I even went to the mobile phone shop

362
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,000
to get him a charger.

363
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,680
He only found a charger

364
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,440
in a short time.

365
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,040
The key is to charge him.

366
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,760
It can only last for an hour.

367
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,960
I can't stop charging him.

368
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,760
If I don't do that,

369
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,360
the boss can't get through to this phone.

370
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,120
Forget it.

371
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,280
Anyway, the mastermind found it.

372
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,480
I'll give him a charger

373
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,840
and free him a charger.

374
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,760
He's not guilty.

375
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,000
If it's as simple as you said,

376
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,480
it's over.

377
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,200
The boss has decided

378
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,640
that you stole this phone.

379
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,720
You're not a good person.

380
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
Where did you buy the charger?

381
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,600
Right.

382
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,560
I opened a post

383
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,440
on the special door.

384
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,160
I sent it to you.

385
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,640
Look.

386
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,000
Here.

387
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,720
Here.

388
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,400
Okay, friend.

389
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,600
How about this?

390
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,720
Put the phone here.

391
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,880
You can go back first.

392
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,040
We need to make a deal

393
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,160
with the phone.

394
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,520
Do you want to give the boss an answer?

395
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,080
No.

396
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,200
I know.

397
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,760
I'll make a deal.

398
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,560
Call me anytime.

399
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm leaving.

400
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,320
By the way,

401
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,120
if you can't do it,

402
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,320
you can go to the monitoring room.

403
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,160
Let's go.

404
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,000
Come on.

405
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,080
Let's go.

406
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,400
Dongmei.

407
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Are you crazy?

408
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,320
He's your boyfriend.

409
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,720
Go and get him back.

410
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,120
What's wrong with Xiaodong?

411
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,080
What's wrong with Dongmei?

412
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,320
Mr. Bao.

413
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,200
Xiaodong left the house.

414
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,920
Okay.

415
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,080
I'll go find him.

416
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I'll go find him.

417
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,280
Mr. Bao.

418
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,400
Mr. Bao.

419
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,320
Dongmei, what's wrong?

420
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,040
You all saw it, right?

421
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,240
Xiaodong wrote it.

422
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,240
He hates this house.

423
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,560
He hates that he has a father like Luo Dapeng.

424
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,400
He's so sorry in front of his classmates.

425
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,120
He hates me.

426
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,840
He hates our parents.

427
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,760
He won't continue to live in his family.

428
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,080
Dongmei.

429
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,520
Go and check on him.

430
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,560
Maybe Xiaodong is there.

431
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Let's go.

432
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,400
Chen,

433
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,760
go to the lake and park

434
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,320
around our school.

435
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,120
Go and check them out.

436
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,600
Okay.

437
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,520
I'll go there.

438
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,880
Han Chao, you two go there.

439
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,800
We'll go to the monitoring room

440
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,880
of the new school.

441
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,680
I think when Xiaodong came,

442
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,800
he was just in.

443
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,000
He heard our conversation.

444
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,480
Now he's in a hurry

445
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,520
to find evidence.

446
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,960
He's so worried about Luo Dapeng.

447
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,560
He's so worried about his child.

448
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
I also heard that

449
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,880
he misunderstood his father.

450
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
They didn't have any evidence.

451
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,080
They just made a big sound

452
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,880
to let others steal his phone.

453
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,440
But he ran away.

454
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,360
When you're in the monitoring room,

455
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,720
you can't let go of one of them.

456
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,120
I'll go to the school to find the supervisor.

457
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,160
The main idea is

458
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,720
to make a law

459
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,840
and make a trial.

460
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,360
We'll make a law on April 4th.

461
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,960
We'll start the law-making activity.

462
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,920
If Xiaodong is in the process,

463
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,240
we'll mainly

464
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,440
go to the community.

465
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,040
We'll go to the community.

466
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,600
We'll work together.

467
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
As the public,

468
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,480
we'll be the public's witness.

469
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,800
Try your best.

470
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,440
I heard you were stealing my phone.

471
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,360
You stole it.

472
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
You wanted to...

473
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
I heard you went to find it.

474
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,080
You took it out.

475
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,160
You stole it.

476
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,360
You want to steal it.

477
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,440
You went out again.

478
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,880
Then you wanted to...

479
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,000
You stole it.

480
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,720
That's great.

481
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,120
That reporter was very suspicious.

482
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
He said I didn't go to the school.

483
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,080
You were in the movie.

484
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,760
I didn't go.

485
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,040
I didn't go.

486
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,640
But you didn't.

487
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,600
We were very suspicious.

488
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,640
You were in the movie.

489
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,440
That's great.

490
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,120
That's great.

491
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
Now you're here.

492
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,840
Okay.
