1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A Love So Romantic

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,280
As long as Liang Yin

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,400
doesn't agree to divorce,

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,320
I won't escape at all.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,200
I've made up my mind.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,880
Is she still mad at me?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,880
We need to persuade each other and spend money.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
A paper ring?

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
It's a tryst to keep the promise,

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,160
and their although.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,560
Zhou Hao's smoothly doing it,

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
onto his own.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,560
Actually, using three appointment

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,040
has ever taken Project Liang reflectively.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,720
Liang Yin...

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,120
She just loves Xia.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,960
What are you doing later?

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,320
Entering the firm.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,520
Okay, you guys go ahead. I'll go to the warehouse to get the food.

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,920
Okay.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,420
Hello?

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,320
Mom.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,120
Nuan Xin, is there anything?

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,020
Nothing.

25
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,120
I just miss you.

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,320
Look at you.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
You're already this old.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
You're still so young.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
The sun is already up.

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,920
Zhu Lan is back.

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,720
Really?

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,920
That's great.

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
Let's go.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,920
Hello?

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,120
Son, what's up?

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,320
Dad, I want to change my laptop.

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,920
Your laptop is broken again?

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,520
How fast is the update of electronic products?

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,120
My laptop is too old.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
It's too slow.

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,520
It's good that you can use it.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,520
We can't afford to use it.

43
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,520
I'll use my home's most expensive laptop.

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Give me some money.

45
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,920
I don't have money.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
My money is with your mom.

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Ask her for it.

48
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,120
Okay, dad.

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,920
I have one thing to remind you.

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,720
Don't let mom edit the video.

51
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,120
She might get into trouble.

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Why are you being so stubborn?

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
What's wrong with editing?

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,320
What could happen to your mom?

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,720
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,120
I'm hanging up.

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
You brat.

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,920
You're scolding Xiao Yang again?

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,320
You young people

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
don't dare to be rude.

61
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Are you feeling bad?

62
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,120
Chen, when Xiao Yang is irritated,

63
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,320
you scold us.

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,720
This is wrong, Chen.

65
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,920
Why is the laptop so slow?

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,720
Why is the laptop so slow?

67
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
You're off work.

68
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
What are you two doing?

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
We seem to have found

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,520
Zhou Hang's current girlfriend's contact information.

71
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,920
Really?

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
What's going on?

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,120
You're typing.

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,920
He's typing.

75
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
I'm typing.

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Our laptop is too slow.

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Be more careful.

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Will the new laptop be faster?

79
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Of course.

80
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Okay.

81
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Send her a message.

82
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Add her on WeChat.

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Send her a photo.

84
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
I've added her.

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Be more careful.

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Send her a photo.

87
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Ask her if she knows this person.

88
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Hello.

89
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Please open the door.

90
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
You're back.

91
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
I'll be right back.

92
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
What's wrong?

93
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Are you tired?

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Uncle, the 380,000 yuan

95
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
I know the cash register.

96
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Yu Bo has taken it away.

97
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
I also saw the ID of his signature.

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
You're a jerk.

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Go find him after you finish eating.

100
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
You're not in a good mood.

101
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I'm fine.

102
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
I'm fine.

103
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Come back to Suzhou with me

104
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
to see my mom this weekend.

105
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Okay.

106
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
What case did you make today?

107
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
I went to see Liang Ying at the hospital today.

108
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
It's totally fine.

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,420
ции

110
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
I gave it all up

111
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
for another woman.

112
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
For her loved man,

113
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
she did everything

114
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
to deliver her health.

115
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Tell me,

116
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
why did it end so badly?

117
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,520
You see, your job is to solve these disputes.

118
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,280
When we get off work,

119
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,920
we have to

120
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,800
pick out the disputes, right?

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,720
Let yourself be in a good mood.

122
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,200
Then you can solve them.

123
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,320
Come on, let's eat.

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
If we are tired today,

125
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
let's go to Yuwa tomorrow, okay?

126
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,080
It's okay.

127
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,960
Let's go next week.

128
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,760
I don't know what's going on tomorrow.

129
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, let's eat.

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,320
Come on, have some peanuts.

131
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,840
What's wrong with you?

132
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,080
You have peanuts in your mouth.

133
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,920
I seem to have a little electric shock today.

134
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,840
It's okay, Chen.

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,000
We don't dislike you.

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,040
We are just afraid that you won't go home for dinner.

137
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,080
And Bai Lan won't be happy.

138
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,080
She has a dinner today.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,760
You say,

140
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,240
what will Zhu Lian do

141
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,440
after she knows the truth about Zhou Hang?

142
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,000
Just wait and see.

143
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,960
She said she would think about it.

144
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,920
Liang Ying is young.

145
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,000
How did she get the alcoholism?

146
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,440
Li told me that

147
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,440
since Zhou Hang went abroad,

148
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,240
Liang Ying has been making money every day.

149
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,880
She works in the company during the day

150
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,760
and goes to the bar to sell alcohol at night.

151
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,160
The most important thing is

152
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,960
she has to drink a lot of alcohol every day.

153
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,960
Think about it.

154
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
She is soaked by alcohol every day.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,960
Anyone can stand it.

156
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,960
This is really

157
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,400
the only way to get rid of the drunkenness.

158
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,520
And

159
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,160
Liang Ying has to give Zhou Hang

160
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
eight thousand yuan every month

161
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,640
on time.

162
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,320
Eight thousand yuan?

163
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,000
But she has to live here

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
by herself.

165
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,960
Rent a house and eat.

166
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,640
She has to earn ten thousand yuan

167
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,480
to buy a house.

168
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,320
That's right.

169
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Zhou Hang

170
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,600
is very reasonable.

171
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,360
Liang Ying doesn't allow Zhou Hang to tell her

172
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,080
that she is afraid that she will be worried

173
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,000
and affect her studies.

174
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,680
Actually, she might not know

175
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,280
that she is pretending to be stupid.

176
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,720
I think so, too.

177
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,360
And

178
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,080
it's also a revenge for the foreign scholars

179
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
who help the mentors.

180
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,240
And the revenge is not low.

181
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,880
Zhou Hang not only doesn't

182
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,040
give Liang Ying money,

183
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,760
but also lets Liang Ying

184
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,720
earn RMB from China

185
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
to exchange for her.

186
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,160
Isn't it tiring?

187
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,200
So

188
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,720
when you are in love,

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,240
you should have your eyes wide open.

190
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,840
Personality is very important.

191
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,160
Take care.

192
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,600
Go full on.

193
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,240
Okay.

194
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,640
I will leave now.

195
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,880

199
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Don't be like that, bro.

200
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,120
Can you talk nicely?

201
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,000
Talk nicely.

202
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,320
I really don't have money now.

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
I'll pay you back if I have money.

204
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,040
Besides, I...

205
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,640
I...

206
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,200
I left my property certificate with you.

207
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,080
I can't run away.

208
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
Right?

209
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
Well, can you give me a few more months?

210
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
A few months?

211
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,400
You're so generous.

212
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,000
You don't take our money as money, right?

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,400
No.

214
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll kill you.

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,160
No.

216
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,880
Uncle.

217
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,560
What are you doing?

218
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
Who are you?

219
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,680
Who are you?

220
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,840
I'm Piao.

221
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,880
Piao?

222
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,280
You've really thought it through.

223
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,760
You have a conscience and a conscience.

224
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,280
You don't pay back the loan you owe.

225
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,320
Did you hear the question?

226
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,240
You don't pay back the loan?

227
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,680
No.

228
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,040
Sister-in-law.

229
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,720
No.

230
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,080
Brother.

231
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,200
Look.

232
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,240
Look.

233
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,280
Look.

234
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,360
Look.

235
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,440
Look.

236
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,520
Look.

237
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,600
Look.

238
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:42,680
Look.

239
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:42,760
Look.

240
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:42,840
Look.

241
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:42,920
Look.

242
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,000
Look.

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,080
Look.

244
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,160
Look.

245
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,240
Look.

246
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,560
Look.

247
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:43,640
Look.

248
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,440
It's too late today.

249
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,000
Tomorrow.

250
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
I'll go to you tomorrow.

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
Let's talk about this.

252
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,800
Okay?

253
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,240
Besides, I...

254
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,360
Isn't the stuff with you?

255
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,440
I won't run away.

256
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
My brother is a lawyer.

257
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,320
I won't run away.

258
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,960
Remember.

260
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,240
Don't play tricks on me.

261
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,360
No.

262
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,080
Let's go.

263
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,720
Brother, stop being so ugly.

264
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,400
Tell me.

265
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,760
What's going on?

266
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,160
Who did you borrow the money from?

267
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,720
Why did they beat you?

268
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,920
Yubo.

269
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,200
Tell us the truth.

270
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,480
Did you meet something?

271
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,440
Okay.

272
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,880
Let's not talk about it today.

273
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,360
Where did you get

274
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,560
your father's money?

275
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,200
I didn't take it anyway.

276
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,640
I've already known it.

277
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,240
You took the money away.

278
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,480
I even saw the proof of your signature.

279
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
You're a loser.

280
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,440
You hurt your father like this.

281
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,200
Still don't tell me the truth.

282
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,280
Where did you get the money?

283
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,840
You let him wander the streets.

284
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,400
You...

285
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,160
You really want to kill him.

286
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
I didn't, brother.

287
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,200
Don't say that.

288
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,800
I...

289
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,040
Didn't my father always

290
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,960
ask me to marry?

291
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,240
I listened to him.

292
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm in love and I'm getting married.

293
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,320
But whoever I'm in love with,

294
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,760
they'll break up with me

295
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,920
after they hear that my father was in jail.

296
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,880
What can I do?

297
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,160
He,

298
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,520
you're in love and you're borrowing money?

299
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,000
You're in love and you're not cheap.

300
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,760
Then...

301
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,120
What's my condition?

302
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,960
What's your condition?

303
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,640
What's my condition?

304
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,360
Can we be the same?

305
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,000
Yubo.

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,720
You...

307
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,240
Tell us the truth.

308
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,720
How did you get the money

309
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,800
after you got married?

310
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,200
My girlfriend

311
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,640
said she could live with my father in the future.

312
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,600
It's convenient for her to take care of her father.

313
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,920
I think it's good.

314
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,240
But there's a prerequisite.

315
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,160
I have to buy a house.

316
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,680
Then I can have a new house when I get married.

317
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,960
So I pay the first payment.

318
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,800
She pays the loan.

319
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,640
Then I...

320
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
You paid the first payment with the money you got from the lottery?

321
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
What about the house?

322
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,880
Besides, you bought a house.

323
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,840
You shouldn't discuss it with your family.

324
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,600
I'm an adult.

325
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,560
I have the right to decide about our family.

326
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,400
I...

327
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,280
I...

328
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,520
Fine.

329
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,600
You decide

330
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,240
about your family.

331
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,880
Wife, let's go.

332
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,800
Then...

333
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,640
Don't be so stubborn.

334
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,520
If your mom asks you,

335
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,560
you should care about her.

336
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
Let's get this straight first.

337
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,480
Sister-in-law, you can't...

338
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,840
I'll slap you.

339
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,800
You paid the first payment with the money you got from the lottery.

340
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,640
Your girlfriend paid the loan.

341
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,200
How did you owe her?

342
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,560
Sister-in-law, it's not my girlfriend's fault.

343
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,960
She paid the loan for a month.

344
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,640
When it was time to pay the loan for the second month,

345
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,480
she said there was a problem with their company.

346
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
They couldn't pay the loan.

347
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
So she asked me to pay the loan first.

348
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,680
She said she had to pay the loan after paying the loan.

349
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,800
I don't have that much money.

350
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,720
I just borrowed the loan.

351
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,160
Do you want to know how to pay the loan?

352
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,680
My girlfriend said the company sent me the money

353
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,080
and gave me a loan to pay the loan.

354
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,280
Show us the house deed.

355
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,840
It's with my girlfriend.

356
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,800
Where's the house?

357
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,920
In the south.

358
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,120
Show us.

359
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,960
What time is it now?

360
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh, right.

361
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,160
My girlfriend said she couldn't see it now.

362
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,600
She said it's the seventh house.

363
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,480
Then you should have a seventh house.

364
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,360
Then...

365
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Yu Bo, show us your girlfriend.

366
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,880
Well...

367
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,600
Sister-in-law, you can't make it hard for her to see my girlfriend, right?

368
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,800
Oh, I'm so angry that my liver hurts.

369
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,680
Honey, look.

370
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,560
She's still protecting me even though she's hurt so much.

371
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,880
She didn't hurt me.

372
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880
We're here to buy a house.

373
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,920
She's nice to me.

374
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,880
She's very kind.

375
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,840
Really, sister-in-law.

376
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,440
Yu Bo.

377
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,560
You've paid so much for the house.

378
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,880
You don't know anything about house.

379
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,280
Just for these two days,

380
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,680
bring your girlfriend out.

381
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,920
We'll ask her in person.

382
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,120
Okay?

383
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,560
Okay.

384
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,800
You're such a liar.

385
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,440
I'm leaving.

386
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,000
I've told you to ask me.

387
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,640
Why are you scolding me?

388
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,040
I hope she didn't meet a PoA.

389
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
PoA?

390
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,040
I think women should understand the feelings of the people

391
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,080
and the feelings of the people.

392
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,440
They should be able to persuade us to be honest.

393
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,280
We should know the root cause of the problem.

394
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,600
We should find a reasonable solution.

395
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,800
We should have a relationship with the people.

396
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,960
I think women should be more enthusiastic.

397
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,920
It's the hardest to deal with the people.

398
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
The most difficult thing is to reason with them.

399
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
You should be more mature.

400
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,520
Start.

401
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,520
I don't think it's useful to me to ask her out.

402
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,640
Image creation is subjective.

403
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,120
I always say that there is no right or wrong.

404
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,720
You may prefer this.

405
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,400
I definitely like that.

406
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,600
So it's different.

407
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,240
If it's different, I think my difference

408
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,840
is my characteristic.

409
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,920
I'm sorry.

410
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm sorry.

411
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
I'm sorry.

412
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
I'm sorry.

413
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm sorry.

414
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm sorry.

415
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
I'm sorry.

416
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
I'm sorry.

417
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm sorry.

418
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm sorry.

419
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
I'm sorry.

420
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm sorry.

421
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm sorry.

422
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm sorry.

423
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I'm sorry.
