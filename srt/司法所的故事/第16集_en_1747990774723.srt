1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
The first person to get a job

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,600
is Zhang Yubing

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,960
The first person to get a job

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,360
I'm really in no mood now

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,800
I must pay you back

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,400
I...

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,600
I can't let you

8
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,000
put the interviewer in the interview

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,840
I can't run either

10
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,000
Do you think so?

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,600
Sang Yu

12
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,440
He met

13
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,040
I'm a POA

14
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,480
POA?

15
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,000
We must find a way

16
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,400
to get them here in time

17
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,920
The first person to get a job

18
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,400
is Zhang Yubing

19
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,040
The first person to get a job

20
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,000
is Zhang Yubing

21
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The first person to get a job

22
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,200
is Zhang Yubing

23
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
Morning, boss

24
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,400
Morning

25
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,000
Morning

26
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,200
Morning

27
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,400
You're in a good mood today

28
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,800
Okay

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Morning, everyone

30
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Morning

31
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,000
Beibei

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
How's your conversation with Shen Hao?

33
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,000
It's a bit long

34
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
Let's talk about it in the meeting room

35
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
I'll talk to you later

36
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Okay

38
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,800
Let's go

39
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,120
So he officially

40
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,800
went to the People's Conduct Committee

41
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,000
to ask for a solution

42
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
for the problem of Shen Hao's mom

43
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
and her health

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Shen Hao is really good

45
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,000
He will be staying there for a while

46
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,400
He also gave us a time

47
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,000
to find a way to get a job

48
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,000
That's right

49
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,400
Shen Hao's economic conditions

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,200
are indeed better than his brother and sister's

51
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,400
They just think

52
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,800
he's doing better

53
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,400
and want to give him to his mom

54
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,800
How can that be?

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
Is his brother and sister's economic situation

56
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,400
very bad?

57
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't think so

58
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
People with bad luck

59
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
are all good

60
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Even if you are your own new parents

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,200
you can't do anything for your daughter

62
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
and just throw away the package

63
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
We have to insist on

64
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,800
the behavior of bad luck

65
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,200
to happen in our eyes

66
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,200
We have to insist on

67
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
the behavior of bad luck

68
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,400
We have to say no

69
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But

70
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,400
his brothers and sisters

71
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
are not good at making trouble

72
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I guess our conditions

73
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
will be very difficult

74
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,000
What's so terrible about that?

75
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
We can't be sure

76
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,400
Shen Hao's family relationship

77
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
is more complicated

78
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
He said

79
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,600
his brothers and sisters

80
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,400
are all very difficult to deal with

81
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
So I think

82
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,600
we have to be very careful

83
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,000
about the conditions of these people

84
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Otherwise

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
it will be very difficult

86
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,400
The parents of Shangyang

87
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
are the legal reasons for their children

88
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
If they don't travel

89
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
and are evil

90
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
they may be punished

91
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
But

92
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
they have to take the responsibility

93
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,000
If they pursue their behavior that day

94
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,400
they will be punished

95
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
There is a saying in China

96
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,000
called

97
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
if you don't tell the truth

98
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
if the old lady doesn't tell the truth

99
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
we still can't solve it

100
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
Shen Hao said the same thing

101
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
He said that

102
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
his parents will never

103
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
be able to solve their own children

104
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
I will talk to the director of the street

105
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,000
about this matter

106
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
If necessary

107
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
we can make a big team

108
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
with the street and the police

109
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,000
We must have the old people

110
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to do as we please

111
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay

112
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I am the director of the police

113
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,800
Mr. Wang

114
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Sister

115
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,200
Are you off work?

116
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Why are you here?

117
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
We have dinner together

118
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,600
What's wrong?

119
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Sister, go

120
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
We are in the police

121
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,200
Go, go, go

122
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's have a chat

123
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,600
Let's have a chat

124
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,400
Boss

125
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
Chat

126
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Did you find the street loan company?

127
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,200
Yes

128
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,000
Can you help the local flow?

129
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Did you go with them?

130
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,000
I dare to

131
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,800
They will deduct it after I say it

132
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
I think so

133
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
I will go to see what's going on

134
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and find their place after I spend a lot of money

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The cousin is here

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,400
The cousin is here to pay the money

137
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Go in and talk

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Just talk here

139
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Yes

140
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
The body is here to pay the money

141
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
How much do you owe them?

142
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I don't know

143
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,000
How much do you owe them?

144
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Did you bring the money?

145
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I want to

146
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
But you have to tell me

147
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,600
how much he owes you

148
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
I will go back to pay the money

149
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,400
You are always the cousin

150
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,000
How can you prove that you are his cousin?

151
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,800
Do I have to prove it?

152
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
I am here to pay the money

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
not to pay the debt

154
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
Do people from the same company

155
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
come here to pay the money for him?

156
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
We still have to verify your identity

157
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
You have to work in the bank

158
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,600
to earn money first

159
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
You agree, right?

160
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Yes

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Then you go find him

162
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't do that

163
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Do you want money?

164
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Of course I do

165
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,200
Then tell me

166
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,400
how much he owes you

167
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,400
400,000

168
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
400,000

169
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
400,000

170
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
400,000

171
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Do you have a balance?

172
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes

173
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,400
The balance of the past

174
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
The balance of the past

175
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,800
and the balance of the future

176
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,600
The money and the income of the country

177
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
are all together

178
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
400,000

179
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
They also said

180
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
they estimated the price of the fish-fish-fish-fish-fish

181
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
at the bottom of the oil

182
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,600
is about 500,000

183
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
If the fish-fish-fish-fish-fish-fish

184
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
can't pay the money in the deadline

185
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
they will be angry with him

186
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,600
But the fish-fish-fish-fish-fish-fish-fish-fish

187
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,200
said he only borrowed 200,000

188
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,200
Even if the interest rate is over 300,000

189
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,400
he will become 400,000 in no time

190
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,600
I am also a nambu

191
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,800
I went out to find him

192
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
What did he say?

193
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
He said he only borrowed 200,000

194
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,800
but later he couldn't pay the money

195
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,600
Those people forced him to write a new loan

196
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
Later he wrote it twice

197
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
and he took away Yuan Xian

198
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
It became 200,000

199
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
400,000

200
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
They are not putting the loan on the high-end loan

201
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,400
They are putting the loan on the law

202
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Put the loan on the law

203
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
But from the first round

204
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
they are doing it without a doubt

205
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can't find the evidence

206
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
of them putting the loan on the high-end loan

207
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,800
Yuan Xian's loan has been destroyed

208
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,200
The current loan

209
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,000
is clearly black and white

210
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
400,000

211
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
They are the rulers of the legal system

212
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,000
The ruler of this thing

213
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
is still his girlfriend

214
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
If he didn't say he wanted to buy a house

215
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,800
and paid such a big loan to the nambu

216
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
how could he borrow the loan?

217
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,200
You have found this person

218
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
What kind of woman?

219
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
There are a few colors

220
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,200
I can't even see it

221
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
It's so dirty

222
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
I have to be very self-conscious

223
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Are you crazy?

224
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What do you think?

225
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
This woman

226
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
is not a part of the loan

227
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
for the nambu

228
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,800
This is hard to say

229
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,000
This is a legal control

230
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
It's impossible to do

231
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,600
Tian Yi Niu Feng in the procedure

232
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,400
We will take the opportunity

233
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to find a way

234
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
to catch them and punish them

235
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Eat two bowls

236
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't want to eat

237
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I have something else to eat

238
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You eat

239
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Eat two bowls

240
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't want to eat

241
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Qing Jia

242
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's all for today

243
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't worry

244
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Our daughter is here

245
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We will treat her like a biological daughter

246
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't worry

247
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't worry

248
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't worry

249
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's go

250
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Go back

251
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
May I ask Mr. Shen?

252
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes

253
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
We are from Chengxin

254
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I am Han Chou

255
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
This is He Bei

256
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Hello

257
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
What do you want to see me for?

258
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
We can go in and talk

259
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Okay, okay

260
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Please

261
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Li Li

262
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Here

263
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
You are also very hard

264
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,400
It's really not easy to get a hot meal

265
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
It's not easy

266
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Mr. Shen

267
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
I told you to buy tea

268
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
You always forget

269
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Look

270
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Don't worry

271
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
I am sorry

272
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
I will drink some white water

273
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Thank you

274
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Thank you

275
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Mr. Shen

276
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Mrs. Shen

277
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
We are here

278
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
to ask for your opinion

279
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
about Mrs. Shen's mother

280
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
We are here today to ask

281
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
how you arrange

282
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Mrs. Shen's life

283
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Do you understand?

284
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Yes, of course

285
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Is there any discussion

286
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
between your children and women?

287
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
What kind of discussion?

288
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
To be precise

289
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Mrs. Shen's nursing plan

290
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
It's like this

291
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
There is a plan

292
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
and discussed it

293
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
But

294
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,400
she has sent her mother to the old house

295
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
The old house

296
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
is now single

297
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
and the family conditions are good

298
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
It's not suitable

299
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
to take care of the old mother

300
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
The old house is young now

301
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
and has the ability

302
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
We are relieved

303
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
to have her nursing

304
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes

305
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
You two said the old house is Shen Hao, right?

306
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Yes

307
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
As far as I know

308
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
he has been abandoned since he was young

309
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
So he has nothing to do

310
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
with your mother now

311
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,400
You know it very well

312
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Shen Hao

313
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,400
has been abandoned

314
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
But

315
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
my mother

316
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
is also his biological mother

317
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
She should be in the hospital

318
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
for nursing

319
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
After all

320
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
my mother

321
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
has given her life, right?

322
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Have you discussed

323
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
the matter

324
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400
that Shen Hao gave to her mother?

325
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
What's there to discuss?

326
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Her life is given to her by her biological mother

327
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Is it also the right thing

328
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
for her to take care of the old woman?

329
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
What else do you want to discuss?

330
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
So you

331
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
just send her to the door of the house

332
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
and leave

333
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
It's none of your business

334
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Have you ever thought

335
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
if Shen Hao doesn't go home that day

336
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
then

337
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
shouldn't she

338
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
move in the cold

339
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
environment?

340
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
This is a big threat

341
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
to her mother

342
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Have you ever thought about it?

343
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
No wonder

344
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
she and her sister did this

345
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I went to see her

346
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
to see if she was okay

347
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Yes

348
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
That day

349
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Yu Li and other things

350
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
left first

351
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I didn't expect

352
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
my two sisters

353
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
to be so rude

354
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
How could they leave first?

355
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Okay

356
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Let's talk about the political issue

357
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Who's the mother

358
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
who lives in Shen Hao's house now?

359
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
But it's temporary

360
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
The obligation of raising her mother

361
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
is to be with you

362
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
and Shen Lan

363
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
This is a legal responsibility

364
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
You are the main reason

365
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
for raising her mother

366
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Can you understand that?

367
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Of course I understand

368
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
We are not fools

369
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
These years

370
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
we have always been

371
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
to bear the obligation

372
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
of raising her mother

373
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
We have never been to

374
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
find any trouble in Shen Hao

375
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
The current situation

376
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
is that

377
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
our situation

378
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
has changed

379
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Just now

380
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
the wife you met

381
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
at the door

382
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
is our relative

383
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
The wife

384
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
is about to enter the house

385
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
You know

386
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
the conditions in our house

387
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
There are so many people

388
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
So

389
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
we thought of Shen Hao

390
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Shen Hao

391
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
is my mother's

392
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
biological son

393
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Now

394
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
he is the one who comes to raise her

395
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
It's not too much

396
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Right?

397
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
To be honest

398
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I can understand

399
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
what you mean

400
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
From now on

401
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
you don't care about

402
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
the mother

403
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
You only care about

404
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Shen Hao, right?

405
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
We have already done it before

406
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
It's like a manager's gang

407
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Now this gang

408
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
is in Shen Hao's hands

409
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Exactly

410
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Look

411
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
We ran 100 meters before

412
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Now it's only 50 meters

413
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
No

414
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Now it's probably

415
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
less than 50 meters

416
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Why can't Shen Hao

417
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
keep running?

418
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Shen Hao

419
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
takes care of her mother

420
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
She has to

421
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
do what she has to do

422
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
She has the moral and conscience

423
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
If you and your two sisters

424
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
don't do this

425
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
you have to bear the legal responsibility

426
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
What are you talking about?

427
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Who told you to come?

428
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
At least my family

429
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
can use you

430
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
to say goodbye

431
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Go, go, go

432
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
You are not welcome here

433
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Li Li

434
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Su Ke

435
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
You are not well

436
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
and you are so angry

437
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Look at you

438
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
You have to bear the legal responsibility

439
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
to take care of her

440
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Let's go

441
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Let's go

442
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
We are

443
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
getting angry

444
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
to fix the divorce

445
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
It's not a waste of money

446
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Now

447
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
you know it

448
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Let's go

449
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Let's go

450
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Let's go

451
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
She doesn't want to talk

452
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
So we

453
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
will provide some

454
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
legal services and legal materials

455
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
to the other party

456
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
What should we do next?

457
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
The public legal service

458
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
will give her

459
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
a way to

460
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
take care of her next step

461
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
and solve the problem

462
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
In the process

463
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
there are some legal problems

464
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
The Ministry of Justice

465
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
has also

466
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
called the Ministry of Justice

467
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
12348

468
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
to call

469
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
to ask

470
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
If you don't feel comfortable

471
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
to call

472
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
you can go to

473
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Siva County

474
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
The authorities

475
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
take extreme care of her

476
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:57,400
And she has

477
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,920
Got back at the estuary

478
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,500
I always checked a cart

479
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,980
I always got渗
