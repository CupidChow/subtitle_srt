The First Episode

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,960
The First Episode

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,880
Shen Hao is my mom's biological son after all.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,360
If he doesn't do this,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,360
he'll have to take the legal responsibility.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,040
This is our home!

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,960
I don't need you to say anything.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,280
Go!

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,400
What kind of person is he?

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,600
He's not sick. I'm not allowed to eat now.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,360
Let's talk.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,840
He's very polite.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,120
Then why did you tease him?

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,720
You were the one who said that.

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,000
I didn't say anything. I just made sense.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,240
Some people laugh at others' words.

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,600
Others' words make others laugh.

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,640
You're the one who said that.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,360
I didn't mean to make you laugh.

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
I'm just trying to make it up.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,760
Or I'll beat you up.

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,720
I have a plan.

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,480
What should we do now?

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,720
I have an idea.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,720
Let's go talk to his son.

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
His son is about the same age as him.

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,560
He should be able to talk.

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,280
That's right.

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,600
He's smart.

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,520
But how can we find him?

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,560
Ask Shen Hao.

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,680
Okay.

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,480
I got it.

34
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm hungry.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,120
Okay. Let's find a place to eat first.

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,480
Then we'll think about it.

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,080
Let's go.

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,920
Let's go.

39
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,320
Hello, you're...

40
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,680
Brother Cheng.

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,440
I'm here to see you.

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,560
Are you planning to move out?

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,480
I don't want to live here.

44
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't want to see you either.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm near the school in Malin.

46
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,320
I found a small village.

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,200
Malin is going to be in high school next year.

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,600
I don't want to disturb his study.

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,360
What about the business license,

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
the medical certificate and the procedures?

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,400
They're all in the process.

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
These are all necessary.

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,640
I know.

54
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,600
That's good.

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,280
Oh, right.

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
You're getting divorced.

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,800
You're getting divorced.

58
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,680
What do you need in the future?

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,560
Come to our private room.

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
Find us.

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,280
Thank you.

62
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm leaving.

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Brother Cheng.

64
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,400
Wait a minute.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,960
I moved out with my son.

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,280
This is the key to the store.

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,440
I want you to give it to him for me.

68
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Okay. I'll give it to him.

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you.

70
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,240
Let's go.

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's go.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,240
Let's go.

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,440
Let's go.

74
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
Hello.

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,640
Chen.

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,320
I met a man in Shenhao's place

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,200
with Bebe.

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,080
Don't be so happy.

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,240
Help us do something.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
What's up?

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,440
Tell me.

82
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,200
Go find your mom.

83
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,040
I have a good idea.

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,000
What's up?

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,840
You're chatting?

86
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,760
Yes.

87
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,360
Did Shenhao go to work?

88
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,640
He went to work.

89
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,840
I'll go buy some food later.

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,360
He'll come back for dinner tonight.

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,840
I'll go with you to buy some food.

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,560
That's good.

93
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,760
You can go to my son's place for dinner tonight.

94
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,080
Take care of your lover.

95
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,760
We won't bother you.

96
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,680
I'll bring you back to the market.

97
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
I have something to do.

98
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
I won't bother you.

99
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,280
Let's go.

100
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,520
Take care.

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,160
Take care.

102
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,320
Sister.

103
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,440
Goodbye.

104
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,040
Mom Shen.

105
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,760
I heard your grandson is getting married.

106
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,840
I heard their words.

107
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,560
I don't know what they're talking about.

108
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,920
Where is he working?

109
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,680
I heard he's selling his phone.

110
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,760
Selling his phone?

111
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,840
That's great.

112
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,560
My son wants to buy another phone.

113
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,800
I'll ask him to buy it for me.

114
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay.

115
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,320
I don't know what his shop is.

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,600
I heard he's selling his phone.

117
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
He's selling his phone.

118
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,000
What's his name?

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,840
Shen Zhiwei.

120
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Shen Zhiwei.

121
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
His girlfriend is...

122
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,760
She's Huihui.

123
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,240
I can't remember her name.

124
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,640
If they get married,

125
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,840
you'll be a big fat boy.

126
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,800
You'll be a good boy.

127
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,080
That's great.

128
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,040
Yes.

129
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,960
When we first came here,

130
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,600
I was wrong.

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,840
You're both famous.

132
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm not a good man.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
I'm old.

134
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,240
What's the name of their shop?

135
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,120
Huihui's phone shop?

136
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,800
Or Zhiwei's phone shop?

137
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,280
I think Huihui's name is a bit too big.

138
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,560
Huihui?

139
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
Why?

140
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
What's the name of our shop?

141
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,280
It must be Han Chao's phone shop.

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,040
It's Beibei's phone shop.

143
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,800
Then we're good.

144
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,640
I think it's best if we open the shop.

145
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,280
Look, it's a word.

146
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,600
Chao.

147
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,120
Is that it?

148
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,520
It's really this name.

149
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,320
Welcome to the shop.

150
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,400
Do you have a phone?

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,080
You can open it.

152
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,760
Let's find Shen.

153
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,360
He's the one.

154
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm the one.

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We're from the Chengxin Court.

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,760
I'm Han Chao.

157
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,280
He's from Hebei.

158
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,240
The Court?

159
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,280
I didn't hear of it before.

160
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,000
You know it today, right?

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,520
Yes.

162
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,080
Chao.

163
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,920
Beibei, sit down.

164
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,040
Sit down.

165
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,640
Shen.

166
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,120
My name is Shen Zhiwei.

167
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,920
Zhiwei.

168
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,440
We're here to ask you for a favor.

169
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,000
We want to talk about your family.

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,720
About my family?

171
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,120
It's okay.

172
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,400
We can talk about anything.

173
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,880
Okay.

174
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
Then...

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,200
I heard that you're close to your grandma.

176
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,640
She's been taking care of you since she was little, right?

177
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,400
What's wrong with my grandma?

178
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,640
She's not doing anything.

179
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,040
She's living in your uncle's house.

180
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,280
Why is she living in my uncle's house?

181
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,160
She's living in my aunt's house, right?

182
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,760
By the way,

183
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,960
she should be living in our house this month.

184
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,720
We didn't have many friends before.

185
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Why is she living in her house?

186
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,240
It's not what your grandma wants.

187
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,640
It's your aunt, your aunt,

188
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,800
and your mom who sent her in.

189
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,320
Why?

190
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,560
You're right.

191
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
You're right.

192
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,480
You're right.

193
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,520
You're right.

194
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,760
Why is it better than me?

195
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
Okay, let me tell you.

196
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,080
In this way,

197
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,760
we just came out of your parents' house.

198
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,560
We just met our parents.

199
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,040
They said that they were getting married because of you.

200
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,160
They wanted to make the house a wedding room.

201
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
So that grandma can live in this house.

202
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,320
What?

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,960
This is not my idea.

204
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,760
Don't look at me.

205
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,280
That's my dad's fault.

206
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,600
It's not.

207
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,320
We came here not to blame anyone.

208
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,400
We just want to solve the problem.

209
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
Don't say that.

210
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,840
This is too embarrassing for my parents.

211
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,440
I said that grandma hasn't come back yet.

212
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,520
They thought of such a thing.

213
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,400
I'll find them a way to settle this.

214
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,120
Don't be impulsive.

215
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
Zhiwei,

216
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,280
we should try to solve this.

217
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,520
We can't be impulsive.

218
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,080
No.

219
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,440
Even if we get married in a house,

220
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,720
we won't be in grandma's house.

221
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,840
If this is spread out,

222
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,760
no one will scold us.

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,520
Huihui,

224
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
it's not your fault.

225
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,600
Don't be sad.

226
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
I'll take care of it.

227
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,440
Chao, Beibei,

228
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
don't worry.

229
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll take care of my parents.

230
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,000
Even if they don't want grandma,

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,840
I'll let grandma live with us.

232
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
Right.

233
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,320
I envy you two.

234
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
You two are good too.

235
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,080
I can see that.

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,640
Of course you can.

237
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,960
I can tell that

238
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,480
you two are a team.

239
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,680
But I haven't got

240
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,280
the recognition of grandma.

241
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,920
Chao,

242
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,240
come on.

243
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,960
But he took my brother away.

244
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
You have a brother?

245
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,080
Really?

246
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,320
Zhiwei,

247
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,360
your brother is so happy.

248
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,200
It's okay.

249
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,360
We'll be together.

250
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,160
We'll have brother and sister.

251
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,840
Zhiwei,

252
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,200
I'm counting on you.

253
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,080
Don't worry.

254
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,640
How about changing your phone?

255
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,440
It's cheaper.

256
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm leaving.

257
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,360
Bye.

258
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,720
Okay.

259
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,160
Bye.

260
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,520
Take care.

261
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,560
Take care.

262
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,080
Sister.

263
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,640
Here.

264
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,240
What's up?

265
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,920
Xiao Dong is here.

266
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,080
It's okay.

267
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,720
Here.

268
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Have a seat.

269
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,320
I'll get you some milk tea.

270
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,960
Chao,

271
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,280
why do you drink milk tea too?

272
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,120
Why can't a boy drink milk tea?

273
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,280
Who's not sure?

274
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,520
You're not sure?

275
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,440
No.

276
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,680
My boyfriend said

277
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,880
that a man drinks milk tea.

278
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,960
What?

279
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,280
He's a bit like a mother.

280
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
What?

281
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,440
What's wrong with you?

282
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,920
It's too chaotic.

283
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,360
You don't have to care about him.

284
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,480
He's my sister.

285
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,560
You're my aunt.

286
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,440
Xiao Dong,

287
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,760
this is your fault.

288
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
How can you care about Fang Suo's aunt?

289
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,960
It's my sister.

290
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
She's my aunt.

291
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,360
You're a fool.

292
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,560
What's the deal today?

293
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,160
Sister,

294
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,520
you always tell us

295
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,720
that we can't just talk about it.

296
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,120
You're not smart.

297
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,600
We're both smart.

298
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,160
How about the effect?

299
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,480
The effect is good.

300
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
And I think

301
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,720
Shen Han should be able to be his son.

302
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,760
That's great.

303
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,920
Xiao Dong,

304
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,960
go back first.

305
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,560
We have something to talk about.

306
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
I'll go find him

307
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,640
when you're done.

308
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,360
Okay?

309
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
Have a good talk.

310
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,800
Don't worry.

311
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,120
Well,

312
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,880
isn't there a sister

313
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,920
who's been passed down by the rules?

314
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,440
It's Shen Qiu.

315
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,280
You can ask him to do it.

316
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,440
See what he thinks about it.

317
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,480
Okay.

318
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,760
Come on, slow down.

319
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,480
This way.

320
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,600
Come on, this way.

321
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,040
Come on, come on.

322
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,920
Chen,

323
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,680
why did you bring the dog back?

324
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,000
I went to find Shen Dan just now.

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,520
Then I went to the vegetable factory with him.

326
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,440
When I went out,

327
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,520
I saw this white dog.

328
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,400
Don't say that.

329
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,920
When he saw me, he followed me.

330
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,560
Wherever I went, he was there.

331
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,640
I think he must have

332
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,960
lost his way with the owner.

333
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,320
I just stood there for a while.

334
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,640
But no one came to pick him up.

335
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,000
Then there was a big sister

336
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,720
who said that this dog was abandoned

337
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,080
and was there for several days.

338
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,200
Look.

339
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
Such a cute dog is still abandoned.

340
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:36,960
Yes.

341
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,280
So pitiful.

342
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,760
Yes.

343
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
There are many things like this now.

344
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Some people come to the market

345
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,880
and think of small animals.

346
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,680
But when they are adopted,

347
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,080
they find that it's a matter of trouble.

348
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,840
They are abandoned for two days.

349
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,560
It's irresponsible.

350
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,280
This little cat and little dog is also life.

351
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,840
Since they are adopted, they must treat them well.

352
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
This way, the abandoned is in society.

353
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,280
Isn't this causing trouble for others?

354
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,680
Haven't you seen the news online?

355
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,480
The abandoned cat and little dog

356
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,400
live in a very narrow and difficult space.

357
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,680
Their average life is about a year.

358
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,920
I've told my friends about raising small animals.

359
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,560
Before you think about raising small animals,

360
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,480
you must be a good student.

361
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,440
Right?

362
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,160
You can't just keep raising them.

363
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
Because once you raise them,

364
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,840
it's a matter of several years.

365
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,280
Even more than ten years.

366
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,960
They have spent your life with you.

367
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,400
They brought you happiness.

368
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,160
You have to take care of them.

369
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,040
These little animals know how to love.

370
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,280
Once they are abandoned,

371
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,480
they feel very sad.

372
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
What should we do now?

373
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,480
Why can't we keep them in the dormitory?

374
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,120
I was thinking.

375
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,880
If we put them in society,

376
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,680
it's not a matter of time.

377
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,000
Where should we raise them now?

378
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,920
It's a matter of time.

379
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,520
You didn't bring them back?

380
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,880
No.

381
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,120
Bai Lan is too famous.

382
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
My son loves small animals.

383
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,120
If he can raise them, I'll raise them sooner.

384
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,800
I want to.

385
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
But I think my parents don't agree.

386
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,720
I should be afraid of affecting the communication.

387
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
It's not possible for a male family.

388
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,200
I don't like it.

389
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,160
Your family is preparing for the pregnancy.

390
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,960
Well...

391
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,800
Why are you looking at me?

392
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,680
Your family is not famous.

393
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,800
You know what?

394
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
It's not famous.

395
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
No one is pregnant.

396
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,920
Who is pregnant?

397
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,000
It won't affect the education.

398
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,680
Enough.

399
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,040
You just want to send me home.

400
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,160
You just want to say it.

401
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,600
You still want to make a big circle.

402
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
Brother Chao, look at him.

403
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480
You should take him in.

404
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,760
I promise I'll like him.

405
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm sorry.

406
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,400
I won't be mad at you.

407
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,480
It seems I'm being forced.

408
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,200
How is it?

409
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,080
Are we done?

410
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,280
Wait a minute.

411
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,880
I have to do something.

412
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,400
Just accept him.

413
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,760
Okay.

414
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,600
Then follow me.

415
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,400
Great.

416
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,920
We have a new family.

417
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
Let's make a name.

418
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,840
What's the name?

419
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,000
It's called...

420
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,760
Be good.

421
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,000
Look at the name.

422
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,880
This name sounds good.

423
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,520
Be good.

424
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
That's right.

425
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,120
How about it?

426
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,320
You're the best.

427
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
Be good.

428
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,720
Chao.

429
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,480
You have to give him a dog ID.

430
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,760
And a cover.

431
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,240
And you have to put on the rope when you go out.

432
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,120
Do you understand?

433
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,720
Of course I know.

434
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,760
Take the dog in and take a shower.

435
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,560
Then go get the dog ID.

436
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,960
There are many people

437
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,120
who can communicate with each other.

438
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,280
Of course, you will face this kind of problem.

439
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,240
Some people are not good at talking.

440
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,040
Some people will choose to go to the hospital.

441
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,280
At the moment,

442
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,480
according to our name,

443
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,800
for example,

444
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,080
we have a kind of design

445
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,200
to enhance their consciousness

446
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,160
or their responsibility.

447
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Good night.

448
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,240
What are you doing?

449
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,640
I'm afraid of the mouse.

450
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,120
What's the only thing that's afraid of?

451
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,840
I'm afraid of the mouse.

452
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,120
How torn a dog is,

453
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,600
but wehal girthong.

454
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,120
You can't do that.

455
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,680
Look at his cheeks.

456
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,040
After six weeks,

457
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,680
Changa and Shaoyang lost in battle.

458
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,600
From this day,

459
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,080
she has afraid of the mouse.

460
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,840
A이컕 texing afraid of the mouse.
