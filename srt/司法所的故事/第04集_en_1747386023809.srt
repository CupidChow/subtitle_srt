1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
nice

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
But the foothills,

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,120
not only a few,

4
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:46,440
it's fulsome and

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,840
I want to report

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,860
and why are you there again

7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,720
It's me again

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,960
And today I reported you

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,840
What do you want to report

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,140
You tell me

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,040
I also wanna try

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,640
You say it

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,920
Nanxing, you are busy with your business

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,760
I'll talk to her about this

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,440
Let's go out and talk

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:02,960
What?

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Are you afraid that I report you for hiding your unethical behavior?

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,360
I hide my unethical behavior?

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,600
Okay, the director is here

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,280
You say it

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,280
How can I hide my unethical behavior?

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
She is a little third, shameless behavior

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,000
I hide the little third

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Who is the little third?

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
Hua Xiaorong

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,240
You two divorced

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,760
You can't pour the dirty water on her head

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,720
Look

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
This is not a cover

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,280
You are Hua Xiaorong's

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,560
I am her ex-husband

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,400
You can find a normal man

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,200
She is looking for a rich husband

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
How do you know?

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,960
If you don't know, you can't do anything

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Do you have evidence?

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,920
Of course I have evidence

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,880
Her mask is so ugly

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,600
I don't know

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,560
You can ask about her mask

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,840
Who gave her?

42
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,360
But I have to say it again

43
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,360
If you can talk to her

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,680
Let her share half of her income every month

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,680
I don't see her little third shameless behavior

46
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,160
We don't know about Hua Xiaorong

47
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,960
But the economic problem between you and Hua Xiaorong

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Is to use the judgment of the court

49
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,880
Or the divorce agreement

50
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,480
Related to the relevant regulations of the property division

51
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,320
In addition

52
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,080
We have no reason to persuade her

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,560
Let her give you half of the income of the hair salon

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,120
But you can't use any reason to threaten her

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,880
Let her share half of her income, right?

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,360
How do you talk?

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
What is threat?

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,640
I see it

59
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,960
You are all in the same group

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,960
Ok

61
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960
Wait for my ugly thing

62
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
I will let everyone know

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
I advise you

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,760
You should find a job seriously

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,000
Be independent

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,320
You are better than anything

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Better

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,960
You can persuade yourself

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,440
What's the situation with Hua Xiaorong?

70
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,520
Yesterday, Du

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Hid in the hair salon of Hua Xiaorong

72
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,120
I have no idea

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
I went to the salon in the middle of the night

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,280
To ask for money

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,880
I went to the salon in the middle of the night

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,640
What's wrong with the salon?

77
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,120
I really don't know about the salon

78
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,400
I sometimes go to the hair salon

79
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,360
But I can't go to a hair salon

80
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,120
And ask how the salon came

81
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,040
Yes

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,240
Or you can know it

83
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,720
Director

84
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,400
I am worried about you

85
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,200
According to what Hua Xiaorong said

86
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,600
Du, her ex-husband

87
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,480
Divorced because he liked gambling

88
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,840
I guess

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,640
He has no money these two days

90
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,440
So he went to the salon to make trouble

91
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,160
Ok

92
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,160
He Beibi

93
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
Come here

94
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,040
Hello

95
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,840
Hello

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
He Beibi is not here

97
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,120
Ok, call her when she comes back

98
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,080
Ok, bye

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,160
How great

100
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,640
levels sister

101
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,320
This is S GM

102
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,960
I am looking for you

103
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
What's wrong?

104
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,520
It's too troublesome

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,240
Take a look

106
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,000
Chen Qingqi

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
Box musketeer

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,200
Alma zmu

109
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,840
Yes, that's his house

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,600
The balcony on the second floor

111
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
was extended out

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
and installed on the door of the first floor.

113
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,680
How could it work?

114
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,960
How did it work?

115
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,200
That area

116
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
is the old residential area.

117
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,680
It's complicated.

118
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
When it was installed,

119
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,320
they didn't do any procedures.

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,240
They installed it secretly.

121
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,520
It's hard to let them demolish it now.

122
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,560
Right.

123
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
I think there's a son

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
in the Luo Man Man's family.

125
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,920
Right.

126
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,840
Well,

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,240
arrange it as soon as possible.

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
Have a meeting

129
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
at your judicial office.

130
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,320
When the legal review is over,

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,040
talk to the judicial office.

132
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,000
When you finally go to the judicial office,

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,720
you should do your job well.

134
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,360
Okay.

135
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,000
I got it.

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,040
Okay.

137
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm leaving.

138
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,680
Take care.

139
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,520
Sister Lan Xin.

140
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,560
You're back.

141
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,200
Did you find Zhou Hang?

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
We found the place where he lives.

143
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,920
It's the small house

144
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
that we rented with Mr. Liang.

145
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,800
Did Zhou Hang figure it out?

146
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,960
Sister Lan Xin,

147
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,320
you overestimate him.

148
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,040
What are you going to do?

149
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,760
I have a trick.

150
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,080
Look.

151
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,760
This is Zhu Li An.

152
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
It's possible that he's Zhou Hang's son-in-law.

153
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,080
The photos are so close.

154
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,320
It must be a different relationship.

155
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,360
This Zhu Li An

156
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,360
posted on Weibo

157
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,080
his intimate photos with Zhou Hang.

158
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,200
And he's still in the state of

159
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,680
not having a divorce with Zhou Hang.

160
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,480
Isn't he afraid that others will know

161
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,400
their relationship?

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,440
Is it possible that

163
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,280
he doesn't know

164
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,240
Zhou Hang's whereabouts?

165
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,120
It's possible.

166
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,280
But we can see it.

167
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,360
Liang Yin can't see it.

168
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
Doesn't he know Zhu Li An's existence?

169
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,000
You don't know

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,920
Liang Yin's obsession with Zhou Hang.

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
With his obsession,

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,280
even if he saw the photos on the train,

173
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,080
he might have another interpretation.

174
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,680
He won't think Zhou Hang is a ghost.

175
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,960
Sister Lan Xin.

176
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
Do we want to

177
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
tell this Zhu Li An

178
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,920
the real situation of Zhou Hang?

179
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,040
Of course.

180
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,440
Quiet.

181
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
At this time,

182
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,360
the British side

183
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
should be sleeping.

184
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,360
There's a time difference.

185
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,440
I think

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,720
he'll come back when he wakes up.

187
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,680
Hello, Li Kang.

188
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,600
What's up?

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,880
The doctor urged

190
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,600
Liang Yin to do the surgery as soon as possible.

191
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,320
Otherwise, it'll be troublesome.

192
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,960
But Zhou Hang doesn't answer the phone.

193
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,000
What should we do?

194
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,720
Don't worry.

195
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
We'll do our best

196
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,240
to find a way.

197
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,800
Liang Yin has been asking me

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
whether I should do the surgery.

199
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,840
I think

200
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,720
I should do it.

201
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,440
I think

202
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,360
I should do it.

203
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,680
He's been asking me

204
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,280
when Zhou Hang will come to see him.

205
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,080
I don't know

206
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,200
how to answer him.

207
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
Don't worry.

208
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,440
If we can't

209
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
change Zhou Hang,

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,320
we can still rely on the law.

211
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,280
Okay.

212
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,720
I'll wait for your news.

213
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,080
Bei Bei.

214
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,280
Let's go to the hospital

215
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
to see Liang Yin.

216
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,880
If he's in the legal aid area,

217
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,480
we can also

218
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,560
ask him to apply for legal aid.

219
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,760
Dating has to be scripted.

220
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,180
Dubbing她

221
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,320
is dangerous for the Devil's

222
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,880
Did you record it?

223
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:32,920
the

224
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
All right.

225
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,520
Mr. Lin is so nice to us.

226
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,200
Is he still mad at me?

227
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,960
He's really mad at me.

228
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,160
He wants to divorce me.

229
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,200
Help me persuade him.

230
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
Don't worry.

231
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,760
We'll do our homework.

232
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,720
Then, have a good rest.

233
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,440
We'll come to see you in two days.

234
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,840
Okay.

235
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,240
I'll see him off.

236
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
He still has a little fantasy about Zhou Han.

237
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
He always thinks Zhou Han is angry.

238
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,160
Were they in a good relationship before?

239
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,020
Yan ma aircraft,

240
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,680
we're also afraid you'll become too kind.

241
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,160
They love each other in college.

242
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,280
They share a similar background in the original family.

243
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,000
That's why they can talk well with each other.

244
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
and sympathize with each other.

245
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,320
Understand and sympathize

246
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,240
are not equal to love.

247
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,320
Why don't you tell us

248
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,520
what they were like at the time?

249
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,800
Right.

250
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,360
It will also help us

251
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,400
convince Zhou Hang.

252
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,080
Okay.

253
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,520
From the third grade,

254
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,400
Zhou Hang often came to the dormitory

255
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,200
to find Liang Yin.

256
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,480
Other people's love

257
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,720
is always a surprise.

258
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,680
You are good at this.

259
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,120
You are always surprised.

260
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,200
Go away.

261
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,040
Shut your disgusting mouth.

262
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,640
I don't have anything

263
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,880
to say to you.

264
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,960
You don't know how to play the guitar.

265
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,400
You can learn to play the violin.

266
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,280
How can you be so stubborn?

267
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,920
Okay.

268
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,400
I want to see

269
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,440
when you find a boyfriend

270
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,400
and sing a love song for you downstairs.

271
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,720
At this age,

272
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,080
you are not as crazy as him.

273
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,600
Stop looking. Let's go eat.

274
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,280
Let's go.

275
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,520
Later,

276
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,280
they almost never part.

277
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,560
They did everything together.

278
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,840
At that time,

279
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,080
he was planning

280
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,200
his future with Zhou Hang.

281
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,600
Li Ke.

282
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,400
Li Ke.

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Wait for me.

284
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,920
What's wrong?

285
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
Take me back to the dormitory.

286
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm running late.

287
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,400
You...

288
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,840
He used the time to work outside.

289
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,880
He went to work after class every day.

290
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
He will come back very late.

291
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,240
Liang Yin.

292
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,760
Li Ke.

293
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,160
You just came back.

294
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,200
You have an exam tomorrow.

295
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,040
Don't forget it.

296
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,840
I know.

297
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,240
I will definitely forget it.

298
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,480
I have to study.

299
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,680
Liang Yin used the money he earned from working as a junior worker

300
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,320
to rent a small house

301
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,760
with Zhou Hang.

302
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,000
At that time,

303
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,560
we were all very jealous

304
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,520
of the love and affection between them.

305
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,220
Zhou Hang was

306
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,240
banned from studying

307
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,120
because of his excellent grades.

308
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,600
Liang Yin also passed the test

309
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
with his own efforts.

310
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,400
When we

311
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,520
wanted to celebrate for him,

312
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,640
he suddenly told me

313
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,000
that he would give up studying.

314
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,640
You really decided that?

315
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,040
I can't do anything about it.

316
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
It's just that we are in a situation

317
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,240
where we can only

318
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,520
allow others to continue to do things.

319
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,400
Didn't his family

320
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,200
sponsor him when he went to school?

321
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,720
Why did he have to give up?

322
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,560
His family

323
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,120
is not equal to him.

324
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,600
He has long ignored his mother.

325
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,600
From the fourth grade,

326
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
his family completely broke his economic background.

327
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,760
So,

328
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,440
he earned money with you

329
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,360
just to earn his tuition.

330
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,960
Why didn't he go to work by himself?

331
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,840
He is a lazy person.

332
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,440
He also wanted to work.

333
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,480
I didn't give him a chance.

334
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,640
He is over you.

335
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
He can work

336
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,680
without his wife.

337
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,760
No.

338
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,000
Think about it.

339
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,360
As long as he can complete his studies,

340
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
study salt,

341
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:19,320
and then study

342
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
you don't have to worry.

343
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,000
We have made a deal.

344
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,440
As long as he can go to study,

345
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,560
we will get married first

346
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,320
and then he will go to study.

347
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,760
Before Zhou Hang went abroad,

348
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,400
they held a wedding.

349
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,040
First of all,

350
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,360
thank you for coming.

351
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,600
You are very kind.

352
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,280
You can come to my wedding

353
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,080
with Liang Yin.

354
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,680
I didn't know

355
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,960
if I was a sun-dressed man in my previous life.

356
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,040
I can hold hands with Liang Yin in this life.

357
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,760
I also know

358
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,320
I can't give you

359
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,040
a very rich life now.

360
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,640
But today,

361
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,400
I invite you all to come

362
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,680
to witness for us.

363
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,760
I promise

364
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,520
I will use my remaining life

365
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,360
to protect you,

366
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,560
make up for you,

367
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,960
and treat you well.

368
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,640
Good.

369
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,680
Cheers.

370
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,240
Come on.

371
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,240
Cheers.

372
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,960
Thank you all.

373
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,800
Come on.

374
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,000
Liang Yin.

375
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,280
I know

376
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,320
marriage is a hard thing

377
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,080
for a girl.

378
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,960
You gave me everything you had.

379
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,560
But now,

380
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,000
I can only give you

381
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
such an unparalleled wedding.

382
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,120
Please believe me.

383
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,360
I will spend my life

384
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,560
with you.

385
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,120
This is my promise.

386
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,360
Your hands are stupid.

387
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,480
I

388
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,200
took off such a ring.

389
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,560
But I made it with my heart.

390
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,120
Liang Yin.

391
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,360
I forgot to put it on for you.

392
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,080
I'm willing to.

393
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,760
Oh my god.

394
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,400
This is so romantic.

395
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,800
What should I do?

396
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,680
Liang Yin.

397
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,840
This ring

398
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,760
is a promise

399
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,480
and a career.

400
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,200
I believe that

401
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
in the future,

402
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,400
I will buy you

403
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,240
a big ring just like this.

404
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,080
Again, I swear

405
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,400
that

406
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,720
I will be loyal to you.

407
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,560
For some girls

408
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,360
I think men are more happy when they are in a relationship

409
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,560
Sometimes when a girl comes out

410
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,160
I think you are not as good as a boy

411
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,760
But I think we are in this aspect

412
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,360
Although it's a big pressure

413
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,960
But I think girls have their own characteristics

414
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,760
We can be more patient

415
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,960
And we can be more passionate

416
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,760
The teaching is in front

417
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,360
But we also talk about friendship

418
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
So from the perspective of friendship

419
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,560
We say that friendship is limited

420
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
And we use the opposite to the base

421
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,760
The bottom is not dry and the bottom is not too thick

422
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,960
It's me again

423
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,360
I'm the one who took it off

424
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,160
Yes

425
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,760
It's good to have a hand to hold it

426
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,160
Then you can talk to him

427
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Just like this

428
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Ready to stand up

429
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Look at him

430
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560
He is so calm

431
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,760
You have to read it

432
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,360
Then he said OK

433
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,560
You can't just put it on your head because you are married

434
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,160
See, there is no violence
