Episode 1

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,000
You...

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You...

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You...

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What are you doing?

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,000
You went to the hospital a few days ago

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
to check the results.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The doctor said I was fine.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I was just too nervous.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Too nervous?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why are you nervous?

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Episode 1

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
After boiling for three hours,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
you can steam the chicken.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Come on, Xing.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Come on.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I...

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Come on.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Come on.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The soup is made with pepper.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Come on.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Mom, what are you doing?

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Son, eat it.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's a big fire.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's going to burn in the nutrition.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nuanqi,

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
there are only two legs of chicken.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Mom, I know

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
there are three legs of chicken

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that haven't been born yet.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm so angry.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then I'll give it to you.

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mom, why are you angry?

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't love you, have some.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He said he doesn't like it.

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes, he does.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Nuanqi,

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
it's 38 today, right?

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Mom, it's 35.

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
35 is not small.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I don't think

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
you are anxious about the baby.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Anxious?

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are not anxious.

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Didn't you go to the hospital to check it?

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's not a problem.

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You always tell me

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
it's not a problem.

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's the use?

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ask Nuanqi

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
to color it.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What should we do?

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why don't you

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
take care of it?

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you here

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to see me

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
or to be angry with me?

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Mom, don't be angry.

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You are right.

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How can you talk so much?

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You think

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
you are 20 years old?

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm wrong in some words.

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Have some.

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My goodness.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I really helped her.

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know her.

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You are her husband.

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why are you angry with her?

72
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I am not that kind of girl.

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I will give you a chicken leg.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can do anything.

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can beat you.

76
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Be normal.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I am not normal.

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In the future,

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you can do whatever you want.

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't fight with her.

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's go home

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and have a fight.

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We can chat

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and have a good time.

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
My goodness.

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will help her.

88
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why are you coming here?

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Be careful, Mr. Wang.

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Slow down.

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Slow down.

92
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't be anxious.

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You are anxious.

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You will be gone in a few days.

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay.

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Mom,

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I need some rest.

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, give me the stuff.

100
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Come, help me.

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Wait a minute.

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Slow down.

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

104
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay, wear it.

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't be so anxious.

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I am not.

108
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I went to a small new place today.

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's a bit far.

110
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I went there

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to adjust

112
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the distribution of a noodle house.

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A girl

114
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
has to

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
get a house

116
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
by her

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
to pay

118
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the medical expenses

119
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
of her mother.

120
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What's wrong with her?

121
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's serious.

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
She seems to have a long-term fever.

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This man

124
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
gave this woman

125
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
a house

126
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
before,

127
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
but now she wants to take it back.

128
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Here's the thing.

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This man

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
lied to this girl

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
that he was single.

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But in fact, he is old.

133
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Now his wife knows

134
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
that she must

135
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
take back the man

136
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and give him

137
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
a gift for another woman.

138
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There is a patient

139
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
in this house.

140
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's so hard.

141
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Dad, how is it?

142
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay, okay.

143
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll be right there.

144
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay.

145
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Put the clothes on the table.

146
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What are you doing?

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What are you doing?

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What are you doing?

150
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let me help you.

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you doing?

154
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let me help you.

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let me help you.

157
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let me help you.

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let me help you.

159
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wait.

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Dad,

161
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you should open the door.

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't do this to your wife.

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Open the door.

164
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What's wrong?

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Dad,

166
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
open the door

167
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
for his wife.

168
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You bastard.

169
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Open the door.

170
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Open the door.

171
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Dad,

172
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
don't open the door.

173
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's knock out.

174
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Who is he?

175
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
He's knocking.

176
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,320
Open the door.

177
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,560
You... You stay here.

178
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,040
I'll go find the private office's Chen Laoguo.

179
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,560
He'll definitely open the door for you.

180
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,360
I'll go first.

181
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,680
You go first.

182
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,200
No, no, no.

183
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,080
I'll go by myself.

184
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,680
Stop it.

185
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,600
Don't knock.

186
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,840
Open the door.

187
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,920
Don't spend my money.

188
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Open the door. I'll knock.

189
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,520
Open the door.

190
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,120
Don't.

191
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
I'll go.

192
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,840
Open the door.

193
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,360
Open the door.

194
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,480
Open the door.

195
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,640
Open the door.

196
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,360
Don't knock.

197
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,040
Open the door.

198
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,520
Boss Chen is here.

199
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,960
Open the door.

200
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,520
What's going on?

201
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,640
Boss Chen.

202
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,360
You're here.

203
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,440
Ma Puchun has a big sister-in-law.

204
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,080
She's holding a bag.

205
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,880
Ma Puchun.

206
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,680
Open the door.

207
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm Chen Zhengyang.

208
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
You...

209
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,320
You want to take my door away?

210
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,520
Xiaolei.

211
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,800
Are you okay?

212
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,920
Boss Chen is here.

213
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,640
How did he treat you?

214
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,600
You told Chen Zhengyang.

215
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
He's the master.

216
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,520
What master?

217
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
He just slept in the middle of the night.

218
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,560
What are you doing?

219
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Are you sleeping?

220
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes.

221
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,040
What did you do just now?

222
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,200
You told Boss Chen.

223
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,720
You hit him for a long time.

224
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,360
Did you see my man?

225
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,560
I saw it.

226
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,640
I saw it, too.

227
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,560
Yes.

228
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,560
And I've been staring at you for a long time.

229
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,160
Boss Chen, did you hear that?

230
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,320
He's been staring at me for a long time.

231
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,760
This is a steal.

232
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,720
I'm telling you.

233
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,760
Stealing is a way to cheat the trend.

234
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,760
Ma Puchun,

235
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,440
don't be so stupid.

236
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,080
You've been working so hard for the night.

237
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,120
How can they not come to see you?

238
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,880
They...

239
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,440
They've broken the door.

240
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,240
If the door is broken, they can accompany you.

241
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,360
If the person is broken,

242
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,880
you'll be responsible for the new thing.

243
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,520
Do you know that?

244
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,200
Yes.

245
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,000
Wenyin.

246
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Come here.

247
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Come here.

248
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,560
Did you tell them that I hit you?

249
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,320
Sorry to bother you.

250
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,360
I'm fine.

251
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
Did you just say that I hit you?

252
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,120
No.

253
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,400
Did you hear that?

254
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,600
Go to bed early.

255
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,600
He's too arrogant.

256
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,440
How about this?

257
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,240
If he's a murderer,

258
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,240
you'll directly hit 110.

259
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
If he doesn't wake up,

260
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,080
he won't be ashamed.

261
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,160
Okay.

262
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,720
No.

263
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,600
I see.

264
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,080
Okay.

265
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,840
You've worked hard.

266
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,680
I'll go back first.

267
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,560
Okay.

268
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,480
Okay, bye.

269
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,320
Take care.

270
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,680
Okay.

271
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,160
Go.

272
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,560
Xiao Shui.

273
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,960
You.

274
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,760
Look after him.

275
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,280
Me?

276
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,200
Xiao Shun.

277
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,280
I'll look after him.

278
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,920
Wang Cheng.

279
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,720
You didn't rest well last night?

280
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,600
I went to adjust the night shift.

281
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
That Huaxiao Rong

282
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
sent me a message all the time.

283
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,840
He said that Duan Mohao told him

284
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,600
that he would take back the room.

285
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,280
His face is faster than his book.

286
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
Huaxiao Rong once told me

287
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,120
that Duan Mohao's parents passed away early.

288
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,920
No one loved him.

289
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,760
He got married so easily.

290
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,600
His wife passed away with illness.

291
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
He's been lonely for so many years.

292
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,200
It seems that

293
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,040
he's a sad and lonely man.

294
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,760
He's the most capable man.

295
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,200
But

296
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,440
Duan Mohao is so much bigger than Huaxiao Rong.

297
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
Is he really in love with him?

298
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,640
He really doesn't know that he has a family?

299
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,400
And he can hide this for so long.

300
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,200
I don't believe it.

301
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,000
I've investigated this matter with Chen.

302
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,720
According to Chen and Han Chao,

303
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,560
Huaxiao Rong

304
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,360
doesn't know Duan Mohao's family.

305
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,680
Look at Du.

306
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,000
He admitted it, too.

307
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,280
He followed Duan Mohao

308
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,080
to find out that he has family.

309
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,000
This Huaxiao Rong's mother

310
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,080
is very serious.

311
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,840
Yes.

312
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,000
And his brother is only second.

313
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
He's still in his early days of graduation.

314
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,440
That means

315
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,960
the income of the hotel

316
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,320
is important to Huaxiao Rong.

317
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,240
Yes.

318
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,720
But his brother also expressed

319
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,280
that he supported his sister

320
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,600
and Duan Mohao's breaking up.

321
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,760
He said that he can prove it.

322
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,640
But the problem is that

323
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,400
this matter is very difficult to solve.

324
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,920
If Wang Lianhua

325
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,120
is willing to take that door interview room,

326
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
then this matter

327
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,560
will be solved only by the lawsuit.

328
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,360
Then we try to solve it.

329
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,520
We try to convince Duan Mohao

330
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,400
to solve the dispute with the lawsuit.

331
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,240
We try not to lawsuit.

332
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,360
To lawsuit is to be paid for.

333
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,920
Yes.

334
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
To be honest,

335
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,280
I think the biggest damage

336
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,480
caused by the dispute

337
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,720
is Duan Mohao's wife.

338
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,680
Think about it.

339
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,240
The husband is out of the house.

340
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,440
The wife is not worth it.

341
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,080
The property is damaged.

342
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,920
We have to pay for it.

343
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,200
No one can help us.

344
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,240
You're right.

345
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,880
The owner of this matter

346
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,120
is Duan Mohao.

347
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
He's the one who's in trouble.

348
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,720
This person

349
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,360
is very good at it.

350
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,080
But I think

351
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,600
we can't exclude Huaxiao Rong

352
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,040
from the main business of the hotel.

353
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,520
If he is strong at first,

354
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,240
he will be independent and strong.

355
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,760
He has been doing other work for so long.

356
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
He may not make enough money

357
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,680
to pay for his mother's medical expenses.

358
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,680
But Huaxiao Rong is very hard-working

359
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,600
in this business.

360
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
We can't

361
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
think that Huaxiao Rong has no problem.

362
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,720
The owner of this case

363
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,880
is very thoughtful.

364
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,880
Then it's hard to resolve it.

365
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,800
You say he is a case-maker.

366
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,960
He said he is a real lover.

367
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,880
Then how can we judge this?

368
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
We just need to

369
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,560
take action from the facts.

370
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,800
You seem to be very similar

371
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
to Huaxiao Rong.

372
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
It doesn't exist.

373
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,840
I think

374
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,040
we should...

375
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,840
You see,

376
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,000
we should

377
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,560
focus on three points.

378
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,760
First,

379
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,960
Huaxiao Rong is not

380
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,160
aware of Duan Mohao's marriage.

381
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,040
Second,

382
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,800
Duan Mohao is the owner of this hotel.

383
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,520
Third,

384
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,440
Huaxiao Rong is trying

385
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,520
to inspire your money

386
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,600
for his deposit.

387
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,480
So he is

388
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,920
behind the windworks.

389
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,680
I think we should

390
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,840
ogy we should organize with fairness and Justice Flores.

391
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,960
You can have your own opinion

392
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,200
and emotion.

393
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,640
But it shouldn't affect

394
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,880
your judgment of

395
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,120
the legal government возьs a case.

396
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,560
Han Shang,

397
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,280
you just ignored the law.

398
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,400
There isrie you are more 93 Elliott

399
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,280
involved

400
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:49,680
when there is not more law.

401
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,440
Many things are in accordance with the law, but not in accordance with the law.

402
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,880
That's right. We should learn from the law.

403
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,680
But I can't let go of the law about these things that are not in accordance with the law.

404
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,880
But as a person who is a person of the law, we must still follow the law.

405
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,680
So the law is not in accordance with the law, right?

406
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,180
Yes.

407
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,380
Your true self is quite interesting.

408
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,780
But what is the purpose of our business today?

409
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,780
We need to discuss a solution.

410
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,980
As long as we are from this...

411
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,680
Wang Lianhua is a key figure in the business.

412
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,480
This problem will be solved, right?

413
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,580
If you want to ask anything, just ask.

414
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,180
If you have made it clear, it might be better.

415
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,680
Duan already told me.

416
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
I just want to hear a true story.

417
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,580
Is he looking for you first or is it you who is looking for him first?

418
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,080
I have already broken up with Duan.

419
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,380
This whole thing...

420
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,480
I didn't understand.

421
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,580
My responsibility is not to blame others.

422
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,080
Then...

423
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,380
Then this door interview room...

424
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,880
Is it the one that Duan gave you?

425
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,380
Or is it you who wanted it?

426
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,380
I did something wrong.

427
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,080
Duan looked at me pitifully and sympathized with me.

428
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,780
So, he gave me this door interview room.

429
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,180
Duan...

430
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,780
As a condition, you have to control yourself.

431
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,480
Besides the key is to correct your position other than identifying yourself.

432
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,080
We may not be able to makeац a story.

433
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,180
So, from this moment on,

434
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,080
no Commentaries will come and sit at your zodiac.

435
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Da Will gives us some direction,

436
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,880
making a formal statement.

437
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,380
But at the same time, all the scenes will...

438
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,380
I was just looking at him

439
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,380
But he was just standing there

440
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Then we had a chat

441
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,380
Many people told me that after listening to my thoughts

442
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,380
They said, oh, it's different from what I thought

443
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,380
It's not like everyone is not really

444
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,380
You can only follow me

445
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,380
Because it's totally different

446
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,380
Even if I have a little bit of a connection

447
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,380
It will be better

448
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,380
That is to say, all the groups are more deep than me
