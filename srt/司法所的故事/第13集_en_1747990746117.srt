1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
You can enjoyØ®

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,040
in strong love

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,880
or, in connecting relationships.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,040
Or in applying for a job,

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,680
it's okay.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,520
Later,

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,160
we may need a favor.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,280
Correct.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,120
Everyone said

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,000
What kind of attitude will we have today?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,880
I can't say.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
It's hard to say.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,880
You can't say?

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,440
If you make a mistake,

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,680
you can't agree with Shi You.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,720
Really?

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,640
I've seen this person before.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
He looks like a teacher,

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,320
but he's not a good speaker.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,360
I can't say anything

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,920
if I meet such a thing.

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Naqin,

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,480
I understand your feelings.

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,040
In this incident,

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,040
you were hurt.

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,600
Duan Baohua used the man's means

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,320
to deceive others' feelings

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,040
and hurt the people who were deceived by him

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
and also hurt women and families.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
But

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,360
since this incident has been exposed,

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,480
we must be at the bottom of this.

34
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,360
We can rely on the power of law

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,000
to make every part of the world work.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,320
Da Meizi,

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,200
this incident

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,440
is a mistake.

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,600
He and Hua Xiaorong's relationship

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,840
have been reversed.

41
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,600
And after Hua Xiaorong learned

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,480
the truth about the incident,

43
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,240
he chose to break up with Duan Baohua.

44
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,720
If you have any opinions

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,240
or suggestions,

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,080
you can tell us.

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,800
We can understand them.

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,200
I heard that

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,000
,

50
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
he

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
had a brother in Shang University, right?

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,040
That's correct.

53
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
I am actually not

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,360
that thi Earthen,

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
nor very swordless.

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,640
I also never

57
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,920
talk about what I did,

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,200
I was 19 when I married Duan.

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,200
I worked with Duan Baohua in the construction site.

60
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Then, the business got bigger.

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I had a good life and money.

62
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,200
I thought of coming back to take care of my family,

63
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,200
take care of my children, take care of him.

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,200
We are also true love.

65
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Who would have thought of us?

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,200
As for this house,

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
I'm not going to be back.

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm not that ungrateful.

69
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
But, don't be anxious.

70
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Give me some time.

71
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Let me think about it.

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Then, this is our card.

73
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Think about it first.

74
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
If you have a good idea, call us anytime.

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Sister, we are leaving.

76
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I'm so hungry.

77
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm so hungry.

78
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Why are you so fast?

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm so hungry.

80
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Drive the car.

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,200
I can't afford to pay for the whole day.

82
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
How many do I have to pay for?

83
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
I'm not a scholar.

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm a rich woman.

85
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm doing this for the sake of learning.

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I didn't spend the money on other places.

87
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
You are learning from drawing.

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Xiaolei said she is learning to participate in the exam.

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,200
And she said she will study more skill.

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,200
She will have a new way to go when she is in the college.

91
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
She knew she would come to me every day.

92
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
She was so stupid.

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,200
No, who dares to take that stupid thing?

94
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
You are so brave.

95
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
I have to wait for you.

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
What do you want to do?

97
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
What are you doing?

98
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Are you okay?

99
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Are you okay?

100
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Two bowls of three-spice noodles.

101
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
No.

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
I'm not going to sue you.

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Why are you so quiet?

104
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
I've never seen you do this.

105
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Give me the money.

106
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
No, no.

107
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Help me with the next bowl of three-spice noodles.

108
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,200
I will send it to the sixth floor.

109
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Sister Fu, what are you so anxious about?

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
You are here too?

111
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
That's great. You can help me.

112
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Manager Liu.

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Come here and tell them what's going on.

114
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
In the afternoon, there were three or four-year-old women.

115
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
They brought an old lady.

116
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
They said they wanted to find Mr. Shen from the sixth floor.

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Then they brought them here.

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
They don't know where they are going after a while.

119
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
The old lady is here.

120
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Come here.

121
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Wang, who are the three people who brought you here?

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,200
I said, who are the three people who brought you here?

123
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I've been asking her.

124
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
She can't hear or say it clearly.

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I think the old lady is not really confused.

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
The old lady is also looking at the face.

127
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
If she really is her three daughters,

128
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
she will feel very embarrassed.

129
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
She can't hear it on purpose.

130
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
She probably doesn't want us to know.

131
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
What should we do now?

132
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
We can't let my wife sit here all the time.

133
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
What if she breaks the door?

134
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Manager Liu.

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
You said that the person who brought her here

136
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
was looking for Mr. Shen.

137
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Yes.

138
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Could it be Shen Hao?

139
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
You mean,

140
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,200
the old lady has something to do with Shen Hao?

141
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Shen Hao was last night.

142
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
How can he say that?

143
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
He said that he was looking for Mr. Shen.

144
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
He said that he was looking for Mr. Shen.

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
I think he is not in the right time.

146
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Hurry up and let him come back.

147
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
I'll call him.

148
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Hello.

149
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
The number you are trying to reach is not connected.

150
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Who is it?

151
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
The key is turned off.

152
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Send him a message.

153
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Tell him to call you right away.

154
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I just sent you a message.

155
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
The three women who just sent you here,

161
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
are they your children?

162
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Sister Fu.

163
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
This old lady

164
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
should be related to Mr. Shen Hao,

165
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
who just moved in.

166
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
If those three women

167
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
are really the old lady's daughter,

168
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
she doesn't want us

169
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
to know that she is pregnant.

170
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
She is looking at us.

171
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
What should we do now?

172
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Why is there no one like this?

173
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
We can't let the old lady

174
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
sit here all the time.

175
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Yes.

176
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm here to see Old Cheng.

177
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
He lives in this small area.

178
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
It's convenient.

179
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I'll call Old Cheng.

180
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Hello.

181
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Old Cheng.

182
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm Fu Lanfang.

183
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
You are here.

184
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I'm Fu Lanfang.

185
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
You come to the little area's downstairs.

186
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Six holes.

187
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Come here.

188
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
We'll wait for you here.

189
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Old Cheng, come here later.

190
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Sister Fu.

191
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Do you want Old Cheng

192
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
to take this old lady back

193
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
and stay with me there?

194
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I don't think it's good.

195
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
But what can we do now?

196
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Well,

197
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
you can call Shen Hao.

198
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Let's see.

199
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Yes, I'll call him now.

200
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I'll ask him.

201
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
I'll give you a call.

202
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
I'll call him.

203
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes.

204
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
He'll be here soon.

205
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I'll see him.

206
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Sorry.

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
He's coming.

208
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
I'll call him.

209
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Yes.

210
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
He's coming.

211
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I'll call him.

212
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
He's coming.

213
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
I'll call him.

214
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
OK.

215
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
OK.

216
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
OK.

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I'll call him.

218
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I'll call him.

219
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
See you later.

220
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
See you later.

221
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Let's play a game.

222
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,120
Grandma.

223
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,600
This old mother is our neighbor.

224
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,640
She lives in the sixth cave.

225
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,440
Her child is not at home.

226
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,760
Let's sit here for a while.

227
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,480
You're really a big Chen Chunyang.

228
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,520
You usually go out at night

229
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,800
to do business.

230
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,960
You brought a mother today.

231
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,360
No.

232
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,120
Tao Ruo.

233
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,040
Why do you do business

234
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,080
like hitting a husband?

235
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,240
You're still angry.

236
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,760
Come on, Bai Lan.

237
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,360
Let me explain.

238
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,240
Let me explain.

239
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,840
What are you doing?

240
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:40,960
Bai Lan.

241
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,200
Let me explain.

242
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
She's not like this.

243
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,960
I'll go out and talk to her.

244
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,600
Don't worry.

245
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,240
Come on, Bai Lan.

246
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,120
Bai Lan.

247
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,880
She's so personality.

248
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,800
She's fun.

249
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,400
Fun.

250
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,640
It's really hard for you, Mr. Yan.

251
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
No, no, no.

252
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,720
I'll go call my mom.

253
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,560
I'll call your mom.

254
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,080
Bai Bai.

255
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,880
No need.

256
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,360
She's staying here.

257
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,320
It's okay.

258
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,000
It's okay.

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,960
It's okay.

260
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,440
Bai Lan needs to be angry.

261
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,120
Hello, mom.

262
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,080
What did you introduce to me?

263
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,200
What?

264
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,040
Shen Hao.

265
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
He abandoned his mom to me.

266
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
What's going on?

267
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,000
You're still

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,720
a father to him.

269
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,640
How could he be like this?

270
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,840
I went to his mom.

271
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,560
No.

272
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,360
His mom is in my apartment.

273
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Where did she go?

274
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
Why is she in your house?

275
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,400
I said Shen Hao's mom.

276
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Yes.

277
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,040
She's staying in our house.

278
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,520
She's staying at your house.

279
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,920
She's coming back to see you.

280
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,520
My mom said Shen Hao's mom

281
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,080
is in our house.

282
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,600
I heard it.

283
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,560
Then who is this mom?

284
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,920
Who's mom?

285
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,360
She's not Shen Hao's mom.

286
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,320
Shen Hao.

287
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,440
Sister.

288
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,160
Hello, Shen Hao.

289
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,480
Sister.

290
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,480
Why did you turn off the camera?

291
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,960
I just got off the plane.

292
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
You got off the plane?

293
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,280
Yes.

294
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,000
What's the matter with the doctor?

295
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Nothing.

296
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,160
There were three women

297
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,240
putting an old mom

298
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
in the entrance of the building.

299
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,320
I thought

300
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,320
they were looking for Mr. Shen.

301
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,080
It's okay.

302
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,680
Let them call them.

303
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,840
They left after they put her in the car.

304
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,680
You bastard.

305
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,040
What?

306
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,720
What?

307
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,480
I'm sorry.

308
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,600
I didn't mean to say you.

309
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,160
I'm not back today.

310
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,240
Can you please

311
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,560
take care of her for me?

312
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,920
I'll tell you my family's secret.

313
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,520
Please take her to my house.

314
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,640
Okay.

315
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,440
Okay.

316
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,360
Bye.

317
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,920
How's the situation?

318
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,800
It's settled.

319
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,600
Mr. Shen.

320
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,600
You're looking for her, right?

321
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,680
Where's the man?

322
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,160
Where's the man?

323
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,520
Where's your mom?

324
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,320
Where's your wife?

325
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,160
You want to know?

326
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,040
You bastard.

327
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,360
How dare you talk to your dad like that?

328
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,040
I'm talking to you.

329
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,080
Your wife left it for you.

330
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,120
You're not standing there?

331
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,040
Is this your mom's?

332
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,800
I think it's your little bastard

333
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,880
who helped her.

334
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,280
Yes, I did.

335
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,760
My mom followed you

336
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,480
and treated you like a emperor.

337
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,720
What about you?

338
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
How did you treat her?

339
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,400
You don't deserve my mom.

340
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,680
You little bastard.

341
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,520
You're shouting

342
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,880
to me, you little bastard.

343
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,360
Tell me where your mom is.

344
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,960
Can I pick her up?

345
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,400
You don't need to pick her up.

346
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,360
My mom said

347
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,720
she couldn't live with you anymore.

348
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,240
Yes.

349
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,920
I've already recognized her.

350
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,760
Do you know

351
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,160
the word she's in her room?

352
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,480
You've already

353
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,080
got her in my mom's heart.

354
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,480
You can't go back.

355
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
You...

356
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,440
Chinese Traditional Chinese Art

357
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,480
Chinese Traditional Chinese Art

358
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,440
The traditional Chinese art

359
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,000
is more beautiful,

360
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,720
more talkative,

361
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,560
more talkative.

362
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,480
And the contradiction in the family

363
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,720
is often said

364
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,000
in the past.

365
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,840
The old people are doing the right thing.

366
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,040
We can't just say

367
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,560
this is a complete mess.

368
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,600
Since we can still walk here,

369
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,440
it's actually

370
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,520
a problem that we can solve.

371
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,360
Since we can solve it,

372
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,320
we should just

373
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,400
spend more time on it.

374
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,280
It's not too big of a problem.

375
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
If you want to be a doctor,

376
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,440
I'll give you 10, 8, 9, 9.

377
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,040
Really?

378
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,880
Yes.

379
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,720
You've never seen this person before.

380
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,120
It looks like he's a doctor.

381
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
