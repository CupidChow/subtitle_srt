00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
King of Words

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Luckily, there's a few lessons required

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,880
to maintain order.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,040
Nice, beautiful!

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,480
Come back.

6
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,640
Hurry.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,100
Stay straight.

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,960
Come on, stand properly, go to the temple for Fields again.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,880
Run, come on.

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,360
Let me take a picture with you on the phone.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,000
Hop!

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,800
Hop!

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,080
transient.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,000
Co effù?

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,760
Co effù?

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,500
Correct, that's it.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,280
Can't wait to walk她.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,420
Why did I suddenly become that kind of person?

19
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,960
Tell me!

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,480
Pen這麼 colour affordlyub into恐커

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,160
I can residents choose the one that looks more suitable

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,960
Needless to

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,360
What are you waiting for?

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,320
But we don't have money.

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,560
You don't have money.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,080
I'll help you find him.

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,720
OK.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,120
Thank you.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,680
Thank you.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,200
Don't do the same.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,880
OK.

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Boy,

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I think I can only sweep one at a time.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Where's my phone?

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
He Tuotuo, did you steal his phone?

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Mom, your phone is on the sofa.

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Mom, here's your phone.

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
You haven't finished your homework yet?

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Well, almost.

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
What are you doing?

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Studying homework?

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
How can you pass the exam?

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Sister, can you help me copy the assassin's text again?

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
I copied it for you before.

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
I'm copying it for you again?

46
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm so jealous.

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Then you were playing games secretly just now.

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Well, when I come back to help you,

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
I'll go to the police station later.

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Write it.

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
You're not sick.

52
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Everything is normal.

53
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I know I'm not sick.

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Are you more assured after the examination?

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Dr. Wang,

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
why do you think I can't get pregnant all the time?

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
You're just too nervous.

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Work pressure and all aspects.

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Does your mother-in-law talk a lot?

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
You have to relax yourself.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
You know my situation.

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
How can I relax?

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Let someone go on a trip with you.

64
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Maybe you can come back with the baby.

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Dapeng,

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
what are you laughing at?

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
It's not funny if you fall down.

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Do you think I'm kidding?

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I'll go with you.

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Let's go to the river.

71
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
No, no, no.

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't come up.

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Don't persuade me.

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Find my old lady.

75
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
If she doesn't come,

76
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I'll jump down.

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Hurry up.

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Help me.

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Hurry up.

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Find my old lady.

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Hurry up.

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
It's not a big deal to call her.

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Call Chen.

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Okay, I'll go right away.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
What are you doing?

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
You're just in time.

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Luo Dapeng is going to jump down.

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
What are you doing?

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm going to find Luo Dapeng.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
You go to the scene first.

91
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Okay, go.

92
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Let's go.

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Luo Dapeng is going to jump down.

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Don't go to the scene.

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Okay.

96
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Find my old lady.

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
If she doesn't come,

98
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I'll jump down now.

99
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Luo Dapeng, what are you doing?

100
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Calm down.

101
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I don't want to bother you anymore.

102
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
If you really don't want to bother us,

103
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
just come down.

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Stop talking.

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I can't hear you.

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
I don't understand.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I don't listen to the devil's eaves.

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
If the old lady doesn't come,

109
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I don't understand anything.

110
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I only listen to the old lady.

111
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
If you don't come,

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
I'll jump down now.

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Hurry up.

114
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Call her.

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Why are you standing there?

116
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Hurry up.

117
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
I'll jump down later.

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
None of you can leave the village.

119
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Hello, Mr. Fang.

120
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
You don't have to come.

121
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
We'll take her back to the police station.

122
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Okay.

123
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Luo Dapeng.

124
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Chen has gone to see your mother.

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Think about it.

126
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
She's already over 70 years old.

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
She's already over 70 years old.

128
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Do you have the heart to talk to her like this?

129
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
If she treats me better,

130
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I won't talk to her like this.

131
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I want to see

132
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,800
if my son is important in her heart

133
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
or the wife who ran away from her.

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Xiao Dong.

135
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Luo Dapeng, come down now.

136
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Don't be a disgrace to me.

137
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
You still want to hurt your mother?

138
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
You've already found another man.

139
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Still there.

140
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Pretending to listen to the devil's mother.

141
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm in this field today.

142
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
It's all your fault.

143
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm telling you.

144
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
If you don't return our house today,

145
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
I won't go down.

146
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Then stay with her.

147
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I...

148
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
You'd better not come down.

149
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
If you come down,

150
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
it'll be a trouble.

151
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm talking to the old lady of the Wu family.

152
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
It's useless to say anything.

153
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
I only talk to the old lady.

154
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Luo Dapeng.

155
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I...

156
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
How did you come up?

157
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
We know.

158
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
You must have met a problem when you came up.

159
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Otherwise, you can't do this.

160
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Let's go.

161
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Bai Shi, you're old.

162
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Your mother is sick.

163
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
You have to treat her.

164
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
If you fall, you have to treat her leg.

165
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Let's go. Let's go down first.

166
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
No, no.

167
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
You all go down.

168
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
No, no.

169
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Why?

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Yes, yes.

171
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
We all go down.

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Go down.

173
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
No, we mean this.

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Come on.

175
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Go down.

176
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
I'll talk to you slowly.

177
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
No, no.

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I can't come back.

179
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I finally found a job.

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Then I have no job.

181
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
No one pays the salary.

182
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
My daughter asked me for tuition.

183
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
I can't pay it.

184
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I have no dignity.

185
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
My daughter looks down on me.

186
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
You can look down on your daughter

187
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
when you're old.

188
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
No, no.

189
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
You think I can't live my life

190
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
to be able to take care of my daughter?

191
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Go, go, go.

192
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
No, no.

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I don't want to go.

194
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm sure you can solve it.

195
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Da Peng.

196
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Don't be so useless.

197
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Look.

198
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Your mother is here.

199
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Brother Cheng.

200
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
This girl doesn't want to talk here.

201
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Are you crazy, Luo Da Peng?

202
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
What's wrong with me?

203
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
I'm here.

204
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
You're here to take care of your family?

205
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
What's your business?

206
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
It's none of your business.

207
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Come here and find me.

208
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
How can I not take care of you?

209
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
You're not from the Luo family.

210
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
You're standing next to my mother's door.

211
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
You don't let me.

212
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
You're so shameless.

213
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
What do you mean?

214
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Luo Da Peng, I'm telling you.

215
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Your mother is here now.

216
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
What are you doing here?

217
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm here to trust you.

218
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm not a person.

219
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
You gave me this person.

220
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Mom.

221
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
You're really interesting.

222
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Say something.

223
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Mom, mom, mom.

224
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
You're calling me so lightly.

225
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Mom, mom.

226
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
You're calling me so lightly.

227
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Mom, mom.

228
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Shut up.

229
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Mom, this woman

230
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
is not your daughter-in-law anymore.

231
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
You're so shameless.

232
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
You're driving me crazy.

233
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
I'm telling you.

234
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
In my life,

235
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
you're the only daughter-in-law in Dongmei.

236
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Look.

237
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Okay, okay.

238
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Stop talking.

239
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Listen to your mom.

240
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Mom, mom.

241
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
What's going on?

242
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
My door-to-door room

243
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
is just a little bit big.

244
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
It's all managed by Dongmei.

245
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
I'm so old.

246
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm just relying on that door-to-door room.

247
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I have some income.

248
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I'm living well.

249
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
This useless thing.

250
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
He made me give the door-to-door room to him.

251
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I talked to a ten-year-old girlfriend.

252
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
I haven't even seen her.

253
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
You say.

254
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Can I be assured to give it to him?

255
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I'm not talking about girlfriend.

256
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
This is another matter.

257
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Your door-to-door room is managed by me.

258
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
It's supposed to be the best.

259
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Boss.

260
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
What you said is wrong.

261
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Look.

262
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
He's unreasonable.

263
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
I haven't managed the door-to-door room for five or six years.

264
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
You used to agree.

265
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
What are you doing now?

266
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I don't have any income now.

267
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
If you don't have any income,

268
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
let me give the door-to-door room to you.

269
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
You're my mom.

270
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I can't eat.

271
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Do you want to see me starve to death?

272
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Listen to me.

273
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Listen to me.

274
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
He's unreasonable.

275
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Don't talk to me about reason.

276
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Enough.

277
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Talk to me about family.

278
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Luo Dapeng.

279
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
You don't have any income now.

280
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
It's not your mom's fault.

281
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Why are you arguing with her?

282
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
You want to manage this door-to-door room.

283
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
You can discuss with your mom.

284
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
You can't force me.

285
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Hello, Mr. Jin.

286
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
You're free on Monday.

287
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Come to school on Monday.

288
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
What's the matter?

289
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
As your sister,

290
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
you should give your brother

291
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
a good example of love.

292
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Do you help him

293
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
with his homework?

294
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
He can't memorize the text.

295
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
That's why I asked him to copy it ten times.

296
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
I just want to discuss with you

297
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,800
how to help He Chongcong with his study.

298
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
If you're free,

299
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I'll invite your parents or mother.

300
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
No need.

301
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
I'll go.

302
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I'll go.

303
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
OK.

304
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
This is my phone.

305
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Your mom just sent it to me.

306
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
I'll check it.

307
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
OK.

308
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
Mom.

309
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Don't be mad.

310
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm not arguing with my mom.

311
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I want to take the house.

312
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Stop.

313
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Hao Chen.

314
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Mom.

315
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
This door-to-door room

316
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
is in your name.

317
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
You can use it

318
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
as you want.

319
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
But it can't be used.

320
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,720
I didn't answer the phone.

321
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,200
Mom came to urge me again.

322
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,560
She asked if you found a job for your uncle.

323
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,800
Did you find a job?

324
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,320
You said the house was not found.

325
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,680
Work, work, and then it was not found.

326
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,480
How is he going to live in the future?

327
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,120
It's Song Tao.

328
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,880
Who?

329
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,760
My old god.

330
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,400
Old god.

331
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,120
Chen Chunyang.

332
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,120
That doctor.

333
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,560
Where is Nuan Xin?

334
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,600
She's in the room.

335
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,480
Wait a minute.

336
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,440
I'll go call her.

337
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,440
So that means...

338
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,920
Nuan Xin.

339
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,680
This...

340
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,560
Song Tao's phone.

341
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,160
Let him call me later.

342
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,320
If you need anything, don't call the office.

343
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,120
Call my phone.

344
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,920
As a family,

345
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,160
we can discuss everything.

346
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,080
You should discuss it peacefully.

347
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,640
Right?

348
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,240
Don't get angry all the time.

349
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
What's the use of getting angry?

350
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,400
It can't solve the problem.

351
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,600
Song Tao.

352
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,280
It's me again.

353
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,080
Nuan Xin said she'll call you later.

354
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,400
Okay, okay.

355
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,200
Don't let her forget.

356
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,760
Okay.

357
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,200
You go out first.

358
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,760
Let me talk to your mom alone.

359
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,800
Esther.

360
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,320
Who is she?

361
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,800
Stop it.

362
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,360
Hello, Lord Shen.

363
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,960
Chen Tao.

364
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,160
You don't blame me today.

365
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,360
I...

366
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
I'm really upset.

367
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,280
I know.

368
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,240
I know.

369
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Even though you're angry,

370
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,080
no matter what happens,

371
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,000
you shouldn't

372
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,800
do this to your mom.

373
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,400
Don't have any ulterior motives.

374
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,080
I...

375
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,440
You know about this.

376
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,640
I know.

377
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,760
But she changed her mind long ago.

378
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,280
She did change her mind.

379
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,880
But it wasn't for me.

380
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,480
She found a man outside

381
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,640
and she didn't let him

382
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,320
stay in my house.

383
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
She raised him.

384
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
There's no such thing in the world.

385
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,040
You two are divorced.

386
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
It's not like

387
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,400
she has anything to do with your family.

388
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,640
But

389
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,320
her old lady trusts her.

390
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,280
She can endure hardships and be brave.

391
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,600
She runs a small noodle house

392
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,280
and it's very popular.

393
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,280
Are you capable of that?

394
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,440
But I don't have a job now.

395
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
I don't have any income.

396
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,920
I have to find a job.

397
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,040
I know. I know.

398
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,040
You want to find a job, right?

399
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,400
If you run this noodle house,

400
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,240
can you run it well?

401
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,600
You even lost your old lady's income.

402
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,880
Isn't that more unfair?

403
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,880
Right?

404
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,480
But I can rent the noodle house.

405
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,920
I can eat rent.

406
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,960
If you can't eat,

407
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
you should learn to

408
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,720
run a noodle house

409
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,600
of your old lady.

410
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,280
Are you trying to be old?

411
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,720
I am.

412
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,520
I am.

413
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,760
You should find a job

414
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,040
while you're young.

415
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
I did.

416
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
It's hard to find.

417
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm old.

418
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,360
Besides,

419
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,880
I can't do anything

420
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,680
except fixing the pipe.

421
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
It's hard to find a job.

422
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,040
You can find a girlfriend.

423
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,600
But...

424
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
You're lazy.

425
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
You're old.

426
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm not.

427
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,320
I have a girl who is 10 years older than me.

428
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,160
I didn't agree.

429
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,280
Well,

430
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,440
as for finding a job,

431
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,280
you can find a job

432
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,320
as long as you don't pick three or four.

433
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,000
Right?

434
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,800
Mom,

435
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,560
don't be angry.

436
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,120
We will

437
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,560
continue to care about her.

438
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,800
It's about work.

439
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,160
Let's think about it together.

440
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,400
I believe you.

441
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,920
Take care.

442
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,520
Okay.

443
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm leaving.

444
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,520
Okay.

445
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,440
Why are you crying?

446
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,480
What are you doing here?

447
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,960
Your mom is not angry.

448
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,880
Go after her.

449
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,480
Go and ask her.

450
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,040
Hurry.

451
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,000
Bei Bei and I

452
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,240
have an appointment with Liang Yin

453
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
to visit her in the hospital.

454
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,360
We have to go now.

455
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,920
Okay.

456
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
You two go.

457
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,040
Fang Si and I will keep an eye on her.

458
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,720
Okay.

459
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,720
Bei Bei.

460
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,960
Is Liang Yin's husband back?

461
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Yes.

462
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,360
He was in a bad mood

463
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,440
after a phone call.

464
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,480
And they

465
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,920
refused to show up.

466
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,560
That's ridiculous.

467
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,200
Seriously.

468
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,120
If he refuses to show up,

469
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,840
you can go to visit him once.

470
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,560
Before he goes back to the UK,

471
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,080
try to pay for Liang Yin's medical bills.

472
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,360
Okay.

473
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,520
The work of the judicial department

474
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,560
is more like a organ.

475
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
The work of the district bureau

476
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,640
is just one of the jobs

477
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,040
of the judicial department.

478
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,440
We have many

479
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,280
such as

480
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,720
the large-scale legal propaganda

481
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,400
and the social justice.

482
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,600
Action.

483
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,240
There is no danger.

484
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,840
You can see

485
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
that a very dangerous scene

486
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,360
has become a joke.

487
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,240
And Luo Dapheng didn't just come back.

488
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
So Bei Bei asked

489
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,600
why he came again.

490
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,560
This joke is also very important.

491
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,680
The first episode

492
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,160
must be absolutely attractive.

493
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,920
That's why people

494
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,160
are willing to watch it.

495
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,000
You can relax.

496
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,920
You can put your hands on the table

497
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,200
or something like that.

498
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,480
I can't do it.

499
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,840
I can't do it.

500
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,400
Relax.

501
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,440
Happy New Year.
