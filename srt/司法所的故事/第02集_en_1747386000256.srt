1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:23,680
The

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,080
Be regular

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,000
Lagard

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,920
I'll give you this.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
I didn't buy any food.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,720
You're quite busy.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,320
Look over there.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,120
What are you looking at?

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,280
Isn't that Lin Song Tao?

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,400
The one next to her is

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Qu Yushi?

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
I think she's...

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,880
Forget it.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,560
Let's go in.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,600
That Qu Jing and that girl

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,680
are classmates of the university, right?

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
I think so.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,880
Then why didn't we

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,480
go up there and say hello?

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,120
Why?

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,360
You're a bit sensitive.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,560
Isn't it normal to say hello

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,880
to an acquaintance?

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,960
They're classmates.

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Don't be so arrogant.

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,320
I know.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,720
I'm not that gossipy.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Is that Zhou Hang?

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,440
Is that so?

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,280
Look.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,840
I think so.

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,000
Zhou Hang.

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,920
Excuse me.

34
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,040
Are you Zhou Hang?

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,760
You are...

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,800
I'm He Beibei.

37
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
We talked on the phone before.

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,640
We...

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,720
Don't run.

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,800
Let's talk.

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,720
Why are you running?

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,520
Are you a donkey?

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,400
Why are you running?

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
You can't run away with leather shoes.

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
Why are you dragging me?

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,920
Well.

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
Are you guys so nosy?

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,480
Liang Yin has filed a complaint

49
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,120
to the People's Conditions Committee.

50
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,840
Since we've been entrusted with it,

51
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,080
we should be responsible for it.

52
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,800
If you're responsible for it,

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,280
you should tell Liang Yin

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,520
that I don't love him anymore.

55
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,360
I don't love him anymore.

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,080
Do you understand?

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,880
What do you mean?

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,120
Okay.

59
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,480
As long as he agrees to divorce,

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll pay for the medical expenses.

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,200
Who gave you the money

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,880
to study abroad?

63
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,560
Did you forget?

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,120
Don't talk nonsense.

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,880
The past is the past.

66
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,840
Now is the now.

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,080
Don't talk nonsense.

68
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,440
You don't know the law.

69
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,440
Even if you don't love Liang Yin anymore,

70
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
you're still husband and wife.

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,240
Do you understand?

72
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,760
All your income

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,520
is your husband's joint property.

74
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
What is joint property?

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,600
I don't need to explain it to you.

76
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,120
Okay.

77
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,600
Okay.

78
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,240
Anyway.

79
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
As long as Liang Yin

80
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,920
doesn't agree to divorce,

81
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,240
I won't run away with a penny.

82
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,960
Okay?

83
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,720
No. You can't...

84
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,960
You just let him go?

85
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,080
He's not like a person

86
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,240
who has high academic ability.

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,520
In his condition today,

88
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,200
how can we talk to him?

89
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,880
I almost couldn't hold myself back.

90
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,680
Let's go back and calm down.

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Let him calm down.

92
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,440
Let's go.

93
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,960
Luo Dapeng

94
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,080
can't be idle.

95
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,800
I told you.

96
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,040
Look at him.

97
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,520
He's not good at

98
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,400
his skills and age.

99
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,600
Once he loses his job,

100
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,880
it's hard to find a job.

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
What can he do?

102
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,600
Let him join the engineering team.

103
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,440
He has the spirit

104
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
to work hard.

105
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
But he can't do

106
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,000
the work of the engineering team.

107
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,960
How about

108
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,080
he join the property

109
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,240
to be a repairman?

110
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,880
That's a good idea.

111
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,520
How about asking

112
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,120
Manager Liu of the Beauty New City Museum?

113
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,000
They're all from the same district.

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,120
They know each other.

115
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,800
That's a good idea.

116
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,240
Your phone is ringing.

117
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,160
It's Song Tao.

118
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,200
He wants to ask me

119
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,760
about the hospital check-up this morning.

120
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
He's so annoying.

121
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,720
You went to the hospital to check-up?

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,920
Song Tao didn't mean that.

123
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,840
He said he had an emergency

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,200
and asked you to call him back.

125
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,560
He's always

126
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
in a hurry.

127
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,520
I said I had an emergency.

128
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,160
If you don't call him back,

129
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,240
it's your problem.

130
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,720
You're so annoying.

131
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,480
The doctor said

132
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,400
the best treatment

133
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
is surgery.

134
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,120
Change the liver?

135
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,680
How much is the total

136
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
of the surgery?

137
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,560
I'm not sure.

138
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
At least

139
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,360
three times 100,000 yuan.

140
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,200
We saw Zhu Hao downstairs.

141
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,280
He said he wouldn't come to the hospital

142
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,640
to check on Liang Yin.

143
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,440
That's too much.

144
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,080
Did you talk to him?

145
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,600
He had to wait for us.

146
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,960
He ran away

147
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,720
when he saw us.

148
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,760
That jerk.

149
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
I'll call him and scold him to death.

150
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
Wait.

151
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,560
His attitude

152
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,520
makes us angry.

153
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,960
But now

154
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,760
the problem is

155
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
we have to figure out

156
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,920
how to get him to pay

157
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,960
for Liang Yin's treatment.

158
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,600
Of course,

159
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,640
if he doesn't want to pay,

160
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,160
we can also

161
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,720
ask him to pay

162
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
through legal means.

163
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,280
But the most important thing is

164
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,200
Liang Yin's illness can't wait.

165
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,520
We have to

166
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,040
be patient

167
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,040
and find a way to convince him.

168
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,280
Li Ke,

169
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,800
do you know

170
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
where Zhou Hang

171
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,640
might live now?

172
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
Zhou Hang?

173
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,880
Zhou Hang

174
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,320
has an aunt in his hometown.

175
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
He might live

176
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,400
in his aunt's house.

177
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,160
Is it possible

178
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,320
that he will live in

179
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,680
the house

180
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,920
of his aunt and Liang Yin?

181
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,080
That house

182
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
is rented.

183
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,160
After Liang Yin was hospitalized,

184
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,680
that house

185
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,600
should not be sold yet.

186
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,840
But

187
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,880
I'm not sure

188
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
if he will go.

189
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,080
Ask Liang Yin

190
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,320
to send us

191
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,680
the address of those two houses.

192
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
It should be this building.

193
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm not sure if it's here.

194
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,000
We'll know when we get there.

195
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,320
501...

196
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,640
This one?

197
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,920
501.

198
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,560
501.

199
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,320
501.

200
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,120
501.

201
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,640
501.

202
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,240
501.

203
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,000
501.

204
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,640
501.

205
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,240
501.

206
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,960
Who is it?

207
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,600
Is Zhou Hang living here?

208
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,120
No.

209
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Who are you?

210
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,080
We are Zhou Hang's friends.

211
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,760
Didn't he

212
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,920
come back from abroad?

213
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,080
Let's visit him.

214
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,680
He's dead.

215
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

216
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,920
What's the matter with you?

217
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,400
You must be

218
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,440
Zhou Hang's aunt.

219
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,520
Sort of.

220
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,360
She doesn't recognize us.

221
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,080
Are you

222
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,160
saying that

223
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,320
she came back from abroad?

224
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,400
They are

225
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,440
friends of White-Ear Lang.

226
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:14,680
Why are you

227
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,640
bothering them?

228
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,000
Why is Zhou Hang

229
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,480
being a White-Ear Lang?

230
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,080
Let's go.

231
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,800
He lives here.

232
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,840
Does he

233
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,880
go back to the hotel?

234
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,680
Will he

235
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,240
go back to the small house with Liang Yin?

236
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,600
Liang Yin is not home.

237
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,280
Let's go and see.

238
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,080
You should go to the hospital first.

239
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,280
Or your dad will be worried.

240
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,440
Okay.

241
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,920
All right.

242
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,560
so you're harder to catch up with.

243
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:23,340
I think you're more Ar ficar

244
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,100
You're on a business trip, Chou.

245
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,500
It's been easier?

246
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Look at you, all good and oppressed.

247
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,060
Let me help you.

248
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,820
It's hot.

249
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,420
Okay.

250
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,740
Let's chat for a while.

251
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,500
Go back. Go back.

252
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,340
Don't worry. I'm here.

253
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,140
You don't have to worry.

254
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,660
Okay.

255
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,780
I'm leaving.

256
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,300
Why are you looking at me?

257
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,540
I'm not tired.

258
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,780
Mom.

259
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,420
You look better

260
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,060
day by day.

261
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,020
We'll be discharged in a few days.

262
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,820
Hello, mom.

263
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,740
Where are you?

264
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,660
Come back for dinner?

265
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,380
We're not coming back for dinner.

266
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,460
I'm watching a movie with your dad.

267
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,180
Okay.

268
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,300
You can watch it.

269
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,180
There's roasted duck in the fridge.

270
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,740
Tongtong said she wanted to eat it yesterday.

271
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,260
Okay. I got it.

272
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,300
I'll heat the roast duck for you.

273
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,380
I'm going to cook for grandma.

274
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,660
Oh, right.

275
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,300
Right.

276
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,380
Today,

277
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,860
Mr. Jin called me.

278
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,580
He found out that I helped you copy the test.

279
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,260
Look at you.

280
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,020
You're so bad at copying.

281
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,100
You'll be scolded by Mr. Jin tomorrow.

282
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,700
You're blaming me?

283
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,620
You're laughing like a flower.

284
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,940
And Mr. Jin is criticizing you.

285
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,900
He's not scolding you, okay?

286
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,100
You have to use the right word.

287
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,700
Stop watching.

288
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,420
Turn off the TV.

289
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,220
Let's eat.

290
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,900
Let's eat.

291
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,260
Uncle is gone?

292
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,540
Where's his son?

293
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,700
Doesn't he know where he's gone?

294
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:24,940
Okay?

295
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,980
Don't worry.

296
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,460
I'll go out and find him.

297
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,380
Oh, my.

298
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,820
We can't be so warm-hearted.

299
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,260
He's the one who started the company.

300
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,220
He has an organization.

301
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,580
I'll go out and find him.

302
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:37,940
Okay.

303
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,740
You keep looking for a job.

304
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,420
You can't find a job.

305
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,180
You're missing.

306
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,580
You're so annoying.

307
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
Please open the door.

308
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,940
You're finally back.

309
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,740
What's wrong?

310
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,220
I've been calling you for a day.

311
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,460
Why didn't you answer my call?

312
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,100
You're so smart.

313
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,940
He's gone.

314
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,100
Who's gone?

315
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,380
Uncle is gone.

316
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,180
I did call him.

317
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,900
Okay.

318
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,020
Call him back.

319
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,940
Ask him where he is.

320
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,340
Hello.

321
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,860
The number you dialed is currently unavailable.

322
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
No one answered.

323
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,540
You too.

324
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,580
Why didn't you answer my call?

325
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,220
I've been busy all day.

326
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,940
I can't not answer your call.

327
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,060
You're busy too.

328
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,380
You can't just ignore your family.

329
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,980
No wonder mom keeps asking you for tea.

330
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,580
You're so good.

331
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,020
You should keep your words.

332
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,460
Go.

333
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,260
You're so rude.

334
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,460
Why did I ignore my family?

335
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,020
Drink some water.

336
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,700
Let's go out.

337
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,020
So,

338
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,820
how about atmosphere highscore?

339
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,060
Mom said

340
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,380
mom once told her

341
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,540
not to cry,

342
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,660
but no come out,

343
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,500
so she cried and...

344
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,340
Come, come.

345
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,660
I'll take you to the hospital.

346
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,100
Come.

347
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,820
Come.

348
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,460
I'll take you to the hospital.

349
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,980
Mom.

350
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
Mom,

351
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,580
dad isn't here.

352
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Mom, when will you come back?

353
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,660
Your dad and I won't come back today.

354
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,740
We'll stay at your place.

355
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,460
Why?

356
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,500
Are you playing mahjong again?

357
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,740
It's rare.

358
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,860
Mom, I have my own business.

359
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,220
I need to do it.

360
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,660
What's your business?

361
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,660
I'm in love.

362
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,100
We haven't agreed on

363
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,380
your relationship with Han Chao.

364
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,500
Why are you still in love?

365
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,700
Besides,

366
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,300
you don't have enough money to work.

367
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,380
You can't help your brother when you get off work.

368
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,020
I'll pick up

369
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,860
365 days a year, okay?

370
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,540
I'll pick up

371
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,740
two more months.

372
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,420
You need to take a vacation for two months.

373
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,260
Alright.

374
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,100
You care about me the most.

375
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,060
I know.

376
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,860
I'll hang up.

377
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,980
Liu Anyi is calling me.

378
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,580
Coming.

379
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,420
I'm so sorry.

380
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,620
I'm so sorry.

381
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,740
I'm so sorry.

382
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm so sorry.

383
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,820
I'm so sorry.

384
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,020
I'm so sorry.

385
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,220
I'm so sorry.

386
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,420
I'm so sorry.

387
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,380
I'm so sorry.

388
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm so sorry.

389
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,620
I'm so sorry.

390
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,660
I'm so sorry.

391
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,620
I'm so sorry.

392
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,580
I'm so sorry.

393
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,860
I'm so sorry.

394
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,900
I'm so sorry.

395
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,860
I'm so sorry.

396
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,060
I'm so sorry.

397
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,340
I'm so sorry.

398
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,620
I'm so sorry.

399
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,220
I'm so sorry.

400
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,340
I'm so sorry.

401
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,700
I'm so sorry.

402
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,580
I'm so sorry.

403
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,700
I'm so sorry.

404
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,980
I'm so sorry.

405
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,100
What's wrong of you?

406
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,320
I'm sorry.

407
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,260
Turtle,

408
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,620
Go away.

409
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,580
Go away.

410
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,820
Come on.

411
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,120
Where are you going?

412
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,180
I don't know.

413
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,200
What if Max and Mom are back?

414
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,400
No.

415
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,080
Great.

416
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,780
Grace,

417
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,580
You scared me.

418
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,500
I thought it was...

419
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,060
No, I was scared.

420
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,260
You scared me.

421
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,180
Where's your dad?

422
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,220
My dad? I don't know.

423
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,540
You didn't see him today?

424
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,340
No.

425
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,660
Last night,

426
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,220
my dad had a fight with me.

427
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,060
Now we can't meet.

428
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,820
We'll fight when we meet.

429
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,500
Yes.

430
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,940
I don't know.

431
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,580
You lost his money and house.

432
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,660
He can't fight with you.

433
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,340
I didn't get the compensation.

434
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,500
Why did you fight with me?

435
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,500
Your dad is missing?

436
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,180
My dad is missing?

437
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,340
Where can he go at such a young age?

438
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,140
He's missing?

439
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,460
Uncle.

440
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,620
Answer it.

441
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,300
Where's Wen Nan?

442
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,700
Hello, uncle.

443
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,780
Where are you?

444
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,180
Hello, I'm Jiao Yaolin.

445
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,380
The owner of this phone

446
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,380
is in the third hospital.

447
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,780
We saw your phone number

448
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,980
in his phone.

449
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,860
May I ask

450
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
what's your relationship with him?

451
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,460
I'm his relative. What's wrong with him?

452
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,140
He fell from the sixth floor.

453
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,860
His injury is serious.

454
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,260
Please go to the third hospital immediately.

455
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,020
I'll be there soon.

456
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,300
What's wrong with you?

457
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:17,900
Tell me.

458
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,940
Uncle.

459
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,500
He fell from the sixth floor.

460
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,980
He's in the third hospital.

461
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,780
When someone brings you

462
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,380
negative emotions,

463
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,980
actually, the negative emotions

464
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,420
are not self-evident.

465
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,300
We can't be carried away by him.

466
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,060
You're very angry.

467
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,100
I'm also very angry.

468
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,780
Then it's hard for us to solve it.

469
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,260
So I think first of all,

470
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,340
learn to be a self-confident,

471
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,340
to digest this emotion

472
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,340
and be alert.

473
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,140
I'm solving problems for everyone.

474
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,100
I can't be carried away by everyone's emotions.

475
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,140
The purpose of the event

476
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,060
is to help the community

477
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,140
to help the community

478
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,340
to help the community

479
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
to help the community

480
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,060
to help the community

481
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,740
to help the community

482
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,460
to relieve their stress.

483
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,900
So that they can rest,

484
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,380
and see their family

485
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,860
and the movement of their life.

486
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,820
When I film,

487
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,140
I always slow down every day.

488
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,980
Then actually, I have a lot of 쉬,

489
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,340
you say you save him?

490
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,860
I don't feel so necessary.

491
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,420
But you won't save him,

492
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,660
you look particularly sorry.

493
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,100
Come to station.
