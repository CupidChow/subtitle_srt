1
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,158
Good morning.

2
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,535
Morning, love.

3
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,667
What are you staring at?

4
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:47,756
Only the face of my beautiful fiancée.

5
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,842
So I don't forget.

6
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,639
Come on. I'll give you a bath.

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,016
-Hm?
-Come on.

8
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,768
Give me a bath?

9
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,728
Wait-- Oh, please.

10
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,979
No, no.

11
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,397
I can walk…

12
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,565
You're so weird.

13
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,828
Love.

14
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,418
Aww, love. You're so sweet.

15
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,212
-I love you, too.
-Love you.

16
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,631
-Have some breakfast.
-Oh. I can't, love.

17
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,218
I need to go.
I have a presentation today, remember?

18
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,928
I can’t be late. I'll just book a cab.

19
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,179
No, it's fine. I'll take you.

20
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,180
-Huh?
-Yeah.

21
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,515
-You sure?
-Yeah.

22
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,808
Alright, let's go.

23
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,354
Thanks, love. Sorry. I didn't get to eat…

24
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,446
So, what we can do is,
we can book vloggers who are moms.

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,990
And these vloggers
will produce our main content

26
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,201
about cooking for their kids. Like

27
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,119
Anna Sy.

28
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,036
UNLI COOKING

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,457
Anna Sy has two million subscribers
on her YT account alone.

30
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,459
And she's not even an actress.

31
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,627
She's a working mom

32
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,712
who just so happens
to love vlogging with her kids.

33
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,299
Which makes her more credible
and more authentic.

34
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,761
Good idea. You know how the consumers
would think if it was an artist.

35
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,055
What are the platforms involved again?

36
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,516
Okay, we can do FB and YT,

37
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,643
which are the top
two social media platforms.

38
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,021
We can do IG reels and IGTV,
and on top of that…

39
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,692
The clients were extremely pleased
with your marketing presentation.

40
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,902
And because of you,

41
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,779
the business was awarded to us.

42
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,240
-Oh, wow! Really?
-Mm-hmm!

43
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,200
Thanks, sir. Congratulations to us.

44
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,493
You know, Pia,

45
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,120
I'm quite impressed with you.

46
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,080
Because of that,

47
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,583
I'm thinking of assigning
our biggest client to you.

48
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,585
JTK Apparel.

49
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,546
-JTK Apparel?
-Mm-hmm!

50
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,047
Sir, are you serious?

51
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,632
Yes! I'm serious.

52
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,633
Wow!

53
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,595
Sir, thank you! Thank you!
I can't believe it--

54
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,806
Sorry, I'm being too loud.
I just got excited. Thank you.

55
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,057
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

56
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,309
Take your lunch break.

57
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,685
Okay, sir. Thank you.

58
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,520
-Congratulations.
-Sir, thank you again!

59
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,908
Dr. Jose Rizal had many siblings.

60
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,621
The eldest was Saturnina Rizal.

61
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,916
Paciano Mercado Rizal.

62
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,835
Narcisa Rizal, or simply, Sisa.

63
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,590
Olympia Rizal. Lucia Rizal Herbosa.

64
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,717
Maria Rizal Cruz.

65
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,511
Concepcion Rizal.

66
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,598
Josefa Rizal. Trinidad Rizal.

67
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:47,769
And the youngest
among them was Soledad Rizal.

68
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,856
Sir Aki,
that's a lot of names to memorize.

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,817
You must have so much patience
to become a history teacher.

70
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,153
It can be a pleasure
to look back on the past.

71
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,572
And as George Santayana once said,

72
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:04,827
"Those who cannot remember
the past are condemned to repeat it."

73
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,831
And because of your comment Gio, pop quiz.

74
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,667
-What?
-Sir!

75
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,434
Love?

76
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,562
-Love!
-Yeah?

77
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,024
Love! I'm hungry. Let's eat.

78
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,442
Cook something.

79
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,611
Yeah, I will.

80
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,949
I'm still fixing this…
What do you call this? Uh…

81
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,742
-The…
-What?

82
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,744
For recording. For…

83
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,954
-It's a camera!
-For taking videos.

84
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,080
-Camera.
-Camcorder!

85
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,790
-That's what I said. Camera.
-You old man.

86
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,791
Sorry.

87
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,543
I thought it wasn't working anymore.

88
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,046
Why don't you buy an SLR?

89
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,841
Look around.
You have a bunch of old stuff

90
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,677
-just sitting there collecting dust.
-Love.

91
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,140
It's good to look back on the past.

92
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,642
Here we go again.

93
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,104
Because the past

94
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,648
lets us appreciate the present

95
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,234
and look towards the future.

96
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,278
Is my hair okay?

97
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,863
-Yes, it's okay.
-The baby.

98
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,656
You look so handsome there, love.

99
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,408
You look beautiful as always.

100
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,869
I'm baby girl princess.

101
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,412
What about you?

102
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,998
-Baby boy prince.
-Wow! Baby boy.

103
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,087
-Tinola chicken mami!
-Tinola chicken mami!

104
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,923
‎Mwaah!

105
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,051
-Feed me with the spoon, love.
-Alright, I will.

106
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,846
That's a mouthful!

107
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,805
Love.

108
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,931
The old,

109
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,017
the bygone times…

110
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,522
The past tells us where we began.

111
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,149
So, love,

112
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,985
if you're feeling bored,

113
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,863
if you're feeling tired,

114
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,450
if you're starting to forget,
look back on our memories.

115
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,285
Remember…

116
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,915
Love, you'll remember
how much you mean to me.

117
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,710
Wow! Jose Rizal, is that you?

118
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,295
Such a poet.

119
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,214
It's a bit much. Cut it out.

120
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,215
My lady.

121
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,009
You are my beloved.

122
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,722
Hey, love.

123
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,809
It's your proposal.

124
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,608
Yes.

125
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,402
Oh.

126
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,946
My beloved.

127
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,406
My lady.

128
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,495
The first time I laid eyes on you,

129
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,747
I knew you were the one.

130
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,207
You are the one.

131
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,672
For as long as I live, I will serve you,

132
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,423
love you.

133
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,635
And no matter what,

134
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,181
I will never forget you.

135
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,561
I love you, Pia.

136
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,980
I love you.

137
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,606
I love you.

138
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,985
I'm so in love with you.

139
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,529
Oh, stop it.

140
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,115
Sophia Suarez, will you marry me?

141
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,829
-Of course, I'll marry you. Duh.
-Yes.

142
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,664
-Yes!
-Yes! A thousand times yes!

143
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,425
Yes! Okay, put the ring on my finger.

144
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,468
Thank you.

145
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,846
Yeah!

146
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,267
I miss that song.

147
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,936
-"How Did You Know?".
-Really?

148
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,979
Play it for me.

149
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,772
-Sure.
-Now, please?

150
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,107
-Now?
-Right now.

151
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,151
-Okay.
-Pretend you're proposing to me again.

152
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,736
-Sure thing.
-Come on. Hurry.

153
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,863
Okay, let's go. Then cook dinner?

154
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,448
Alright I'll cook dinner.

155
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,408
Come on.

156
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,439
-What are these?
-They're pictures of all our dreams.

157
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,859
We'll hang them on our dream wall.

158
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,195
It's called "manifestation".

159
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,196
Is that even real?

160
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,364
Of course!

161
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,157
When we see our goals
and dreams laid out in front of us,

162
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,825
we'll be more focused
on achieving them, right?

163
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,410
We'd know where we're headed.

164
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,288
That's our dream house, there.

165
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,208
Isn't that too big, love?
Won't we get lost in there?

166
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,545
We might as well dream big, right?

167
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,756
And we won't get lost in there.
We'll be holding hands.

168
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,841
Where should we put the piano?

169
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,136
That's our house.

170
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,180
It's where we'll start a family.

171
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,349
They'll grow up there.

172
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,475
We'll grow old there.

173
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,810
With Mama and Jay.

174
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,811
Mm-hmm!

175
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,191
Welcome, sir.

176
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,859
This is the house model.

177
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,362
It feels like this house
has good vibes, doesn't it?

178
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,073
Don't you agree? Do we need to… Do we
still need to hire a feng shui expert?

179
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,199
Can we afford this?

180
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,410
We can. We have to.

181
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,370
-Okay.
-Alright.

182
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,625
We'll get married here.
That's where Popoy and Basha got married.

183
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,877
-Seriously?
-Didn't you watch the movie?

184
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,795
Sorry.

185
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,006
It's because you don't help me
with the planning.

186
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,882
Love, are you done yet?

187
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,427
Wait. I'm almost done.

188
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,198
Let's practice.

189
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,578
Father.

190
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:26,042
I take thee,

191
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,669
Sophia Suarez,

192
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,132
to be my lawfully-wedded wife,

193
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,925
even if she spends too much.

194
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,137
Love, don't ruin the moment.

195
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,930
Come on. Keep going.

196
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,724
So, there you have it, Father.

197
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,352
From this day forward,

198
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,314
for richer or poorer,

199
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,400
in sickness and in health,

200
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,778
to love and to cherish,

201
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,199
according to God's holy ordinance.

202
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,422
We've had several bookings
for next year, all weddings.

203
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,757
Oh? I see.

204
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,301
But we can reserve it, right?

205
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,220
Yes, we just need a reservation fee.

206
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,558
Oh, wow. That was a bad twist.

207
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,893
Hey, love.

208
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,687
-Sorry for the PDA.
-Sorry. It's fine.

209
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,314
-It's okay. Enjoy yourselves.
-We're just excited.

210
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,652
What will we do here?

211
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,113
Well, you know…

212
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,615
We'll make a… baby.

213
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,825
-Babies?
-Yeah!

214
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,201
Babies…

215
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,160
Plural.

216
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,203
Plural.

217
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,915
This will be our room.

218
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,043
-Beautiful.
-This is where we'll make a baby.

219
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,169
What?

220
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,629
What did you say?

221
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,005
This is where we'll make a baby.

222
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,842
-Hey, don't lie down on it.
-Come here.

223
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:58,759
Are you sure?

224
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,594
-Lie down.
-We'll get in trouble.

225
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,472
It's so soft.

226
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,643
Why?

227
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,478
Let's make a baby.

228
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,771
Later, we'll make one.

229
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,148
Come on.

230
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,566
Hey! What are you doing?

231
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,026
What's with you?

232
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,446
Love, we'll get in trouble. We still have…

233
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,991
Love! You're tickling me…

234
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,453
Ma! We have a surprise for you!

235
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,037
Here you go!

236
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,248
Dear, what is this?
You're spending all your money.

237
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,083
There's more.
I'm buying you an air conditioner.

238
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,295
An air conditioner? Oh, please,
there are too many gaps in the walls.

239
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,963
-Mom. I want to do it for you.
-What's this?

240
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,465
Thank you so much.

241
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,508
These are all for you.

242
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,843
-Thank you, sis.
-Don't break it.

243
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,046
Hey, guys, didn't see you there.

244
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,715
Hello. Welcome to our vlog. Hey. Hey.

245
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,718
Oh, hang on. Love.

246
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,138
Here. Is this okay?

247
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,558
Singapore.

248
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,935
I'll record you.

249
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,604
Pretend you're arranging the frames.

250
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:20,192
This is where we'll have our honeymoon.

251
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,862
We'll book a room right over here.

252
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,656
Welcome to our future.

253
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,326
Promise me, okay,

254
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,453
that we'll fulfill all our dreams.

255
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,096
Aunt Lorna, I'm sorry.

256
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,099
This is all I can give you.

257
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,311
Oh no, I should be saying sorry.

258
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,812
It's embarrassing.

259
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,149
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

260
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,442
There's no need.

261
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,776
This is me helping you.

262
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,737
Thank you, Aki.

263
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,489
We're family. We should
be looking out for each other.

264
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,534
We're just low on funds right now.

265
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,328
But I will pay you back, I promise.

266
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,704
-Pia!
-Hi, Rek!

267
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,874
-How are you?
-Hi, Auntie. How are you?

268
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,710
-How are you? Oh my, look at you.
-Long time no see!

269
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,546
-So pretty and still sexy, I see.
-Thank you, Auntie.

270
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,798
When is your wedding again?

271
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,841
It's next year, Auntie.

272
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,593
-Wow!
-You and Rekrek better be there.

273
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,094
-Hey! Aki…
-Awesome.

274
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,763
You used to be so little…

275
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,014
-I'm the same old Aki.
-Still little.

276
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,184
My naughtiest nephew,

277
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,727
getting married.

278
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,271
If I don't see you two at the wedding,

279
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,397
I'll be so upset with you.

280
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,357
-Oh!
-Hey, no.

281
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,650
-Watch out.
-Come on.

282
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,529
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Good afternoon.

283
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,615
You were absent yesterday. We missed you.

284
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,575
Did we have class yesterday?

285
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,826
Yes, sir.

286
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,037
Our schedule
is Mondays-Wednesdays-Fridays.

287
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,667
How was the presentation?

288
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,794
It went well. Sir Carlo loved it.

289
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,212
So did the client.

290
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,507
Wow.

291
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,385
My wife is amazing.

292
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,054
As for me…

293
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,974
Did you know
I've been missing a lot of classes?

294
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,685
Maybe because I'm so busy
with the wedding plans

295
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,644
and with the house?

296
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,271
Love, I already told you
not to worry about that.

297
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,982
I'll take care of the wedding planning.

298
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,612
Oh, love.

299
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,114
-Mm?
-I just remembered.

300
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,824
What should we do on my birthday?

301
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,075
You birthday?

302
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,619
That's in two months. Isn't it
too early to be thinking about it?

303
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,830
What's the matter?

304
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,289
You're such a buzzkill.

305
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,250
Let's have dinner with my mom and brother.

306
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,460
Dinner. Okay.

307
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,047
Dinner and then afterwards, you know…

308
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,260
Hey. Love, it's not my birthday yet!

309
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,803
Hey, I'm still working.

310
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,556
Love! Love, my laptop.

311
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,142
Stop it.

312
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,768
Later! I’m still working.

313
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,645
Just hug me like this.

314
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,523
-Huh? Love.
-Mm?

315
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,566
Love!

316
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,736
Love! Love.

317
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,237
The designer replied.

318
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,781
Remember, Camille's contact?
They gave us a discount!

319
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,950
-Yay!
-Yay!

320
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,870
Yes!

321
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,790
Gosh, love.

322
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,334
It was a hectic day at the office.

323
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,502
Oh yeah?

324
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,465
-You want a massage?
-Oh! I'd love a massage, sure. Perfect.

325
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,632
Right here.

326
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,222
Hello, Ma.

327
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,724
Happy birthday, Pia!

328
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,017
Thank you, Ma.

329
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,560
We're going there later, okay?

330
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,603
Let's eat.

331
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,229
Dinner, right?

332
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,315
Yes. 7:00 p.m.

333
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,484
See you, Ma. I have to do some chores.

334
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,152
Okay, dear. Love you. Bye!

335
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,528
Love you, Ma. Buh-bye.

336
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,033
-Oh?
-Oh, love?

337
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,077
Let's go. We're running late.
Why aren't you dressed?

338
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,995
Love, you're so funny.

339
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,705
Why are you in uniform?

340
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,500
Why else? For work.

341
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,418
Love.

342
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,253
It's Sunday.

343
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,389
Like I said, it's Sunday.

344
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,682
Mmm.

345
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,101
I'm on Monday time.

346
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,564
Hey, love.

347
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,482
Mm?

348
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,817
Happy birthday!

349
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,070
See? If I didn't point it out,
you wouldn't greet me.

350
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,988
Come on. I was just pranking you.

351
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,576
Hey, we're having dinner at Mom's.

352
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,747
She didn't want to go out
because of her arthritis.

353
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,459
-Okay.
-Love, what's this?

354
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,672
Our electric bill's not paid yet?

355
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,215
This is a disconnection notice.

356
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,759
You know what? I'll pay it.
You can do it online now.

357
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,303
Love, I promise I'll do it. Promise.

358
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,847
Are we taking these to your mom's?

359
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,224
-Ah yeah. They'll fit in the trunk, right?
-Yeah.

360
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,017
-Should I load them up?
-Yes.

361
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,727
I'll put this on the fridge.

362
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,646
-So you don't forget.
-Okay.

363
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,199
Oh, love. You're already dressed.

364
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,034
-I know.
-Dinner with Mom is much later.

365
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,328
My boss suddenly called me.

366
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,165
He wants to see
my presentation all of a sudden.

367
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,501
Can't that wait until tomorrow?
It's Sunday. It's your birthday.

368
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,919
Love, it's okay.

369
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,547
You know how it is. I need to impress him.

370
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,216
Remember? Promotion.

371
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,509
-Alright…
-Are you taking me?

372
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,760
-Yeah.
-Come on. Hurry.

373
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,803
I'm late.

374
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,933
Oh no, love. My boss is already there.

375
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,894
Don't forget my bithday dinner, okay?

376
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,187
I'll catch up with you.

377
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,479
I'll go there after this, okay?

378
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,731
Take care.

379
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,982
-Love you!
-Love you.

380
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,194
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you!

381
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,242
-Pia.
-Sir.

382
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,994
-Sir, did you wait long?
-It's okay.

383
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,829
-Sorry. Sorry.
-It's okay.

384
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,206
Where were you?

385
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,165
At home, sir.

386
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,305
Sir, I'll show you
what I've been working on.

387
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,390
Oops, sorry.

388
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,683
Hold on a second, Pia.

389
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,560
I read it on the group chat.

390
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,396
It's your birthday today?

391
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,773
Huh?

392
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,025
Unbelievable! I made you work.

393
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,735
-My God! Sir.
-I'm so embarrassed.

394
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,321
Sir, it's okay. It really is. No problem.

395
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,698
Oh, please. We're celebrating.

396
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,909
Forget about work for now, alright?

397
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,453
Oh, I don't want to impose. It's fine.
It's really okay.

398
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,580
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.

399
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,290
I almost made the most

400
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,961
hardworking person I know
work on her birthday!

401
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,170
My God, that's unacceptable!

402
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,588
-Thank you, sir.
-Let's celebrate.

403
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,714
-Thank you.
-Put that away.

404
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,757
-You sure?
-Come on.

405
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,760
-Thank you, sir.
-That's for you.

406
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,306
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you, sir.

407
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,809
Dad, where are you going?

408
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,727
Stay with your aunt.

409
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,103
Nardo!

410
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,313
Nardo!

411
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,523
Nardo, where are you going? Nardo!

412
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,482
Aki.

413
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,567
Son, stay with your aunt.

414
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,818
Sis, take care of him.

415
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,861
Where are you going?

416
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,863
What about
your responsibility to your son?

417
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,698
You're just gonna leave him?

418
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,326
Dad, don't leave me!

419
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,873
Dad.

420
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,082
Aki…

421
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,532
Finish your studies. Go enroll.

422
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,159
You didn't even tell me.

423
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,786
I'll pay for your tuition.

424
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,121
It's the last semester. Finish it.

425
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,414
Thank you,sis.

426
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,749
You're the best.

427
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,459
-Sis.
-What?

428
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,796
Maybe you could…
buy me a new pair of rubber shoes, too?

429
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,713
There we go…

430
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,298
Hey, Jay.

431
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,759
Stop asking for expensive things.

432
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,552
-Quit bothering your sister.
-Tell him, Mom!

433
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,595
I wasn't.

434
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:09,930
-Oh, Ma.
-Here you go.

435
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:13,183
Aki and I are buying
a house for all of us.

436
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,018
It's big. We'll all be comfortable there.

437
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,061
No, thanks.

438
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,354
Mm?

439
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,605
No, thanks.

440
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,315
I'm okay here, dear.

441
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,110
You know I don't like a big empty house.

442
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,695
-Right?
-Ma, please, it's gonna be great.

443
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,198
And you know this is my dream for us.

444
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,325
I want us to live in a nice house.

445
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,203
Thank you, dear.

446
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,122
Of course.

447
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,331
Thank you.

448
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,209
Oh, Ma. Have you taken
your maintenance meds?

449
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,752
-Ah, go and get it.
-It's over there.

450
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,711
-I'm having barbecue.
-Getting it.

451
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,506
You're not having any of this, Ma.

452
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,426
Oh, what about Aki?

453
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,344
Where is he?

454
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,470
I don't know where he is.

455
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,429
-Here you go.
-Wait, Ma.

456
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,973
-I'm going to call him.
-Alright.

457
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:07,404
Happy birthday, bestie Pia

458
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,489
Bestie! Thank you.

459
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,991
Come. Let's sing to your sister.

460
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:17,539
-Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to me!

461
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,251
Happy birthday

462
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:25,589
Happy birthday to you!

463
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,756
-Make a wish!
-I'll make a wish.

464
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,841
Make a wish, sis.

465
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,012
Yay!

466
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,681
-Thank you, bestie. What a surprise.
-Happy birthday, bestie.

467
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,599
Come. Sit.

468
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,101
Where did I put it?

469
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,311
I know it's here somewhere.

470
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,062
I can't find it.

471
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,230
Great.

472
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,649
Where is it?

473
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,943
Love, why are you home so late?

474
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,112
Love.

475
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,323
Have you seen my phone?

476
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,328
Love, have you seen my phone?

477
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,997
I can't find it anywhere.

478
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,249
I don't remember where I put it.

479
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,419
Love.

480
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,841
Hey, what happened?

481
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,635
What's wrong?

482
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,095
Love.

483
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,097
Pia.

484
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,642
I don't get it.

485
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,684
What?

486
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,687
You're here looking for your phone

487
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,147
instead of going to my birthday dinner.

488
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,483
Oh, fuck! That's right.

489
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,360
-Yeah, what's this?
-Uh!

490
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,737
That's why you're so drunk, Aki.

491
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,405
You were having your own party.

492
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,865
That's just great.

493
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,033
I only had a few shots.

494
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,201
Shots, really?

495
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:40,288
Mama and Jay were looking for you.
Fel was there, too.

496
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,874
Sorry, love. It slipped my mind.

497
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,045
Sorry, love.

498
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,463
Aki.

499
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,757
Aki, stop!

500
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,259
You smell like booze.

501
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,678
Love, sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

502
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,888
It slipped my mind…

503
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,099
I don't know, maybe because…

504
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,226
I've been too stressed?

505
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,645
I'm really sorry.

506
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,939
Why wouldn't I go, huh?

507
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,655
How did you know?

508
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,073
-Tsk. Aki.
-I needed someone

509
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,700
-Aki, stop it.
-Like you

510
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,909
Aki, what the hell?

511
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,163
How was your date, huh?

512
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,749
Kissing on the cheeks?

513
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,002
Please,

514
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,837
Aki. He's my boss.

515
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,131
-Don't change the subject.
-You like him?

516
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,091
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

517
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,092
You're seriously asking?

518
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,010
Mm-hm.

519
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,096
You're being ridiculous.

520
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,056
I don't want to talk to a drunk person.

521
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,644
Love.

522
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,564
I'm really sorry.

523
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,399
Aki.

524
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,901
Love, I'm sorry. I really
didn't mean to miss your birthday.

525
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:57,615
There's too much on my mind.
I keep forgetting my schedule…

526
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,536
I'm really stressed out. Fuck, I'm sorry.

527
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,914
I don't like this, Aki.

528
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,915
What do you mean?

529
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:06,958
You don't want this?

530
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,460
You don't want us anymore?

531
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,130
-Love?
-Aki, no. That's not what I meant.

532
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,550
Love, you just said you don't want this.

533
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,469
Love!

534
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,680
Love, what did you mean?

535
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,682
Aki, what I'm saying is,

536
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,684
it's my birthday, right?

537
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,853
And you didn't show up.

538
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,146
And I come home to this!

539
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,856
You, drinking.

540
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,566
How do you think I feel?

541
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,986
I can't believe you.

542
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,375
Love, I'm sorry.

543
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,253
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

544
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,514
Love.

545
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,682
What?

546
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,438
Don't leave me, okay?

547
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,948
Don't abandon me like my father did.

548
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,202
Stay with me, okay?

549
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,745
Promise?

550
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,915
Promse.

551
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:29,999
Okay, I promise.

552
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,668
You stink, Aki.

553
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,634
Well…

554
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,722
That's my phone. Why is it there?

555
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,724
See? Keep drinking.

556
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,437
Here,

557
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,148
drink some water. You're drunk.

558
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,441
So annoying.

559
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,319
-Here.
-In the fridge.

560
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,530
I was cooling it.

561
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,115
It was overheating.

562
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,286
How did you know

563
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:12,625
I needed someone like you in my life?

564
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:18,423
On November 3, 1896, Jose Rizal was taken

565
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,259
to Fort Santiago.

566
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,140
Along with other patriots
and his brother Paciano.

567
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,560
And on November 20, 1896,

568
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,772
the preliminary investigations began.

569
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,360
He faced court…

570
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,824
with Judge Advocate Colonel

571
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,827
Francisco Olive.

572
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,704
For five days, he was…

573
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,041
For five days, he was…

574
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,754
Check the book.

575
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:03,259
He was investigated,
and on November 26, 1896…

576
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,556
What does it say? Let me see.

577
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,517
On Nov--

578
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,401
Good morning, ma'am.

579
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,528
Good afternoon, Aki.

580
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,613
-Ah, right. Good afternoon.
-Have a seat.

581
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,866
Uh, Ms. Panela is here, our chair.

582
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,368
Good afternoon.

583
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,203
Hi, ma'am. Uh…

584
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,538
What's the matter?

585
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,457
I called you here because…

586
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,501
this is not the first time
that I have received

587
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,045
complaints regarding your attendance.

588
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,842
You have missed several of your classes.

589
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,386
This has been going on for six months,

590
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:50,139
and I'm scared to say
that it's affecting your students.

591
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,476
The parents are already complaining.

592
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,649
Sir Aki.

593
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,861
I'm sad to say this, but…

594
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,156
we might need to let you go
because of this.

595
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,617
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,101
You're a genius, Pia.

597
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,813
The clients were ecstatic about

598
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,608
the insight on our marketing campaigns.

599
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,109
That's good news, sir.

600
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,694
Congratulations to us.

601
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,196
And congratulations

602
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,699
to our new senior account manager.

603
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,826
Sir?

604
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,412
What was that?

605
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,415
You are this company's
new senior account manager.

606
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,499
You're promoted.

607
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,377
Sir, me? Really?

608
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,504
Am I dreaming?

609
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,673
Sir, thank you! Thank you.

610
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,717
This means so much to me.
Sir, I love this job.

611
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,302
Thank you so much.

612
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,804
That's why we need to celebrate.

613
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,884
When we see our goals
and dreams laid out in front of us,

614
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,302
we'll be focused on achieving them, right?

615
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,388
We'd know where we're headed.

616
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,264
Promise me, okay,

617
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,100
that we'll fulfill all of our dreams.

618
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,613
Oh!

619
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,531
Shit!

620
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,699
-Oh, sir!
-Sorry.

621
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,118
-Sir, I'm okay. Please sit down.
-I'm sorry, Pia.

622
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,620
-I'll take care of this.
-Let's have it replaced.

623
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,622
I spilled it all over your steak.

624
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,957
It's okay.

625
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,667
-Sorry.
-It's okay. It's not a lot.

626
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,626
No.

627
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,505
You are very, very special to me.

628
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,341
I should take care of you.

629
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,468
Isn't that what you want?

630
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,178
To be taken care of.

631
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,975
I appreciate it, sir.

632
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,936
Would you please just call me Carlo?

633
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,732
Get rid of all those honorifics, okay?

634
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,109
You make me feel so old!

635
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,611
-Okay?
-Sorry. Sorry. Yes, sir--

636
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,196
Hey, what did I just say?

637
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,448
Okay.

638
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,449
-Yes?
-Okay, Carlo.

639
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,617
-There we go.
-Carlo.

640
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,505
It's over here, sir. Oh. Here, Carlo.

641
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,133
-Is this it?
-I'm still not used to it.

642
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,180
I hope you enjoyed the steak.

643
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,057
It was lovely. I'm so full.

644
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,600
I had to unbutton my pants.

645
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,518
Same. I think my zipper split open.

646
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,811
Even the buttons.

647
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,855
Alright, uhm…

648
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,981
I'm going in.

649
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,691
You didn't tell me
you were coming home late.

650
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,444
I got us some take-out.

651
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,948
Well, we went out to celebrate because…

652
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:41,120
Love, I got promoted
to senior accounts manager!

653
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,583
Wow.

654
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,047
Congratulations. I'm so happy for you.

655
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,966
Thanks, love.

656
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,344
There's more.

657
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,720
I got a raise in my salary,

658
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,265
so we have more money to pay for the house

659
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,059
and for our wedding

660
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,979
and for our honeymoon in Singapore.

661
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,358
Oh, love. Speaking of the wedding…

662
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,860
Make sure to take care
of the reception venue, okay?

663
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,781
Let's go with The Fort. It's nice.

664
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,032
Reserve it this week,

665
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,119
and call them immediately,
so we can secure our slot.

666
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,873
Hey.

667
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,334
Love, what's wrong?

668
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,544
Are you okay?

669
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,381
You don't seem happy about my promotion.

670
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:37,927
Love.

671
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,183
I got fired.

672
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,427
Love.

673
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,762
Love, what happened?

674
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,189
They said I wasn't doing my job properly.

675
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,400
What?

676
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,528
Love, are you really okay?

677
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,738
I'm okay.

678
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,656
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

679
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,994
I'm going to find another job,
so I can help with our bills.

680
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:55,588
What's this still doing here?
You haven't paid it?

681
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,132
Am I supposed to do that?

682
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,094
Aki, we agreed
the electric bill is yours, remember?

683
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,096
It was very clear.

684
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,139
What?

685
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,516
Sorry.

686
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,643
Whatever.

687
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,685
I'll do it.

688
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:11,938
Love.

689
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,201
The spot over there is for…?

690
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,078
The photobooth. Make sure.

691
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,288
This is the spot for our sponsors.

692
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,416
-Milk tea next to the brownies.
-Milk tea.

693
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,460
-Remember that, okay?
-Okay.

694
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,629
Oh, the balloons. More balloons.

695
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,214
I want many colors.

696
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,465
-Add more balloons.
-Fel.

697
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,801
Sis!

698
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,265
Love!

699
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,475
-Is this it?
-Careful. Watch your head.

700
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,895
Where is it? Is this the curve?

701
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,855
-Watch your head.
-Okay, okay.

702
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,733
-There.
-Slowly. Almost there.

703
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,110
-Okay-- Ah!
-Oh!

704
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,529
Sorry, love.

705
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,655
There.

706
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,032
Well, can I see now?

707
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,994
Yeah, in three, two, one…

708
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,663
‎HAPPY BIRTHDAY
‎LET'S MAKE UP!

709
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,499
Wow…

710
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,376
What's all this?

711
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,420
Well, because…

712
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,047
I didn't show up for your birthday,

713
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,966
I got fired,

714
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,176
and I forgot to pay our electric bill.

715
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,971
I've caused you a lot of stress, so…

716
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,391
In short, this is to appease you, my love.

717
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,727
Yeah, right, don't you mean…

718
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,521
"Because I'm a drunk."

719
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,649
You didn't have to.

720
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,859
It's fine.

721
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,818
It's not fine.

722
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,194
Come on. Let's eat.

723
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,032
Wow!

724
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,409
Is this tinola chicken mami?

725
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,327
You bet.

726
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,874
Fancy mood lighting.

727
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,336
Oh, that. I didn't notice.

728
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,214
Oh, love. Next month, okay?

729
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,632
You're playing the piano at a wedding.

730
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,593
The one Fel told us about.

731
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,970
Oh yeah. I got the details.

732
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,221
Thanks for that, love.

733
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,181
Of course.

734
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,557
Let me try this.

735
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,727
Tinola chicken mami, your favorite!

736
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,728
Are you sure?

737
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,812
Mm-hmm!

738
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,065
Where's the chicken?

739
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,027
I swear to God.

740
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,695
You're right. There's none. Are you okay?

741
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,072
I'll cook some. It won't take long.

742
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,573
Love, it's fine. It's okay.

743
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,076
Then, it's just tinola mami. No chicken.

744
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,827
It's a prank.

745
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,455
Wait. Let me taste it.

746
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:36,874
Let me taste.

747
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,878
Tastes like chicken?

748
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,423
Tastes like… love.

749
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,187
LOVE, DON'T FORGET
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING?

750
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,814
ARE YOU DRINKING AGAIN? AKI???

751
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,940
WHERE ARE YOU, LOVE?

752
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,644
Pia! Who are you waiting for?

753
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,271
I'm waiting for my ride.

754
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,272
I'll drive you home.

755
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,357
Oh no. He's on his way. It's okay.

756
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,025
Hop in.

757
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,110
It's pouring.

758
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,862
Hop in.

759
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,114
Are you sure it's okay?

760
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,907
Yes, I'm sure.

761
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:52,825
Okay.

762
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,787
Thank you. I'm sorry.

763
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,747
-It's nothing.
-He's not answering.

764
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,083
Yeah, I wouldn't want you to get drenched.

765
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,545
By the way,
I'm dropping by my friend's bar

766
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,797
to support them. If that's okay with you.

767
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,549
Sure, no problem.

768
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,743
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

769
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,455
-God, this is strong!
-Yeah, it is.

770
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,831
I can't drink anymore.

771
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,875
You can handle it though.

772
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,126
No, this is my last one, okay?

773
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,378
-It's too strong.
-I won't drink this again.

774
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,755
Where's your friend?

775
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,050
I'm driving you home anyway.

776
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,301
Even so…

777
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,386
That's my last drink.

778
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,105
Carlo.

779
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,268
Love, I need to tell you something.

780
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,936
I'm tired.

781
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,898
I'm going to sleep.

782
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,693
You didn't pick me up.

783
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,595
DID PIA TELL YOU ABOUT THE EVENT?

784
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,887
YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH, FEL!

785
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,306
HI, AKI. SEE YOU LATER AT THE EVENT

786
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,182
CALL TIME IS 3 P.M.
SO YOU HAVE TIME TO REHEARSE

787
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,524
HELLO, FEL. COPY. SEE YOU

788
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,756
Pia, let me just remind you, okay?

789
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,007
It's been less than two years

790
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,426
since you last paid
your down payment for the house.

791
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,304
Your first down payment
might be forfeited.

792
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,640
Yes, yes. I understand.

793
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:03,891
I'm sorry.

794
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,809
I'll see what I can do.

795
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,112
Pia.

796
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,534
Uhm…

797
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,078
I'm sorry.

798
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,497
For the other night.

799
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,540
It's nothing.

800
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,750
Forget about it.

801
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,795
And…

802
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,630
I'm sorry, but…

803
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,758
I overheard

804
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,677
that you're having financial problems?

805
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,474
If you need cash,

806
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,809
I can help you.

807
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,061
Oh no.

808
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,397
It's embarrassing. Don't worry about it.

809
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,065
You sure?

810
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,193
I appreciate it, Carlo.

811
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,903
But really, no need.

812
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,614
And, uh, one more thing.

813
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,575
The regional office
presented me with an offer.

814
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,870
They want me to transfer
to Singapore next year.

815
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,081
And they said

816
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:13,210
I could bring selected team members.

817
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,503
Of course.

818
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,131
Top of mind, you were
the first person I thought of.

819
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,677
-Singapore?
-Mm-hmm. Next year.

820
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,889
It would be a shame to turn it down.

821
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,350
Thanks for the offer.

822
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,102
But…

823
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,979
I'll have to think about it.

824
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,731
I'll also ask my fiancé.

825
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,817
I hope you'll consider it.

826
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,403
I'm sure this will help your career.

827
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,535
Settle the payments. Hurry.

828
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,453
Secure the suppliers.

829
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,620
We still don't have a pianist.

830
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,080
Hurry up!

831
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,081
What the hell, sis?

832
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,919
I almost got in trouble with my clients.

833
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,630
Good thing we found a pianist last minute.

834
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,965
Fel, I'm so sorry.

835
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,676
Fel, I'm sorry. I didn't… I didn't know.

836
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,721
I'll try talking to him later, okay?

837
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,973
I'm sorry. I feel so guilty.

838
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:11,310
The way I see it, Pia,
I'm doing him a favor.

839
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,228
He should be grateful, girl.

840
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,355
I put my name on the line.

841
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,316
If he doesn't treat me with respect,

842
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,319
he should at least show you some.

843
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,831
You ditched Fel!

844
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,667
They went out of their way
to help you get a job,

845
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,961
and you didn't even show up, Aki?

846
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,130
That's been on your calender
for two months, remember?

847
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,798
What's wrong with you?

848
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,385
Sorry, it slipped my mind.

849
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,679
I'll call Fel later.

850
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,725
What's this?

851
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,563
I just… had a few bottles.

852
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,773
Whatever!

853
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,526
You're embarrassing.

854
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,903
I'm sorry.

855
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,572
I don't know what's happening.

856
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,325
You don't know what's happening?

857
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,618
Aki?

858
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,411
Let's not kid ourselves here.

859
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,747
You do know!
You know what's happening to you.

860
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:17,876
You're a drunk. That's why
our lives are in shambles!

861
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,877
What do you want?

862
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,380
Come on. I'll send you to rehab,
since you're an alcoholic!

863
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,464
I'm not an alcoholic!

864
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,675
Then what the fuck is this?

865
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,515
Aki, please.

866
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,977
I'm begging you.

867
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,024
This is draining me.

868
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,406
You didn't show up at Fel's event.

869
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,742
You didn't pay for the house we're buying.

870
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,161
The wedding reception. What's next?

871
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,997
Oh shit, that's right.

872
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,123
"Oh shit, that's right."

873
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,417
"Oh shit, that's right." Son of bitch!

874
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,425
You know what, Aki?

875
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,385
If this is how we're gonna be…

876
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,264
maybe it's better

877
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,726
if I accept the job my boss
offered in Singapore.

878
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,565
That's next year.

879
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,504
It's work, Aki.

880
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,258
It's a big deal.

881
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,928
Instead of us going nowhere.

882
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,273
Congrats.

883
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:09,279
I know that it's what
you've always wanted.

884
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,584
But if you're going to Singapore,

885
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,171
what about all our plans?

886
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,257
The wedding.

887
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,134
The honeymoon.

888
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,929
The house we're buying.
Those are all for next year, too.

889
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,474
Then we should plan more carefully.

890
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,353
Right? Let's do
an intimate wedding instead.

891
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,604
Because, Aki,

892
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,691
I want us to fix our lives first.

893
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,404
Because in this situation,

894
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,448
I have no choice
but to accept the job in Singapore.

895
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,659
I can't say no to that.

896
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,287
And you. Get yourself together.

897
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,914
Your drinking.

898
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,633
What's this?

899
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,055
This is expensive.

900
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,726
What the hell, Aki?

901
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,354
We can't even pay for the house.

902
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,648
And we still have expenses
for the wedding.

903
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,525
You lost your job, remember?

904
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,360
Add your drinking to that.

905
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,862
We can't afford all this.

906
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,071
Fuck.

907
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,324
And you're buying all this shit?

908
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,702
What do you think I am?

909
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,912
-That I shit gold?
-What's that anyway?

910
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,708
How should I know?
You bought that, and you're asking me?

911
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,306
For fuck's sake! Fuck.

912
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,984
Aki, what's going on?

913
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,740
Tell me.

914
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,038
Should we go through with this?

915
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,007
Because if you ask me,

916
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,510
Aki, I'm not so sure anymore.

917
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,762
It's been so hard on me.

918
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,263
I'm so tired.

919
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,142
You've been this way for months.

920
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,354
You're in a daze, drinking.

921
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,357
I don't understand, Aki.

922
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,610
Please, if you have a problem, tell me.

923
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,279
So I can understand you.

924
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,280
Because…

925
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,492
I'm at my limit.

926
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,204
Pia.

927
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,708
Uh…

928
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,168
The thing is…

929
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,339
-The thing is…
-What?

930
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,842
What?

931
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:34,985
Speak up!

932
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,446
What now?

933
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,701
You're going to Singapore.

934
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:47,205
You're leaving me
and throwing it all away!

935
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,666
Go on!

936
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,211
Go there. And that's it?

937
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,170
Huh?

938
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,424
Go on, since you're itching
to go to Singapore!

939
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,675
Please.

940
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,096
Please understand.

941
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,640
I want to achieve more things, Aki.

942
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,601
I want us to do more things.

943
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,810
"Us"?

944
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,229
Pia. "Us"?

945
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,064
I think you mean you!

946
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,400
It's what you want, Pia!

947
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,903
What's the point of planning all this

948
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,822
if you're just going to Singapore?

949
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,907
Huh?

950
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,617
Wow!

951
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,493
You're unbelievable!

952
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,997
Come with me, Aki.

953
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,957
We'll help each other out.

954
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,500
I don't know. Whatever.

955
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,629
What am I gonna do there?
There's no job for me there.

956
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,173
You think it's that easy, Pia?

957
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,758
Huh?

958
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,594
The problem with you is,

959
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,513
you're too fucking ambitious!

960
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,934
Hang on.

961
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,852
Wait.

962
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,854
Why…

963
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:57,817
Why are you making it seem like
I'm only doing this for myself?

964
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:04,324
Aki, why are you making it
seem like I'm selfish?

965
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,249
You think I'm ambitious?

966
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,043
Huh? Aki?

967
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,462
I'm sorry, okay?

968
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,715
Sorry if I'm ambitious
and I have big dreams.

969
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,426
Because who the fuck am I, right?

970
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,056
I grew up in the slums.
Why would I dream of having a nice job?

971
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,933
Why would I dream of Singapore?

972
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,894
A good life for my mom and my brother?

973
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,730
For my future children?

974
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,066
For our family?

975
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,526
Sorry, Aki,

976
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,404
if I want a good life for the both of us!

977
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,702
Because I'm so sick of being poor.

978
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,290
I'm so tired of living
from hand to mouth, Aki.

979
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,251
I'm sick of it!

980
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,523
Pia?

981
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,277
Pia?

982
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,490
Pia.

983
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,243
Pia, where are you going?

984
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:15,872
Pia.

985
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,916
Pia, please don't.

986
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,627
Pia, don't leave me. I love you, Pia.

987
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,630
-Don't leave me, please.
-It's not enough that you love me, Aki.

988
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,090
It's not enough that I love you.

989
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,257
Do we starve?

990
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,550
Huh?

991
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,010
Get yourself together first.

992
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,136
Pia.

993
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,304
Pia, please.

994
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,514
Pia, please.

995
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,765
-Please. Pia.
-Aki.

996
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:34,849
Pia.

997
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,398
Go on. Forget about me!

998
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,235
You all forget about me!

999
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,279
Even you?

1000
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,572
Huh? Pia?

1001
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,907
We have dreams!

1002
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,284
The wedding! The house!

1003
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,497
Pia, come on!

1004
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,503
-Pia.
-It can't just be me, Aki.

1005
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,299
It takes two, right?

1006
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,847
Right now,
it feels like I'm alone in this.

1007
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,807
Sorry, Aki.

1008
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,016
Pia.

1009
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,853
-Sorry.
-Sorry. Sorry, Pia.

1010
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,020
Sorry, Aki.

1011
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,105
Pia.

1012
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,399
Pia!

1013
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,234
Pia!

1014
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,658
Pia, don't leave me.

1015
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,079
Pia, I can't do this.

1016
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,876
-Aki, stop.
-Pia, I can't do this.

1017
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,795
Aki, please.

1018
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,881
-Pia, I can't live without you.
-Aki!

1019
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,841
Aki, stop it.

1020
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:50,925
Pia.

1021
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,094
Pia.

1022
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,387
Pia!

1023
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,431
Pia.

1024
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,391
Pia.

1025
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,351
Pia, please.

1026
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,604
Pia! Pia! I love you.

1027
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,064
I love you.

1028
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,859
I love you so much.

1029
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:13,072
I love you so much.

1030
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,951
Let me go, Aki.

1031
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,078
Sorry.

1032
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,039
-Don't leave me.
-Sorry.

1033
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,665
I’m so sorry.

1034
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,459
Aki, sorry. Please.

1035
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,836
Forget about all this, okay?

1036
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,296
Forget about me, Aki.

1037
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,631
-Sorry.
-Pia.

1038
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,007
Please.

1039
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,597
Pia.

1040
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,974
-Pia, please. Don't.
-Bye, Aki.

1041
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,851
Pia, please. Don't leave me, please.

1042
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:45,772
Don't leave me, please.

1043
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,023
Let's go.

1044
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,775
Aki.

1045
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,319
Pia.

1046
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,820
Let's go.

1047
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:53,905
Pia.

1048
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,573
Pia.

1049
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,866
Pia!

1050
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,368
Pia!

1051
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,869
Pia!

1052
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,412
Pia!

1053
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,789
Pia!

1054
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,294
Pia!

1055
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,966
Pia!

1056
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,391
Good morning, babe.

1057
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,227
Morning, babe.

1058
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,023
Come on.

1059
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,858
We still have a meeting.

1060
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,234
-Come on.
-Wait.

1061
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,277
-Let's go.
-Wait. Five more minutes.

1062
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,528
-We have a meeting.
-Wait.

1063
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,946
Let's go. Come on.

1064
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,905
Babe!

1065
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,240
Get up.

1066
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,658
We're running late.

1067
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,076
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Not yet.

1068
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,411
-I'm gonna carry you.
-I'm still sleepy.

1069
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,580
-I'm carrying you.
-Okay. I'll get up.

1070
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,861
Okay. So, we can stream
our podcast every Saturday,

1071
01:00:56,944 --> 01:01:00,031
and one season can go
for about three to four months.

1072
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,283
We can talk about
relationships that started

1073
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,369
and blossomed on the GTK Dating App.

1074
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,537
Do you have a study
on the podcast's effect on us

1075
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,580
when it comes to advertising?

1076
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,083
Yeah. Actually, we've done the strategy
before with other brands,

1077
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,335
and it's proven very, very effective.

1078
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,461
Babe, come on.

1079
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,213
Let's put up the pictures.

1080
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,464
Do we really have to do this?

1081
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,548
Of course!

1082
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,716
Memories.

1083
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,139
The lighting
and the background is good here.

1084
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,683
-Here. A better angle, see?
-Alright then.

1085
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,769
-The lighting is beautiful.
-Angle.

1086
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:30,812
It is beautiful.

1087
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:31,896
One more.

1088
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,024
Let's take another photo on the bridge.

1089
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,735
You belong in Singapore.

1090
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,946
It's like it was meant to be.

1091
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,240
Hi, dear.

1092
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,866
Ma, you've moved in?

1093
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,702
Let me see.

1094
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,245
Here, sis. Look.

1095
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,956
-It's big, isn't it? Right, Ma?
-Yes. It's beautiful.

1096
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,375
There.

1097
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,795
Dear, thank you for buying us a house.

1098
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:56,713
Come here, babe.

1099
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,632
-What is it?
-Look, they've moved into the house.

1100
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,926
Wow, Auntie. That looks so nice.

1101
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,594
Come on. Give me a tour.

1102
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,762
Jay, where are you?

1103
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,058
That was my dream house then.

1104
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,143
Now…

1105
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,353
my family lives there.

1106
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,521
Soon…

1107
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,314
it's gonna be a mansion.

1108
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,274
I really hope so.

1109
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,775
Believe it.

1110
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,446
I want to meet them.

1111
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,197
Babe, come on.

1112
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,657
Beautiful!

1113
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,660
-Hey, what's the matter?
-Hold up.

1114
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,953
-I'm beat.
-Come on.

1115
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:29,996
Let's go.

1116
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,039
You're so fit with all your jogging.

1117
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,458
You can do it.

1118
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,751
Ouch.

1119
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,504
Why don't we visit Helix Bridge again?

1120
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,048
-It's beautiful.
-We have great pictures there.

1121
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,010
-Nice.
-My Team Award.

1122
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,179
Congratulations.

1123
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,889
Aww, thank you, babe.

1124
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,767
Thank you for everything.

1125
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,644
In my five years here in Singapore…

1126
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,814
you were always there for me.

1127
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,081
Hi, babe.

1128
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,753
By the way, have you spoken to your team?

1129
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:21,005
About that big client.

1130
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,924
We're on vacation, remember?

1131
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,636
Why are we talking about work?

1132
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,887
This is a big client.

1133
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,931
-They have to be impressed.
-Okay, babe. Okay.

1134
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,390
Tomorrow.

1135
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,475
Promise.

1136
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,080
Oh?

1137
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,790
You're still looking at those?

1138
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,127
Thank you, babe.

1139
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,421
For what?

1140
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:04,841
For everything.

1141
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,385
For all this.

1142
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,887
For your help.

1143
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,067
Why does it seem like
you're not happy for me?

1144
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,360
What do you mean?

1145
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:25,653
I'm happy for you.

1146
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,072
I was just hoping that…

1147
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:28,990
you'll do more.

1148
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,700
Really, Carlo?

1149
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:32,159
Now?

1150
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,121
-I just received an award.
-Pia.

1151
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,372
I was just hoping

1152
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:39,375
that you would bring in
more business this year.

1153
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,460
-I met my target!
-Yes!

1154
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,588
You met your target,
but that was the minimum.

1155
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,841
Truth is,
I wanted to promote you this year.

1156
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,175
But how am I supposed to do that?

1157
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,386
When you have nothing to show for it.

1158
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,013
Do you get what I mean?

1159
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,232
Hello?

1160
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,817
Yes.

1161
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,362
The proposal is ready,
so we'll have it sent to your email,

1162
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:12,241
And then just reply to us
when you're ready.

1163
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,826
Okay, yeah. Yes!

1164
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,119
We'll meet you guys tomorrow.

1165
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,829
Perfect. Thank you so much.

1166
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,372
Okay. Goodbye!

1167
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:52,698
I heart you.

1168
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,744
Aww, love!

1169
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,371
You're so sweet.

1170
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,748
-I love you too.
-Love you.

1171
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:11,092
What is that? You're like a child.

1172
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,177
Is it cute?

1173
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,348
Anyway…

1174
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,101
I talked to my guys.

1175
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:23,020
They said we have a special client.

1176
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:24,981
And this looks huge!

1177
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,566
We have to secure this immediately.

1178
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,654
Are you familiar with the app
called Shop2Go?

1179
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:39,328
Hey.

1180
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,790
Earth to Pia.

1181
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,126
Are you listening?

1182
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,044
Yeah, I am.

1183
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,129
Uhm…

1184
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:49,255
This is…

1185
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,298
the Chinese shopping app.

1186
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,842
-Right?
-Correct.

1187
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:56,846
And they want to do
an 11-11 and 12-12 campaign.

1188
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,640
So, let's call a meeting with our staff.

1189
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:04,311
Also, I spoke with their agency.

1190
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,676
HOW ARE YOU?

1191
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,852
Babe. You disappeared.

1192
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,270
You didn't tell me.

1193
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,774
You were taking a while in the restroom,
so I walked around. Is that okay?

1194
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,651
I've been looking everywhere for you.

1195
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,486
Next time, tell me.

1196
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:36,737
Okay, sorry, Carlo.

1197
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,948
-Didn't we talk--
-I'm sorry, Carlo.

1198
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:39,907
Are we good?

1199
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:42,576
Let's go.

1200
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,334
Babe.

1201
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:53,170
Why don't we have a vacation in Manila?

1202
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,421
Maybe next month.

1203
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,091
So we can take a breather.

1204
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,344
I'd love that.

1205
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:03,597
I could take a leave for a few weeks.

1206
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,516
Right?

1207
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,519
I miss my mom and my brother.

1208
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:09,854
Actually,

1209
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:11,856
Manila sounds like a good idea.

1210
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,483
So I can finally meet your family.

1211
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:44,722
You should come visit Singapore.

1212
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:47,892
There's a lot
of hidden tourist spots there.

1213
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:48,809
Mm-hmm!

1214
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,812
There are great restaurants and bars.

1215
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,647
Pia knows what I'm talking about.

1216
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,649
Wow, Carlo. Take me and Mama there, okay?

1217
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,027
My sister looks like
she was really enjoying herself.

1218
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,738
Oh, please, Jay.
It's only fun in the beginning.

1219
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,823
When you get used to it, it's like…

1220
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,241
It's like Fort, Makati.

1221
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,367
Nothing special.

1222
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,952
And it's super fast-paced.

1223
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,746
And it's so hot, it's ridiculous.

1224
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:09,914
Very draining.

1225
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:11,415
It's like you can't breathe.

1226
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,126
Anyway…

1227
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,837
So, Carlo asked us to dinner.

1228
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,757
What's up? I feel like something's up.

1229
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:21,300
Don't.

1230
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:22,426
Mm?

1231
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:23,928
Actually…

1232
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,179
Fel.

1233
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,181
Auntie.

1234
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:28,724
Jay.

1235
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,476
As you all know,

1236
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,229
Pia and I have been
together for five years

1237
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,231
and still going strong.

1238
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,609
And in that short amount of time,

1239
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,611
I've been happy.

1240
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:42,947
She's been happy.

1241
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:47,701
Pia.

1242
01:10:58,545 --> 01:10:59,838
Sophia…

1243
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,216
Ledesma Suarez.

1244
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:05,928
Will you marry me?

1245
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,807
-Go for it, girl.
-Go for it.

1246
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,225
Go, girl.

1247
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,939
Carlo, could you stand up, please?

1248
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,818
Excuse me.

1249
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,820
Carlo, please stand up.

1250
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,657
Carlo, not now.

1251
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,618
What do you mean?

1252
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,746
I'm still not sure.

1253
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,420
I'm sorry. Sorry, I don't know yet.

1254
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:43,007
Excuse me.

1255
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,509
Pia.

1256
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,014
-Go follow your sister.
-Okay, Ma.

1257
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,046
Dear?

1258
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,716
What's your plan? Hm?

1259
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,262
Are you going back to Singapore?

1260
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,014
I need to, Ma.

1261
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,266
I still have work.

1262
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,227
My gosh.

1263
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,562
You two are giving me a headache.

1264
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,690
I've ran out of paracetamol.

1265
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,193
I even ran out of my meds.

1266
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:28,862
Don't worry, Ma.

1267
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,239
I'll buy you some later.

1268
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,866
I'm gonna go lie down, okay?

1269
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:33,992
Excuse me.

1270
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,243
I stopped by earlier,

1271
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:17,703
but I got nervous.

1272
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,081
Of course, Fel. I left him, remember?

1273
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:25,127
How could I face him after all that?

1274
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,462
I don't get you, girl.

1275
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,213
Why are you still thinking about Aki?

1276
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,717
Didn't you break up
because he's a layabout?

1277
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,636
He has no job. He's a drunk.

1278
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:36,763
Just forget about him.

1279
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:40,142
I should go, Fel.

1280
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:41,810
I'm at the pharmacy.

1281
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:51,612
Aricept, please. Ten mg, 90 pieces.

1282
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:52,529
Prescription?

1283
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,364
Here.

1284
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:56,658
Rekrek?

1285
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:58,535
Hey!

1286
01:14:58,619 --> 01:14:59,578
Pia!

1287
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:01,622
How are you?

1288
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:03,123
Long time, no see, eh?

1289
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,709
Yeah. I just got back from Singapore.

1290
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:06,960
What about you? How are you?

1291
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:09,880
I'm alright. Just busy with Aki.

1292
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,757
I'm buying medicine for him.

1293
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,883
Medicine?

1294
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,303
Why? H-how is Aki?

1295
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:17,596
What happened?

1296
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:23,602
Come in, Pia. Come in.

1297
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:26,063
I'm sorry about the mess.

1298
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:29,316
Mom?

1299
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:32,110
Mom?

1300
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:38,659
Mom, it's Pia. She's here.

1301
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,331
Pia?

1302
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:48,210
Uh, how are you?

1303
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:49,962
Hm?

1304
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,048
I'm okay, Auntie.

1305
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,053
Uh…

1306
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,264
Aki!

1307
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:04,184
Aki! Aki, look. It's Pia.

1308
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,352
Aki.

1309
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:13,944
Pia, we'll give you some time alone, okay?

1310
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:17,281
I'll… I'll make you some oatmeal, okay?

1311
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:20,492
Come, Rekrek. Help me in the kitchen.

1312
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,052
Who are you?

1313
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,890
Are you my student?

1314
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:30,979
Isn't it…

1315
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:33,940
Saturday today?

1316
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:36,693
Why are you here?

1317
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,453
Aki, it's me.

1318
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,165
It's Pia.

1319
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,835
Do… Do you remember?

1320
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:58,423
I… I used to live here, too.

1321
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,176
Here?

1322
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:05,097
We were here together?

1323
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,182
When?

1324
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:11,019
Yeah. We…

1325
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,231
We used to be together all the time.

1326
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,572
You used to take care of me.

1327
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:28,203
You would wake me up in the morning.

1328
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:33,542
You would cook for me.

1329
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,296
You would drive me to and from work.

1330
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:46,680
And then…

1331
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,850
Sometimes when I'm sad,

1332
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:52,519
you would play the piano for me.

1333
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,230
Do you remember?

1334
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:11,079
Miss.

1335
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:13,248
Who the hell are you?

1336
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,211
Aki, don't be scared.

1337
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:21,298
Don't be scared.

1338
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:24,760
Miss, you can't just grab me like that.

1339
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:28,013
What are you doing in our house? Rekrek?

1340
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,432
Rekrek?

1341
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,268
Who is this?

1342
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:46,782
Chill out, bro.

1343
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:49,367
She's a visitor.

1344
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:36,039
I don't know.

1345
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:41,461
I thought I was just forgetful.

1346
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:48,134
I thought it was the stress.

1347
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,937
But I was already sick.

1348
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,776
After several examinations,

1349
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:07,237
we have found that…

1350
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,157
you have early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.

1351
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:12,576
What?

1352
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,246
Now, in your case,

1353
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:18,373
there might be rapid deterioration

1354
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:20,500
because you have
a high level of education.

1355
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,336
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

1356
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,963
I'm still fixing this…

1357
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,506
-It's a camera!
-Camera.

1358
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,008
-Camcorder.
-Camcorder, yeah.

1359
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,217
You old man.

1360
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:31,595
The things you mentioned,

1361
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:35,015
when you forget
the words for certain things,

1362
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:38,018
forgetting certain events…
Those are symptoms.

1363
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:38,977
You were absent yesterday.

1364
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:39,895
We missed you.

1365
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:40,896
Did we have class yesterday?

1366
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,857
You're so funny. Why are you in uniform?

1367
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,026
Why else? For work.

1368
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:47,277
It's Sunday.

1369
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,570
Oh, love.

1370
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:49,613
Happy birthday!

1371
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:52,741
See? If I didn't point it out,
you wouldn't greet me.

1372
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:54,784
Our electric bill's not paid yet?

1373
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,286
This is a disconnection notice.

1374
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:57,704
Love, I promise I'll do it.

1375
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:00,165
Why is this still here?
Is it still not paid?

1376
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,417
Am I supposed to do that?

1377
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:03,668
Have you seen my phone?

1378
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,629
You're looking for your phone

1379
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,047
instead of going to my birthday dinner.

1380
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,633
-Oh, fuck! That's right.
-Yeah?

1381
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:16,181
On November 26, 1896…

1382
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:22,896
Actually, I don't know what's happening.

1383
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,066
I don't know why I forget to go to class.

1384
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,484
I don't know what's happening.

1385
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:29,402
I don't know what's happening, ma'am.

1386
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,071
Have you gotten a checkup?

1387
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,283
Tinola chicken mami, your favorite!

1388
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,868
Why is there no chicken?

1389
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:42,332
You ditched Fel!

1390
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:45,168
They went out of their way
to help you get a job,

1391
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:47,212
and you didn't even show up, Aki?

1392
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:49,589
That's been on your calender
for two months, remember?

1393
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:50,632
What's wrong with you?

1394
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:58,181
Another symptom is forgetting
the purpose of certain objects.

1395
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:03,436
Love, I need to tell you something.

1396
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,355
You didn't pick me up.

1397
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,609
I couldn't pick you up because…

1398
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,950
I didn't know how to start the car.

1399
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,868
I don't know why.

1400
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,250
I don't know why.

1401
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:31,381
You have impulsive purchases.

1402
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:33,258
Out of control spending.

1403
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:37,345
These are all behaviors and symptoms
of someone with Alzheimer's Disease.

1404
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:38,888
This is expensive.

1405
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:41,057
We can't even pay for the house.

1406
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,226
And you're buying all this shit?

1407
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,479
I started…

1408
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,566
drinking.

1409
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:50,942
Alcohol.

1410
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,694
So that somehow,

1411
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:56,322
I could feel better.

1412
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,825
Come on. I'll send you to rehab,
since you're an alcoholic!

1413
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:00,076
I'm not an alcoholic!

1414
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,911
Then what the fuck is this?

1415
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:03,621
She thought I was an alcoholic.

1416
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,790
Forget about all this, okay?

1417
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,083
Forget about me, Aki.

1418
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,543
Let's go.

1419
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,211
Pia!

1420
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,923
I didn't tell her.

1421
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:18,178
I don't know.

1422
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:20,388
All I know is

1423
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,098
something was wrong.

1424
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,226
Where am I?

1425
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:27,979
What is this place?

1426
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,031
I didn't want to drag her into it.

1427
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,327
I…

1428
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:46,998
I didn't want to be a burden to her.

1429
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:48,958
Until…

1430
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,006
she left.

1431
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:06,392
I never wanted this. To forget.

1432
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,398
But she forgot about me.

1433
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:22,617
She forgot about everything
we shared together.

1434
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,830
But I can't blame her.

1435
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:29,082
She didn't know.

1436
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,378
It must be tiring to take care of me.

1437
01:25:36,422 --> 01:25:39,884
But if she knew,
I know she wouldn't leave me.

1438
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:44,764
She loves me.

1439
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,393
She loves me so much.

1440
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,264
We didn't know

1441
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:30,143
when it started. It all happened so fast.

1442
01:26:30,226 --> 01:26:31,436
And that was it.

1443
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,938
All his memories were gone.

1444
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,858
Maybe he got it from my brother,

1445
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:38,318
Aki's father.

1446
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:43,156
In Aki's case, I am very sorry to tell you

1447
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:45,241
that in the late stage of Alzheimer's,

1448
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:46,826
in this situation,

1449
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:51,247
he's going to need
round-the-clock assistance and care.

1450
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:55,335
Doc, won't he be able
to remember anything?

1451
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,297
Sometimes, he would be able
to remember some things.

1452
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,506
For example,

1453
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:03,927
he could remember his old hobbies.

1454
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:04,844
Like…

1455
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:07,513
Like playing a certain musical instrument.

1456
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:11,392
But in his case right now,

1457
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:15,563
it will be hard for him
to remember things.

1458
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,775
Maybe there are treatments abroad?

1459
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,903
Just to help him remember even a little.

1460
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,823
Even just to recognize me.

1461
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:28,952
I'm sorry. There's none.

1462
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:40,380
What will you do, dear?

1463
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,840
You still have work in Singapore.

1464
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,345
I think I'm going
to stay here for a while, Ma.

1465
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:50,390
For Aki.

1466
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:54,894
Sis, do you want us
to take care of Aki for a bit?

1467
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:58,147
As much as possible,
I want to be the one taking care of him

1468
01:27:58,231 --> 01:27:59,065
That's why…

1469
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:02,777
I'm going to resign
from my job in Singapore.

1470
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:03,778
Dear.

1471
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:10,201
Stay strong, okay?

1472
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,413
Take good care of Aki.

1473
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:20,461
We're here for you.

1474
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:24,841
Come on. This will be quick.

1475
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:25,842
-No.
-Come on.

1476
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:26,759
Look at me.

1477
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:27,969
-No.
-This will be quick.

1478
01:28:28,052 --> 01:28:30,096
-Take off your clothes.
-I don't want to.

1479
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:34,017
Shit.

1480
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:35,935
Oh no! Oh my God!

1481
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:37,979
What do I do?

1482
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,773
-Oh no! Pia!
-Rekrek!

1483
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:41,941
-What happened?
-Rekrek, I'm sorry.

1484
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,568
I was trying to give Aki a bath.

1485
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:44,694
I forgot.

1486
01:28:44,777 --> 01:28:45,945
Are you hurt?

1487
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,488
N-no.

1488
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:51,200
Aki!

1489
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:54,162
Oh no!

1490
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:57,415
Aki, what did you do?

1491
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:58,583
You're so clumsy.

1492
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,918
Rek, can you clean that up?

1493
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,337
There's more over there.

1494
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,421
Aki.

1495
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:04,589
Oh! Oh!

1496
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:06,507
Oh no! Aki. Aki.

1497
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:07,675
Aki, come here. I'll give you a bath.

1498
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,260
-Come on, so you can get cleaned up.
-No.

1499
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,095
-I don't want to.
-Come on. Please, Aki.

1500
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,347
-I'll help you.
-I said I don't want to!

1501
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,598
-What?
-Hey!

1502
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,225
Who are you, miss?

1503
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,227
What are you doing in my house?

1504
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,647
I'm not kidding. I'll call the police!

1505
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:22,648
Who are you?

1506
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:23,816
Who are you?

1507
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,694
Aki. Aki, it's me, Pia.

1508
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,321
I don't know you!

1509
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,323
Who are you?

1510
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:32,408
Rekrek, who is this?

1511
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:33,785
Get out! I'm not kidding!

1512
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:35,661
Please, I don't want any trouble!

1513
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:38,164
Bro, calm down. Calm down.

1514
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,292
This is trespassing, miss.
I'm not kidding.

1515
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:42,668
This is trespassing!

1516
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:45,797
Calm down. Get in there, bro.

1517
01:29:47,673 --> 01:29:49,008
Stay there, okay?

1518
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:52,178
Go on, Rek. I'll take care of this.

1519
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:56,641
Aki, here. Come on.

1520
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,184
Just a little more.

1521
01:29:58,267 --> 01:29:59,727
Come on.

1522
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:01,521
Aki, come on.

1523
01:30:04,273 --> 01:30:06,692
Aki, it's not good to waste food, okay?

1524
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,069
Why do you keep telling me to eat?

1525
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:10,196
You're so annoying.
You're like a broken record.

1526
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:11,656
Look, you made a mess.

1527
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,032
Pia, here. For cleaning the wound.

1528
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:13,950
Thank you.

1529
01:30:14,617 --> 01:30:15,535
I'll clean this up.

1530
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:16,786
Thank you.

1531
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:19,372
Get him a new bowl.

1532
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:24,293
Rek, can you keep an eye on Aki?

1533
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,921
I think someone's at the door.

1534
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:39,851
Carlo.

1535
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:51,529
-Carlo.
-Hey.

1536
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:53,364
-Have some juice.
-Thank you.

1537
01:30:53,447 --> 01:30:54,282
Sure.

1538
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:01,914
Oh?

1539
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:02,957
What happened?

1540
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,209
-Are you okay?
-Ah, this?

1541
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,628
It's nothing. I slipped

1542
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:09,755
Yeah, I'm so clumsy.

1543
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,425
Ah, anyway.

1544
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:14,260
I wanted to tell you

1545
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:17,722
that I resigned
from the company in Singapore.

1546
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,682
I'm going to start my own

1547
01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:22,268
Singapore-based digital agency.

1548
01:31:22,351 --> 01:31:23,394
Wow!

1549
01:31:23,477 --> 01:31:25,897
That's good. Congratulations.

1550
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:26,856
Thank you.

1551
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:30,276
I thought of offering you a position
in the company.

1552
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:32,361
I want to make you VP.

1553
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:35,239
Uh…

1554
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:40,453
-Carlo, it's just that--
-Also, aside from being VP,

1555
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:42,538
I want you to make a shareholder.

1556
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:45,458
We'll be business partners, in a sense.

1557
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,793
We'll both run the company.

1558
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:51,881
And I'll give you a relocation package.

1559
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:53,966
Uh, allowance.

1560
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,676
Company car!

1561
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,929
I'll even pay for your place there.

1562
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,348
-And then… Maybe we could--
-Carlo.

1563
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:03,935
Thank you.

1564
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:07,188
Thank you for the offer.

1565
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,816
But I don't think I can accept it.

1566
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:14,070
But this is your dream, remember?

1567
01:32:14,153 --> 01:32:16,781
You were always
telling me about this back then.

1568
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:21,410
Honestly…

1569
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,872
I thought that would make me happy.

1570
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,834
But it turns out

1571
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:31,796
that it's not what I need.

1572
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,091
-Pia, please?
-Carlo.

1573
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:39,011
Thank you so much for the offer,

1574
01:32:40,179 --> 01:32:42,181
but I have to respectfully decline.

1575
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:45,184
Pia, please?

1576
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:47,853
I don't know why, but…

1577
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:50,147
I still love you.

1578
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:54,193
Carlo, I'm sorry.

1579
01:32:56,362 --> 01:32:57,488
What the hell?

1580
01:32:57,571 --> 01:33:03,494
You need to finish your food. Calm down.

1581
01:33:03,577 --> 01:33:04,870
What are you doing?

1582
01:33:06,038 --> 01:33:07,957
One last bite.

1583
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,166
No!

1584
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:14,588
Leave me alone!

1585
01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:16,507
There you go.

1586
01:33:19,969 --> 01:33:21,262
Press this one.

1587
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:32,523
Someone told me

1588
01:33:32,606 --> 01:33:34,358
that I used to be good
at playing the piano.

1589
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:37,695
You were so talented.

1590
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:39,530
The best of all.

1591
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:41,282
That's why I fell in love with you.

1592
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,538
Go on. Try it. Keep practicing.

1593
01:33:47,621 --> 01:33:48,622
You'll get it again.

1594
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:05,389
Aki, don't move.
We don't want an accident.

1595
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:08,017
There. Very good.

1596
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,914
I have a love message for you.

1597
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:30,831
Hmm? Alright.

1598
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,666
I love you, I love you, I love you.

1599
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,377
-That's sweet.
-I will never forget you.

1600
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:35,669
-Hm? Promise?
-Promise.

1601
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:36,962
Don't even try.

1602
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,883
That's our dream house.

1603
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:44,720
We said that's where we'll make babies.

1604
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:47,223
That's where I'll cook breakfast for you.

1605
01:34:49,767 --> 01:34:53,020
Hello! Welcome to our future.

1606
01:34:56,982 --> 01:34:58,025
Aki,

1607
01:34:58,692 --> 01:34:59,985
look.

1608
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:01,153
Love you!

1609
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:05,408
Aki.

1610
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:07,368
Good.

1611
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:09,453
Chew. Chew it.

1612
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:10,746
Chew. Mm-mmm.

1613
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,166
Chew. Chew.

1614
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,335
Show your face.

1615
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,796
There! You're so silly. Come on.

1616
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:19,755
Let's eat.

1617
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:20,923
He does stuff like this.

1618
01:35:21,006 --> 01:35:22,591
-Feed me, love.
-Alright, I'll feed you.

1619
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:24,677
This is our dream wedding.

1620
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:40,401
Come here, Aki.

1621
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,653
Over here.

1622
01:35:42,736 --> 01:35:44,864
Stay here. Just for a bit.

1623
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:46,240
Trust me.

1624
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:51,537
Father.

1625
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,497
I take thee,

1626
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:54,999
Aki Orteza,

1627
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:01,714
to be my lawfully-wedded husband.

1628
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:06,260
From this day forward,

1629
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:11,724
for richer or poorer…

1630
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:18,397
in sickness and in health…

1631
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:24,403
to love and to cherish,

1632
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:27,948
according to God's holy ordinance.

1633
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:33,245
Cheers to the bride and groom!

1634
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:34,663
-Yay!
-Yay!

1635
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:36,248
-Congratulations!
-More, more.

1636
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:37,374
-Yay!
-Yay!

1637
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:42,213
We even planned out the date.

1638
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:45,257
I had my wedding gown fitted.

1639
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:47,676
And I've seen you in your barong.

1640
01:36:52,806 --> 01:36:54,934
We even wanted to book

1641
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:57,686
Casa Salome because it's pretty there.

1642
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,189
Oh, are you hungry?

1643
01:37:00,272 --> 01:37:01,190
Do you want to eat?

1644
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:02,858
The Filipino food here is good.

1645
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:04,443
They have lumpia, chop suey…

1646
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:06,278
And our favorite!

1647
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:08,489
Tinola chicken mami.

1648
01:37:08,572 --> 01:37:11,242
You know,
you used to copy the dishes here,

1649
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:13,285
so you can cook them for me.

1650
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,538
But, of course, I prefer your recipe.

1651
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:18,874
The baby.

1652
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,000
Babe.

1653
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:25,673
Okay, there.

1654
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:27,675
There, see.

1655
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:29,718
This is where we used to sit

1656
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:31,220
when we went on dates.

1657
01:37:31,303 --> 01:37:32,638
This is our favorite.

1658
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:33,556
Come on.

1659
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:34,723
Taste it.

1660
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,183
You might be hungry.

1661
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:38,394
Careful. Ah.

1662
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:39,353
Open your mouth.

1663
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,856
Have some soup.

1664
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:45,901
Wow, very good. Isn't it good?

1665
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:50,906
Love.

1666
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:51,991
Mmm.

1667
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:55,786
You know what?

1668
01:37:55,869 --> 01:37:58,122
It tastes better when you feed it to me.

1669
01:37:58,205 --> 01:37:59,206
So good.

1670
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:04,128
There, good job.

1671
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:06,088
Watch your step.

1672
01:38:06,171 --> 01:38:08,132
You proposed to me here, you know?

1673
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:10,426
Over there! Come.

1674
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:13,012
There! And you had a piano.

1675
01:38:13,095 --> 01:38:15,389
And you played "How Did You Know?".

1676
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:16,432
And we danced.

1677
01:38:16,515 --> 01:38:18,309
Just like this. Hold me here.

1678
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:21,687
We danced like this.

1679
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:52,760
And then,

1680
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:54,595
after we danced,

1681
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:56,639
you said to me…

1682
01:38:58,349 --> 01:38:59,391
Love.

1683
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:04,563
My beloved.

1684
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,192
Mister.

1685
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:14,907
Ever since I met you…

1686
01:39:18,535 --> 01:39:21,997
I felt that you were the one.

1687
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,546
When you came into my life,

1688
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:36,387
I never felt loneliness ever again.

1689
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,018
I promise you,

1690
01:39:45,771 --> 01:39:47,022
you will never be alone.

1691
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:57,366
For as long as I live, I will serve you…

1692
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:02,079
love you.

1693
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:08,460
No matter what.

1694
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,427
I will never forget you.

1695
01:40:23,475 --> 01:40:24,977
I love you, Aki.

1696
01:41:46,975 --> 01:41:48,227
Damn, Aki.

1697
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:53,774
It's true what they say, isn't it?

1698
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:00,864
I guess it's true, Aki.

1699
01:42:05,702 --> 01:42:08,539
That we only realize someone's worth

1700
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:13,544
when they're gone.

1701
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,726
I want to apologize to you.

1702
01:42:38,527 --> 01:42:39,695
I'm sorry.

1703
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:45,701
Sorry, Aki.

1704
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:49,246
I shouldn't have left.

1705
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:27,576
Aki?

1706
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:29,328
Hey.

1707
01:43:29,411 --> 01:43:30,913
Aki, why are you crying? Hm?

1708
01:43:32,664 --> 01:43:33,957
Are you okay?

1709
01:43:39,212 --> 01:43:40,339
Are you sad?

1710
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:49,473
Why are you sad?

1711
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:50,682
I don't know.

1712
01:43:53,435 --> 01:43:55,354
It's just so hard. It's so sad.

1713
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,399
Is that possible?

1714
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:02,361
Huh?

1715
01:44:02,444 --> 01:44:04,696
You're crying, but you don't know why?

1716
01:44:05,447 --> 01:44:06,281
That's silly.

1717
01:44:11,453 --> 01:44:13,455
Don't cry, okay?

1718
01:44:15,248 --> 01:44:18,001
Aki, stop crying. I'm here.

1719
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:19,753
It's so hard.

1720
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:32,474
You know, Aki? Me too.

1721
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:35,519
I'm sad, too.

1722
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:41,024
Because if I knew then
that it was the last time,

1723
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:44,361
I would have embraced you so, so tight.

1724
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:49,574
If I knew that was the last time…

1725
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,164
I would never have left you.

1726
01:44:58,709 --> 01:45:00,293
Now, here we are.

1727
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:04,881
You don't even know who I am.

1728
01:45:09,344 --> 01:45:11,054
I know you.

1729
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:14,182
Hm? You know me?

1730
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:15,475
I know you.

1731
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:18,186
Are you my student?

1732
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,818
No! You don't know me.

1733
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:35,203
It's okay.

1734
01:45:35,704 --> 01:45:37,164
It's okay, hm?

1735
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:41,251
I love you so much, Aki.

1736
01:45:44,963 --> 01:45:47,799
I love you so much,
I will never leave you.

1737
01:45:50,469 --> 01:45:51,720
Alright. That's enough.

1738
01:45:51,803 --> 01:45:53,055
Stop crying.

1739
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:55,515
Stop crying, okay?

1740
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:57,059
Come on.

1741
01:45:57,559 --> 01:45:59,728
Let me see. Smile, smile.

1742
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:00,937
Give me a smile.

1743
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:12,616
I'll always be here for you, okay?

1744
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:31,259
Aki?

1745
01:46:32,302 --> 01:46:33,386
Aki?

1746
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:39,392
Aki?

1747
01:47:51,631 --> 01:47:54,593
I've missed that,
the song "How Did You Know"?.

1748
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:57,429
Play it to me,
as if you're proposing to me.

1749
01:47:57,512 --> 01:47:59,848
Someone told me

1750
01:47:59,931 --> 01:48:01,433
that I used to be good
at playing the piano.

1751
01:48:01,516 --> 01:48:04,728
You were so good.
That's why I fell for you.
