00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,280
Die!

192
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,390
Guys,

193
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,350
something really exciting just happened.

194
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,910
I caught a thief

195
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,590
who came to my house to steal.

196
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,560
But don't worry.

197
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,460
I'm ready

198
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,520
to call the police.

199
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,100
Now let's take a closer look

200
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,760
at his desperate expression.

201
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,990
Enough.

202
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,270
Stop struggling.

203
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,230
Explain to the police later.

204
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,010
Look.

205
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,110
110.

206
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,220
Officers!

207
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,670
Officers, are you mistaken?

208
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,930
They all know me.

209
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,110
Officers...

210
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,750
I... I pay so much property fees every year.

211
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,630
What... What's wrong with you?

212
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,270
Officers, you got it wrong.

213
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,080
I'm the owner. He's the thief.

214
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,530
Officer!

215
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,190
You were trespassing.

216
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,460
He's the owner.

217
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,830
Mom.

218
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,870
You should have told me earlier.

219
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,310
I made such a scene.

220
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,200
I'm sorry, my dear daughter.

221
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,470
It's all my fault.

222
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,630
Let me tell you.

223
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,320
Fortunately, he knows you're the daughter of the former owner.

224
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,170
He's done with it after we signed the settlement agreement.

225
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,610
Otherwise,

226
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,260
it would have been a big trouble.

227
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,910
I know.

228
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,040
I haven't seen you for over a year.

229
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,670
Come on, let me take a look at you.

230
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:28,870
Okay.

231
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,870
There's nothing to look at.

232
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,220
Where are you going?

233
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,110
Our home is this way.

234
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,700
This way.

235
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,240
This place looks familiar.

236
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,350
Mom.

237
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,360
Is this our only property now?

238
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,970
Our houses, cars,

239
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,130
and your

240
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,630
clothes, shoes, jewelry...

241
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,670
Are they all gone?

242
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,310
To be exact,

243
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,710
this is

244
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,080
only

245
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,680
a temporary place to stay.

246
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,760
Maybe one day

247
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,860
the creditors will take it away.

248
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,580
A few shareholders

249
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,420
only focused on profit

250
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,730
and invested in several highly risky projects,

251
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,770
which have all incurred losses.

252
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,050
In the end,

253
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,840
the company went bankrupt without repaying the debt.

254
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,060
They even put the debt on us.

255
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,430
I could only sell our villa to pay the debt.

256
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,070
But it wasn't enough.

257
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,590
So I had to sell the old house

258
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,330
we bought when your father and I got married

259
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,690
to pay the debt.

260
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,950
Mom.

261
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,940
You should have told me earlier.

262
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,100
I thought

263
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,950
you would come back later

264
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,820
so I could get ready to tell you this.

265
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,310
I just

266
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,550
didn't want you to suffer with me.

267
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,950
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,230
I never thought

269
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,230
that one day

270
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,030
I would come back here.

271
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:44,950
Happy birthday to you.

272
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,990
Congratulations to our daughter, Gaogui, for turning one year older.

273
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,710
Happy birthday.

274
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,500
Thank you, Dad. Thank you, Mom.

275
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,890
We'll be together forever.

276
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,590
Forever!

277
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,190
Okay, forever.

278
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,310
Gaogui.

279
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,830
I haven't cleaned your room.

280
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,050
Get a quilt and make do with it for one night. Okay?

281
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,460
[Meton Food Co., LTD]

282
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,590
When will you give me a leave?

283
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,150
I'm going to Thailand to learn deep diving.

284
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,810
I think you should learn

285
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,280
something related to work.

286
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,540
Do you still remember the issues

287
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,760
I mentioned earlier that need to be corrected at work?

288
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,410
It's fine if you don't approve it.

289
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,560
What? Do you want to find an excuse to deduct my salary?

290
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,920
The position I hold is an idle job.

291
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,510
You can't blame me.

292
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,690
What if

293
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,670
I find something for you?

294
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,630
Tell me.

295
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,110
Come here.

296
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,100
Let me tell you.

297
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,680
Please.

298
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,980
Come on. Follow my strength.

299
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,030
Take a deep breath.

300
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,130
Take your time.

301
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,410
Relax.

302
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,870
Lean on the chair.

303
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,570
I'll make you the temporary CEO of the company.

304
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,700
What do you think?

305
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,380
Are you kidding me?

306
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,940
You didn't have to go to this extent

307
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,610
just to avoid giving me time off.

308
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,110
Ming.

309
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,180
I have something

310
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,070
to tell you.

311
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,870
I told you before

312
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,330
that your sister-in-law has been feeling unwell lately.

313
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,350
Actually, she's sick.

314
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,070
I plan to take her abroad

315
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,380
for treatment.

316
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,350
I'll be away for a while.

317
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,670
So I'll leave the work in the company

318
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,940
to you.

319
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,150
Well, Brother.

320
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,589
It's an important matter.

321
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,790
Well.

322
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,829
It's an important matter.

323
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,609
So many people in the company are watching.

324
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,710
Vice President Sun has been wanting to get this position.

325
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,829
And Director Lu

326
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,109
always wants to go further.

327
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,109
Why don't you go to them?

328
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,660
Ming, listen to me.

329
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,950
Don't forget

330
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,079
you were Grandpa's favorite.

331
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,000
Although Grandpa has been gone for many years,

332
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,720
our Meton Popcorn

333
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,310
was the first company

334
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,630
established by Meiziwei Group

335
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,590
and also a business left by him.

336
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,150
So I think you should be responsible

337
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,780
and be a real man.

338
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,840
[Zhong Yiming CEO]

339
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,590
Boss.

340
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,350
You told him?

341
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,730
Yes.

342
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,030
You should listen to him from now on.

343
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,210
Please help him.

344
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,830
At this critical moment,

345
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,180
why entrust the company to...

346
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,820
I know you all privately call him

347
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,350
the Second Young Master who idles away.

348
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,620
Then why did you do that?

349
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,750
You appointed him

350
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,740
as Chief Strategy Officer

351
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,670
and paid him for doing nothing.

352
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,600
It has already caused a lot of complaints.

353
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,070
Now you let him be the CEO.

354
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,880

Vice President Sun has worked so hard in the company for so many years.

356
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,870
It doesn't make sense.

357
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,400
The performance of Meton Popcorn is getting worse every year.

358
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,810
You know the situation.

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,520

closing or selling Meton Popcorn.

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,830
Won't they give us some time?

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,150
We'll do our best.

381
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,590
Come on.

You'll have a bright future.

383
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,510
All right, get back to work.

384
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,630
Give me the file.

385
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,430
It's all sorted out.

386
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,110
The useless brother has become the CEO.

387
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,150
What if he ruins the company?

388
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,840
We should contact the headhunters as soon as possible.

389
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,940
Be careful.

390
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,550
How about we hire a cleaner?

391
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,870
Isn't it said that we should leave professional things

392
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,430
to professional people?

393
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,150

405

You've been working for 12 hours.

We work overtime as a matter of course.

Hello, Brother. I was about to call you.

423
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,590
I found a small issue with the project progress at the company.

424
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,160
Can I...

425
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,070
It's okay. It's just a minor matter.

426
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,420
As the CEO, you can make decisions yourself.

427
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,430
Okay, I see.

428
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,990
I'm quite busy. I'll hang up now.

429

Hello, Mr. Zhong.

430

You're going home?

434
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,430
Go ahead.

435
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,150
Whoever leaves now is a fool.

436
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,650
The group appointed such an ignorant person as the CEO.

437
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,860
Obviously, the group

438
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,170
is giving up on our company.

439

Anyone who doesn't perform well now

440
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,820
will definitely be laid off.

441
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,330

I'll briefly say a few words.

445
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,970
I hope the leaders

446
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,030
of each department

447
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,630
can convey my message to your employees.

448
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,470
First,

449
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,350
I hope everyone won't spread the rumor

450
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,670
about me wanting to lay off employees.

451
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,360
I have never mentioned laying off anyone.

452
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,610
I wouldn't even consider laying off anyone

453
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,260
due to shorter overtime hours.

454
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,890
I'll only decide

455
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,960
based on everyone's actual work performance.

456
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,690
Second,

457
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,930
from now on, everyone will leave punctually at 6 p.m.

458
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,640
No overtime is allowed.

459
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,510
If you need to work overtime,

460
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,950
it means your time management and project management

461
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,430
are not well done in my opinion.

462

Once I catch you doing it, I'll take appropriate action.

463
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,110
So, I hope everyone can enjoy

Hello, Boss.

468
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,030
He really said just a few words.

This boss is extraordinary.

470
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,430
He's just acting tough.

471
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,040

Why have you been so hesitant lately?

488
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,200
You had too much traditional French cuisine and

489
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,470
think this place isn't good anymore?

490
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,470
No.

491

492
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,680
which one to choose.

493
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,870
Why bother thinking?

494
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,150
