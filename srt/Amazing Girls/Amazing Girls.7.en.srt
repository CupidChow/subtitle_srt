Suddenly?

67
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,500

They said there was no problem with the production line.

161

Since you're shutting down the factory to examine it,

162
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,230
you have to give us an explanation

163

it's about personal safety

00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,830
and production safety.

170
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,030
But how could we

171
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,030
ensure the safety?

172
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,660
I think

173
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,790

184
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,710
When you find a problem,

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,910
how would I know if there's a problem?

188
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,670

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,390
are all found during an overhaul.

191
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,530
All right, we're leaving then.

192
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,549
You look quite busy.

193
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,549
I won't bother you then.

194
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,440
Don't go. Let's have a drink tonight.

195
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,480
No, no, no.

196
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,230
Let's go.

197
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,350
Are you really leaving?

198
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,470
See you.

199
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,430
Bye.

200
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,090
I didn't know you were such a person.

201
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,610
What's wrong with me?

202
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,350
Can't you see?

203
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,620
The director was obviously hiding something.

204
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,440
As a boss,

205
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,430
why didn't you debunk his lies?

206
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,710
Besides,

207
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,110
as long as you put pressure on him,

208
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,260
he can surely supply the goods.

209
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,590
I just started working in the company.

210
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,710
I don't even know who spread the news.

211
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,870
It's definitely not appropriate to force it.

212
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,150
Why not?

213
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,070
It's fine that you entrap me,

214
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,350
but you still want to harm our company, too?

215
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,430
Do you know

216
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,340
if we can't get money from your company,

217
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,230
I'll have to bear all the cost.

218
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,710
Forget it.

219
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,230
I have nothing to say to you.

220
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,710
No matter how much I do,

221
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,070
it's nothing to you.

222
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,000
I was so wrong about you.

223
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,810
Really?

224
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,720
It's the bonus day again.

225
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,470
After paying off the credit card debt,

226
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,470
I'll be looking forward to getting my next month's salary.

227
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,380
Yes.

228
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,430
Paying off credit card debt

229
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,010
will make disappear the joy of making money, won't it?

230
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,750
That being said,

231
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,230
some things

232
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,430
can indeed

233
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,010
make people forget some of their worries.

234
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,230
Why don't we discuss what to eat for dinner?

235
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,450
The company pays us for one dinner every month.

236
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,110
We have to pick a good day.

237
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,230
For example…

238
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,350
Today!

239
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,480
You guys go. I'm busy. I'm not going.

240
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,850
Let's have a hotpot tonight.

241
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,800
My treat.

242
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,870
Boss, you're so nice!

243
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,990
Thank you, Boss.

244
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,800
Gaogui.

245
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,160
Boss seldom treats us.

246
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,420
Have the hotpot first before anything else.

247
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,670
Yes, go with us.

248
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,680
Okay.

249
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,250
Gao, I'm leaving.

250
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,650
Aren't you leaving?

251
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,540
Hurry up. We're all waiting for you.

252
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,990
Don't wait for me. You guys eat first.

253
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,630
Gaogui works so hard.

254
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,790
It makes us professional eaters

255
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,380
feel ashamed.

256
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,990
Ju Ran, wait for me.

257
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:56,950
Hurry up!

258
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,070
Coming.

259
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,460
Gaogui.

260
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,830
Hurry up. Let's go have dinner.

261
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,710
I'll be working for a while. You guys eat first.

262
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,450
Hurry up.

263
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,430
Isn't your department having dinner together today?

264
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,350
Why are you still here?

265
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,010
Don't tell me they didn't invite you again.

266
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,430
They did.

267
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,710
But I'm not in the mood to eat.

268
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,280
What are you going to do with this hot potato?

269
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,630
I'll pay off my credit card debt myself.

270
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,590
I'll bear all the costs the company has paid.

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,470
What nonsense are you talking about?

272
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,630
You're just working for others, but not starting a business of your own.

273
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,230
It's my last dignity

274
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,750
to keep my promise.

275
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,990
No matter what,

276
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,110
I'll take full responsibility for this.

277
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,170
I'll just find a few more part-time jobs in the worst-case scenario.

278
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,080
I'll make as much money as I can.

279
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,190
I'm off work then.

280
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,160
[Insufficient inventory]

281
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,710
Why is it out of stock even before it goes on sale?

282
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,510
This is hunger marketing.

283
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,830
You think too highly of yourself.

284
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,590
We didn't want to buy it anyway.

285
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,070
I'm turning to an anti-fan from a fan.

286
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,430
Is it a lie?

287
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,940
After all, the shutdown of the factory

288
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,020
[Meiziwei Group]

289
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,990
is not the responsibility of Xinda PR.

290
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,980
You must have seen

291
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,550
the contract we signed clearly.

292
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,140
There are exemption terms in it.

293
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,590
It's written clearly

294
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,350
that the billing will be paid according to the final sales.

295
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,870
The sales are zero now.

296
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,020
We don't need to pay.

297
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,230
This situation

298
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,110
is something neither of us don't want to see.

299
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,400
But based on the spirit of contract,

300
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,790
should your company

301
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,000
bear part of the loss, too?

302
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,830
You shift the problem of the production lines of the factory

303
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,800
to a PR company.

304
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,260
If this gets out,

305
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,110
you'll be laughed at, won't you?

306
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,190
You need to understand this.

307
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,390
If I had a way to solve this problem,

308
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,820
I won't make things so ugly.

309
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,040
But now, we can only follow the contract.

310
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,800
We really can't afford it.

311
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,750
[President's Office]

312
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,930
It's the factory's problem.

313
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,730
Why did you ask Xinda PR to bear the cost?

314
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,990
Mr. Zhong,

315
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,800
You proposed the idea

316
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,150
that the supplier advances the cost.

317
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,860
But I know

318
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,680
your starting point

319
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,630
was to save our company's cost.

320
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,750
But this is the factory's problem.

321
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,590
I didn't say

322
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,190
they have to advance this part too, did I?

323
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,310
This is what we, your subordinates, need to do—sharing your burden.

324
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,630
You didn't expect that,

325
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,720
but I did.

326
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,590
And I wrote it clearly in the contract.

327
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,880
This is my loyalty to the company.

328
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,700
I won't let the company lose a penny.

329
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,710
But business is business, and private affairs are private affairs.

330
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,620
If you feel guilty

331
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,930
and want to pay for it yourself,

332
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,950
I'll have no objection.

333
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,100
Nice bikes.

334
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,610
Are you sure you want to sell them all?

335
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,600
Yes.

336
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,020
Are you selling this racing motorcycle, too?

337
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:51,880
Yes.

338
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,020
Sign it.

339
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,990
Please.

340
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,760
Stop asking me what I'll do.

341
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,590
I have Plan B,

342
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,750
but it seems

343
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,520
it's not a good idea after all.

344
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,750
I'm worried about you.

345
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,590
Yuxuan,

346
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,090
It won't help to worry about me now.

347
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,790
Leave me alone.

348
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,630
I'll think of a way.

349
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,020
[Cash from your credit card]

Who will pay?

354
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,710
I myself.

355
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,920
Mr. Zhong,

356
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,510
listen to me.

357
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,890
Where can you get the money?

358
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,790
Don't go astray

359
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,430
just to get money.

360
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,350
It'll ruin your life.

361
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,990
You think too much. I got the money through the proper channels.

362
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,830
All right.

363
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,840
I'll remit the money to you now.

364
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,920
Remit the money…

365
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,510
Where did he go?

366
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,170
He said he wanted to pay the money for Xinda PR.

367
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,430
What money?

368
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,190
The printing cost of the Mid-Autumn Festival promotion project

369
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,190
of Xinda PR.

370
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,110
Weren't we asked them to bear it?

371
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,240
But the goods were not delivered in the end.

372
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,990
So the money...

373
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,770
He wants to pay for it himself.

374
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,190
That is so unprofessional.

375
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,200
In my view,

376
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,190
he just wants to show off

377
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,500
in front of his little girlfriend.

378
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,230
I know him well.

379
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,920
He usually spends a lot and doesn't save money.

380
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,530
I'm afraid there's nothing he can do.

381
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,590
Hello.

382
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,510
Have you made up your mind?

383
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,280
Come on, beauty. Get in.

384
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,800
Wait a second.

385
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,550
Hello?

386
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,030
Really?

387
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,230
Great!

388
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,670
I'm sorry, sir.

389
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,390
I don't need it anymore.

390
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,290

[President's Office]

392
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,060
Mr. Zhong,

393
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,260
the Mid-Autumn Festival promotion plan has completely failed.

394
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,180
Do you have any compensation measures for this season?

395
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,430
Are you listening to me?

396
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,210
We are in a critical condition!

397
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,510
I know.

398
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,870
I thought you would only oppose

399
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,200
any decision of mine.

400
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,500
Don't you have a solution already

401
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,600
and just need the signature from me, the substitute president?

402
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,790
What I opposed

403
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,510
was the part that I thought would disturb

404
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,020
the normal operation of the company.

405
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,390
Mr. Zhong, you need to understand.

406
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,320
I've been working in this company

407
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,280
since I graduated from college.

408
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,130
I have feelings for this place.

409
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,870
If anything happens to the company,

410
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,470
I'll be more anxious and worried than anyone else.

411
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,170
I'm so glad to have a colleague like you.

412
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,300
My brother has good taste.

413
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,710
So, what's your plan?

414
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,920
I don't have any.

415
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,150
You go and discuss with Vice President Sun.

416
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,590
Let me think more about it.

418
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,620
My heart hurts.

419
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,530
Just like you,

420
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,790
I sold all my treasures recently.

421
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,150
Do you feel the pain in your heart?

422
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,830
But I've been doing really well lately.

423
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,230
I'll pass the good luck to you.

424
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,910
Then I have to get some of your good luck.

425
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,010
I heard good things come in pairs.

426
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,990
The money for the factory has been settled.

427
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,280
You haven't encountered any trouble in your company anymore, have you?

428
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,930
Thank you for your support, Mr. Zhong.

429
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,460
I'll continue to do my best.

431
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,710
where did you put my socks?

432
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,050
I couldn't find them anywhere.

433
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,490
Did you put them in the chest of drawers again?

434
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,500
Not this pair.

435
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,190

do you think

440
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,590
they will refund us?

441
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,730
Maybe.

442
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,750
Darling, I'm sorry.

443
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,470
Darling, sorry to keep you waiting.

You know what? You came at a good time.

It's time for our anniversary.

We have a promotion—charge 5,000 and get 2,000 for free!

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,470
Well,

we're here to ask

453
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,890
if we can refund

454
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,310

00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,760
My baby, you're here.

or dyed?

Your hair is a bit dry.

Well, we're here today

462
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,030

We can do them all very well, honey.

471
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,510
Dye it.

472
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,470
Or at least you can have a scalp care.

473
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,090
You said so much,

474
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,730
but when can I get a refund?

475
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,190
Just tell me the date.

I'll tell you in at least three months.

478
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,840
If you really want to refund it,

479
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,610
you can introduce some new friends.

485
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,990
It's okay. I'll apply again.

486

You won't refund the card, will you?

490
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,160
It's okay, Mom.

491
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,380
Let's think more about it.

How?

510
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,250
You said it yourself

511
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,590
that this card can be used by the cardholder herself and her relatives.

512
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,180
Yes, honey.

513
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,280
But others can't use it, darling.

514
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,710
What do you mean?

515
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,430
They are all my relatives.

Yes, we're all relatives.

517
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
Yes, we're all relatives.

518
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,130
All right, don't just stand there.

Are you?

527
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,030
Your skin is so moist.

528

You look so good.

529
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,190

-Okay.
-Just give me 400.

536
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,060
It's such a fancy place. If you don't give me a discount,

537
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,390
I wouldn't have been too stingy to come here.

538
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,840
Will there be another chance like this?

539
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,730
Yes.

540
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,670
I've used up all the balance on this card.

541
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,240
But tomorrow is the special event for the hair salon.

542

If you want to have a stylish hairdo,

543
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,490
don't miss the chance.

544
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,640
Thank you so much, Fenfang.

545
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,630
I'll bring a few more friends.

546
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,270
Really?

547
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,230
That's great.

548
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,020
Great!

549
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,550
Okay.

See you tomorrow.

It smells so good.

558
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,710
It's been such a long time.

559

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,380
Yeah.

561
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,720
Let me tell you, for a long time I haven't…

562
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,870
I haven't even seen

563
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,030
such delicious food,

564
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,670
not to mention eating it.

565
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,130
Let me tell you.

566
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,440
If I still can't get the money today,

567
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,750
I would have used that credit card.

568
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,260
What are you doing? Eat up.

569
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,070
If you see something nice,

570
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,990
you have to help me pick one.

571
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,030
Sure.

572
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,200
Gaogui.

573
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,330
Hello, Aunt.

574
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,030
You're eating here too?

575
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,940
Yes.

576
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,230
Gaogui, it's been a long time since we last met.

577
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,550
What have you been busy with?

578
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,430
Lately, I've been

579
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,790
busy with work.

580
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,820
By the way, Gaogui,

581
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,790
We are going

582
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,120
-to attend a brand press conference.
-Yes.

583
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,880
There's still one vacancy.

584
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,750
Do you want to join us?

585
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,750
No, thanks.

586
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,030
I have to work overtime later.

587
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,750
Okay. Okay.

588
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,230
We'll leave now.

589
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,270
Bye, Auntie.

590
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,190
See you next time.

591
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,200
See you next time. Bye.

592
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,140
Weren't you friends with them before?

593
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,150
Why didn't you go hang out with them?

594
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,910
Maybe my situation is different.

595
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,650
I feel a little uncomfortable

596
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,340
being with them now.

597
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,800
Eat up.

598
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,820
Are you busy?

599
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,200
Since the company is in a mess,

600
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,090
why don't we pave the way for Mr. Zhong Jr.?

601
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,750
I think he's not far away from getting lost.

602
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,950
If the company is gone,

603
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,290
not only will he get lost,

604
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,770
but we will also go with him.

605
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,950
What's going on?

606
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,500
Why are you being so cynical today?

607
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,190
Don't you think the shutdown this time

608
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,430
is as damaging to ourselves as to the enemy?

609
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,790
If we miss the golden selling season,

610
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,670
we'll lose too much.

611
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,040
Loss is inevitable

612
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,360
if we want Mr. Zhong Jr. to lose his authority.

613
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,050
It is a good opportunity now.

614
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,360
You and I both know the company's situation.

615
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,760
If we keep losing money like this,

616
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,880
the group might give us up completely.

617
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,820
The company belongs to Meiziwei Group.

618
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,750
Just do your job. That's enough.

619
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,290
The company doesn't belong to us.

620
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,550
Don't you always put the company's interests

621
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,910
before everything else?

622
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,390
What's wrong with you today?

623
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,230
Why are you sarcastic to me?

624
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,680
Mr. Sun, let me ask you.

625
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,250
Was there really a safety hazard

626
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,030
so that the factory had to shut down

627
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,470
or was it a fabricated safety hazard?

628
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,320
I know a few people at the factory.

629
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,790
They told me…

630
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,410
You can't accuse people at will.

631
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,310
You need evidence for everything.

632
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,920
Or it'll be slander.

633
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,360
But then again,

634
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,650
the company has suffered a loss,

635
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,870
and Mr. Zhong Jr. has suffered a loss,

636
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,860
but for our future development,

637
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,030
there is no loss, right?

638
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,930
Whether Mr. Zhong Jr. resigns

639
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,220
or gets fired,

640
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,070
we'll go further up the career ladder in the future.

641
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,470
I do want to get promoted,

642
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,270
but it can't be done at the cost of the company's interests.

643
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,470
If it happens again,

644
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,030
I won't keep silent.

645
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,990
Director Lu, go meet someone with me.

646
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,030
Okay.

647
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,700
I hope you can behave yourself.

648
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,750
Do you remember Mr. Lin I told you last time?

649
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,630
The CEO of Dooro Bear?

650
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,910
We have reached a verbal cooperation.

651
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,190
Their IP

652
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,380
is popular among all age groups.

653
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,800
Meton will become

654
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,160
their company's first partner

655
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,250
of trying to co-brand snack products.

656
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,290
Indeed.

657
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,000
Even I, who don't usually watch anime,

658
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,790
know about their anime image.

659
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,630
If we can cooperate with them,

660
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,430
it'll be very good for us Meton.

661
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,860
It's just that…

662
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,560
Mr. Lin.

663
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,180
Hello.

664
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,740
This is Director Lu from our company.

665
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,270
Why don't we play two rounds to relax

666
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,100
and warm up?

667
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,950
You two go ahead, please.

668
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,670
I'm not good at playing it.

669
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,190
Plus, I have some emails

670
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,230
to deal with.

671
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,310
Then… Please.

672
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,310
Alright.

673
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,100
Here.

674
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,940
No, I can't go on anymore.

675
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,550
I really tried my best.

676
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,770
Mr. Lin,

677
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,620
I can't play with you at my level.

678
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,650
How about this?

679
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,740
Let's sign the contract first.

680
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,080
I'll take you to a race next time.

681
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,860
No hurry.

682
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,710
Let's wait for the right time.

683
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,690
Mr. Lin, it seems that you're a bit insincere.

684
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,060
Mr. Zhong is usually very busy.

685
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,400
He specially adjusted his schedule to meet you today.

686
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,820
Mr. Lin must have made time to meet us.

687
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,030
He must be very sincere, right?

688
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,470
How about this?

689
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,810
I'll play a round with Director Lu.

690
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,720
If Director Lu wins,

691
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,580
I'll sign this. How's that?

692
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,600
Okay.

693
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,130
One to zero.

694
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,920
Two to zero.

695
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,790
Ten to zero.

696
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,700
Fine.

697
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,090
Then

698
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,620
I won't waste your time.

699
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,570
Let's continue after signing the contract.

700
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,290
Didn't you just say you can't play?

701
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,100
But why do you play so well?

702
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,960
I've always been the champion of the badminton team in college.

703
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,190
You've been playing it since college? Then...

704
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,350
Sign here.

705
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,360
One more.

706
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,870
How about this? I'm leaving.

707
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,030
I feel I'm not needed here.

708
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,140
Didn't you say…

709
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,970
Why do you leave just after signing the contract?

710
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,300
Didn't we agree to play badminton?

711
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,080
Director Lu is free.

712
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,140
Let Director Lu play with you.

713
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,490
If you're too tired today,

714
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,810
I'll give you a day off tomorrow.

715
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,350
I'm leaving.

716
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,750
Let's play two more rounds.

717
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,230
You play so well.

718
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,690
You can teach me.

719
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:13,790
Besides,

720
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,230
I'm not that bad, am I?

721
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,430
It's not bad, right?

722
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,710
Indeed.

723
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,670
Your skill of picking up the shuttlecock

724
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,390
is not bad.

725
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,670
As for playing badminton,

726
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,570
let's play together next time.

727
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,310
Why do I feel like I've met two frauds?

728
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,030
Mr. Zhong.

729
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,470
We've got the role authorization

730
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,910
of the new anime IP Dooro Bear.

731
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,470
So, we're now having a meeting to discuss

732
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,640
how to explore a new direction

733
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,230
and increase the overall sales.

734
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,890
We can't leave the buckets

735
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,990
which you put a lot of effort into in the warehouse.

736
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,550
The anime image, Poko,

737
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,420
is inspired by a cactus.

738
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,630
People from little kids to adults

739
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,160
would like to buy it.

740
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,070
Kids…

741
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,780
Director Lu,

742
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,000
why don't we take a break and have a meal?

743
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,360
Okay.

744
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,750
Let's take a 40-minute break.

745
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,580
Isn't it a bit rush?

746
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,200
Mr. Zhong.

747
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,870
It's not the time to eat slowly.

748
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,810
Okay. I'll listen to you.

749
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,950
Mr. Zhong,

750
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,360
I'm going to the convenience store for dinner, too.

751
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,070
I ordered takeout.

752
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,020
I'll get it. Wait for me.

753
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,470
Mr. Zhong.

754
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,920
Did you order all this?

755
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:48,710
Yes.

756
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,430
Our boss Director Zhang ordered it for me before.

757
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,310
It was exactly the same as this.

758
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,510
You two have great chemistry.

759
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,020
Is it what you ate in the office

760
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,320
that night when you worked overtime?

761
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,370
Yes.

762
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,620
It was I who ordered that.

763
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,200
Eat up.

764
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,230
You ordered it?

765
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,010
Why did you order it for me?

766
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,790
Director Zhang

767
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,230
asked me if I had given you a lot of work tasks.

768
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,590
If he didn't ask,

769
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,270
I wouldn't have known

770
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,780
you had stayed up late every day

771
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,130
for our project.

772
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,840
If anything happens to you,

773
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,429
I'll have to take responsibility, won't I?

774
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,830
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

775
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:24,620
Okay.

776
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,389
Here you are.

777
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,520
Hello?

778
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,230
Okay, I'll be right there.

779
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,199
I'll wait for you to come back and eat with me.

780
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,110
I'm an old employee.

781
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,469
This is the best advice for you.

782
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,770
Be good, understand?

783
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,550
Yes.

784
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,110
When you go back,

785
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,150
get the material ready for me.

786
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,989
Okay.

787
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,989
You go back first.

788
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,230
Okay, Mr. Sun.

789
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,190
Well...

790
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,800
Mr. Zhong Jr.

791
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,520
I'll call a taxi for you.

792
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,610
No, it's just two kilometers.

793
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
When the taxi you call arrives, I'll be already there.

794
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,130
But you're the president.

795
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,350
It is not decent for you to ride this.

796
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,710
Where is your beloved motorcycle?

797
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,190
I haven't seen it for a long time.

798
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,280
Speaking of which, I now remembered.

799
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,450
Didn't it stop right here before?

800
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,470
I sold it.

801
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,390
Otherwise, where can I get the money to pay Xinda?

802
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,720
No way. It's not that bad.

803
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,300
All right, I'm leaving.

804
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,110
Go back and tell them

805
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,070
that we'll continue the meeting tomorrow.

806
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,270
Okay.

807
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,280
Slow down, Mr. Zhong.

808
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,220
It's not as good as a motorcycle.

809
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,300
Zhen Gaogui, pack up and eat at home.

810
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,280
Mr. Zhong Jr. won't be back soon.

811
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,630
Where did he go?

812
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,220
Do I have to report to you where Mr. Zhong Jr. is going?

813
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,170
Pack them up and go eat them somewhere else.

814
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,560
Okay, I see.

815
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,830
Gaogui.

816
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,530
I just found out that

817
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,150
Mr. Zhong Jr. sold his beloved motorcycle

818
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,210
to pay for you.

819
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,830
That's his life.

820
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,800
You have to work hard

821
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,470
to live up to his efforts.

822
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,840
Did you mean

823
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,330
Mr. Zhong paid the printing cost

824
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,620
by selling his motorcycle?

825
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,910
It's a secret. Don't let anyone know.

826
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,630
Boss.

827
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,110
I heard that Mr. Zhong sold his motorcycle

828
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,510
to pay for us.

829
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,290
He didn't pay with the company's money.

830
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,510
What should we do?

831
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,070
He can do whatever he wants.

832
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,690
I really don't know what to say to you.

833
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,600
You're right to worry.

834
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,860
But you don't have to worry so much

835
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,250
in your position.

836
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,400
Hello?

837
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,280
What?

838
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,910
I'll be right there.

839
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,210
You have to take these away today.

840
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,510
You can't leave them here anymore.

841
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,180
Go back to your work.

842
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,740
Excuse me.

843
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,960
What's going on?

844
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,710
Why are you taking all the goods away?

845
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,540
The warehouse often malfunctions.

846
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,110
We need to empty the warehouse for maintenance.

847
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,150
Your goods

848
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,350
can't be placed here anymore.

849
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,000
How about this?

850
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,740
Can we get them out

851
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,960
the moment the factory ships the goods?

852
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,500
If you don't take them away now,

853
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,990
it will be scrapped.

854
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,860
Don't make trouble.

855
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,110
No.

856
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,960
At least wait for Mr. Zhong's order.

857
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,620
Vice President Sun asked us to move them.

858
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,320
Go away.

859
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,990
Move!
