Sorry I made you worried, Grandpa Tong.

194
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,550
Just seize the chance.

195
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,040
At our age,

196
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,110
we don't even have a chance to seize.

197
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,789
Eat, eat.

198
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,270
Okay.

199
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,830
Is it good?

200
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,350
Grandpa.

201
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,470
Why aren't you eating?

202
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,110
This is your favorite.

203
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,470
I won't eat it today. You guys eat.

204
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,750
Ming,

205
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,120
Gaogui has chosen the right person.

206
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm relieved.

207
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,110
Take good care of her in the future.

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,310
Grandpa Tong, don't worry

209
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,230
We will

210
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,870
come back to visit you often.

211
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,870
Stretch your left waist.

212
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,710
Don't tighten your shoulder.

213
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,870
Mrs. Wang.

214
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,510
Exhale.

215
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,190
Fenfang.

216
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,230
Inhale.

217
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,190
As you can see,

218
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,110
I don't mean to give you a hard time.

219
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,110
Take care of yourself at home.

220
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,860
We've hired a new teacher.

221
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,710
We can't just let her go.

222
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,950
I can take classes on other timeslots.

223
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,990
I'm available anytime.

224
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,990
We don't have any classes for other timeslots.

225
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,950
How about this?

226
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,110
I'll let you know if there's any.

227
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,840
Okay?

228
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,480
Let's go.

229
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,230
Let's stretch.

230
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,230
Let's talk outside.

231
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,990
Turn back.

232
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,710
Hold your waist.

233
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,990
We need to keep breathing.

234
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,710
My mom is unemployed recently.

235
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,710
She can't go to yoga anymore.

236
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,190
She doesn't seem to have much ambition,

237
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,990
but actually she's quite concerned.

238
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,580
Let's go inside.

239
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,190
Mrs. Zhen.

240
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,230
Zhong is here.

241
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,230
Have a seat.

242
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,710
Have a seat.

243
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,310
Sit.

244
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,990
Mrs. Zhen,

245
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,870
how about

246
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,710
teach me private lessons?

247
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,590
I'll take your class.

248
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,990
so that I can relax.

249
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,310
Zhong,

250
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,710
I know you really want to help me,

251
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,950
and treat me well.

252
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,470
But

253
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,830
I still want to devote to a cause

254
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,470
with my own efforts.

255
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm a little tired from work recently.

256
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,510
My neck, arms and legs are all aching.

257
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,470
I want to stretch.

258
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,190
Right, Gaogui?

259
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,580
Yes, indeed.

260
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,230
He told me every day that

261
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,950
if he doesn't take your video class for just one day,

262
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,480
every cell would feel uncomfortable.

263
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,590
You two

264
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,350
just focus on your dating.

265
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,580
I can handle my problem

266
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,470
by myslef.

267
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,230
Mrs. Zhen, I'm serious.

268
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,830
Mom, he's really uncomfortable.

269
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,470
I...

270
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:27,990
Who is it?

271
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,630
I'll get the door.

272
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,110
Zhong.

273
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,830
Aunt Li.

274
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,230
Hello. Hello.

275
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,230
Have a seat.

276
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,430
Fenfang, I heard about it.

277
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,510
They don't allow you to go back to class.

278
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,710
The few of us sisters

279
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,430
really miss you.

280
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,310
Have a seat.

281
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,200
Have a seat.

282
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,240
Well,

283
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,710
in the past, I didn't know how it feels

284
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,950
to work hard.

285
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,120
But now,

286
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,310
there's no chance to work at all.

287
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,110
There will be chances in the future.

288
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,830
I'm not a young girl.

289
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,110
How many years do I have?

290
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,470
Mrs. Zhen, how about this?

291
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,630
Let's start tomorrow.

292
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,190
Yes.

293
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,200
Look, Zhong is so sensible.

294
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,870
If Gaogui doesn't want you,

295
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,470
let me introduce you to a girl.

296
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,070
Do you like older girls

297
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,710
or someone younger than you?

298
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,110
Aunt Li,

299
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,630
what kind of person do you want to introduce to him?

300
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,070
Tell me.

301
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,870
Gaogui,

302
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,870
I'll keep some for you

303
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,110
if I meet anyone suitable.

304
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,430
Aunt Li.

305
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,830
Gao Gui and I...

306
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,990
Actually,

307
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,110
she's already my girlfriend.

308
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,310
So, you were just playing around in front of me,

309
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,110
right?

310
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,950
Fenfang,

311
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,990
nowadays, young people's relationships

312
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,480
are just like TV series,

313
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,320
changing every day.

314
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,510
I really don't understand you.

315
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,990
Aunt Li, we...

316
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,230
We're serious.

317
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,710
Mr. Zhong.

318
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,870
When do you want to hold the company's regular meeting?

319
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,470
I'm not in the office in the afternoon recently.

320
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,110
Okay.

321
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,350
I'll arrange it in the morning.

322
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,830
Please come early.

323
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,750
Have a seat.

324
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,840
Recently, I've been thinking about

325
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,360
how to activate our online channels.

326
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,190
I've read the proposal you sent.

327
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,590
I've also looked into it.

328
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,350
It's important to build an online mall,

329
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,750
but the traffic of snacks relys on

330
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,630
the word-of-mouth brought by live streaming.

331
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,830
We used to sale offline.

332
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,350
Many new netizens

333
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,830
are not familiar with us.

334
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,630
I've talked to some MCN companies

335
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,470
you recommended to me.

336
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,230
But I found that their companies

337
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,230
is too small in size.

338
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,990
Our profit is small as well.

339
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,310
The manager of the Wanmei MCN,

340
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,750
which is very trendy recently, just come back.

341
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,070
I'm going to give it a try.

342
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,870
That company is very strict with product choosing.

343
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,870
They only work with international brands.

344
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,430
Can we talk this through?

345
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,230
What?

346
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,580
Do you have no confidence in our product?

347
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,310
or do you think our brand is not big enough?

348
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,480
None of them.

349
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,990
Go and meet people at Xinda

350
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,070
to work on an executable cooperation plan with them.

351
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,470
Talk to Zhen Gaogui alone.

352
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,480
Give it to me as soon as possible.

353
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,230
No problem.

354
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,110
Some of my people went to the International Snacks Festival.

355
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,590
They tell me that Meton Food

356
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,190
is quite eye-catching when they come back.

357
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,590
To be honest,

358
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,190
I used to think that Meton

359
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,350
was neither tepid nor popular.

360
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,430
Later, a gourmet blogger named Li Bupang,

361
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,230
you know her?

362
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,350
She talked about you last time.

363
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,230
I know.

364
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,590
Our PR personnel

365
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,830
reached out to her many times.

366
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,110
But we didn't cooperate in the end.

367
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,230
There's always a trade-off.

368
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,230
I met Mr. Zhong Sr. once before.

369
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,750
He rejected me as well.

370
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,310
It's all in the past.

371
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,350
We've changed our strategy.

372
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,000
So now,

373
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,480
we need to find

374
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,710
and work with a large MCN.

375
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,310
So that we can improve our online reputation.

376
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,870
I think you should know about

377
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,990
the market outlook, Mr. Zhong.

378
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,230
Although the traffic is huge,

379
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,110
but effective traffic is still very expensive.

380
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,750
We have written

381
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,990

It's not easy for her

545
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,310
to look for part-time job at her age.

546
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,910
But in this era, as long as you're talented,

547
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,790
you won't be buried.

548
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,750
I'll keep an eye on for her later.

549
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,510
When I was in France,

550
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,480
I only saw her in the video.

551
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,000
At that time, she wasn't as cheerful as she is now.

552
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,910
Indeed.

553
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,790
When you find something you enjoy,

554
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,790
you'll find life more meaningful.

555

563
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,060
I'll just stay at home.

for the company, for you.

753
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,230
I hope you can turn back in time.

754
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,150
Mr. Zhong Jr.,

755
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,100
You said you like to take risks

756
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,070
and try new things.

757
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,030
We all understand that.

758
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,350
Young people

759
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,670
are always curious.

760
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,670
But now you're forcing the closure

761
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,830
of the offline commercial channel,

762
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,110
It's grasping the shadow and letting go the substance.

763
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,990
The market and consumers are no longer

764
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,670
the same as they were ten years ago.

765
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,990
What we need is

766
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,510
a new Meton popcorn.

767
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,390
Mr. Zhong, since you don't want to turn back,

768
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,790
I can only leave with my team.

769
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,880
It's been a while.

770
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,990
I'm not back yet. Who's leaving?

771
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,990
Mr. Zhong Sr.

772
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,190
I miss you so much.

773
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,990
You've lost weight.

774
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,470
You're back, Mr. Zhong Sr. Have a seat.

775
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,710
Have a seat.

776
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,470
I happened to

777
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,790
catch your meeting.

778
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,190
So I'll sit and listen.

779
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,630
Don't worry about me.

780
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,020
Continue according to the procedures.

781
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,670
Mr. Zhong Sr,

782
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,310
our company's commercial and supermarket channels

783
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,550
will immediately be closed

784
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,470
by him.

785
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,230
Please talk to Ms. Zhong Jr.

786
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,510
You're closing the commercial and supermarket channels.

787
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,030
What' the operation mode for

788
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,870
the new experience store?

789
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,270
If we only sell

790
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,150
online products with average price,

791
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,990
the profit of traditional commercial and supermarkets

792
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,230
will greatly decrease.

793
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,070
There's no room for survival in the future.

794
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,230
Our popcorn is targeted as

795
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,990
entertainment and leisure food.

796
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,990
What we sell is a lifestyle,

797
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,550
an entertainment concept.

798
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,230
In offline experience store,

799
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,990
we'll sell another high-end product line

800
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,550
it can not only increase the profit,

801
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,030
but also create chances

802
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,150
to work with other industries.

803
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,750
so that Meton popcorn

804
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,910
could appear in a new image

805
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,790
for more brand display.

806
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,510
Is the product design ready?

807
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,230
The cinema can

808
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,710
lower the ticket price to attract customers

809
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,740
and increase popcorn sales

810
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,240
to increase its profit.

811
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,070
We can also create a brand-new experience model

812
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,230
in the offline experience store.

813
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,000
It sounds

814
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,750
very risky.

815
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,070
I told you.

816
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,310
My mouth is worn out.

817
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,000
but he didn't listen.

818
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,470
But this adventure

819
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,550
makes me very excited.

820
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,790
Our new product

821
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,670
is very popular online.

822
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,790
I believe no one

823
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,990
is doubting Mr. Zhong Jr.'s ability anymore.

824
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,390
Go on with the meeting. I'll wait for you in the office.

825
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,510
This...

826
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,260
Mr. Zhong Sr.,

827
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,030
You have no idea.

828
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,540
My phone is about to explode.

829
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,710
I came back this time

830
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,550
just to help you with these problems.

831
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,990
After that,

832
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,510
I'll go back soon.

833
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,550
So, you came back

834
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,710
to support me?

835
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,750
Or what?

836
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,710
Didn't you hear what I said?

837
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,310
Ming,

838
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,870
your performance now

839
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,990
comes as a surprise to me.

840
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,720
But to be honest,

841
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,550
I feel sorry.

842
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,310
You feel sorry for me?

843
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,240
Actually,

844
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,710
I was jealous of you.

845
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,440
And I don't have the guts to admit it.

846
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,790
You're jealous of me? Stop joking.

847
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,230
I should be jealous of you.

848
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,950
No matter what you do,

849
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,630
you can learn it fast.

850
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,710
But

851
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,510
I'd spend more time

852
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,790
to get to the intermediate level.

853
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,190
In parents' eyes,

854
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,230
I always do better than you.

855
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,880
That's because I've put so many efforts

856
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,230
behind the scenes.

857
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,030
They don't know that.

858
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,070
You don't know that, either.

859
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,870
Only I know.

860
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,230
You weren't involved in the company's business before,

861
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,230
but I never underestimated

862
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,550
your thoughts and opinions.

863
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,150
I didn't acknowledge your strategy in the company,

864
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,430
it's because of my pride.

865
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,310
I'm afraid if you do well,

866
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,030
it'll make me look so incompetent these two years.

867
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,550
I researched every decision you made

868
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,630
after you take over the company

869
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,920
as well as every plan you made,

870
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,910
every result you earned.

871
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,990
Objectively,

872
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,950
I think you did a great job.

873
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,430
You need a fair evaluation.

874
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,030
If I had handed Meton to you earlier,

875
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,150
it might already be

876
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,630
the leader of the group.

877
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,469
Brother,

878
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,750
I think

879
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,070
I know you for another time today.

880
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,870
There are a lot of things you should say earlier.

881
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,909
You'll regret if you keep it to yourself.

882
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,270
When your sister-in-law recovers,

883
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,469
and we come back to the country,

884
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,150
I won't interfere

885
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,909
with Meton's decisions.

886
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,310
I'll work for the new company of the group.

887
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,350
Let's compete then

888
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,389
who's better.

889
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:45,150
So as the legendary saying goes, be brothers at home

890
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,590
and rivals

891
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,350
in the real world.

892
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,590
Come in.

893
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,150
Mr. Zhong Sr. has made it clear to me.

894
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,990
I think it's time for me to make a decision.

895
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:11,990
OK.

896
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,630
I respect your decision.

897
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,510
As the saying goes, different people cannot work together.

898
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,480
Since we can't help each other,

899
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,510
let's call it a day.

900
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,790
I wish you a smooth career in the future, Mr. Zhong Jr.

901
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,630
Thank you.

902
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,430
What's wrong with Sun Youli?

903
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,070
He looks like another person.

904
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,350
He resigned.

905
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,350
Resigned?

906
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,670
He won't give up easily.

907
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,750
Is there something wrong?

908
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,910
Keep an eye on his follow-up movements.

909
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,670
If he dares to leak the confidentiality

910
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,350
to our competitor company,

911
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,990
resort to legal channels to reserve our rights at once.

912
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,550
Okay.

913
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,350
Since young,

914
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,630
I've never open up my heart to my brother

915
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,470
and I've never heard his recognition of me.

916
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,360
What?

917
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,470
Is my recognition less important than your brother's?

918
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,180
Of course, yours is important.

919
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,470
By the way,

920
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,470
let me ask you.

921
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,830
How am I better than Zhang Feiyang?

922
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,630
Why did you mention him?

923
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,950
Didn't he confess to you?

924
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,430
Tell me.

925
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,150
What did he say?

926
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,110
You're so annoying.

927
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,550
You're even concerning about my rumors.

928
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,030
If you don't tell me,

929
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,150
I'll be jealous.

930
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,150
You are always jealous.

931
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,350
Why didn't you tell me such an important thing?

932
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,870
Did he confess in before or after me?

933
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,830
If you say it again,

934
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,110
I'll post your photo on Moments.

935
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,670
Sure, go ahead.

936
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,470
I want the whole world to know

937
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,670
you took this photo for me.

938
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,390
And you stuffed the bread for me.

939
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,630
