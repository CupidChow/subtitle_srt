The first one is the taste is too ordinary...

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,860
Lin Yue and Zhen Gaogui are in a relationship.

Do you know that?

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,910
But you are her boyfriend.

Did she accept your love and agree to be your girlfriend?

How did you express your love?

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,670

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,400
I think the Dooro Bear is very popular online.

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,960
Many bloggers use it as a video-making material.

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,700
If we can get its long-term authorization,

22
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,490
our sales will definitely increase in the future.

do you have any peripheral products of Dooro Bear at home?

25
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,820
No.

No?

It's from one of our media executives.

No, I've been here for two and a half years.

Why haven't I seen you before?

I'm just an assistant product researcher,

117
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,650

When I'm in a relationship, I will have a better mood.

158
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,780
how should I help him?

159
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,570
Make sure

160
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,920
if she really has a boyfriend.

161
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,670

No, no, no.

165
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,620

166
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,230

It's not good for you to wait for me like this.

179
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,260
Your notebook.

180
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,300
You left it in my car yesterday.

181
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,060

183
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,990
It's okay that you were not waiting for me.

184
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,900

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,180
I don't want to continue this kind of

193
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,380
meaningless conversation anymore.

194
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,700
I have to go to the company to modify your slides.

195
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,940
If you keep asking,

196
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,940
you'll keep me from my work.

197
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,200
[Zhong Yiming, CEO of Meton Food Co., LTD]

198
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,470
Gaogui,

199
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,730
there's just a scandal related to you and Mr. Zhong,

200
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,060
do you really love him?

201
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,420
But what about Lin Yue,

202
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,690
you nominal secret lover?

203
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,420
Take a look.

204
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,910
Gaogui,

205
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,820
I think it's unbelievable

206
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,900
if you're dating Mr. Zhong.

207
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,300
And I feel strange

208
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,440
if you say you're dating Mr. Lin.

209
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,290
Well...

210
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,430
Why do you feel it strange?

211
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:42,720
Look,

212
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,820
if you have such a great boyfriend,

213
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,300
why are you still working here?

214
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,180
Yes.

215
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,460
Are you here to spy on us?

216
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,240
Come on!

217
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,290
Besides,

218
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,440
what does my boyfriend's work have to do with me?

219
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,190
Can he make slides for me?

220
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,210
See,

221
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,180
I didn't save the slides and they were gone.

222
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,820
We're going to meet him again.

223
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,090
We will meet him more often.

224
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,250
We may have a lot of cooperation

225
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,690
with him on our popcorn of new flavors.

226
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,650
Will you be unhappy if you lose to him?

227
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,060
What do you mean?

228
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,510
Have we ever fought?

229
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,990
He just appeared a few years earlier.

230
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,460
It seems that you and Zhen Gaogui...

231
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,330
What's wrong with us?

232
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,750
We are

233
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,360
just cooperative partners.

234
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,540
Just cooperative partners?

235
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,300
When I saw you two last time,

236
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,020
I didn't think you are just cooperative partners.

237
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,520
Circumstance changed.

238
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,940
Come here, Ke'er.

239
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,760
Mr. Zhong Jr. didn't discuss with anyone

240
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,840
the promotion of new flavors.

241
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,040
Why didn't you stop him?

242
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,280
Why should I stop him from making money?

243
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,020
Has he mentally controlled

244
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,100
your CPU?

245
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
He is young and mischievous.

246
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,920
Are you also messing around with him?

247
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,620
Promoting new flavors

248
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
means that in the early stage,

249
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,780
we have to input a lot of money on R&D.

250
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,060
It's not easy for the company

251
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,300
to maintain its operation.

252
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,760
If we fail,

253
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,110
the company will be over.

254
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,990
You and I know the current situation.

255
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,420
Even if we stick to the rules,

256
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,740
it can only slow down the company's bankruptcy.

257
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,960
I think we should give it a go.

258
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,630
I'm always optimistic.

259
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,950
But Mr. Sun,

260
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,310
you always target Mr. Zhong but not the business.

261
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,420
Do you really put the company's interests

262
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,430
first?

263
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,660
Look at you,

264
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,030
am I that kind of person?

265
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,600
You...

266
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,980
Mr. Zhong.

267
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,260
your absence

268
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,560
caused the mess of the company.

269
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,720
Calm down. Take your time.

270
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,020
Did he have a conflict

271
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,090
with Xinda PR again?

272
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,180
No.

273
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,570
But I heard

274
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,150
that young lady has climbed up another branch.

275
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,030
The point is

276
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,410
young Mr. Zhong Jr.

277
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,540
told the R&D Department

278
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,770
to promote new flavors.

279
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,470
How can we promote new flavors in such a short time?

280
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,050
I heard that today, there is a bad luck.

281
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,000
Did it affect you two?

282
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,520
I don't know if it's a bad luck.

283
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,940
But I was influenced by a man.

284
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,320
What kind of person

285
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,920
could affect Mr. Zhong?

286
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,760
When did Mr. Lin have a girlfriend?

287
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,500
Why didn't you make it public?

288
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,780
Is there a reason?

289
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,670
Girlfriend?

290
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,360
Who are you talking about?

291
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,840
Do you have several girlfriends?

292
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,650
[Brother]

293
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,300
Hello? What's the matter?

294
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,810
Ming,

295
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,900
do you plan to promote

296
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,160
popcorn of new flavors?

297
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,750
It's a big deal.

298
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,410
Why didn't you discuss it

299
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,300
with others?

300
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,510
Mr. Lin, you really have several?

301
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,030
What?

302
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,410
Girlfriends.

303
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,780
Would you be jealous

304
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,220
if I have several girlfriends?

305
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,410
No.

306
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,580
I just think

307
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,020
we may have a lot of meetings later.

308
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,930
I'm afraid that will delay your date.

309
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,140
You're jealous.

310
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,540
I'm not here to talk about this.

311
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,410
Mr. Zhong

312
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,260
is planning to develop

313
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,020
popcorn of new flavors that are suitable for young people.

314
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,740
I hope we can cooperate with

315
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,490
with your animation IP.

316
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,050
So we may have to

317
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,660
discuss a few times later.

318
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,680
Ming,

319
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,110
I understand that

320
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,820
at your age,

321
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,290
it's inevitable for you to like a pretty girl

322
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,050
when you meet her.

323
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,590
I'm talking about work now.

324
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,790
Let's put it aside.

325
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,920
I'll send you the plan when it's done.

326
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,440
How is it going?

327
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,400
What progress?

328
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,200
Of course, our work.

329
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,650
I know it's about work.

330
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,040
Wait.

331
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,810
Why are you two so weird today?

332
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,610
Did someone expose me?

333
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,940
I didn't see something

334
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,180
on the news.

335
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,780
It looks like we won't have

336
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,190
any substantial results today.

337
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,200
How about this?

338
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,250
Mr. Zhong,

339
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,260
later,

340
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,620
I'll discuss with Mr. Lin alone a few more times later.

341
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,670
I'll report the details to you.

342
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,800
Okay.

343
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,420
Director, what took you so long?

344
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,180
You're going to be late.

345
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,720
The driver took the wrong way.

346
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,620
Wait.

347
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,070
Sorry.

348
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,000
We're 5 minutes and 28 seconds late.

349
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,290
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

350
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,410
Let me correct it.

351
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,980
5 minutes and 32 seconds.

352
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,860
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

353
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,400
Director, I'll get back to work.

354
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,350
Go ahead.

355
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,180
After the shooting,

356
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,700
we should check the agenda together.

357
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,370
Because you're late,

358
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,850
the time we have is less than half an hour.

359
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,530
Speed up.

360
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,060
In this way,

361
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,050
we can finish it in half an hour.

362
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,350
But I can't speak faster.

363
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,119
My speech

364
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,380
is

365
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,819
even

366
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:10,650
slower.

367
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,560
What do you want?

368
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,810
I'll compensate you for your time.

369
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,380
Haven't you heard of that saying?

370
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,940
Time is precious,

371
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,619
it's impossible to buy time.

372
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,660
Time is very expensive.

373
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,010
I can't compensate you with time.

374
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,250
But I can compensate you with someone. Is it okay?

375
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,130
Deal.

376
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,240
This way.

377
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,640
Sit down.

378
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,770
I'll arrange a job for you.

379
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,830
Just sit here

380
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,600
and watch the sofa.

381
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,050
Don't let anyone steal it.

382
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,180
Who would steal this sofa?

383
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,240
Who knows?

384
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,920
Some people may look like they don't care about it,

385
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,510
but they actually care about it a lot.

386
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,780
Who?

387
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,260
Did I mention you?

388
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,500
Is this sofa useful,

389
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,180
beautiful,

390
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,110
or expensive?

391
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,110
Why do I feel

392
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,940
the air smells sour?

393
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,460
I find you are suitable to be a cook.

394
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,060
You like to add some "flavors" to things.

395
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,040
You know what?

396
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,390
I used to cook a lot when I was abroad.

397
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,590
The food I cooked was quite delicious.

398
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,650
Mr. Lin, the scene is ready.

399
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,770
I'm going to work.

400
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,980
Wait for me here.

401
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,830
Director,

402
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,670
Mr. Lin bought these.

403
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,970
He asked

404
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,960
you to try this flavor.

405
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:02,880
This,

406
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,470
he asked you to drink it more.

407
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,770
I have one too.

408
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,200
Mr. Lin is so nice.

409
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,790
He is handsome

410
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,710
and takes care of others.

411
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,120
I really want to work with him every day.

412
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,140
Right, Director?

413
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,770
Why don't you go to their company?

414
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,100
Director, I'll get back to work.

415
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,180
Have you been sitting here motionless

416
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,790
and looking at the sofa?

417
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,500
Why don't you eat?

418
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,820
I can't accept a reward without contributions.

419
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,200
I don't like slacking off.

420
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,090
Let's talk about work.

421
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,360
You should eat something.

422
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,820
When I was abroad,

423
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,780
I didn't have meals regularly,

424
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,350
which almost destroyed my health.

425
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,980
Didn't your girlfriend take good care of you?

426
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,930
So sour.

427
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,180
Will you take care of me?

428
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,640
What does it have to do with me?

429
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,740
Nothing to do with it?

430
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,180
Gaogui,

431
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,440
what's going on between you and Mr. Zhong?

432
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,140
And what's going on

433
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,310
between you and Mr. Lin?

434
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,930
Did I really misjudge you?

435
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,980
As an outsider,

436
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,950
I think Mr. Lin is quite nice.

437
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,140
Have you lost your passion

438
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,700
after dating with him for a long time?

439
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,450
That's why

440
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,510
you had a spark with Mr. Zhong?

441
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,310
What spark?

442
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,940
I've been so worried

443
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,020
that my eyebrows are burning.

444
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,150
Mr. Sun took care of me

445
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,250
and let me be the director of the Product Department.

446
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:48,640
Don't worry.

447
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,900
I'll take care of it.

448
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,100
Besides,

449
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,420
can I let a newbie ride on my head?

450
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,280
Yes.

451
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,900
We've worked hard for so long.

452
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,860
How can we be replaced easily?

453
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,730
What a joke.

454
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,830
I always feel something is wrong

455
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,130
on the relationship of Zhen Gaogui and Mr. Lin.

456
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,600
Is the rumor true?

457
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,910
We'll know it later anyway.

458
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,770
I don't want to wait anymore.

459
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,590
Aren't we going to hold a media appreciation banquet

460
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,010
for Meton in a few days?

461
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,210
I heard from the Media Department that

462
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,420
Lin Yue is on the alternative guest list.

463
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,450
What do you mean?

464
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,600
Invite Lin Yue.

465
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,400
Ju Ran,

466
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,070
I don't think it's a good idea.

467
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,450
OK.

468
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,950
Meton Food's media appreciation banquet

469
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,370
in Shengyi Hotel

470
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,650
is ready.

471
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,970
My colleagues in charge of offline activities

472
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,190
will update the progress at any time.

473
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,050
As for the information about the popcorn of new flavors,

474
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,980
Mr. Zhong, do you have something to say?

475
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,520
I have a lot of things to say.

476
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,180
I'm afraid that after work,

477
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,730
you do not have enough work,

478
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,620
then you will meet someone.

479
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,840
Someone?

480
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,830
You mean Yue, right?

481
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,500
Don't worry.

482
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,380
If I'm that free,

483
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,040
who worked overtime for you every day?

484
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,370
Not now.

485
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,660
But you never know.

486
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,080
People's mind changes fast.

487
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,590
Mr. Zhong, you'd better say it to yourself.

488
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,180
Take this back and discuss

489
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,570
the corresponding relationship between the flavors and the anime characters.

490
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,700
Let's see if they can match.

491
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,580
Mr. Zhong,

492
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,460
do you think

493
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,720
there could be gossips related to you and me

494
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,040
if I don't have a boyfriend?

495
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,130
Of course.

496
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,220
Why not?

497
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,610
How?

498
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,830
You're Party A's CEO.

499
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,980
I'm just an employee of Party B.

500
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,220
It's like I'm taking a shortcut.

501
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,690
Are you kidding?

502
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,210
Do you really think I have a shortcut?

503
00:22:59,210 --> 00:22:59,860
Have you ever had a shortcut?

504
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,540
It doesn't matter if I had one or not.

505
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,770
What matters is

506
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,480
others think I've taken a shortcut.

507
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,420
Didn't Yue

508
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,050
open the back door for you?

509
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,420
Why do you call Yue more intimately

510
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,700
than I do?

511
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,720
We just cooperated for a few days.

512
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,460
It seems that you and Yue will

513
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,930
have a bright future.

514
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,420
Enough.

515
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,080
As for popcorn of new flavors,

516
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,410
does the Product R&D Department

517
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,940
have any new materials?

518
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,290
Let's go. I'll show you.

519
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,900
Xiaotian,

520
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,180
I know

521
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,980
you're an ambitious young man.

522
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,670
Director Shen,

523
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,350
goodbye.

524
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,400
If you go somewhere else,

525
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,040
you will get a higher position.

526
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,570
I'm waiting for your help.

527
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,470
Mr. Zhong.

528
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,680
What's going on?

529
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,260
Here's the thing,

530
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,090
Xiaotian resigned.

531
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,300
He has noble ambition.

532
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,940
He thinks that going to another company

533
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,860
will bring him better development.

534
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,280
Everyone has his own goals.

535
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,450
We can't stop him.

536
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,330
Right, Xiaotian?

537
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,100
Mr. Zhong,

538
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,910
thank you for appreciating me.

539
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,620
I will always remember your help.

540
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,130
Goodbye.

541
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:30,980
Wait.

542
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,140
Xiaotian, why are you leaving?

543
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,150
I'm sorry.

544
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,530
What a pity.

545
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,390
He's a talent.

546
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,230
I'm speechless.

547
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,370
Such a fool is taking the company's important position.

548
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,010
How can the company get better?

549
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,840
What kind of idiot?

550
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,000
Director Shen of Product R&D Department.

551
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,230
He is afraid that newcomers will cut a smart figure.

552
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,740
I've heard that he fired many people

553
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,700
in the past years with ridiculous reasons.

554
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,500
As long as someone has achievements,

555
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,750
he'll fire him.

556
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,190
I didn't expect Mr. Zhong to care about your employees.

557
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,620
I heard what they said and

558
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,320
I thought you were...

559
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,120
What?

560
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,210
A loser.

561
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,910
You think I haven't heard of it?

562
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,000
Actually, when I first came to the company,

563
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,890
just like you,

564
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,790
everyone thought I know nothing

565
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,510
and couldn't do anything well.

566
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,010
Director Zhang even

567
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,210
didn't want to give me an offer.

568
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,140
Yes.

569
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,760
That's why I'm giving you this chance.

570
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,500
You did a good job.

571
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,880
Actually, I'm grateful to you.

572
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,950
You made me feel that I'm outstanding.

573
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,980
Although I feel like my life is in a mud,

574
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,270
I think

575
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,400
I get to know how to climb up.

576
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,980
Well,

577
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,780
is it so hard?

578
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,220
Lin Yue,

579
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,520
no, Yue,

580
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,870
didn't think of helping you?

581
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,310
Or you two

582
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,170
do not have any relations at all!

583
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,970
Do you

584
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,310
hope it's fake?

585
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,550
I hope it's true,

586
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,350
at least he can sign the authorization contract more easily.

587
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,420
Here.

588
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,580
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

589
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,120
Mr. Zhong.

590
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,660
Come in.

591
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,280
Xiaotian,

592
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,370
why are you back?

593
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,860
Say goodbye to Mr. Zhong?

594
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,750
Mr. Zhong asked me to come back.

595
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,920
You're just in time.

596
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,450
I have an announcement.

597
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,900
From today on,

598
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,170
I officially appoint Xu Xiaotian

599
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,670
as the director of the Online Product R&D Department.

600
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,600
He is in the same position as Director Shen.

601
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,020
From now on,

602
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,320
he is Director Xu.

603
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,390
He's mainly responsible for the online product development.

604
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,210
Mr. Zhong,

605
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,570
do you mean

606
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,040
the Product R&D Department

607
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,940
will be divided into two parallel parts?

608
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,710
Yes.

609
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,170
As for manpower of the new department,

610
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,940
I will choose some people in the current Product R&D Department.

611
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,580
In the future, Director Shen,

612
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,640
you have to work harder

613
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,940
and do more work.

614
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,230
Xu Xiaotian,

615
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,590
didn't you agree to resign?

616
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,300
Director Shen,

617
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,740
here's the thing,

618
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,420
the troubles you said I would have

619
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,940
if I don't quit

620
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,200
were already

621
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,950
solved by Mr. Zhong.

622
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,620
And he promised they would never happen.

623
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,200
So I decided to stay

624
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,690
to contribute my power to Meton Food.

625
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,860
Mr. Zhong, I think...

626
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,470
Enough.

627
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,070
I'm just informing you.

628
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,450
As for the details.

629
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,490
they will be discussed at the company meeting next time.

630
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,290
[Shengyi International Hotel]

631
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,040
[Appreciation banquet]

632
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,700
Why is Lin Yue

633
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,050
in this guest list?

634
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,290
And his name is handwritten?

635
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,800
I didn't know he would come.

636
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,550
One of my clients couldn't come.

637
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,620
Ju Ran advised me

638
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,900
to invite Lin Yue, who is on the alternate list, instead.

639
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,070
Then, his name was added.

640
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
He didn't refuse us?

641
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,690
No.

642
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,290
What's wrong?

643
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,610
Ju Ran.

644
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,590
If everyone hadn't asked you

645
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,100
about the relationship between you and Mr. Lin,

646
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,700
would you keep it a secret?

647
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,490
Yes.

648
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,080
I think there's nothing to say.

649
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,250
Everyone is busy with work.

650
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,590
No way.

651
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,570
Ju Ran,

652
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,880
I think no matter what,

653
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,790
we should let Gaogui and Mr. Lin make their relationship public.

654
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,500
Otherwise, we're afraid that you'll meet a scumbag.

655
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,930
No need. Indeed.

656
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,120
Believe me.

657
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,950
I've seen many gossips like this.

658
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,660
If you don't make it public,

659
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,500
it's very likely that

660
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,100
he will flirt with other girls.

661
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,360
It's bad for both of you.

662
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,660
And I think

663
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,970
this is something to be blessed with.

664
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,250
There's no need to hide, right?

665
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,220
That's right.

666
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,400
Otherwise, we might not be convinced

667
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,010
of your relationship.

668
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,420
What if Zhen Gaogui made up the stories?

669
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,360
This...

670
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,680
How is that possible?

671
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,810
I'm just shy.

672
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,140
Ju Ran,

673
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,090
you mean...

674
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,190
Let me give you an example,

675
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,330
can I make an official announcement?

676
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,900
How long did you stay up

677
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,290
to have such a dream?

678
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,090
You're always dreaming like Zhen Gaogui.

679
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,630
Forget it.

680
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,400
Do you think you're a prince on the run?

681
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,870
Have you seen Mr. Zhong?

682
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,460
No.

683
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,210
No.

684
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,910
I've been looking for him for a long time.

685
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,170
Is he going to be late again?

686
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,740
Director Lu,

687
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,730
I've checked the list of guests.

688
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,360
I have to go out now.

689
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,210
I'll be right back.

690
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,110
The appreciation banquet is about to begin.

691
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,170
Hello, Senior Lin.

692
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,830
I'm Zhen Gaogui.

693
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,090
I'm in Paris.

694
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,260
Welcome, Junior.

695
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,310
Don't just stand there. Come in.

696
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,090
Hello, Senior.

697
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,220
Let me introduce new roommates to you.

698
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,240
Leticia, Bastian.

699
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,690
Nice to meet you.

700
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,300
Your Chinese cuisine smells so good.

701
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,450
I'm a good cook.

702
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,590
Thank you. I'm hungry.

703
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,060
You scared me.

704
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:29,180
Happy birthday to you.

705
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,130
Thank you.

706
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,360
Blow out the candles.

707
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,020
Senior,

708
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,880
you're back so soon.

709
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,960
I don't know if I can see you again.

710
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,480
I have a chance to start my own business in China.

711
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,830
Call me when you come back, okay?

712
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:47,970
Good luck.

713
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,730
That's what happened.

714
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,030
That's the thing.

715
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,880
When you go upstairs,

716
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,180
if my colleagues ask you

717
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,450
something that should be asked,

718
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,930
you know how to answer, right?

719
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,840
Help me make up the lie.

720
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,330
I was wondering why Zhong Yiming

721
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,480
was like a Gatling gun,

722
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,640
which would shoot me when we met.

723
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,280
I see.

724
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,660
You used me as your shield.

725
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,100
Did you ask for my permission?

726
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,230
I had no choice.

727
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,850
My life was so hard

728
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,120
but I didn't ask you for help.

729
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,020
Could you please help me this time?

730
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,870
Okay, okay.

731
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,790
How can I not help you?

732
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,170
But it will affect our cooperation

733
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,390
if Zhong Yiming is jealous.

734
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,010
Who cares?

735
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,970
Protecting my job is more important.

736
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,960
You are not the one who will send me an offer.

737
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,030
I've provided a job for you,

738
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,440
but you didn't choose to come to my company.

739
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,610
I did so for our friendship.

740
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,700
How can we be friends if I work for you?

741
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,380
All right, I'm going upstairs,

742
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,340
you go up later.

743
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,760
Okay.

744
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,110
Your Yue

745
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,120
is invited as a special guest, are you happy?

746
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,540
Of course.

747
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,110
Why do you look happier than me?

748
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,100
This is our company's activity,

749
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,210
of course I'm happy.

750
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,990
And you guys are doing well,

751
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:57,960
so I'm happy.

752
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,740
We didn't see you so happy

753
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,350
after some activities were successfully held.

754
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,980
Not only that.

755
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,030
I thought you would be jealous.

756
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,219
Jealous?

757
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,659
Am I that kind of person

758
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,980
who will be jealous?

759
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,210
Mr. Zhong, you're here.

760
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,139
If you're late again,

761
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,340
I  don't know how to explain it to others.

762
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,900
It's an important event today,

763
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,370
how can I be late?

764
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,420
If I'm late,

765
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
I would miss

766
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,860
a wonderful show.

767
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,170
What?

768
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,699
I'd like to see the wonderful show.

769
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,480
Mr. Zhong, you speak first,

770
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,929
and then the guests.

771
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,090
Director Lu, come with me.

772
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,380
Look at them,

773
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,570
they look like an old couple.

774
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,170
They can understand each other with just one glance.

775
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,390
Mr. Lin,

776
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,290
we have makeup artists here.

777
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,570
Do you want some makeup?

778
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,000
Okay.

779
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,750
Do you want to go with me?

780
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,930
I'll go with you to apply some shading powder.
