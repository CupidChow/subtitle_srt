00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,640
Mr. Zhong is busy. He can't stay.

192
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm free.

193
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,500
Hurry up.

194
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:38,870
I'll heat up the dumplings for you.

195
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,510
Okay.

196
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,350
You like eating at my place that much?

197
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,040
I don't like eating.

198
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,920
I just missed Auntie!

199
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,180
Fenfang.

200
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,710
Is this your son-in-law?

201
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,630
Why haven't I heard you say that before?

202
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,350
What do you do?

203
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,020
When are you getting married?

204
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,710
No, Aunt Li, he's not my boyfriend.

205
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,350
He's just a partner working...

206
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,110
Auntie, I'm a snack salesman.

207
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,940
When we get married,

208
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,170
it's up to Gaogui.

209
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,830
What?

210
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,500
No, I'm just kidding.

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,110
He's kidding.

212
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,230
Don't take it seriously.

213
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,780
Did you two have a fight?

214
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,580
I've been there before.

215
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,200
Young people will have quarrels,

216
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,760
but they make up in the end.

217
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,100
Let's eat.

218
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,850
Fenfang, it's a little cold in this room.

219
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,730
If you're cold, you...

220
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,600
Come to the kitchen and help me with something.

221
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,350
Okay.

222
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,200
Help me clean it up.

223
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,520
Is the air conditioner broken?

224
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,830
Let me fix it for you.

225
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,350
No, no.

226
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,360
We just didn't turn it on.

227
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,370
You must be full.

228
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,150
Since you're full, go back home early.

229
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,110
Are you looking for me?

230
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,140
Are you going to side with them?

231
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,980
What do you mean by that?

232
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,590
When did the company become a battlefield?

233
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,630
Do you see nothing but division

234
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,930
and no corporate interest?

235
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,650
What division?

236
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,580
In my heart, there is only one sect,

237
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,130
and that's Mr. Zhong.

238
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,900
Mr. Zhong made me who I am today.

239
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,830
I just can't stand watching them

240
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,870
ruin

241
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,510
Mr. Zhong's hard work.

242
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,630
Don't use your loyalty as an excuse

243
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,680
to justify your wrongdoing.

244
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,510
I hope you know what you're doing.

245
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,510
Fine.

246
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,630
I knew it.

247
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,950
You were brainwashed by them.

248
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,680
Hello, boss.

249
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,360
Did Mr. Zhong Jr. tell you about

250
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,870
the new flavored popcorn

251
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,350
and our cooperation with the Dooro Bear?

252
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,150
Yes.

253
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,110
What do you think about that?

254
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,800
I think since our company's sales

255
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,570
have been declining year after year

256
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,310
and there aren't many improvements

257
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,990
through traditional channels,

258
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,840
why don't we follow the trend

259
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,080
and launch some new flavors?

260
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,540
Maybe there's a chance.

261
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,350
Judging from the current market feedback,

262
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,430
the new flavor is good.

263
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,520
The number you have dialed is not available.

264
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,110
Please try again...

265
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,060
Yingxiong.

266
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,740
This may be a bit abrupt,

267
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,230
but I didn't manage to reach any of them.

268
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,860
Do you have any resources to help me out this time?

269
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,300
Gaogui.

270
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,790
There's nothing I can do.

271
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,870
Think about it.

272
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,430
When did I have more resources than Ju Ran?

273
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,400
Even if I have,

274
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,910
I've already given it to her, right?

275
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,830
I can help you with anything else.

276
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,710
Just this one...

277
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,750
OK.

278
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,110
I'll think of other ways.

279
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,590
You...

280
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,800
Ju Ran!

281
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,270
You're so considerate. You bought us fruit!

282
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,440
You only have your Ju Ran in your heart.

283
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,870
I bought them.

284
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,580
Thank you, Lele.

285
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
What were you two talking about

286
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,430
Gaogui, she...

287
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,830
Do you need help?

288
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,830
I have plenty of resources at my disposal.

289
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,470
You can come to me if you need help.

290
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,990
We are colleagues. We should help each other.

291
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,550
Although we are competitors,

292
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,480
I can't bully you because of my seniority.

293
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,060
No need.

294
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,560
I can do it myself.

295
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,470
Alright.

296
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,860
Gaogui.

297
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,110
Check this out.

298
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,110
What's going on?

299
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,050
What?

300
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,590
I think

301
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,540
you can ask for help from your ex-boyfriend.

302
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,250
My ex-boyfriend?

303
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,950
What ex-boyfriend?

304
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,310
Mr. Lin.

305
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,630
Right.

306
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,110
You forgot about him so soon?

307
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,960
You can come to him secretly.

308
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,070
We won't find out about it.

309
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,770
I can't do that.

310
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,210
I have to do it myself.

311
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,890
So stubborn.

312
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,500
Why are you so preoccupied every time you come here?

313
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,830
And you won't tell me what happened to you.

314
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,770
Although I'm old,

315
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,710
I'm not stupid.

316
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,230
I'm so young.

317
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,230
What major things can happen to me?

318
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,310
Just some trivial matters.

319
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,380
No matter how trivial, if you can't get over it,

320
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,830
it'll be hard for you.

321
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,530
Forget it then.

322
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,710
Let's go out and play.

323
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,890
You want to go to the garden?

324
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,360
No.

325
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,030
Then play Mahjong?

326
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,040
What would you like to play?

327
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,370
I want the osmanthus cake from Old Shen's.

328
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,440
It's been more than ten years.

329
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,030
Okay, I'll order it for you.

330
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,190
Don't order it.

331
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,990
We have to go out

332
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,360
and eat at the restaurant.

333
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,760
Listen to the customers' chats in the restaurant

334
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,950
and browse through the menu.

335
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,950
Order a pot of tea

336
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,040
and savor it slowly.

337
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,110
Grandpa,

338
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,500
I suddenly remembered that the nurse said

339
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,270
you couldn't have too many desserts.

340
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,190
I'll go after taking the medicine.

341
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,930
I promise you.

342
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,980
I won't eat much. Just one bite.

343
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,520
No, no, three bites.

344
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,360
I won't eat much, okay?

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,840
Seriously...

346
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,010
I told them before,

347
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,940
but they refused to allow me to go out alone.

348
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,360
But, Grandpa, think about it.

349
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,890
We need to ask for leave from the director in order to go out.

350
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,710
Then we can only go out for an hour.

351
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,500
That place is so far away.

352
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,470
We might not make it back.

353
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,130
We are not at school.

354
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,090
We don't need to write a self-criticism if we're back late.

355
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,760
Let's go.

356
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,010
Come with me.

357
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,950
No, you have to walk slowly.

358
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,290
It's okay.

359
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,750
The weather is nice.

360
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,600
The weather is great.

361
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,240
It's warm.

362
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,070
Grandpa.

363
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,970
Are you sure it's here?

364
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,940
Yes.

365
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,230
This is the Old Shen's.

366
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,070
It has been around for twenty years.

367
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,790
It's gone, just like that.

368
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,400
It's probably been demolished.

369
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,350
We can't have it.

370
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,160
If I had known earlier,

371
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,520
I would have bought more osmanthus cakes

372
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,690
when I was here last time.

373
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,630
It's okay.

374
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,030
Maybe they just moved somewhere else.

375
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,780
I'll ask around for you.

376
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,110
OK.

377
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,590
Wait for me here.

378
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:40,990
OK.

379
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,470
Excuse me.

380
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,510
Do you know where the Old Shen's restaurant

381
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,510
relocated to?

382
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,590
I'm sorry.

383
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm new here. I don't know.

384
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,680
If you'd like to have some desserts,

385
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,830
please line up at the back.

386
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,010
Thank you.

387
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,750
You're welcome.

388
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,510
No. 37, No. 38, please come in.

389
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,600
This is too long.

390
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,350
Grandpa,

391
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,690
let's go to another place.

392
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,510
The one we just passed

393
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,470
looks nice.

394
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,869
Do you want to try it?

395
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,710
Can that place be good?

396
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,339
Let's give it a try.

397
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,170
Let's go to another place if that shop is not good.

398
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,270
OK, I'll listen to you.

399
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,940
Thank you.

400
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,510
This looks much better than osmanthus cakes.

401
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,160
Here.

402
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,000
We didn't come here in vain.

403
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,710
Try it.

404
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,119
Okay.

405
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,420
Sweet and bitter.

406
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,880
What is this?

407
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,950
Grandpa.

408
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,390
This is called matcha.

409
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,310
They are extracted from green tea.

410
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,030
The one you usually drink.

411
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,090
Try this.

412
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,710
I've never seen

413
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,310
these new things.

414
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,860
If I had tried them earlier,

415
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,470
I wouldn't still be thinking about osmanthus cakes.

416
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:56,990
Grandpa.

417
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,630
Grandparents of your age

418
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,900
don't eat these.

419
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,070
They think it's for young people.

420
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,700
There's a difference between young people and old people when it comes to food?

421
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,350
Look, it doesn't say that old people can't come in.

422
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,100
I have to try it when I come here.

423
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,840
Otherwise, I'd have thought

424
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,440
that osmanthus cakes were the best in the world.

425
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,720
We agreed that you would only have three bites.

426
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,630
You can't have more.

427
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,470
What if you don't feel well after more bites

428
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,430
and need to go to the hospital again?

429
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,400
It hurts to get a shot.

430
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,380
I won't eat then.

431
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,120
I'm not going to the hospital.

432
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,850
Grandpa, I want to go check it out.

433
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,240
Go.

434
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,950
The line is still that long.

435
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:43,770
Yeah.

436
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,780
Li Bupang, came and recommended it.

437
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,830
[Internet-famous blogger: Li Bupang, came and recommended it]

438
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,230
It seems

439
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,860
that a very popular blogger came here,

440
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,750
and that's why so many people come here to eat.

441
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,700
I know.

442
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,910
Isn't it the internet-famous shop you mentioned?

443
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,360
Grandpa, why are you so trendy?

444
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,230
Are you busy?

445
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,670
Am I not disturbing you, right?

446
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,320
I'm busy,

447
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,840
and you may have disturbed me.

448
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,550
No, I called to ask about the progress.

449
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,030
Mr. Zhong.

450
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,920
Did you ask that as a client?

451
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,670
No.

452
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,660
Mr. Zhong.

453
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,590
I've been really busy lately.

454
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,470
Zhen Gaogui.

455
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,510
Did I do something wrong?

456
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,390
No.

457
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,230
Then why don't you want to see me so much?

458
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,790
Can I only be your client?

459
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,480
What else do you want?

460
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,490
Mr. Zhong, I'll get back to work.

461
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,150
I'll contact you when there's any progress.

462
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Well... Mr. Zhong,

463
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,990
you don't have to overthink.

464
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,070
Class is over.

465
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,870
That's it.

466
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,210
Bye.

467
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,710
Bye. Bye.

468
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,710
Bye.

469
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,300
Auntie.

470
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,550
Why are you here?

471
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,590
You need to

472
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,640
see my daughter?

473
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,860
You had a fight.

474
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,300
Not really.

475
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,280
She ignored you, right?

476
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,380
Then you come to me

477
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,570
to ask how she's doing,

478
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,120
right?

479
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,230
I also want you to help me...

480
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,960
I don't think it's a good idea.

481
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,340
I'm in the middle of both of you,

482
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,790
and I put in good words for you.

483
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,860
It's not suitable.

484
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,950
Auntie.

485
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,710
Fenfang.

486
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:12,730
Fine.

487
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,500
I'll go back and gather some information.

488
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,560
Okay.

489
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,660
What would you like to eat? On me.

490
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,260
Zhong came to me today.

491
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,550
He said you were cold to him again.

492
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,270
What happened? Tell me.

493
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,800
Mom, don't listen to him.

494
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,770
There's nothing between us.

495
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,960
He comes to you passionately every day,

496
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,900
but you have been giving him the cold shoulder.

497
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,830
Your sense of self-assurance and superiority

498
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,400
must have been inherited from me.

499
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:52,900
Mom,

500
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,480
we are just working partners.

501
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,820
It's not like what you said.

502
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,420
Besides, he is my client.

503
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,470
Well...

504
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,130
If I got too close to him,

505
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,710
what would my colleagues think of me?

506
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,490
Then I'll become one of those girls

507
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,950
who sell themselves out for a higher position.

508
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,860
No way.

509
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:11,930
I don't understand.

510
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,060
Delicious.

511
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,060
Look. Look at this one.

512
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,950
I think this is nice.

513
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,960
We have to Photoshop it.

514
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,510
Let me tell you.

515
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,150
I think it's hilarious.

516
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,980
Right.

517
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,730
Very funny.

518
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,310
Gaogui.

519
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,240
Although we just met,

520
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,150
I have a feeling

521
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,930
that we'll have a great time working together.

522
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,690
Right.

523
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,170
See.

524
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,530
I've invited Nana, the most popular food blogger

525
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,890
in our company, here.

526
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,670
-Nana. Hello.
-Hello.

527
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,460
I won't introduce just anyone to her.

528
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,130
Can I take a look

529
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,630
at Nana's profile?

530
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,060
I forgot.

531
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,020
Here.

532
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Thank you.

533
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,300
200,000 followers.

534
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,590
Of course.

535
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,050
But why is the number of her comments in the single digits?

536
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,070
Are our fans not very active?

537
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,860
Actually, my fans...

538
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,750
You don't understand.

539
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,650
It's not that Nana's followers are inactive.

540
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,980
Nana's fans are all foodies.

541
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,790
Foodies are busy eating.

542
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,120
Who would have time to interact with others?

543
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,720
Is that a thing?

544
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,590
Yeah, you don't understand.

545
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:46,800
Here.

546
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,430
Do we still have other big bloggers

547
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,830
like Nana?

548
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,280
What?

549
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,210
You still don't want Nana?

550
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,190
No.

551
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,320
Nana has a full schedule.

552
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,470
Many big brands are fighting for her.

553
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,330
Your Meton Popcorn is picky about us?

554
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,620
Go ask around.

555
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,190
Anyone out there with a fan base like Nana's

556
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,070
won't be cheaper than us.

557
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,100
I didn't mean that.

558
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,820
We need to consider the result of our promotion.

559
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,820
So...

560
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,250
How about this?

561
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,550
Our published price is

562
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,700
100,000 yuan.

563
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,350
We're

564
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,670
good sisters.

565
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,380
Best and final.

566
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,250
80,000 yuan.

567
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,470
8,000 yuan for one post.

568
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,510
Am I good enough for you?

569
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,990
Don't worry.

570
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,460
It's my call.

571
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,470
-That’s too little.
-We're good sisters.

572
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,030
Too little.

573
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,380
It's okay.

574
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,910
Hello?

575
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,910
Come over there right now?

576
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,740
That urgent?

577
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,890
Okay, I got it.

578
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm sorry.

579
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,590
It's too much of a rush.

580
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,230
She left?

581
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,510
We adjusted the ingredients and manufacturing methods.

582
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,640
I've almost sorted out the criteria.

583
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,950
I can send down the technical materials

584
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,450
once the files are approved by the authority.

585
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,190
Have a meeting with the marketing department

586
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,890
to discuss the follow-up progress.

587
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,390
PR firms should also promote new products

588
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,170
in conjunction with our product launches.

589
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,550
During this period,

590
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,950
you can also prepare the ingredients.

591
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:18,850
OK.

592
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,740
Is there any news

593
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,710
from Xinda PR?

594
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,710
No.

595
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,620
They are preparing for the detailed programs.

596
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,090
What else?

597
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,150
You mean Zhen Gaogui?

598
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,170
Sort of.

599
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,750
Isn't she close to Lin Yue?

600
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,210
I'll ask about her for you sometime.

601
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,470
No need.

602
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,610
If you can get to see him recently,

603
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,150
you can just ask him.

604
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,260
OK.

605
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,130
If someone from Meton

606
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,540
asks you about me,

607
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,100
just say that you know nothing.

608
00:25:59,170 --> 00:25:59,840
Thank you.

609
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,050
Don't worry, my ex-girlfriend.

610
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,060
Welcome.

611
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,470
Here you are.

612
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,470
I've already ordered the dishes.

613
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,320
The dishes will be ready in a minute.

614
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,390
Okay.

615
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,620
Wait for a moment.

616
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,820
I have to reply to some messages.

617
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,110
Tenosynovitis?

618
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:42,620
How do you feel?

619
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,440
I feel better than before.

620
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,000
It's my family's technique.

621
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,190
Really?

622
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,390
I couldn't sleep

623
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,370
and yelled all night because of the pain.

624
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,010
It can relieve the pain after massaging like this.

625
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,220
How did you recover?

626
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,380
Massage it like this.

627
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,840
Have you been in touch with Zhen Gaogui recently?

628
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,510
Of course not.

629
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,790
I don't think I've had as much contact with her as you guys have.

630
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,340
Didn't she tell you what she's been doing recently?

631
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,950
If you want to know what she's doing,

632
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,230
how about I invite her over

633
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,270
to have dinner with us?

634
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,450
Then you can talk to her alone.

635
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,870
No need.

636
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,750
Did Zhong Yiming ask you to ask about her?

637
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,750
No.

638
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,340
When you lie,

639
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,390
can you be more smooth?

640
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,510
I find

641
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,420
that when you lie,

642
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,880
your hands will become cold.

643
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,110
Wait a minute.

644
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,010
I'll be back soon.

645
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,290
Did they turn cold?

646
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,830
This is the plaster I used before.

647
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,360
Apply it three times a day.

648
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,910
Don't apply it for more than eight hours at a time.

649
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,580
Three courses, and you will be fine.

650
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,460
Thank...

651
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,880
You

652
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,930
are so nice to me.

653
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,880
Is there a hidden agenda?

654
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,190
Yes.

655
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,550
What?

656
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,030
I...

657
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,990
have signed up for the badminton game.

658
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,710
Mixed Doubles.

659
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,950
I need a partner,

660
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,850
so I want to invite you.

661
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,320
Your hand is not well,

662
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,420
and I'm afraid it will hinder us from winning.

663
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,190
Since when

664
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,920
have you been so interested in badminton?

665
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,420
I loved it when I found out

666
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,580
that you were a skilled badminton player.

667
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,700
I want to learn badminton from you.

668
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,190
I'll take it as a yes if you don't say anything.

669
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,860
You agree to form a team with me?

670
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,160
I don’t know when my hand will recover.

671
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,540
Let's talk about it after I've recovered.

672
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,390
Come on, babies.

673
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,030
These are all fresh.

674
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,220
Fresh fruits

675
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,910
and many snacks.

676
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,430
Let's keep our eyes on the yellow cart.

677
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,470
Altogether.

678
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,910
You scared me. What are you doing?

679
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,740
What are you watching?

680
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,790
Oh, no.

681
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,270
You patted me like this,

682
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,630
and you kept me from getting that coupon.

683
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,710
I didn't get the coupon.

684
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,390
What coupon?

685
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,350
20 yuan.

686
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,440
Look, this box of snacks...

687
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,750
We can get a 30% discount.

688
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,800
Mom, think about it this way.

689
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,310
Think about it.

690
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,950
You didn't get the coupon, so you won't buy it.

691
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,820
So you save 100%.

692
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,550
This blogger

693
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,820
was recommended by one of my yoga students.

694
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,080
She is Li Bupang.

695
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,210
She doesn't work for a company, so no company takes a cut.

696
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,070
The discounts are huge.

697
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,730
I heard that wherever she eats, it becomes hot.

698
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,640
She won't lie for money.

699
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,690
Really?

700
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,010
That amazing?

701
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,770
-Li Bupang.
-Let me see.

702
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,910
10 million fans!

703
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:20,990
Right?

704
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,150
Hello, who is this?

705
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,490
Hello.

706
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,800
I'm Zhen Gaogui from Xinda PR.

707
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,680
Are you Ms. Li Bupang's assistant?

708
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,210
I'm sorry.

709
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,370
We have no intention of working with any PR company.

710
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,800
Here's the thing.

711
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,870
If you have any other requirements,

712
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,010
we can negotiate.

713
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,360
Can I have a meeting

714
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,850
with Ms. Li Bupang?

715
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,290
Because she doesn't have a PR company,

716
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,110
she can gain the trust of her fans.

717
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,250
The live stream collaboration mentioned in your plan

718
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,010
won't work.

719
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,230
Yingxiong!

720
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,070
I need to go out for a while.

721
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,470
If the boss asks later,

722
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,150
tell him that I came to find a blogger named Li Bupang.

723
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,310
No problem.

724
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,860
Hello, could you please lift the pole for me?

725
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,890
What do you do?

726
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,030
I'm looking for a friend.

727
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,500
You need an appointment or a membership to enter our park.

728
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,620
Sir, please go back. Thank you.

729
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,560
Hello, are you a member?

730
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,030
Yes.

731
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,330
Then tell me your name and phone number.

732
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,120
My surname is Liu.

733
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,800
Ms. Liu, right?

734
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,790
Yes.

735
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,810
You're in our system. Please come in.

736
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,020
Hello.

737
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,370
I got separated from my friend.

738
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,770
Now they've gone in and camped.

739
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,610
Could you give me a ride?

740
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,100
Okay, get in.

741
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,790
Thank you.

742
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,320
You're welcome.

743
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,720
I've been here several times.

744
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,340
Isn't it nice?

745
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,190
Why did you prepare so many things?

746
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,260
Hello, everyone.

747
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,170
Hello.

748
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,710
Do you know

749
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,490
a blogger named Li BuPang?

750
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,440
She's also camping here.

751
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,020
Li Bupang?

752
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,170
I don't know.

753
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,210
I don't know.

754
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,880
These are all my friends from the car club.

755
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,790
She may be on the west side.

756
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,110
And you also need an appointment to come to the west side.

757
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,520
This is the east.

758
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,420
You'll reach there through these woods.

759
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,710
Thank you.

760
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,530
Am I lost?

761
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,550
Is anyone here?

762
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,510
Can someone tell me where this is?

763
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,110
Is there anyone here?

764
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,230
Is anyone here?

765
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,360
[Fenfang]

766
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,670
Hello, Aunt.

767
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,470
Zhong.

768
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,470
Are you with Gaogui?

769
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,250
No.

770
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,680
She didn't go home?

771
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,390
No.

772
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,850
I can't get through to her.

773
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,280
Look at the time.

774
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,940
If she got off work early,

775
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,430
she'd be back by now.

776
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,790
I thought you guys were out.

777
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,350
Okay, don't worry.

778
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,830
I'll go find her now.

779
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,980
I love working overtime with you.

780
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,430
It feels like we're working together.

781
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,500
I hate working overtime.

782
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,550
That's a waste of my expensive eye cream.

783
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,870
True.

784
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,590
Mr. Zhong.

785
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,510
Is Zhen Gaogui still working?

786
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,110
No, I didn't see her the whole afternoon.

787
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,740
No?

788
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,110
Do you know where she went?

789
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,630
I don't know.

790
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,870
You can't reach her?

791
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,780
I think I saw her on the phone,

792
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,450
and she said she contacted a blogger called...

793
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,150
That's right.

794
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,070
Li Bupang.

795
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,680
Li Bupang. Yes, I remembered.

796
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,510
Right.

797
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,620
Li Bupang.

798
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,030
We should go now.

799
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,190
Okay, thank you.

800
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,030
Bye.

801
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,910
Li Bupang.

802
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,110
Mr. Zhong.

803
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,470
Our old member. Please come in.

804
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,020
Excuse me.

805
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,940
Excuse me, bro.

806
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,370
Have you seen this girl?

807
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,070
Who?

808
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,840
Have you seen this girl?

809
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,200
She came by and went to the west side.

810
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,810
West side?

811
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,110
Over there?

812
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,700
Yes.

813
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,120
Okay, thank you, bro.

814
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,840
This girl must have quarreled with him.

815
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,060
It's been a long time.

816
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,870
Yeah.

817
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,430
Sure. I just came back from camping.

818
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,950
How about I come to you?

819
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,650
No problem.

820
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,630
I'll come to you.

821
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,510
Okay.

822
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,570
No problem.

823
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,420
Li Bupang.

824
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,840
I'm coming. Bye.

825
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,470
Li Bupang!

826
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,560
Li Bupang!

827
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,960
Li Bupang!
