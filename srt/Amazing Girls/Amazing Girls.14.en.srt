What's the result today?

In other words,

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,150
I am not sure if it will bring bad consequences.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,030
I once read a book.

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,990

13
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,790
So since you already did it,

14
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,300
don't care if it's good.

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,990
That's right.

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,110
But no matter what the result will be,

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,630
I should consider it comprehensively.

What we do

19
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,550

didn't happen,

may happen,

I don't want to bother you here.

Do you think I'm giving you a hard time on purpose?

I'm sick of you wandering around in front of me.

That's not what I meant.

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,420
I watched the videos you posted.

Do you still want to

75
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,230

76
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,550
Aren't I now?

What kind of person do you think I am?

00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,710
A green hand at work.

79
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,560
You're afraid of making mistakes and being scolded by your leaders.

80
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,550
You've been working hard every day.

81
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,270
You just started to compromise with the society, right?

82
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,390
You're right, Ms. Le.

83
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,670
Actually,

84
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,390
I think most people in life

85
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,110
are like me.

86
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,710
We were always protected

87
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,510
by our parents when were young.

88
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,230
Hence, life was much easier for us when we were kids.

89
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,550
When we grew up, we realized every step in life

90
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,870
would be so hard.

91
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,709
What's wrong?

92
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,350
You used to be protected by your parents so well.

93
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,830
Now you know it's hard to make money?

94
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,470
Life and making a living are both hard.

95
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,920
Luckily, I'm still young.

96
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,790
I still have a chance.

97
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,590
But we can't always look back.

98
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,790
Otherwise, we're going to

99
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,030
miss out on a lot of the good things in life.

100
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,230
There's nothing good around me now.

101
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,550
Judging from my current situation,

102
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,590
nothing is better than it used to be.

103
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,920
At least you have a lot of leisure time now.

104
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,230
You don't have to work

106
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,600
I hope I could.

107
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,590
I'm not afraid of hard work.

108
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,470
Who doesn't want a chance to make money?

109
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,910
Ms. Le,

110
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,830
have you considered

111
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,590
letting your fans know your real situation?

112
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,240
No way.

113
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,780
Everybody hits a man who is down.

114
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,390
Then no one will offer me opportunities.

115
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,470
Actually,

116
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,550
everyone already knew that.

117
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,550
Look at the comments below

118
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,990
and read what they said.

119
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,830
[Is she crazy? She hasn't been popular for many years!]

120
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,830
[It doesn't matter she is out of favor now. She must have suffered from the mental internal friction.]

121
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,830
[I hate people who pretend to be nice.]

122
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,159
I never read those comments.

123
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,550
Those who said these

124
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,710
are losers in life.

125
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,110
I don't need to lower myself to their level.

126
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,270
Yes, they've gone too far.

127
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,150
According to my analysis,

128
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,230
there are only two kinds of people

129
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,390
who are still following you.

130
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,790
One is fake follows. They rarely show up.

131
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,710
The other kind is

132
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,230
the anti-fans.

133
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,159
They just come to make fun of you.

134
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,710
Since this is the case,

135
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,909
why don't you make a change

136
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,720
and think out of the box?

137
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,150
How?

138
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,560
Actually, I have an idea.

139
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,590
I want to shoot a video for you.

140
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,670
But you don't have to do anything,

141
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,710
except for expressing

142
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,350
your true feelings.

143
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,110
For example, tell others

144
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,790
you're not in good condition.

145
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,800
And you also need chances

146
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,230
to act.

147
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,470
Enough.

148
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,670
If this is your plan,

149
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,030
stay away from me.

150
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,270
Let's give it a try.

151
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,150
Since it's already like this,

152
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,350
Maybe we can strike back.

153
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,150
Think of another plan.

154
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,350
I'm going to shoot the next scene.

155
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,830
Ms. Le, don't you want to think about it?

156
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,230
I took an ad for you.

157
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,110
We'll make a video about the color testing this weekend.

158
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,470
This is the sample sent from the brand.

159
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,220
For this foundation? Are you sure?

160
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,240
Are you surprised?

161
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,390
I've seen their advertisements.

162
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,350
They only hire actresses who were no longer in their prime ten years ago.

163
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,150
It specializes in long-lasting makeup.

164
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,710
You can't be picky now.

165
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,920
If you don't make more money,

166
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,830
my KPI in the company will be at the bottom.

167
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,910
If it wasn't a first-class international brand,

168
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,710
it wouldn't have been able to negotiate with me.

169
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,150
Do you know that in showbiz,

170
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,590
the time when you are not trending,

171
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,910
it's called the past?

172
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,670
Your era is over.

173
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,270
So what?

174
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,150
My achievements in the past can still prove my ability!

175
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,270
Come on, Le.

176
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,230
We have to look forward.

177
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,470
Many people used to have their moments.

178
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,470
Most of them are a spent force now.

179
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,110
If you don't take this job,

180
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,670
there might not be advertisements in the future.

181
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,360

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,670
my assistant resigned.

190
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,550
The reason is

191
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,670
I have difficulty paying her salary.

192
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,790
In this year,

193
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,230
I only got one role.

194
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,150
It was a supporting role with few scenes.

195
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,910
My role didn't

196
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,990
even have a complete name.

197
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,670
It's called "Mrs. Wang".

198
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,910
This is what

199
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,670
I could barely imagine in the past.

200
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,030
But now

201
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,670
I have to be grateful to

202
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,000
the director and producer

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,150
who provided me the chance.

204
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,550
Actually, I've tried live commerce.

205
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,710
They said they could use

206
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,470
my label for "empress's professional"

207
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,909
to boost some traffic.

208
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,710
I also received lots of

209
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,110
negative comments on the Internet,

210
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,750
saying that I'm superior

211
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,750
and don't know how ordinary people live.

212
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,590
How can I do the live commerce if I don't know how to select the proper goods?

213
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,950
They said I hadn't cooked before,

214
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,750
how could I sell pans?

215
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,630
I think they are right.

216
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,360
So I stopped these attempts.

217
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,630
Now,

218
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,630
I just want to live my life well.

219
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,750
I want to live a normal life

220
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,470
that I abandoned before.

221
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,230
I'll get the life

222
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,950
that ordinary people live back.

223
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,750
Being an actress

224
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,630
is my lifelong goal.

225
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,230
But if I haven't experienced

226
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,480
the hardships of life,

227
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,950
how can I play the roles

228
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,630
that come from life well?

229
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,590
I'm not saying these for sadfishing.

230
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,110
I just want to tell you

231
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,310
the former celebrity Cui Le

232
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,190
has left.

233
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,590
The one who's talking to you here is the actress, Cui Le.

234
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,230
An actress who is serious about

235
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,830
living and experiencing life.

236
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,070
I love acting.

237
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,700
I'm hungry for a chance.

238
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,750
I hope the directors and producers

239
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,990
who are watching this video

240
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,230
can provide me with one more chance.

241
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,470
I won't let you down.

242
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,950
At the same time,

243
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,350
I want to tell the audience

244
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,830
if you are at the bottom of the barrel

245
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,190
like me,

246
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,110
and you're feeling lost in life,

247
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,510
please work hard together with me.

248
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,430
So you worked so hard

249
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,630
when you first came to our company

250
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,720
because you wanted to get out of the slump of your life, didn't you?

251
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,510
Yes.

252
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,350
Although I didn't cause all the changes in my family,

253
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,830
it was still hard for me to accept the fact that

254
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,120
my carefree life

255
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,990
has to be gone.

256
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,590
No wonder I always feel

257
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,350
you have a special energy.

258
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,590
You kept working like a lunatic.

259
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,630
I'm not scolding you.

260
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,110
I mean,

261
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,430
you never hesitate to do anything.

262
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,840
You always try your best

263
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,580
to complete every task.

264
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,110
You never leave any retreat for yourself.

265
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,710
I have no choice.

266
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,630
I'm trying hard

267
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,510
to live like I used to.

268
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,110
So the sceneries you saw in your life journey

269
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,350
are different from others'.

270
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,190
I also want to see this kind of scenery.

271
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,310
That's great.

272
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,830
Please guide me in the future, Boss.

273
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,470
Are you here for Mr. Zhong?

274
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,830
He's not in the company today.

275
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,830
It's the same if I talk to you.

276
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,950
It must be something very important

277
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,070
since you came here in person.

278
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,830
It's mainly because we don't want to delay your progress.

279
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,110
We have discussed the topic of

280
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,070
image licensing for the new flavored popcorn.

281
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,630
Although some new IP images

282
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,630
can be used,

283
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,750
we still want to re-design

284
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,430
some of the content.

285
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,750
In this way,

286
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,630
when you advertise the new products,

287
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,960
you can also develop

288
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,110
new peripheral products.

289
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,950
As a result, it will take some time.

290
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,310
Okay, I'll tell him.

291
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,750
He has other things to deal with recently.

292
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,510
There may be some delays on our end as well.

293
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,470
Where's Zhong Yiming?

294
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,830
He went to work?

295
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,110
He went to talk to our brand ambassador

296
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,870
with Zhen Gaogui.

297
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,110
It's Cui Le. Do you know her?

298
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,830
I do.

299
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,830
Her famous line is

300
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,960
"Let me see

301
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,830
how many prods you can bear this time".

302
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,470
Yes, that's her.

303
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,110
We plan to completely give up the real people endorsing

304
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,950
and upgrade it with the image of the Dooro Bear.

305
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,710
But you may know,

306
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,230
as a celebrity,

307
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,430
she was defeated by a cartoon image,

308
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,470
so she was upset about it.

309
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,430
I'm just afraid that

310
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,480
she may say something extreme.

311
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,510
Zhen Gaogui can solve it.

312
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,590
Don't worry.

313
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,510
I'm worried

314
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,470
because I can't help at all.

315
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,740
This feeling of helplessness is terrible.

316
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,710
What are you going to do after work?

317
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,510
Would you like to chill?

318
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,350
So you're not here for work,

319
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,830
but for a date with me?

320
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,470
It sounds

321
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,230
as if I'm not serious about work.

322
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,750
It's office hours.

323
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,350
I get paid.

324
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,110
But it's okay after work.

325
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,070
I'll wait for you then.

326
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,230
I've got too much on my plate this week.

327
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,240
My schedule is full.

328
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,630
But you'll be my priority

329
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,630
next week.

330
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,870
Here.

331
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,510
Thank you, Boss.

332
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,500
The property management said just now

333
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,000
the air conditioner in our building

334
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,230
will be turned off later.

335
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,310
You'd better go home right after this.

336
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,830
It's okay.

337
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,720
I don't have an air conditioner in my house anyway.

338
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,710
There's no difference.

339
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,230
I'm almost done with this video.

340
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,990
Why is this interface stuck?

341
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,710
Have a look.

342
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,190
You're truly my Boss.

343
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,510
I've experienced life

344
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,230
without an air conditioner.

345
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,070
I didn't want to spend much money on rent.

346
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,870
So I rented an apartment

347
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,470
without an air conditioner.

348
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,510
I couldn't afford a heater fan,

349
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,470
so I went to the malls as soon as I got off work.

350
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,480
And then went back to sleep

351
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,110
when my body was still warm.

352
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,500
Life is so great now.

353
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,630
As long as I am at work,

354
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,190
there will be free air conditioning.

355
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,110
Now,

356
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,190
I feel the same way.

357
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,710
Well,

358
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,240
I need to talk to Zhong Yiming.

359
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,470
Why is he pushing

360
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,350
my employee so hard?

361
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,750
I was about to talk to you.

362
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,630
What made you here?

363
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,310
You brought Zhen Gaogui here

364
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,990
and let her work overtime here.

365
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,980
Is it appropriate?

366
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,350
Is that the way to be a boss?

367
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,830
Is it me who asked her to work overtime?

368
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,350
Didn't you ask her to work overtime?

369
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,510
Well,

370
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,710
how can I work

371
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,430
with you two staring at me?

372
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,710
How about

373
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,630
leaving me to my work?

374
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,470
Didn't you say you have a solution?

375
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,750
So I came to have a look.

376
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,720
I'm not done yet.

377
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,830
I'll show it to you when it's done.

378
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,630
What if Cui Le backs out

379
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,720
and doesn't like it when you're done?

380
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,990
Just trust me for once.

381
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,350
If she's not content,

382
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,830
I'll pretend to be a temporary worker and resign to apologize

383
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,310
so that she can be mollified.

384
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,350
I have the final say

385
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,590
on your resignation.

386
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,110
Even if I need to renew the contract with her,

387
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,750
I won't let you resign. Don't worry.

388
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,620
Mr. Zhong,

389
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,230
you're such a good man!

390
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,840
I think compared to me,

391
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,630
the company's overall interests are more important.

392
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,110
You are also important.

393
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,870
You are very important to Xinda.

394
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,950
You are more important to Meton.

395
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,710
You are extremely important to Xinda.

396
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,310
You are much more important to Meton.

397
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,990
Stop talking nonsense.

398
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,110
My mom called.

399
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,070
Hello, Mom.

400
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,470
My dear girl.

401
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,230
It's been late. Why aren't you home yet?

402
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,430
I'm working overtime.

403
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,630
Why are you working overtime again?

404
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,470
Fenfang, it's me, Zhong.

405
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:39,630
Zhong?

406
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,180
Yes.

407
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,830
I'll take Gaogui home later.

408
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,190
Don't worry.

409
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,750
Are you with Zhong?

410
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,230
Then ask him

411
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,630
to come over for a visit.

412
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,230
No problem.

413
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,710
Hurry up.

414
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,480
Okay, I have to hang up.

415
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:55,750
Hurry up.

416
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,590
Your mom asked me to take you home after work.

417
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,510
Give me five more minutes.

418
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,070
I'll take her home later.

419
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,069
I don't think we're going the same way.

420
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,430
We'd better let you go.

421
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,069
Okay.

422
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,190
Okay, you can go home now.

423
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,710
Mr. Zhong, thank you for giving me a free ride.

424
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,069
Go home early.

425
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,230
It's getting late.

426
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,030
Wait a second.

427
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,910
It's...

428
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,710
Let's go.

429
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,670
A heater fan.

430
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,630
Let's go.

431
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,030
So you're here to deliver the heater,

432
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,190
not me?

433
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,230
Mom.

434
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,150
Come in, please.

435
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,430
I'll make a midnight snack for you.

436
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,060
Auntie, I brought you something good.

437
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,720
Look at this.

438
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,470
What is it?

439
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,870
I'll plug it in for you.

440
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,030
Is this a heater fan?

441
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,190
Zhong, thank you so much.

442
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,390
Mr. Zhong.

443
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,230
How about this?

444
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,910
How much is this? I'll transfer it to you.

445
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,630
We can't accept it for free.

446
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,470
No need.

447
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,310
Your mom said she would treat me to a midnight snack.

448
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,310
It's just a heater fan.

449
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,230
No worries.

450
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,950
Okay, I'll prepare the midnight snack for you.

451
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,910
Mom, it's so late.

452
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,670
We've had dinner.

453
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,750
You can have some midnight snacks before sleep.

454
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,470
Yes, I happen to be hungry.

455
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,230
Mom.

456
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,950
What delicacies did you make?

457
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,470
Why do you want us to have one more meal?

458
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,230
Then I have to introduce it to you.

459
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,940
You are lucky.

460
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,990
You'll taste the first jiaozi

461
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,550
that I have ever made in my life.

462
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,670
Mom, you know how to make jiaozi?

463
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,790
Yes, I learned it from Mrs. Li.

464
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,630
Otherwise,

465
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,430
I'd have gone to get my beauty sleep at this hour.

466
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,070
I'm going to boil jiaozi for you.

467
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,950
-Thank you, Mom.
-Thank you, Auntie.

468
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,190
Here are the jiaozi.

469
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,390
Here you go.

470
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,670
After the jiaozi are wrapped,

471
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,470
I might have put them on the table

472
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,310
a little too long.

473
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,230
And then

474
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,270
when I was about to boil them,

475
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,510
their dough and stuffings were separated.

476
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,430
Auntie, the jiaozi you made

477
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,230
are the best ones I've ever eaten

478
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,910
in the world.

479
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,260
It's true.

480
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,950
I'm glad you like it.

481
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,190
It tastes good.

482
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,030
This is the final version

483
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,720
of the video I edited for Cui Le.

484
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,510
If this can attract her fans' attention,

485
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,030
we still have a chance of winning.

486
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,470
If it can't,

487
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,190
we'll have to think of another way.

488
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,470
Why do you think this video would be a turning point?

489
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,910
Because I think sincerity is the key.

490
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,230
I'm happy for Cui Le

491
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,030
to take this step.

492
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,430
Maybe her fans will be moved by her courage.

493
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,760
All right, you can watch it here.

494
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,310
I'll help my mom wash the dishes.

495
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,430
He's a thief who broke into my house.

496
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,200
But don't worry.

497
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,230
I'm ready

498
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,190
to call the police.

499
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,670
Now let's take a closer look

500
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,550
at his desperate expressions.

501
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,070
All right, stop struggling.

502
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,150
Explain to the police later.

503
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,830
What are you watching?

504
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,670
Don't watch this.

505
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,150
Wait.

506
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,390
Don't take it back.

507
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,310
I haven't finished yet.

508
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,560
Wait. Don't...

509
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,200
Give it to me.

510
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,310
Don't watch it. Give it to me.

511
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,270
Don't touch. It will be broken.

512
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,510
Have some fruits.

513
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:56,910
Mom.

514
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,750
Sorry, I should have been here now.

515
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,510
Mom.

516
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,470
It's too late.

517
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,990
I think I'd better go home now.

518
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,030
-Have some fruits.
-Well...

519
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,030
Deal with the video yourself.

520
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,190
Auntie, I'm leaving.

521
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,420
Mom, I have a stomachache. I need to go to the toilet.

522
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,130
[A self-statement of an out of favor actress, Cui Le]

523
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,470
I'd like to say something to my fans

524
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,150
who are still following me.

525
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,270
Frankly...

526
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,790
How's the data?

527
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,710
Maybe I misjudged it.

528
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,030
There are very few viewers.

529
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,390
How about

530
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,430
I get you some online supporters

531
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,310
to improve the data?

532
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,270
You can also leave me to it.

533
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,190
I have a lot of ways to do it.

534
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,510
I'll give you a discount.

535
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,310
Not now, thanks.

536
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,070
I'll wait a little longer.

537
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,430
Work

538
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,710
won't always go smoothly.

539
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,670
How about this?

540
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,710
I'll ask some influencer friends

541
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,710
to share it for you

542
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,150
to raise the first wave of traffic.

543
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,870
No, I don't want to bother you.

544
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,160
It's nothing.

545
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,070
Work is not a personal matter.

546
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,470
You don't have to

547
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,910
avoid letting me help you every day.

548
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,990
How about this, Boss?

549
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,870
I'll wait for another two hours.

550
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,470
If it doesn't work in two hours,

551
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,750
I'll trouble you then.

552
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,510
I want to see

553
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,710
if my decision is right.

554
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,950
Sure.

555
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,310
Hello, everyone.

556
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,710
I'm an actress, Cui Le.

557
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,990
I'd like to say something to my fans

558
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,830
who are still following me.

559
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,390
Frankly,

560
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,830
I'm already a has-been now.

561

Hello?

562
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,230
Brother.

565
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,870
I don't think it's going well, right?

566
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,470
We're still trying to find a way.

567
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,480
Really?

568
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,310
Did you talk to her?

569
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,870
No.

570
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,310
I let the PR company meet and talk to her.

571
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,710
What's the result?

572
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,430

I'm not sure.

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,670
Mr. Sun,

588
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,470
you may be informed faster than me.

589
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,470
You're immature.

590
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,780
Mr. Zhong Jr. didn't handle it well.

591
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,790
If I ask him about it,

592
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,950
he'll be embarrassed.

593
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,710
I'm still a green hand, Mr. Sun.

594
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,190
I need to learn from you.

595
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,070
Is he still in a meeting?

596
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,230
There's probably no result.

597
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,510

The company is in a transformation stage,
