00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,430
Why isn't the pianist here yet?

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,390
The dinner is about to start.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,230
The pianist said that he suddenly had an attack of tenosynovitis.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,460
It hurts so much that he can't play the piano.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,870
Let's use background music today.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,910
No.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,690
The leaders of the Asia region will come here for an inspection today.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,670
Otherwise, I wouldn't have invited

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,990
such an expensive pianist here.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,370
Just see

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,630
whether you can contact any other pianist.

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,430
Money is not a problem.

14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,790
Where can I find another pianist now, Manager?

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,280
Excuse me.

16
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,790
Is it true that the pianist can't come because of personal affairs?

17
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,420
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,060
The pianist is late because of something.

19
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,430
How can I help you?

20
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,840
Do you think I can do this?

21
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,630
I also learned to play the piano before.

22
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,450
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,630
We need a professional pianist to play the piano.

24
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,750
For now, it's not available for guests.

25
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,780
Why don't you interview me?

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,240
I can play well.

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,760
You can't find anyone else anyway.

28
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,700
Filling the vacancy on stage is like putting out the fire.

29
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,590
Manager, why don't we just let her give it a try?

30
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,390
If it's not okay, we can think of another way.

31
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,030
It's too late to find someone else now.

32
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,870
That's right.

33
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,870
Then...

34
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,030
give it a try.

35
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,550
Very good.

36
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,810
Then you're hired.

37
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,350
Can you help to play the piano for an hour?

38
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,190
Our leaders will come here for an inspection tonight.

39
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,110
Well,

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,550
pay me 500 yuan per hour. My price is very favorable.

41
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,830
Okay. No problem.

42
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,270
It's a deal.

43
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,190
Ma'am, please come this way to change into a gown.

44
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,110
Okay.

[Episode 5]

47
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,230
You played the piano well just now.

48
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,670
Really?

49
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,430
They are just some useless skills anyway.

50
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,120
Why do you think they are useless?

51
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,950
The guests who sat around me just now

52
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,840
all applauded for you.

53
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,870
They thought that you played well.

54
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,710
I'm flattered.

55
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,790
You must have played the piano for many years.

56
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,290
When I was a kid, my dad thought that a girl

57
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,110
should cultivate the taste in music,

58
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,290
so he asked me to learn to play the piano.

59
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,990
I wasn't quite willing to do it at that time.

60
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,550
But now I think that

61
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,000
music can bring people happiness indeed.

62
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,630
Then why did you stop playing the piano later?

63
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,209
Isn't that normal?

64
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,440
I didn't want to be a pianist.

65
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,550
I didn't have so much time to learn to play the piano.

66
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,750
I think your dad asked you to learn to play the piano

67
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,870
because he wanted you to live a carefree life, right?

68
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,310
I did live a carefree life.

69
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,950
Now,

70
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,590
I just want to work harder

71
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,430
so that he won't be disappointed in me.

72
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,550
Of course he won't be disappointed in you.

73
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,430
I haven't seen you for a few days.

74
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,110
I think you've matured a lot.

75
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,500
Thank you for treating me to dinner.

76
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,630
Mr. Zhong.

77
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,440
I should thank you for treating me to dinner.

78
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,310
What is this?

79
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,800
I'm sorry about what happened last time

80
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,930
when I went to your home.

81
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,860
Actually, I wanted to give you this dress.

82
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,070
I saw that your dress got dirty at the proposal meeting.

83
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,700
This dress is very expensive. It costs too much.

84
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,840
Just accept it.

85
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,110
We didn't choose Xinda PR at the proposal meeting.

86
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,430
It's our company's internal problem.

87
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,290
I'm also responsible for it.

88
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,720
You've been working hard lately.

89
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,510
Thank you.

90
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,990
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

91
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,390
Actually, I should apologize to you.

92
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,370
I hit you accidentally when you came to my home that day.

93
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,190
I mistook you for my creditor.

94
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,430
Those creditors really went too far. I...

95
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,750
Creditors?

96
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,250
Nothing.

97
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,420
I think you looked very intimidating.

98
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,950
I had no choice.

99
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,630
You can see my life now.

100
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,180
My mom and I depend on each other for living.

101
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,790
My life is just like a mess.

102
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,430
But now my biggest motivation is

103
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,830
working hard to pay off my debts.

104
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,870
I wish that I didn't have a debt.

105
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,200
Do you need my help?

106
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,920
No.

107
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,780
You manage such a big company every day.

108
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,420
I think it's a tricky task for you, right?

109
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,000
To be honest,

110
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,950
I quite envy your relationship with your mom.

111
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,190
You two are like sisters and can talk about everything.

112
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,820
My dad passed away early.

113
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,030
My mom and I had to depend on each other for living.

114
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,780
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

115
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,870
It's okay.

116
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,240
Let's not talk about this.

117
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,160
Just tell me

118
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,070
what plan Wisdom PR proposed

119
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,550
in the end last time

120
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,690
so that I can learn from it.

121
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,320
Wait.

122
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,540
It suddenly occurred to me that

123
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,390
the restaurant manager hadn't given me the money for playing the piano yet.

124
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,820
Hold this for me.

125
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,370
I earned 500 yuan by playing the piano.

181
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,710
you should show your talent more and work harder.

The quickest way to get fired

183
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,360
is to go to work and get off work on time.

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,550
No one thought that if you worked overtime,

185
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,070
it would cost a lot of water, electricity and network traffic?

186
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,650
Who cared about that?

187
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,830
For us,

188
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,350
as long as we had enough working hours on the record,

189
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,890
being in a trance for a day was also considered as an effort.

190
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,520
You just slacked off like that?

191
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,480
They just evaluated the employees' performance like that.

192
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,540
Mr. Zhong, to be honest,

193
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,310
it was so hard for us to work for Mr. Sun.

194
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,340
Then tell me about the further details.

195
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,120
It's inappropriate for me to snitch on my leader behind his back

196
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,070
like this, right?

197
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,310
Come on. Sit here.

198
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,430
Hurry up.

199
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,950
It's nothing.

200
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,150
I'm his boss.

201
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,570
Why should I let him know?

202
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,830
Besides,

203
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,860
he has to take responsibility for his mistakes, right?

204
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,810
That makes sense, but...

205
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,510
Mr. Zhong.

206
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,960
Are you trying to trick me into telling you the truth?

207
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,880
What if I say something wrong

208
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,580
and you fire me as well?

209
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,030
Give me your mobile phone.

210
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,350
What do you want to do?

211
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,130
Just take it out.

212
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,830
As long as you finish

213
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,040
the KPI for the second half of the year,

214
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,790
I promise that you can stay in the company.

215
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,470
Why did you do this?

216
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,190
I left you the evidence of recordings

217
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,030
so that you won't blame me for killing the donkey after it has done its job at the mill.

218
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,830
Who is the donkey?

219
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,860
Alright. Just tell me.

220
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,800
Tell me more about it before they come back.

221
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,080
Mr. Zhou, the boss of this company,

222
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,380
is very close to our vice president Mr. Sun.

223
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,470
Just like Wisdom PR,

224
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,050
they have cooperated with us for many years.

225
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,580
But why can we cooperate with each other for so long?

226
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,050
Look at this company.

227
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,960
It looks ordinary.

228
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,110
Its employees also look ordinary.

229
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,310
Everything is ordinary.

230
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,350
So?

231
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,150
So every time we cooperate,

232
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,330
their price is 30% higher

233
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,400
than the market price.

234
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,150
Where do you think

235
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,310
the extra money goes?

236
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,190
Mr. Sun?

237
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,590
Is this true?

238
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,760
It's true.

239
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,350
Once I had a drink with him. He drank too much

240
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,440
and told me about it himself.

241
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,710
He also told me that

242
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,190
he had been working in the company for so many years

243
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,310
and made great contributions,

244
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,630
so he should take the money.

245
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,970
He should? He talked as if it were reasonable.

246
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,190
Besides...

247
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,150
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,740
Mr. Zhong, sorry to keep you waiting.

249
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,230
It's all right.

250
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,190
Mr. Sun has been recommending you strongly in front of me.

251
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,430
He said that your channels were very good.

252
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,230
We're flattered.

253
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,930
Here's the contract.

254
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,950
Mr. Sun has confirmed

255
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,780
this contract.

256
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,920
If you have no objection,

257
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,860
let's proceed with the following process.

258
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,710
Mr. Zhou, here is the thing.

259
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,520
Our company has become stricter about

260
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,860
the examination of contracts.

261
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,690
I'm afraid it's too late to finish it now.

262
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
After I go back, I'll let you know our decision as soon as possible. Okay?

263
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:30,850
No need to see us off.

264
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,470
Longlong, let's go.

265
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,330
Mr. Zhong!

266
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,950
Goodbye, Mr. Zhou.

267
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,250
What kind of person is that?

268
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,750
Mr. Zhong.

269
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,910
I heard that you hadn't signed the contract

270
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,640
with Mr. Zhou.

271
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,170
Well, I'll think about it further.

272
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,430
After all, I've never done such a job before.

273
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,370
It's safer if we learn about it more clearly before we decide to

274
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,290
cooperate with them.

275
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,400
Longlong.

276
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,350
Did you not handle it well?

277
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,210
Why did you criticize Longlong?

278
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,500
It's my own decision.

279
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,280
Then you should hurry up.

280
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,510
We can't afford to delay the handling process.

281
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,230
Okay.

282
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,680
By the way,

283
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,300
have you heard of the cartoon figure Dooro Bear

284
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,970
which has been very popular online recently?

285
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,310
Lin Yue, the person who is in charge of their company,

286
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,670
has also been on a business trip here recently.

287
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,640
I want to talk to him face to face.

288
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,430
I'll tell you if there's any progress.

289
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,750
You can also search for the relevant information when you're free.

290
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,030
I've heard that he's

291
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,550
extremely popular online.

292
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,310
You can learn about him.

293
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,850
Okay.

294
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,240
Director Lu, you're here on a business trip again?

295
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,120
Yes.

296
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,990
[Recommended excellent exhibitors in the animation fair: Dooro Bear, a chubby bear which grows towards sunshine]

297
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,970
[Lin Yue]

298
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,570
Do you know this man?

299
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,650
Yes, he often lives in our hotel.

300
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,830
The Dooro Bear that has been very popular recently

301
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,600
is from their company.

302
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,830
You're

303
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,830
Lin Yue?

304
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,240
What a coincidence.

305
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,470
I was recognized before I introduced myself.

306
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,630
I'm sorry to have occupied your parking space

307
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,980
at the parking lot last time.

308
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,870
It's okay.

309
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,470
I took your elevator last time.

310
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,270
Let's call it even.

311
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,420
What are you busy with during this business trip?

312
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,950
I've been working all day.

314
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,910
I'm a little tired.

315
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,530
I don't feel like talking right now.

316
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,430
Sorry to bother you.

317
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,190
Mr. Lin.

318
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,310
You're here.

319
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,640
Director Lu asked me about you just now.

320
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,320
You can ask me if you want to know anything.

321
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,310
I can tell you something which you

322
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,400
can't find online.

323
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,950
No need.

324
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,550
I don't want to know something that

325
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,940
I shouldn't know.

326
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,990
It's okay.

327
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,150
In the future, you can learn about me slowly.

328
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,860
Do you really think that you're like a product in a shopping cart,

329
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,170
and I have to read its details?

330
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,840
Aren't you looking at me now?

331
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,970
You think I want to look at you?

332
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,420
But you were really looking at me just now.

333
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,230
I'm tired.

334
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,290
I'm going back to my room first.

335
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,380
Bye.

336
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,240
We'll meet again.

337
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,400
Mr. Lin.

338
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,240
Do you know Director Lu or not?

339
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,910
No.

340
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,550
Then let me introduce her to you.

341
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,310
No, we'll get to know each other in the future.

342
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,230
Brother.

343
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,600
If the supplier

344
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,310
is selected by them like that,

345
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,250
how can we manage the company well in the future?

346
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,250
Everyone will know that it was decided internally due to some special relations,

347
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,900
and the leaders embezzled the company's funds.

348
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,430
It'll make us, the executives,

349
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,590
look not so smart.

350
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,070
If you directly refuse them now,

351
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,710
it will be harmful to your relationship with them.

352
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,030
You still have to work with them in the future.

353
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,000
Got it?

354
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,520
This is not okay. I have to find a way to deal with them.

355
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,370
You haven't signed the contract yet, have you?

356
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,490
How about this?

357
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,600
Why don't we change it to the form of bidding

358
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,510
so that all the suppliers can start again to bid for the project?

359
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,070
If they need to bid for it on the spot,

360
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,550
they won't have a chance to act unscrupulously.

361
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,440
Those suppliers who have special relations

362
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,190
probably won't play this game with you.

363
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
This is a good idea.

364
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,730
Those who are experienced are so intelligent, Brother.

365
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,400
Come in.

366
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,660
Mr. Zhong.

367
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,710
The proposal procedure of Wisdom PR has been completed.

368
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,770
After the contract is signed,

369
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,120
they can make their work more detailed.

370
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,990
Why don't we wait a little longer?

371
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,990
Is there any problem that needs to be solved?

372
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,140
I know that

373
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,930
after you met Mr. Zhou during the business trip this time,

374
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,390
you didn't sign the contract with him.

375
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,630
Can I decide by myself

376
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,150
whether to sign the contract or not?

377
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,430
Of course, you can decide it.

378
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,859
I'm just worried that

379
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,359
you'll forget about it when you're so busy,

380
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,780
which might delay our work progress.

381
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,150
You think that

382
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,190
this Wisdom PR is really good.

383
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,010
Of course.

384
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,990
Their competitiveness in the industry is also strong?

385
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,410
Don't worry about

386
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,190
their working ability.

387
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,570
I just think that

388
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,640
the Mid-Autumn Festival promotion event is so important that

389
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,790
I want to find the most suitable partner.

390
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,980
Mr. Zhong.

391
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,950
Do you want to go back on your word?

392
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,960
This is inappropriate.

393
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,190
The proposal procedure is over.

394
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,420
The cooperation partner has been confirmed.

395
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,050
Besides,

396
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,820
everyone has voted.

397
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,270
We have no excuse.

398
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,420
Right.

399
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,510
Do you think it'll be better if I invite these suppliers

400
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,980
to join the bidding together

401
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,660
so that we can select the partner on the spot?

402
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,320
Mr. Zhong.

403
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,830
Let's talk about it next time when we vote.

404
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,670
This is my first big event

405
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,710
after I joined the company.

406
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,530
I have to be cautious about it.

407
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,900
Besides, Wisdom PR is so excellent that

408
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,350
there won't be any problem for them in the bidding.

409
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,000
Right?

410
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:20,950
Do you agree?

411
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,430
Yes.

412
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,950
I'd like to inform you of something.

413
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,110
From now on, all our company's key outsourcing projects

414
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,030
will be decided in the form of bidding.

415
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,260
So, for the Mid-Autumn Festival promotion event this time,

416
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,590
we need those companies which have offered proposals

417
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,750
to make bidding documents as soon as possible and prepare for the bidding.

418
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,910
I've told the old Mr. Zhong

419
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,520
about this thing.

420
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,670
Besides, in order to ensure the quality of this project,

421
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,630
we need the supplier to pay the cost first.

422
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,000
Only after the sales volume meets our expected goal

423
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,140
will we pay the money.

424
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,510
Otherwise, all the cost will be borne by the PR company.

425
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,110
Director Lu,

426
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,390
after I sort out the bidding documents,

427
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,130
please send them to all the companies that have offered proposals.

428
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,910
Okay. I'll inform all of them,

429
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,050
especially Zhen Gaogui.

430
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,040
You seem to pay a lot of attention to her recently.

431
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,470
Aren't you the same?

432
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,510
Me?

433
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,950
Really?

434
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,190
Director,

435
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,400
this opportunity from Meton is quite rare.

436
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,110
I want to fight for it.

437
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,210
Didn't you already fight for it last time?

438
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,470
Actually, I was quite satisfied with myself last time.

439
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,780
Though I didn't succeed,

440
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,690
it was not entirely my fault.

441
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,320
We finally got another chance to bid for the project this time.

442
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,140
If I give up,

443
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,710
then all our previous time will be wasted.

444
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,870
You've also read their bidding requirements.

445
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,900
It'll not only waste our time,

446
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,270
but also our money.

447
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,030
Do you how risky it is

448
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,070
to let the company pay the cost first?

449
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,540
But if we can promote the event well

450
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,400
and it's profitable,

451
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,320
we can get the money back, right?

452
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,310
Besides, by doing this,

453
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,940
we can build a long-term cooperation relationship.

454
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,230
I'm just a director of Xinda PR.

455
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,550
The boss hired us to make money.

456
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,820
Before we can make some money,

457
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,590
we even want to ask the company to pay the cost first.

458
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,950
Do you think every boss

459
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,350
is an angel investor?

460
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,750
But...

461
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,750
How about this, Director?

462
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,550
If we can't get the money back later,

463
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,420
I'll pay all the cost

464
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,040
and bear all the risks.

465
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,390
Is it necessary?

466
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,920
Why are you in a trance?

467
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,750
Have some tangerines.

468
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,640
Ms. Zhang gave them to me. They are very sweet.

469
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,410
They are too cold.

470
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,270
Let's earn money to buy an air conditioner as soon as possible.

471
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,300
In this way, we can use it in all the four seasons.

472
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,360
Are you going to buy an air conditioner with this credit card?

473
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,330
I can't use the credit card so casually.

474
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,640
However, as long as it's here,

475
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,660
I dare to do something big.

476
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,270
Hello, if you're here to submit bidding documents, go this way please.

477
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,900
Okay.

478
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,710
Mr. Zhong.

479
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,130
I'm here again.

480
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,020
It looks like you're very confident about your preparation.

481
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,930
All of us will compete fairly with our ability.

482
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,680
Of course,

483
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,770
I hope that I can get the result I want.

484
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,930
Then we'll go back first.

485
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,990
I hope that we can cooperate with each other.

486
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,480
By the way,

487
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,740
this is Director Zhang of our company.

488
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,510
Without his help, I wouldn't have had the chance

489
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,950
to participate this time.

490
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,380
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhong.

491
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,890
As they said,

492
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,790
you're young and talented.

493
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,720
Hello, my name's Zhong Yiming.

494
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,400
My name's Zhang Feiyang.

495
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,840
You've recruited such an excellent

496
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,710
talent as Zhen Gaogui.

497
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,750
You have good taste.

498
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,310
We'll go back first.

499
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,160
After the bidding information was sent out,

500
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,880
Wisdom PR, which had succeeded in their proposal, gave up.

501
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,140
Only three companies were willing to continue to participate in the bidding.

502
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,670
After the open bidding organized by our bidding team,

503
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,710
Xinda PR got the most votes.

504
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,110
It's surprising that Wisdom PR gave up.

505
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,190
It doesn't make sense.

506
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,740
As expected, Xinda PR got the project in the end.

507
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,510
Director Lu, please help to

508
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,880
inform Xinda PR.

509
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,470
Let's sign the contract and get to work.

510
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,630
Okay.

511
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,110
[Notice of Winning the Bidding]

512
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,310
Gosh! I won the bidding!

513
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,250
The project of Meton Popcorn is mine!

514
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,740
What did I tell you?

515
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,320
Work hard after you got the project.

516
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,400
Of course.

517
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,400
Besides,

518
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,270
remember what you said to me.

519
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,420
I hope that the bad result you said

520
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,710
will never happen.

521
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,470
Come in.

522
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,620
Mr. Zhong, I'm here again.

523
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,590
What is it now?

524
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,790
I specially came here to thank you.

525
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,510
For what?

526
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,190
I know that I won the bidding this time

527
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,660
because you helped me secretly.

528
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,030
You're the most kind-hearted man, Mr. Zhong.

529
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,870
Alright.

530
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,000
Last time, you treated me to a meal.

531
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,270
I'll treat you to a meal this time.

532
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,260
We need to cooperate with each other well in the future.

533
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,220
No, I should treat you to a meal this time.

534
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,270
Didn't you alrealy treat me

535
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,920
to a buffet last time?

536
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,150
Last time, Director Lu said that you gave me

537
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,830
the meal coupons.

538
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,750
She told me the same thing.

539
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,230
Director Lu.

540
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,430
What was going on with the meal coupons last time?

541
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,750
Last time, the meal coupons

542
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,590
were actually given to me by my friend.

543
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,340
Originally, Mr. Zhong and I

544
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,510
should have treated Zhen to dinner together.

545
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,630
But I was too busy.

546
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,400
I could only do that in the end.

547
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,710
There must be a misunderstanding between you two.

548
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,900
Our cooperation has been realized, hasn't it?

549
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,310
Now everyone is happy, right?

550
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,490
Thank you, Director Lu.

551
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,800
Please help me when necessary

552
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,590
for the Mid-Autumn Festival promotion event.

553
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,560
It doesn't matter whether I'll help you or not.

554
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,470
What matters is

555
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,890
Mr. Zhong's help for you.

556
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,310
Gaogui is back.

557
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,260
It's Lele's. It contains less ice.

558
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,790
Thank you.

559
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,630
This is yours.

560
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,870
-Half sugar.
-Thanks.

561
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,920
And this is Ju Ran's. It's without sugar.

562
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,590
Thanks.

563
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,470
This is mine.

564
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,680
Since Gaogui got the project,

565
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,350
she has been high-spirited.

566
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,580
But Gaogui told me that she won the bidding this time

567
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,310
because she promised our client that

568
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,980
our company would pay the cost first.

569
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,750
Our company has to bear the risks, too.

570
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,910
For such a risky project,

571
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,240
our director also approved it for a newcomer like you?

572
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,030
If anything goes wrong,

573
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,430
and the client doesn't admit the cost,

574
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,990
it'll lead to big trouble.

575
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,750
It looks like our company is quite confident in you.

576
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,200
Gaogui will surely succed.

577
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,310
[PANTRY]

578
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,380
You even dared to take charge of a case like this?

579
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,720
I have to do it no matter how difficult it is.

580
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,870
Actually,

581
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,190
I also know that it's risky.

582
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,710
I feel uncertain, too.

583
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,450
But what can I do?

584
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm not so lucky as to make a fortune

585
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,020
so easily anyway.

586
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,790
As the saying goes,

587
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,990
wealth comes with risks.

588
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,990
Normally, in a flagship store,

589
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,830
such a box of facial masks would cost 109 yuan.

590
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,880
But now I'm offering you a big discount

591
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,390
in the live stream room.

592
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,710
Listen. The price is 59 yuan.

593
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,820
Well, I think

594
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,190
this live stream is good.

595
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,270
I bought some good stuff here.

596
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,270
Mom.

597
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,910
When can you get rid of this bad habit?

598
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,190
You spent money buying useless things again.

599
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,710
No, I didn't. I'm making money.

600
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,360
How come you think of buying staff as making money?

601
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,870
My students

602
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,910
asked me to recommend some good yoga mats.

603
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,230
I happened to see this live streamer selling it.

604
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,160
You know what?

605
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,980
I think it's quite suitable.

606
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,140
You want to sell the mats to them?

607
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,060
Stretch your body.

608
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,160
Good. Good.

609
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,600
Bend your waist to the right.

610
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,470
Inhale.

611
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,850
Put your palms together.

612
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,830
Class is over. Thanks, everyone.

613
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,280
By the way,

614
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,070
don't go.

615
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,150
I have something to tell you.

616
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,910
These yoga mats

617
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,630
are the benefits from our yoga class.

618
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,830
I specially selected these foreign-trade products.

619
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,480
Those who have recharged their season cards

620
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,780
can get one mat respectively.

621
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,410
Now if you buy the season card by paying the fees for each single lesson,

622
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,900
you can get a 20% discount.

623
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,620
For the remaining students who recharge their cards monthly,

624
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,070
as long as you can recommend a friend to join us,

625
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,390
we'll give you a mat.

626
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,140
What do you think?

627
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,030
I want it.

628
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,830
Be patient. Let's do it one by one.

629
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,310
Be patient.

630
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,480
There are enough mats for all of you.

631
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,110
This is for you.

632
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,750
Your meal has been on the desk from noon to afternoon.

633
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,670
Why don't you eat it?

634
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,620
I forgot it as I was so busy.

635
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,620
I'm a bit hungry indeed.

636
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,870
What kind of product are you working on?

637
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,630
Popcorn.

638
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,790
This is the only client I have.

639
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,920
As your senior colleague,

640
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,090
can I give you a suggestion?

641
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,420
Normally speaking,

642
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,840
when we work on a product,

643
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,990
we should use the design drawings of the same kind of products as the benchmarks.

644
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,750
But your deisgn

645
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,410
contains both chocolate and ice cream.

646
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,750
It's a bit irrelevant to

647
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,180
your popcorn, isn't it?

648
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,260
I know.

649
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,340
I just want to take a high-end route.

650
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,080
Isn't this more profitable?

651
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,670
So I want to add some fairy-tale elements

652
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,430
to the inspiration of my design.

653
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,340
That makes sense.

654
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,280
According to my small amount of experience,

655
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,840
if you change it so much,

656
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,530
your client

657
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,890
may not accept it.

658
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,520
If it doesn't change much,

659
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,350
why does the client need me to work for them?

660
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,300
Please deepen this color for me.

661
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:24,950
Okay.

662
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,500
Please make this line thicker for me.

663
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,390
Thank you.

664
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,770
Wait.

665
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,570
I have a new idea.

666
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,400
Can you turn the whole picture

667
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,550
into the nine...

668
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,110
I'm about to get off work.

669
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,450
Can you think more clearly

670
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,010
about your ideas?

671
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,860
Okay. I'll be quick.

672
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,660
And I think the ears of the rabbit...

673
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,490
Handle the work of the Customer Department.

674
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,150
Zhen Gaogui.

675
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,080
Tell Lu if you have any requirements later.

676
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,330
I have something else to do.

677
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,410
I have to go.

678
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,630
No, this... this...

679
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,220
Well, I'm just an intern.

680
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,310
I'm a bit slow in working.

681
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,270
Please don't mind.

682
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,560
It's okay.

683
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,290
I'm also an intern.

684
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,940
I've finished revising this.

685
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,340
Can I go home now?

686
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,140
I've ordered dinner for you.

687
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,630
You've drunk the coffee, too.

688
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,930
You want to go home now

689
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,000
and leave me alone?

690
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,920
Besides,

691
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,840
I think you did a good job.

692
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,790
I just want to make it more perfect.

693
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,360
For example, for this style of the picture,

694
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,780
you can refer to the big house in a fairy tale.

695
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,590
Do you know that?

696
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,430
How about this?

697
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,390
I'll order a portion of yogurt with mixed fruits for you.

698
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,660
Are you satisfied now?

699
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,190
I just want to finish it soon and go home early.

700
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,680
I'll try again.

701
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,640
Work hard!

702
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,910
Gaogui.

703
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,860
You're still working overtime?

704
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,040
I'm busy revising the design drawings for Meton.

705
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,170
While you're working, you should take a rest when necessary.

706
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,670
Remember to order some night snacks if you're hungry.

707
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,830
I'll reimburse you for the expenses later.

708
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,120
Thank you, Director.

709
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,000
Work hard.

710
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,860
Hello, Director Zhang.

711
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,480
Mr. Zhong, what's the matter?

712
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,120
Didn't you say that Xinda PR

713
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,140
could hold a workshop in our company?

714
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,080
You can share the cases in the industry with our colleagues.

715
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,870
I want to discuss this with you.

716
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,100
Sure.

717
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,390
I'd better ask Zhen Gaogui

718
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,590
to write this down.

719
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,770
She's making arrangements for the details.

720
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,950
But she's been busy recently.

721
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,320
She's still working now.

722
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,730
She's still working?

723
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,950
She's still busy

724
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,350
with your case.

725
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,430
She just wants to handle the project well.

726
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,850
Okay.

727
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,790
As for the following process,

728
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,280
I'll contact Zhen Gaogui.

729
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,270
Thank you.

730
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,670
Mr. Zhong.

731
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,190
Didn't you say that you wouldn't work overtime?

732
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:24,830
Why are you still here?

733
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,410
I have a meeting with a foreign company

734
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,270
which is our partner.

735
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Why haven't you gone home yet?

736
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,150
There was still the last part of the work for me during the day.

737
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,900
I'll finish it soon.

738
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,910
If you don't mind,

739
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,450
I've ordered some takeout food. Shall we eat together?

740
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,910
Thank you.

741
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,710
Longlong.

742
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,230
Send me the detailed address

743
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,470
of Xinda PR.

744
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,680
You want to send a parcel? I'll send it for you.

745
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,660
Just send the address to me. Hurry up.

746
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:01,910
I've sent it.

747
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,230
Alright. Okay.

748
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,650
Mr. Zhong, why are you laughing if you don't eat?

749
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,480
Nothing.

750
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,950
Let's eat. Hurry up.

751
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,330
Ms. Zhen.

752
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,580
Hello.

753
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,510
Hello.

754
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,340
Who are you?

755
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,400
Your takeout food.

756
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,830
Okay. Thank you.

757
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,900
Enjoy your meal.

758
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,170
I didn't order the takeout food.

759
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,480
[It's not easy to work overtime. I'd like to treat you to some night snacks]

760
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,890
Our director is so good.

761
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,410
He treats me so well.

762
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,040
So many snacks.

763
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,310
It's my turn to be lucky now.

764
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,190
After this big meal, it's time to work hard.

765
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,230
I've also won a small battle recently.

766
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,840
Seeing that they disdained me

767
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,920
but they couldn't get rid of me,

768
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,110
I felt so good.

769
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,560
Well, I advise you to keep a low profile.

770
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,710
Judging from what you said,

771
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,620
you've matured a lot lately.

772
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,350
The young Mr. Zhong has really given me a hard time this time.

773
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,170
What do you think he wants to do?

774
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,790
I hope he's not trying to apply strict measures after taking up the position.

775
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,510
[Analysis of the Industry]

776
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,650
For Meton Popcorn's Mid-Autumn Festival promotion event this time,

777
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,500
our company thinks that we should focus on

778
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,790
those elite families which have a sense of ceremony.

779
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,960
By changing the packaging and sales channels,

780
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,610
we aim to increase the profits.

781
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,720
For example, there's the packaging like this.

782
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,310
What do you think?

783
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,560
I think this plan is well designed.

784
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,400
We should give up some

785
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,630
traditional ways indeed.

786
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,090
I don't think it makes sense.

787
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,080
It's not down-to-earth.

788
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,889
Moreover, it's totally different from Meton Popcorn's

789
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:21,870
previous image.

790
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,600
Besides,

791
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,060
after we raise the price,

792
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,870
what if we can't sell it?

793
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,070
How about this?

794
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,510
As usual, raise your hand to vote for it.

795
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,550
Raise your hand if you agree.

796
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,400
In that case,

797
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,260
let's take a break first.

798
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,610
You can also refresh yourselves.

799
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,710
Please think carefully, too.

800
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,969
Give me an answer after you come back.

801
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,570
Take a break, everyone.

802
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,350
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

803
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,670
Actually,

804
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,110
it's good to have someone supporting me.

805
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,970
You worked on this design drawing for a long time, didn't you?

806
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,430
Yes.

807
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,640
How do you know?

808
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,740
You put in a lot of effort. Of course I can sense it.

809
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,520
Can the instant noodles prepared in three minutes

810
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,520
the same as the broth prepared in three hours?

811
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,250
What if they still disagree

812
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,970
after they come bakc later?

813
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,230
So we need to discuss it and think of a countermeasure.

814
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,610
When you sorted out the materials,

815
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,230
did you see some successful cases

816
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,360
where the market prices were changed?

817
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,180
Yes, I did.

818
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,140
I'll find the cases for you.

819
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,670
Let's go.

820
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,200
Well,

821
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,610
I really don't know how to fix computers.

822
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,630
Maybe it always stayed up and worked late with me,

823
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,870
so it's broken now.

824
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,790
Reboot it. Then try it again.

825
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,090
I'll go get you a drink.

826
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,740
I think there's a chance for them.

827
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,020
Well,

828
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,560
when they are in the meeting room,

829
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,070
can't they behave themselves?

830
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,030
Zhen Gaogui's idea is good.

831
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,300
We can give it a try.

832
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,660
What do you mean?

833
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,830
You want to take their side?

834
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,450
Mr. Sun, don't choose a side first.

835
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,380
Anyway, I'm doing this for the company's sake.

836
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:48,870
Alright.

837
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,490
I'd like to see

838
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,620
how successful they can be.

839
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,760
Come on. Look at this, everyone.

840
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,350
These are some successful cases

841
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,510
Zhen Gaogui and I have just summarized.

842
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,990
Later, they'll be sent to you.

843
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,210
No need to show us the cases.

844
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,720
Then what do you want to see?

845
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,470
Mr. Zhong.

846
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,540
You want everyone to have a vote on

847
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,670
Xinda PR's design drawing, right?

848
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,600
We've decided on that.

849
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,600
How about this?

850
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,670
If you think

851
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,380
we can proceed with Xinda PR's design drawing,

852
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,130
raise your hand.

853
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,200
Congratulations, Mr. Zhong!

854
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:38,820
Great.

855
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,710
Zhen Gaogui and I will arrange the following plans.
