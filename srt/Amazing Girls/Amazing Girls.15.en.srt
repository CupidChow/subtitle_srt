Blowing hot and cold

322
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,590
is because he thinks he doesn't deserve you.

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,310
Why did it leak?

385
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,230
That's why you come to me?

386
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,830
Yes

387
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,870
You asked me to change the plan without any explanation.

388
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,830
Do you know how long

389
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,230
I spent on the previous plan?

390
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,510
You just stopped,

391
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,510
and gave me a random reason.

392
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,990
Do you think

393
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,190
my effort is

394
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,230
worthless?

395
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,470
No, I never meant that.

396
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,310
Since you want to keep a distance from me,

397
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,750
please leave.

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,710

423
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,710
I've asked Zhen Gaogui

to revise the plan.

425
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,910
Sort out the leaked parts

426
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,750

Aren't you worried？

428
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,230
Zhen Gaogui is definitely not the spy.

429
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,670
I suspect

430
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,230
there's a mole in our company.

431
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,000
After all, the company has started a reform

432
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,630
and launch new flavors.

433
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,430
It must have something to do with someone’s interest.

434
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,190
There's no reason for Xinda PR to do so.

435
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,310
He is willing to see

436
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,790
we promote more new flavors.

437
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,790
What else can we do?

438
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,510
Now,

439
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,870
we can only give it a test.

00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,390
Have you heard?

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,030
There's a new gossip about Meton.

It's said that the planning scheme

443
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,230
of their new product was leaked.

444
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,790
They suspected our company.

445
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,910
Are we suspected?

446
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,630
Yes.

447
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,150
We came up with this plan.

448
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,470
How can we cheat ourselves?

449
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,480
Leaking can ruin one's whole career life.

450
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,230
That's right.

451
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,030
Boss,

452
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,190
do you think so?

453
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,990
They said we leaked the scheme,

454
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,510
if this gets out of hand,

455
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,950
how can we make money in the future?

456
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,790
How can we get new clients?

457
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,200
Well,

458
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,870
is this what Zhong Yiming

459
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,710
want to tell you?

460
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,230
I guess that's it.

461
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,070
There is nothing else.

462
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,670
Have you explained this to Zhen Gaogui?

463
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,750
No.

464
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,960
She's angry now.

465
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,870
Don't make trouble for her.

She's angry.

467
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,200
You're in trouble.

468
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,790
It will damage your feelings.

469
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,990
Do we have any feelings?

470
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,200
From your words...

471
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,310
I think we should deal with the company's affairs first.

472
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,470
Boss,

473
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,030
what's up?

474
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,540
Nothing.

475
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,990
Well.

476
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,510
He suspected our company leaked the plan

477
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,430
but asked you to work overtime?

478
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,230
I don't think he thought the spy is

479
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,460
in our company.

480
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,150
Maybe,

481
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,200
he has his own ideas.

482
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,990
Didn't he tell you anything else?

483
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,230
You two are so close.

484
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,190
Who is close to him?

485
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,990
I have nothing to do with him.

486
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,160
Nothing?

487
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,950
That's good.

488
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,030
Boss,

489
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,310
I have a bad relationship with Party A.

490
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,390
Aren't you worried about it?

491
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,790
About what?

492
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,670
I'm not worried about your ability at all.

493
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,310
If there is any mistake,

494
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,510
it must be Party A's fault,

495
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,150
especially

496
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,230
Zhong Yiming's fault.

497
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,230
Why are you so concerned about Mr. Zhong lately?

498
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,160
That's because he cares too much about you.

499
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,150
Boss,

500
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,740

501
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,870

511
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,230
No need, really.

512
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,390
Okay.

513
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,470

I've told you that Mr. Zhong Jr. was not capable.

525

Since our strategy

526
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,710
was leaked to the Crispy Popcorn,

I'm investigating.

537
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,990
Is it helpful?

538

intercepted, you know?

00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,240
All the preparations are in vain.

542
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,510
Don't worry.

543
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,430
I'll deal with it.

I can't match you anymore.

765
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,270
Right?

766
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:46,510
By the way,

767
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,909
he solved the incident of Meton.

768
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:50,630
Do you know that?

769
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,870
How could I know?

770
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,270
He didn't tell me anything.

771
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,190
Not bad.

772
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,990
He finished his job perfectly.

773
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,430
Why should he bother you?

774
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,150
The annoying issues are not coriander

775
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,470
that can refresh the taste.

776
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,390
It will disturb your mood if you know it.

777
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,550
Did he tell you he solved it?

778
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,310
Yes.

779
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,150
Zhong Yiming is a good partner.

780
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,950
He has foresight

781
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,270
and is straightforward.

782
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,750
It's good for you to have a relationship with him.

783
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,670
What?

784
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,830
I won't do that.

785
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,760
Time is limited.

786
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,510
We have made some adjustments

787
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,480
on marketing plans and strategies.

788
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,630
Besides,

789
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,190
I've talked to

790
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,670
the following bloggers again

791
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,510
to ensure their time and their schedule.

792
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,670
Do you have any questions?

793
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,470
I think it's okay.

794
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,150
Crispy Popcorn would never think of it.

795
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,150
I support it.

796
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,990
We can promote the new joint products

797
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,510
of Meton Food and Dooro Bear in advance.

798
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,310
Let's have dinner together after this.

799
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,470
Everyone has been exhausted lately.

800
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,150
Mr. Zhong,

801
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,540
if there's nothing else,

802
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,990
I'll go first.

803
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,870
It's time for the cleaning appointment.

804
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,110
Okay, bye.

805
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,110
Bye, Gaogui.

806
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,390
Goodbye, Director Lu.

807
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,550
Bye.

808
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,750
Why did you drink so much today?

809
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,430
I'm happy for Mr. Zhong.

810
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,790
Are you?

811
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,390
Didn't I make you angry?

812
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,350
You know it?

813
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,270
Then you should drink three cups as punishment.

814
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,470
Fine, it's my fault. Come on.

815
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,860
♫The melody of my heart♫

816
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,990

♫The bird call and the sea♫

818
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,070

But Zhong Yiming,

839

If you have any problem next time,

840
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,110
you're not allowed to carry it yourself.

841
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:22,950
Got it?

842
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:26,670
Okay.

843
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,310
If something happens to you,

844
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,540
you can't bear it alone.

845
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,750
You too.

846
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,630
I didn't intend to keep it from you.

847
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,990
I just didn't want to share with you

848
