189
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,950
and accompanying you.

190
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,550
Just a few days ago, he did me a big favor.

191
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,310
So I'll treat him to dinner

192
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,230
to thank him.

193
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,990
By the way,

194
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,110
next time,

195
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,190
you should thank Zhong too.

196
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,840
Why should I thank him?

197
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,830
You can't even imagine

198
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,320
how he found you yesterday.

199
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,010
I couldn't reach you and I was so worried,

200
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,470
so I called him.

201
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,310
He said he was going to look for you.

202
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,440
He cares so much about you.

203
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,230
You

204
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,960
should try to think

205
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,840
from his perspective

206
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,230
and consider how he feels.

207
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,590
Alright, Mom.

208
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,580
I'm going out.

209
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,500
Enjoy your meal.

210
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,430
Thank you.

211
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,190
By the way,

212
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,630
one more set of tableware.

213
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,470
Okay.

214
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,190
Who else is coming?

215
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,340
You'll know.

216
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,830
Sorry, I'm late.

217
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,910
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

218
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,230
-Why can't I come?
-Why can't I come?

219
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,750
Well.

220
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,510
When Lin Yue asked you out, you came.

221
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,990
When I asked you out, you didn't.

222
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,720
Yeah.

223
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,830
Lin Yue is my best friend.

224
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,420
Who are you?

225
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,750
We're just in a working relationship.

226
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,110
Do I have to

227
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,230
have dinner with the Party A after work?

228
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,470
Am I always Party A?

229
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,630
Isn't Party A human?

230
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,740
Can't Party A have dinner?

231
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,230
Can't Party A meet friends?

232
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,550
Fine, Party A is always right.

233
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,590
Party A is God.

234
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,320
Party A is always right, okay?

235
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,310
You said you have a friend with you.

236
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,870
He's that friend.

237
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,830
Well,

238
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,750
how about you

239
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,470
see if there's anything else you want to eat?

240
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,310
Order more.

241
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,430
I want more.

242
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,630
Waiter.

243
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,510
Please give the gentleman a bottle of vinegar.

244
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,470
The biggest one.

245
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,350
OK.

246
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,310
Why?

247
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
Because I think you like vinegar.

248
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,470
Aren't you the type

249
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,830
who likes things that are sour?

250
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,390
I haven't even arrived yet,

251
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,310
and it seems like you've had half a bottle of vinegar.

252
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,990
Although

253
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,110
it's hard work for Party B,

254
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,990
Party A doesn't have it

255
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,440
as easy as you imagine either.

256
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,510
As for me,

257
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,980
I've done both Party A and Party B's work.

258
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,310
Work itself is bittersweet.

259
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,270
When I was working for others,

260
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,450
I thought my boss was so happy.

261
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,720
After I started my own business,

262
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,110
my happy time didn't

263
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,450
increase much compared to before.

264
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,830
That's right. I think so too.

265
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,640
Sometimes, you even have to listen to Party B.

266
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,470
Do you think it's easy to be Party B?

267
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,680
Party B not only has to deal with Party A,

268
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,310
but also colleagues and leaders in the company,

269
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,710
as well as an inbox full of documents.

270
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,710
In the essence of work,

271
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,630
there is no Party A or Party B.

272
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,430
There is only happiness and unhappiness.

273
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,730
Look at Zhen Gaogui,

274
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,470
although she complains all day,

275
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
she is full of motivation.

276
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,510
My motivation

277
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,480
mainly comes from you.

278
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Here's your tableware.

279
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,110
Thank you.

280
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,350
Please.

281
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,490
Did he tell you

282
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,950
about Li Bupang?

283
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,190
Yes.

284
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,810
He said he was worried.

285
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,630
No, I wasn't worried at all.

286
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,870
I didn't care at all.

287
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,450
Ignore him.

288
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,510
Okay, let's not talk about him.

289
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,230
Let's talk about Li Bupang.

290
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,830
I know her very well.

291
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,430
If it's hard for you,

292
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,710
I can help you talk to her.

293
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,190
Why didn't you say so earlier?

294
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,430
You didn't ask me.

295
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,190
I heard you almost

296
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,830
risked your life for Li Bupang.

297
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,070
Don't listen to someone's nonsense.

298
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,590
Who is talking nonsense?

299
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,230
Who?

300
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,960
Who is talking nonsense?

301
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:10,990
How about this?

302
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,350
I'll talk to her.

303
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,630
Whether or not you can see her is up to her.

304
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,470
Okay?

305
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,470
Thank you.

306
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,110
You are...

307
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,660
Li Bupang?

308
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,590
Manager Zhen.

309
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,430
You should have told me earlier that you know Mr. Lin.

310
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,750
We could have met earlier.

311
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,880
Nice to meet you.

312
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,230
I'm not a manager.

313
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,070
Just call me Gaogui.

314
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,310
By the way,

315
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,230
last time at the camping park,

316
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,830
I saw someone behind the car,

317
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,470
and I thought it was a stalker fan,

318
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,190
so I quickly left.

319
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,380
I'm really sorry about that.

320
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,430
Even bloggers have stalker fans now.

321
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,190
Exactly.

322
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,500
By the way, how did you know Mr. Lin?

323
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,510
We were roommates abroad.

324
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,590
No wonder you two are so close.

325
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,350
If it weren't for Mr. Lin these years,

326
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,870
I wouldn't be who I am now.

327
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,640
I was in trouble a couple of years ago

328
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,310
and couldn't even afford the rent.

329
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,920
It was Mr. Lin who helped me get through that difficult time.

330
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,330
For the sake of our relationship,

331
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,490
I had to come to see you.

332
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,430
So that means

333
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,870
we can really work together?

334
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,230
Great. Thank you so much.

335
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,440
About the cooperation,

336
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,990
I've read the proposal.

337
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,310
It's really good.

338
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,470
But I'm sorry.

339
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,470
It's just that I've always promoted

340
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,110
not cooperating with PR companies

341
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,610
and not accepting advertising fees.

342
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,490
That's how I get fans' support.

343
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,350
If our cooperation succeeds,

344
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,350
my image will be ruined.

345
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,030
Can't you consider it?

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,310
I'm really sorry.

347
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,110
But in the future,

348
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,950
if there are other types of cooperation,

349
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,510
we can still discuss it.

350
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,590
Okay.

351
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,580
Thank you for coming to meet me today.

352
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,350
How was the talk?

353
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,490
It's not going to work.

354
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,990
She refused to cooperate.

355
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,790
Is it that your negotiation skills are not good enough?

356
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,230
I don't think so.

357
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,110
I think she's a nice person.

358
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,540
Probably because we have different concepts of cooperation.

359
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,070
Snacks cooperation.

360
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,540
So many.

361
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,740
All individual bloggers,

362
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,800
I have a friend from a PR company

363
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,650
who is seeking snack cooperation.

364
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,470
Come on.

365
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,660
This friend is really reliable

366
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,990
and worth working with.

367
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,080
I'll share her name card in the group chat.

368
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,590
Who are you texting? You're so obsessed.

369
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,430
Many food bloggers added me on WeChat.

370
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,630
I can't even keep up.

371
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,820
By the way, I went to see Li Bupang.

372
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,990
And I came to thank you.

373
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,600
So you two have successfully cooperated?

374
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,800
Not with Li Bupang,

375
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,190
but she recommended these bloggers to me.

376
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,500
This weekend,

377
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,650
can you do me a favor?

378
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,960
Practice badminton with me.

379
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,470
Why do you suddenly want to exercise?

380
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,109
Here's the thing.

381
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,990
I made an appointment with Director Lu from Meton

382
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,240
to play badminton as a team.

383
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,990
I don't want to embarrass myself in front of her.

384
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,270
You two...

385
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,630
This is the hotel address.

386
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,760
Don't be late.

387
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,990
Okay, see you this weekend.

388
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,970
Mrs. Zhen, I bought you some fruits.

389
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,370

390
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,790
let me tell you something.

391
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,660
Gaogui went on a date with someone else.

392
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,720
Hold on.

Mrs. Zhen, I won't go in.

396
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,790
You came right after she left.

397
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,940
Hello, Mr. Lin.

398
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,610
Sir.

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,120
How can I help you?

400
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,310
No, I live here.

Yes, I live here.

Sir,

406
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,550
please show me your room card.

407
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,480
Only the guest can enter, right?

408
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,070
Yes.

409
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,750
If you forgot it,

410
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,270
you can tell me your room number and name.

411
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,670
Oh, I forgot it.

412
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,640
Wait a minute.

413
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,230
Okay.

414
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,230
Can you get a room for me?

415

Hold on.

No, I'm not a thief.

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,380
I can explain it, bro.

You think you can meet the manager as you want?

I'll call the police.

Hello, receptionist.

Mr. Lin, I caught two thieves.

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,030
No big deal.

00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,030
He's my friend.

00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,300
It's okay.

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,310
What happened?

00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,170
Let him go.

476
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,210
Let's go.

477
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,470
Worried about me?

478
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,630
You're worried about me, so you climbed to the wall to see me?

479
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,550
What?

480
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,310
Are you a human camera?

481
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,990
I think you're mocking me.

482
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,230
Is it polite for you to mock Party A like this?

483
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,510
Didn't you say that

484
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,430
Party A has friends too,

485
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,030
and Party A is also human?

486
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,070
Now,

487
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,790
I'm just here as a friend

488
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,510
smiling at you nicely

489
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,470
and telling you to be careful when climbing.

490
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,190
Let me tell you seriously.

491
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,670
This thing is between you, me,

492
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,380
and the two of them.

493
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,750
Why did you come to me?

494
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,920
I came to see what you two are doing here.

495
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,780
What can we do?

496
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,400
You...

497
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,350
What can you do in the hotel?

498
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,380
We're here to play badminton.

499
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,230
I came to have a meeting with you.

500
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,030
You didn't answer my call.

501
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,310
So I climbed up to check on you.

502
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,420
But how did you know I'm here?

503
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,990
Did Lin Yue tell you?

504
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,990
Not really.

505
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,680
I was just passing by

506
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,310
and saw you two coming in.

507
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,310
By coincidence?

508
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,990
Yes, it is.

509
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,990
Totally.

510
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,470
What a coincidence.

511
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,980
My mom sent me a message saying that

512
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,750
you came to my house.

513
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,550
Let me buy you a drink.

514
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,540
I have something to tell you.

515
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,950
Let's go.

516
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,190
I'd like a drink without alcohol.

517
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,360
This one is for the lady.

518
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,470
I told you.

519
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,310
I have to apologize to you

520
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,300
for the camping park.

521
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,470
You've climbed the wall to apologize.

522
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,710
It's inappropriate if I don't forgive you.

523
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,430
Isn't the project progress

524
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,270
in the company going well recently?

525
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,670
It's going quite well.

526
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,730
Whether it goes well or not, I have to solve it myself.

527
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,010
You can't help.

528
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,230
After all, it's my job.

529
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,030
Does your work includes playing badminton with Lin Yue?

530
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,710
It's not that I want to play with him.

531
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,710
I'm just his practice partner.

532
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,790
He actually wants to play with someone else.

533
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,230
Someone else? Who?

534
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,910
You know, someone

535
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,470
who sits right in front

536
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,750
but you can't take a step forward.

537
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,740
Who sits right in front

538
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,290
but you can't take a step

539
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,190
forward?

540
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,510
Who sits right in front

541
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,500
but you can't take a step forward.

542
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,000
Who...

543
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,230
You and Zhen Gaogui are here to practice?

544
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,030
Yes.

545
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,670
I don't want to embarrass myself playing with you next time.

546
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,390
You came here to play badminton.

547
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,750
Why do you need a room to rest?

548
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,230
This is my home.

549
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,490
Your home?

550
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,990
Don't just stand there.

551
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,670
Take a seat.

552
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,170
Here's the thing.

553
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,990
I often go on business trips

554
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,990
and can't stay in one place for long,

555
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,310
so I usually rent a room in a hotel.

556
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,240
After seeing enough of the scenery in one place,

557
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,220
I'll move on to the next one.

558
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,190
And there's everything in the hotel.

559
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,470
There are people helping me clean up.

560
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,430
It's so convenient.

561
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,750
Well,

562
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
you must have something you want to keep.

563
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,310
Where do you put them?

564
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,430
There's nothing I need to keep.

565
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,540
All the important documents are in the office.

566
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,470
The rest

567
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,630
are in my mind.

568
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,700
The meaning of things to us

569
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,910
is just memories and feelings.

570
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,570
I don't need to see them every day.

571
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,270
So this is the most popular

572
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,430
minimalist style?

573
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,190
My home can be considered minimalist.

574
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,490
But I'm not.

575
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,070
Let me get you a pair of slippers.

576
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,420
Don't bother.

577
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,280
This is my home.

578
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,460
You can't go to someone else's home without changing shoes.

579
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:35,790
Here.

580
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,000
Thank you.

581
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,190
Is this

582
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,630
your first time watching it?

583
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,870
I'm usually too busy with work.

584
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,980
I've never turned on my TV.

585
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,780
Let's start with the first episode.

586
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,790
No.

587
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,610
You've watched the first episode, right?

588
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,960
But I haven't watch it with you.

589
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,510
Is the road difficult today?

590
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,710
Why are you riding so slowly?

591
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,430
It doesn't matter if the road is easy or not.

592
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,330
What matters is I want to ride slowly now.

593
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,340
Do you feel anxious when you work?

594
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,300
Yes.

595
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,820
It's also a part of life.

596
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,950
It's like riding a bike.

597
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,070
Going uphill is difficult,

598
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,230
so you'll realize how comfortable and precious

599
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,470
the flat road is.

600
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,230
Actually, before I started working,

601
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,950
I thought my life could only be like this.

602
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,990
But recently,

603
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,230
this anxiety is actually reassuring.

604
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,990
It's like the tingling in my mouth

605
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,420
after eating chili.

606
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,990
This spice is great.

607
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,710
It makes me

608
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,590
look forward more to tomorrow.

609
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,000
It's already over 1 a.m.

610
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,250
I usually go to bed at 12 p.m.

611
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,180
Just be a rebellious girl for today.

612
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,840
This is a drawing of me.

613
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,380
So cute.

614
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,470
Can I have this?

615
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,140
Not the iPad.

616
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,680
You can have the drawing.

617
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,670
I need to adjust some details.

618
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,550
I'll send it to you later.

619
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:44,710
Okay.

620
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,990
I'm leaving.

621
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,550
Let's go. I'll walk you out.

622
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,740
On no.

623
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,360
I ruined my image in front of a girl today.

624
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,740
Tell me your embarrassing story

625
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,930
and make me happy.

626
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,030
No way.

627
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,790
The result of your new challenge is out?

628
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,390
You'll know tomorrow.

629
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,550
What an unlucky day.

630
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,450
I went out early in the morning,

631
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,400
but the bus broke down halfway.

632
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,930
So I decided to take a taxi,

633
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,230
but there was a traffic jam.

634
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,030
Just a few minutes late,

635
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,230
and the whole morning was in vain.

636
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,430
I bought it this morning but didn't drink it.

637
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,950
Consider it a treat.

638
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,400
Thank you.

639
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,710
Once I drink this coffee,

640
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,550
all negative energy will be gone.

641
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,170
Ju Ran is in a good mood this morning.

642
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,630
Right.

643
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,940
The result of

644
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,190
the Meton project is coming out today.

645
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,690
Gaogui, how are you preparing?

646
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,730
Not bad.

647
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,880
Even if we combine our resources,

648
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,210
we can't compete with Ju Ran.

649
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,880
Is there any project she can't get?

650
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,150
That's true.

651
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,060
Don't worry.

652
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,190
Zhen Gaogui is excellent too.

653
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,730
Let's see what boss says in the meeting.

654
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,950
By the way, I'm treating everyone to lunch today.

655
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,210
Let's celebrate in advance.

656
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,150
Gaogui.

657
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,500
You should come too.

658
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,470
Thank you.

659
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,950
Today, Xinda PR notified us that they'll

660
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,550
confirm the final content cooperation and plan.

661
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,630
You seem more anxious than them.

662
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,770
For such an important project,

663
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,790
of course, I have to be more cautious.

664
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,000
Such an important project.

665
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,980
You starts to be cautious today?

666
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,230
You're worried

667
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,030
whether Zhen Gaogui will come, right?

668
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,710
As for the theme of today's meeting,

669
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,510
I'm sure you all know that.

670
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,740
It's about

671
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,710
the resources competition

672
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,030
between Ju Ran and Zhen Gaogui.

673
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,150
I've reviewed your proposals.

674
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,390
The resources Ju Ran provided are really good.

675
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,550
She's confirmed cooperations with several major

676
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,070
multi-channel network companies.

677
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,430
In this case,

678
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,470
Ju Ran's advantage is greater than Zhen Gaogui's.

679
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:05,990
Boss.

680
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,470
Hurry up and announce the result.

681
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,950
Mr. Zhong, here's your package.

682
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,230
Thank you.

683
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,270
Did I come at the wrong time?

684
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,830
No, not at all.

685
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,640
What now?

686
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,190
But...

687
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,400
Zhen Gaogui found another way out.

688
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,840
Look, the total price of the quotation from the companies

689
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,860
Ju Ran contacted is 500,000,

690
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,510
while Zhen Gaogui's quotation is 200,000.

691
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,300
Although Zhen Gaogui doesn't have

692
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,520
♫We won't fall♫

693
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,270

♫Gently and firmly♫

699
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,950

♫We're getting closer♫

701
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,650

The stars all the way down the palm

to be in charge of the promotion plan

709
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,710

You've surpassed Ju Ran so quickly.

719
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,070
Actually, I'm quite surprised too.

720
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,080
♫That's you♫

721
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,230

♫You're an expected surprise♫

723
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,790
You've only been here for a few days,

724
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,909
and now you're working on a big project.

725
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,030
I have to learn from you in the future.

726
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,030
Zhen Gaogui.

727
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
With such a comprehensive project,

728
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,350
you will encounter many challenges in the future.

729
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,630
If you need any help,

730
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,150
just let me know.

731
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,219
Thank you.

732
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,610
Actually, there's still a lot I should learn from you.

733
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,070
Ju Ran.

734
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,110
For this project,

735
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,510
you should work together with Gaogui.

736
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,469
Gaogui is a newcomer

737
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,030
with innovative thinking,

738
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,550
and the two of you can

739
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,670
complement each other.

740
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,750
Boss,

741
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:44,150
I can handle it on my own.

742
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,790
You're welcome.

743
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,000
We are colleagues.

744
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,070
I'll do whatever the boss says.

745
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,489
Thank you.

746
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,990
It's a tough battle ahead.

747
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,540
Do your best.
