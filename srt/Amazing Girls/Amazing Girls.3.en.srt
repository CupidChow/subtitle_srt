When we have enough money,

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,350
should we buy curtains first

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,520
or install an air conditioner first?

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,670
You're thinking too much.

They were first sent to the mansion we used to live in.

See?

37
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,220
So the new landlord sent them here.

It seems these things

41
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,430
were sent to us as gifts by those stores

42
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,890
because we have their loyalty cards.

43
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,150
Really?

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,780
Whatever. Let's see what these things are first.

45
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,830
Looks like these things are not very useful for us now.

46
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,150
There is a gift card from Xidedeng Hotel.

47
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,039
With it, we can live in the hotel for three days and two nights for free.

we can go to this five-star hotel.

This is really a good thing.

It's the limited edition perfume I ordered before.

I've been waiting for it for six months.

How much can we sell it for?

58
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,660
Mom, I won't give it to you.

Okay.

68
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,480
Coco sent these gifts because she

wanted to collaborate...

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,710
I'm the one who will decide whether to collaborate with her or not.

00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,940
[Meton Food Co., LTD]

190
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,580
Come in.

191
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,640
Yesterday, I saw

192
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,310
Zhong Yiming and the girl from Xinda PR

193
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,990
messing around in the office.

194
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,690
He's such a disappointment.

195
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,010
If he takes charge of the company,

196
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,750
he'll only use his power to flirt with girls.

197
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,410
I hope he won't ruin the company.

198
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,410
After all, we've been working for the company for so many years.

199
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,480
We're like a family.

200
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,280
We'd better solve the problem quickly.

201
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,390
How about we just let him ruin himself?

202
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,270
Since Mr. Zhong Jr. likes playing with fire,

203
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,650
we can get him to make more mistakes

204
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,580
so that he will be in a less favorable position.

205
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,830
Then Mr. Zhong

206
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,060
will have to make up his mind

207
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,310
to get Mr. Zhong Jr. replaced.

208
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,790
Director Lu.

209
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,400
Zhen Gaogui, Mr. Zhong has been waiting for you for long.

210
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,240
-Really?
-Yes.

211
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,920
Mr. Zhong.

212
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,930
What are you two...

213
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,040
Well...

214
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,620
The sample snacks I took back last time

215
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,220
got lost by accident.

216
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,980
So I came to get some snacks again.

217
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,450
You can just ask me

218
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,690
for the sample snacks.

219
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,060
But I think you and Mr. Zhong should talk more.

220
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,580
Mr. Zhong has got many ideas.

221
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,980
Others may not be able to understand them.

222
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,630
It would be great if you two

223
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,300
have a brainstorm together.

224
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,090
What do you think?

225
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,370
I agree.

226
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,450
I agree.

227
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,130
Then...

228
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,070
Do you think the time is enough?

229
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,820
Yes. It's enough.

230
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,820
If you need more time,

231
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,340
I can make more adjustments to the schedule.

232
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,610
No need.

233
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,210
Okay, you two can start now.

234
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,450
Bye, Director Lu.

235
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,090
Bye.

236
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,950
[Meeting Room]

237
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,460
I've prepared three proposals.

238
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,090
Please check them, Mr. Zhong.

239
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,830
The promotion is for the Mid-Autumn Festival, not Valentine's Day.

240
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,890
This theme is "Popcorn Makes Your Fear Disappear".

241
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,330
No.

242
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,650
What's the problem?

243
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,250
Tell me. We can fix it.

244
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,770
Is there anything wrong with the font,

245
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,950
the size or the color?

246
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,050
Let me show you some cases.

247
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,610
Mr. Zhong, I'm thirsty.

248
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,160
Is there a coffee machine in the company?

249
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,660
You came to work for me,

250
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,970
not to be a guest.

251
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,620
Ju Ran.

252
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,220
Our client

253
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,460
is very satisfied with your proposal.

254
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,800
Thank you for your hard work these days.

255
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,220
They like the idea

256
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,240
that the new milk

257
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,430
should be put near the French art decorations

258
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,350
on the counter.

259
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm happy that they like it.

260
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,360
Why are you laughing?

261
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,940
Have you finished the proposal for Meton?

262
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,580
I worked overnight to help Ju Ran

263
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,720
make the proposal you just mentioned.

264
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,870
Yes.

265
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,940
Ju Ran and I stayed up all night to revise the proposal.

266
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,970
Gaogui was also there.

267
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,130
So we asked her to help us a little.

268
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,220
She learned from us.

269
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,100
We should praise her for that.

270
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,090
Right, Gaogui?

271
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,930
Yes.

272
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,340
Then Lele and Ju Ran left.

273
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,220
I finished the rest of the proposal alone.

274
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,680
Yes, we asked Gaogui to check

275
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,660
if there were any spelling mistakes in the end.

276
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,570
Good.

277
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,630
You should continue

278
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,460
to learn from Lele and Ju Ran.

279
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,970
It will help you improve your work.

280
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,460
All right, keep working.

281
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,770
Yes, Boss.

282
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,970
If I hadn't maintained a good relationship with the client,

283
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,760
and revised the plan according to his feedback at that time,

284
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,580
your proposal wouldn't have been passed so quickly.

285
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,860
Gao.

286
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,080
As a more experienced person,

287
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,330
I should tell you sincerely,

288
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,370
keep modest,

289
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,710
and do not take all the credit.

290
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,850
Got it?

291
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,320
Got it, Ju Ran.

292
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,700
[Pantry]

293
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,200
It's ridiculous.

294
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,790
I worked all night to make that proposal

295
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,300
but gained no recognition for it at all.

296
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,060
I told you.

297
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,340
In the workplace,

298
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,940
you either fight for yourself or quit.

299
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,490
No one can stay out of it.

300
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,410
Well, I didn't know

301
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,090
they could be so mean.

302
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,030
There are many other things you don't know.

303
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,380
The world is dangerous.

304
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,670
Wish you good luck.

305
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,960
So

306
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,200
though Mr. Zhong looks like the worst man,

307
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,860
he may not necessarily be the most horrible man.

308
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,210
Mr. Zhong.

309
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,250
Do you think my market analysis is right?

310
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,220
I think

311
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,820
Meiziwei Group

312
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,320
is making Meton popcorn

313
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,440
reach the low-end market.

314
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,030
You're right. I agree with you.

315
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,860
Why are you suddenly so humble and eager to learn?

316
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,540
Have you adjusted your approach?

317
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,480
You're a client that I have to serve well.

318
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,100
This is my last chance to prove myself at my company.

319
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:05,940
Look.

320
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,660
I think their popcorn

321
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,800
can try to reach this market.

322
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,400
[Mom]

323
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,890
Wait a minute.

324
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,670
Hello, Mom.

325
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,930
What?

326
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,810
Okay. I'll be right there.

327
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,490
Well...

328
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,620
Mr. Zhong, I have something important to do.

329
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,770
I have to leave right now.

330
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,470
Bye.

331
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,210
Is it an urgent matter?

332
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,230
Let me give you a ride. Let's go.

333
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,670
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

334
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,130
Miss, is this it?

335
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,710
You're new here. How dare you steal from our customer?

336
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,820
I didn't.

337
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,890
We've found the evidence. How can you still deny it?

338
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,750
It's you who stole it.

339
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,940
How can you say it's me?

340
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,690
Give me an explanation as soon as possible.

341
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,070
I don't want to waste my time here.

342
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,340
Boss, let me explain.

343
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,820
I really don't know why

344
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,100
it was in my bag.

345
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,050
I didn't steal it.

346
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,079
Here.

347
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,109
I didn't steal it. I didn't steal it.

348
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,040
Stop. Let's go to the police station.

349
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,710
What are you doing?

350
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,980
How can you call my mom a thief?

351
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,930
Do you have any evidence?

352
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,460
See for yourself.

353
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,970
This customer left her phone on the table.

354
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,020
Miss.

355
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,740
I didn't frame your mother.

356
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,190
Only Panpan and Qin Fenfang

357
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,500
passed by the table.

358
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,319
When I said I would search their bags,

359
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,589
your mother agreed.

360
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,900
The customer's phone was found in your mom's bag.

361
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,400
Did the phone

362
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,420
go into your bag by itself?

363
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,540
How would I know?

364
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,110
Didn't you say

365
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,750
you were a full-time housewife

366
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,720
who never did any household chores

367
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,560
but now you have little money and are in debt.

368
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,660
You must feel very tired in working here

369
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,380
so you want to steal something

370
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,650
to make your life easier.

371
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,260
How could you say that?

372
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,990
Stop.

373
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,900
Call the police.

374
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,420
Let the police handle it.

375
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,620
I don't want to wait anymore.

376
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,930
Let them call the police. We did nothing wrong.

377
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,780
Wait.

378
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
Boss, can you come with me?

379
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,070
Who are you?

380
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,730
I can help you solve the problem.

381
00:17:59,170 --> 00:17:59,610
Let's go.

382
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,710
Can I see the video recorded by the surveillance camera in front of the dressing room?

383
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,620
The surveillance camera has been broken for days.

384
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,800
I haven't had time to get it fixed.

385
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,070
That means if someone

386
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,870
really framed up the girl's mom,

387
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,130
we cannot fine the evidence?

388
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,970
Then there's nothing we can do.

389
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,540
Let the police handle it.

390
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,220
Wait.

391
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,370
I notice the camera's indicator light is on.

392
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,310
I happen to know how to fix the surveillance camera.

393
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,420
Let me see if I can

394
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,190
get the video recorded by the broken camera.

395
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,360
That would be great.

396
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,540
The monitoring room is over there. Follow me.

397
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Okay, I'll go with you.

398
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,290
[Monitoring Room]

399
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,850
The real thief will be found.

400
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,760
Is it her?

401
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:57,940
Where are you going?

402
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,140
I'm not feeling well. I want to go home and rest.

403
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,050
It won't take much time. Wait here.

404
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,740
You can go later.

405
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,370
We know who the real thief is.

406
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,780
The evidence is here.

407
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,300
But we want to

408
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,410
give the thief a chance to confess.

409
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,590
If the thief confesses,

410
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,730
we'll solve the problem here.

411
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,460
Right, Boss?

412
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,250
If the thief doesn't confess,

413
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,520
we'll let the police handle it.

414
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,700
I confess.

415
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,540
It's her.

416
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,300
How come she did it?

417
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,980
I took the phone.

418
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,280
Sorry, Miss.

419
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,740
I shouldn't have taken your phone.

420
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,660
I'm really sorry.

421
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,260
Please.

422
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,940
Don't call the police.

423
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,290
Tell us more details.

424
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,600
At first,

425
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,360
I saw the customer's phone on the table.

426
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,780
I knew the surveillance camera was broken.

427
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
So I took it away and thought that no one would find out.

428
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,620
But the customer came back so soon to look for it.

429
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,410
Then Boss said she would search our bags.

430
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,900
When I was getting my bag,

431
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,950
I put the phone in Qin Fenfang's bag.

432
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,940
I know the surveillance camera in front of the dressing room

433
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,220
was broken.

434
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,850
So I thought it's impossible that the camera would film how I put the phone.

435
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,450
I didn't expect a computer expert would come here today.

436
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,700
I'm sorry, Fenfang.

437
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,410
I shouldn't have framed you up.

438
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,240
Panpan.

439
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,630
Wait for me in my office.

440
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,370
Mom, let's go home.

441
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,750
-All right, it's all settled. Guys, please leave.
-Fenfang.

442
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,700
Let's go to my office with this customer.

443
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,410
Let's go.

444
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,420
I'll wait you here.

445
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,450
You're amazing.

446
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,590
I didn't know you were a hacker.

447
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,130
Actually, I don't know how to fix a surveillance camera.

448
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,640
It's my little trick.

449
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,110
I told the boss

450
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,610
I knew how to get the thief to confess.

451
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,670
Boss, actually, I don't know how to fix it.

452
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,450
I've got an idea. Let's pretend

453
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,690
we've found the evidence.

454
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,540
So you didn't fix the camera?

455
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,040
You're so cunning.

456
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,620
What?

457
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,810
I proved your mom's innocence.

458
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,850
How can you use such a word to describe me?

459
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,620
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,940
That's not what I meant.

461
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,280
I mean

462
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,220
you're so smart.

463
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,330
Whatever. Save your compliment.

464
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,370
Mom.

465
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,810
Actually, in the end

466
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,400
the surveillance camera was not fixed.

467
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,690
Man, you're amazing.

468
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,150
But for you,

469
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,540
they would have

470
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,050
sent me to the police station today.

471
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,740
-Thank you so much.
-It’s okay.

472
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,950
You didn't do the bad thing.

473
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,460
So you won't be punished.

474
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:23,970
That's right.

475
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,740
What do you do?

476
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,620
He's my recent client.

477
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,090
You must be busy.

478
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,740
Sorry you spent so much time

479
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,290
in helping me today.

480
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,190
It's okay.

481
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,780
Zhen Gaogui can finish my work.

482
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,330
Okay, I know.

483
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,040
I have to go now.

484
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,420
Thank you.

485
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,460
Take care.

486
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,860
Usually, he is difficult to get along with.

487
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,180
But today, he was being really smart.

488
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,460
Director Lu.

489
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,130
You want to see me?

490
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,380
What can I do for you?

491
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,460
Why isn't he answering my phone?

492
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,670
The meeting is at two.

493
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,900
Where did he go?

494
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,180
I've been working for the company for so many years.

495
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,490
I've never been late.

496
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,180
Don't worry.

497
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,020
You go first.

498
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,620
I'll keep calling him.

499
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,280
Until he answers.

500
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,100
Yes, madam.

501
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,960
How can you take the parking spot in that way?

502
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,790
Didn't you see

503
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,260
I was going the park my care there?

504
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,580
First come, first served.

505
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,960
It's not your private parking spot.

506
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,860
Why are you in such a hurry?

507
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,740
Are you going upstairs to maintain world peace?

508
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,170
I didn't expect you to be so petty.

509
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,730
I took your parking spot,

510
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,610
and you stopped me from taking the elevator.

511
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
That is not your private elevator.

512
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,210
If you feel bored,

513
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,980
why don't you go maintain world peace?

514
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
What's the point of wasting time with me?

515
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,630
You've misunderstood.

516
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,320
There was a person with BO in the elevator.

517
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,370
I didn't want you to smell that.

518
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,470
It's not a big deal. You just need to wait for another elevator.

519
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,160
Nothing will be there waiting for you forever.

520
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,110
This is true for opportunities and positions.

521
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,760
It's not too late for you

522
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,900
to learn this.

523
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,220
If others can take something away from you,

524
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,590
it means that thing doesn't belong to you.

525
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,980
I guess

526
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,480
you know this.

527
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,970
My time is precious.

528
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,210
I cannot waste it on you.

529
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,890
I'll take the stairs.

530
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,550
Take the stairs?

531
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,380
Are you sure? Which floor are you going to?

532
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,180
The eighteenth.

533
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,130
That's too much walking.

534
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,710
You'd better take the elevator.

535
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,180
No need.

536
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,890
I... I was just kidding.

537
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,630
What do you think of your proposal?

538
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,770
You really think it's very good?

539
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,030
Yes.

540
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,350
Your proposal is full of problems. It's no match for others' proposals.

541
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,190
Even an intern at other companies

542
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,420
can do much better than you,

543
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,650
let alone those experienced workers.

544
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,750
Revise it.

545
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,450
I still have time.

546
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,820
I can make it in time.

547
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,780
Mom, I'm back.

548
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,340
Mom.

549
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,660
You must be tired.

550
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,110
You must be tired, dear.

551
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,940
I'll make something delicious for you today.

552
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,080
I'll cook

553
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,040
braised noodles with egg for you.

554
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,700
Mom.

555
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,090
The delicious food is braised noodles?

556
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,860
Well, I'll make you braised noodles with egg.

557
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,260
You loved it very much when you were a kid.

558
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,770
Well,

559
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,050
I do feel like eating it now.

560
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,820
Let me cook for you then.

561
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,460
Mom.

562
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,240
You've been working so hard.

563
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,900
I should also work hard.

564
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,810
I'll treat you to braised noodles at the restaurant in the future.

565
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,290
I also want to eat spicy chicken.

566
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,650
Okay, let me cook now.

567
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,420
Just wait.

568
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,890
Gaogui.

569
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,690
-Mom.
-Get the extinguisher!

570
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,580
Mom!

571
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,060
Hurry!

572
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,730
Mom.

573
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,260
Okay, I've received it.

574
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,530
Why is it so expensive to repair the cooker?

575
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,340
I've replaced the old parts

576
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,780
with new ones.

577
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,620
They are not expensive.

578
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,730
Ju Ran.

579
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,250
I've brought all your parcels.

580
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,540
By the way,

581
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,220
can you send me the proposals

582
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,130
you used to make? I want to refer to them.

583
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,580
Sure.

584
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,540
Thank you.

585
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,740
Lele.

586
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,060
Your milk tea.

587
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,040
Boss said you made

588
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,660
some market analyses about snacks before.

589
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,040
Can you send them to me? I want to refer to them.

590
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,460
I'll send them to you later.

591
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,020
Thank you.

592
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,520
This is your favorite iced Americano.

593
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,220
You want the materials?

594
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,400
You've been working hard lately.

595
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,540
How can I become a regular employee if I don't work hard?

596
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,470
I've been working very hard at the company for so many years.

597
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,740
You've become so diligent all of a sudden.

598
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,420
You make me look like I'm not working hard enough now.

599
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,460
What should I do?

600
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,350
Do me a favor, please.

601
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,500
Here.

602
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,420
Thank you.

603
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,700
Your proposal has improved.

604
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,970
But let's put it aside for now.

605
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,170
Take a look at this.

606
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,480
Look at your attendance records.

607
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,500
I punch in every workday.

608
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,600
There are no records

609
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,260
of last night and this morning.

610
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,260
You're new at our company. What do you mean by doing it?

611
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,090
Did I have to punch in even if I didn't leave the company?

612
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,600
You didn't leave last night?

613
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,130
I was revising the proposal.

614
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,900
It's just a proposal for a client.

615
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,670
You don't have to work that hard.

616
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:34,770
Boss.

617
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,910
You know it.

618
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,640
I really need this client.

619
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,420
I know.

620
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,180
Though you have just one client today,

621
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,810
but you'll have many more clients in the future.

622
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,450
And you'll have many bosses.

623
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,180
But now this is the only chance I got.

624
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,740
-If I don't do it well, I will...
-What?

625
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,860
Nothing.

626
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,180
I just want to work hard for our company.

627
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,580
You're going to show your proposal to our client.

628
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,600
I'll talk to you about the details.

629
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,820
Thank you, Boss.

630
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,520
Get yourself a formal outfit.

631
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,570
Don't wear casual clothes when presenting your proposal.

632
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,330
Gaogui.

633
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,700
Long time no see.

634
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,540
I thought you were staying abroad and would never come back.

635
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,260
I am back.

636
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,640
Lili.

637
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,530
Come here.

638
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,260
This is Gaogui.

639
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,410
She's one of my old friends and my regular customers.

640
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,420
-Hello.
-Hello.

641
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,730
Just like you,

642
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,070
I couldn't meet the sales target when I first worked here

643
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,910
and got scolded by the leader at night.

644
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,740
That day, Gaogui

645
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,500
bought several new outfits.

646
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,970
She said she wanted to help me meet the sales target.

647
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,060
But for her,

648
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,500
I wouldn't have what I have now.

649
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,020
Everyone can be lucky and unlucky.

650
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,330
We need to help each other.

651
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,490
Then let me show you

652
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,770
the best outfit in our shop.

653
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,260
No, thanks. I'm just taking a walk.

654
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,300
See you.

655
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,200
Gaogui.

656
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,710
Are you short of money?

657
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,500
Yes.

658
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,860
Come.

659
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,980
Lili, get her some water.

660
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,510
Okay.

661
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,900
How about you try it on?

662
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,690
You can take it home and wear it first.

663
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,360
It can be returned within a week.

664
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,470
Just keep the price tag.

665
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,500
It really suits you.

666
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,090
Really?

667
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,900
I'll tell you if there's a new outfit you may like next time.

668
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,890
You are the best.

669
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,950
Take it.

670
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,240
Take care.

671
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:22,890
Bye.

672
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,730
See you.

673
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,060
The wage slave will do something big tomorrow. It'll be my first time to do it.

674
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,660
Wish me good luck.

675
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:36,940
I know it's very important to you,

676
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
but don't be too nervous.

677
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,910
It's difficult not to be nervous.

678
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,450
This time, I can only succeed.

679
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,500
Mr. Zhong has invited everyone

680
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,930
to see the proposals this time.

681
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,950
He will cause trouble one day.

682
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,050
If he causes a big trouble,

683
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,290
I'll also be in trouble.

684
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,800
We've been working with Wisdom PR for so long.

685
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,220
If he really picks

686
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,490
one of the other agencies this time,

687
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,380
what am I going to do about the connections that I've maintained

688
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,080
for years?

689
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,910
Mr. Zhong is here.

690
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,260
Let's see their proposals first.

691
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,160
Let's begin.

692
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,510
[Mid-Autumn Festival and Meton Popcorn]

693
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:22,920
Hello, everyone.

694
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,590
I'll show you the proposal done by Wisdom PR.

695
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,870
Wisdom PR has collaborated with Meton Popcorn for so many times.

696
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,530
We know your company

697
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,000
very well.

698
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,500
There are three key points

699
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,980
in my proposal for the Mid-Autumn Festival campaign.

700
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,300
Please take a look.

701
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,740
This is my proposal.

702
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,580
Thank you.

703
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,520
I think Wisdom PR's idea

704
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,530
is really good.

705
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,640
Yes.

706
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,020
But let's see

707
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,260
if other PR agencies have any new ideas.

708
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,210
Okay, next.

709
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,630
Hello, everyone.

710
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,130
I'm Zhen Gaogui from Xinda PR.

711
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,300
When making the proposal for the Mid-Autumn Festival campaign,

712
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,740
I referred to the campaigns

713
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,550
done by some foreign snack brands.

714
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,860
I made a summary of them and finished my proposal.

715
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,260
The elements of fairy tales and the traditional festival are combined.

716
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,630
So the campaign will be more sophisticated and modern.

717
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,060
This is

718
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,340
my proposal.

719
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,270
Thank you.

720
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,389
Xinda PR's proposal

721
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,659
is very interesting and unique.

722
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:37,739
Really?

723
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,090
Maybe it's because I am old.

724
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,380
I think there's a big difference between our ways of thinking.

725
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,090
I cannot understand it at all.

726
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,949
It's ridiculous.

727
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,250
Do you have anything to say

728
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,400
as to which proposal we should choose?

729
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,380
How about this?

730
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,610
Let's vote.

731
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,710
Let's do it anonymously.

732
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,220
Just choose the PR agency you think is the best.

733
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,200
Everyone has one vote.

734
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,260
It's fair.

735
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,590
And it saves time.

736
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,370
Take out your phones

737
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,740
and use the mini program for anonymous voting.

738
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,300
Okay?

739
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,030
Okay.

740
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,830
