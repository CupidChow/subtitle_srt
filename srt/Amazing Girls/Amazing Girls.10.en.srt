Thank you.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,560
I've only heard that this guy was popular online.

12

I didn't expect that he is more charming in person.

13

He is as great as Mr. Zhong of Meton.

Mr. Lin, would you give an interview, please?

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,460

Actually, I'm not as mature as you think.

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:42,080

that you are dating an employee

Well,

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,640
how about taking the opportunity

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,460
to celebrate together with us today?

42
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,180
Well, wait a second.

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,240
I do have a girlfriend.

44
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,420
But both of us chose

45
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,740
not to make it public.

46
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,200
Mr. Lin,

47
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,780
I think as a man,

48
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,350
a responsible man,

49
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,900
you wouldn't want to disappoint

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,630

51
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,270
Please be honest with me.

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,460
Is your girlfriend

54
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,430
Why are you leaving? The exciting part is coming.

55
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,120
Go back.

56
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,640
Mr. Lin is very busy and tired.

57
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,880
If you have any questions,

58
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,579
you can ask me.

59
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,430
Okay. We understand.

60
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,990
Mr. Lin,

61
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,530
We just don't want our colleague to get hurt.

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,570
Yeah.

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,220
Yes.

64
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,360
I had a relationship with Zhen Gaogui.

65
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,280
I knew it.

66
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,640
He did.

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,250
But we've broken up amicably.

68
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Broken up?

69
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,720
Although we are not together anymore,

70
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,910
we'll remain good friends in the future.

71
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,150
But I don't understand

72
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,470
why you insisted on asking about

73
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,329
the relationship we both want to keep private.

74
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,890

75
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,480

77
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,329
will be kind

78
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,750
and won't talk about it anymore.

79
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,550
After all, Zhen Gaogui

80
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,250
is a victim of this relationship.

81
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,010
I hope this won't impair my cooperation

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,320
with Meton Food.

83
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,829
It won't, of course.

84
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,710
Yeah.

85
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,190
Though I was very sad to give up that relationship,

86
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,200
it was all in the past.

87
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,620

94
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,570

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,540
I must help her.

Zhen Gaogui

135
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,110
didn't want gossip about her and me,

136
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,700

if there were rumors about you two,

people would still deny her efforts, right?

141
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,770
That makes sense.

142
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,330
So what do you suggest?

143
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,700
Just say you did have a relationship with her,

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,870
but you broke up already.

145
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,290
That's a good idea.

146
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,360
But why do I feel

147
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,570
that you have some kind of agenda?

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,710
It must be really hard for Gaogui.

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,410
After the breakup,

150
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,760
she has to keep calm

151
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,490
and come to work every day.

152
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,960
If it were me, I wouldn't be able to do it.

153
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,990
I would immediately

154
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,670
have a meltdown.

155
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,570
I think the breakup

156
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,280
has something to do with Meton's Mr. Zhong.

157
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,270
It seems that they're together every day.

158
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:43,720
Something must be going on.

159
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,270
Right.

160
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,600
If she had just broken up,

161
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,990
then…

00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,770

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,710
Well,

170
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,630
is that all you want to tell me?

171
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,240
I need to prepare for today's press releases.

172
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,830
It might be too late after I go back,

173
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,580
so it's better to ask you in person.

174
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,020
You're not going to ask?

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
You don't want to know?

176
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,740
How did you break up with Zhen Gaogui?

177
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,480
Is this the question for your press releases?

But I have something to do later.

192
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,540
I'll take you back later.

193
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,590
Okay.

194
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,350
Let's get changed.

195
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,170
These clothes are not for motorcycle riding.

196
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,800
Didn't you sell your motorcycles?

197
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,210
Where did you get this?

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,840
I got a bonus.

199
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,820
I have to ride my motorcycle.

200
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,830
I used to love traveling.

201
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,410
I've been to many places,

202
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,710
and made video blogs

203
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,330
to share those beautiful sceneries with people.

204
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,510
But since I came back,

205
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,320
I don't have the chance to do that anymore.

206
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,350
You can do it now. I can film it for you.

207
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,010
Here, let me help.

208
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,930
Give me your phone.

209
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,950
I'm filming.

210
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,880
There is nothing to film here.

211
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,390
Here.

212
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:09,920
It's not bad.

213
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,070
Hello, everyone.

214
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,390
I'm Zhong Yiming,

215
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,190
Zhen Gaogui's good friend.

216
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,390
I'd like you to listen to the sound of the wind.

217
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,280
It's the sound of friends from all over the world,

218
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,590
talking to Zhen Gaogui now.

219
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,950
What? Talking to me about what?

220
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,320
They're saying as long as your heart is free,

221
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,600
you can go anywhere you want,

222
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,310
just like the wind.

223
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,280
All right.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,520
- I think I have a talent for making videos. - No.

225
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,670
It's very quirky.

226
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,530
Look at the lake.

227
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,660
It's so big and deep.

228
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Underneath the water, there are piles of sand

229
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,460
and mud that are unseen.

230
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,570
They used to be big rocks.

231
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,600
After so many years,

232
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,760
they've been washed by the water,

233
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,930
and broken into pieces.

234
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:55,990
Well,

235
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,010
they've struggled, haven't they?

236
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,370
You can choose to stay underneath the water,

237
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,870
or flow to faraway places.

238
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,340
I choose faraways places,

239
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,390
of course.

240
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,370
You go somewhere faraway. I go to you.

241
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,960
What's that?

242
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,000
Nothing. I said, "Wait a second."

243
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,130
It's windy today.

244
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,020
It seems that many things in life

245
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,990
are like the wind.

246
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,090
You can't see it clearly.

247
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,020
No, we can't see it clearly.

248
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,660
But we can feel it alright.

249
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,900
Feel it?

250
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,470
What do you feel?

251
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,850
Clouds probably can't understand the wind,

252
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,980
but a person would know

253
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,440
how he feels about another person.

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,610
Mr. Zhong,

255
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,280
when you were a child, have you ever thought about

256
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,650
what you wanted to do when you grew up?

257
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,330
No, I haven't.

258
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,300
You haven't?

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,110
I never think about things in the future.

260
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,660
Unexpected events happen so often in life.

261
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,230
When they happen,

262
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,480
the past and the future become meaningless.

263
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,370
♫If one day♫

264
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,990
I think the present

265
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,890
is what we should cherish most.

266
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,180

267

♫We won't fall♫

270
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,510
Hey, buddy,

271
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,280
I'm not his girlfriend

272

♫We'll fly higher in the sky♫

273
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,070

274
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,300
Brother,

275
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,160
please buy one. It's cheap.

276
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,620
♫Gently and firmly♫

277
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,390
Buddy,

278
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,060
how much do all of these cost?

279
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,250
♫We're getting closer♫

280
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,240
A hundred.

281
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,940
How about I take them all?

282
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,390
♫Farewell to the past, turn around and go♫

283
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,730
Great.

284
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,340
♫To the next destination♫

285
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,830

♫The starlight along the way falls in our palms♫

287

Thank you, brother.

289
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:20,730

♫The wind blows towards the sea♫

291
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,750
That's too much.

292
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,770
A hundred yuan is not nothing.

♫Blowing away all the dark clouds♫

294
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,600
It's a little gift from that boy.

00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Let's go take a look.

304
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,020
♫Beyond the hills and seas♫

305
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,330
Maybe we can expand

306
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,030
the distribution channels for Meton Food.

307
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:00,740
Let's go.

308
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,140
What about these flowers?

309
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,750
They're yours.

310
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,510
Let's go.

311
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,360
[Beluga Friends]

312
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,730
Here we are.

313
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,770
One portion of popcorn, please.

314
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,440
Please scan the code and pay.

315
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,240
How much is it?

316
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,910
Fifteen yuan.

317
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,730
Okay.

318
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,330
Try it, now.

319
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,280
It tastes

320
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,250
stale, not fresh.

321
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,830
It's not good.

322
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,430
The more I eat it, the more

323
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,860
I think Meton Food is becoming a huge success.

324
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,100
I've heard the words "huge success"

325
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,370
when I was a child.

326
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,580
Well, I still need to work hard now.

327
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,380
Mr. Zhong, can I still be part of

328
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,600
the forthcoming projects?

329
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,460
The forthcoming projects

330
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,340
will be talked about later.

331
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,070
This looks nice.

332
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,800

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,320

351
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,820
My dad often brought me here when I was little.

352
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,390
It's a pity that I won't be able to do that again.

353
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,260
If I knew this place was so fun,

354
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,980
I would come here to sell popcorn when I was young.

355
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,270
Did you notice that

356
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,800
people hanging out here

357
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,380
all share delicious food

358
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,810
with someone important to them?

359
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,240
But I am

360
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,380
always alone.

361
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,890
I ride the motorcycle and go surfing.

362
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,060
So time passed quickly

363
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,450
when I do those things.

364
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,340
Alone?

365
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,700
Why?

366
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,620
Because I

367
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,000
made some mistakes in the past.

368
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,260
I realized that life was very fragile.

369
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,330
We should live in the moment

370
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,110
and just enjoy our lives.

371
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,080
What you said

372
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,280
sounds familiar.

373
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,340
I think I heard it before.

374
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,770
Do you think there is a possibility

375
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,820
that it was said to us by the same person?

376
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,160
That's impossible.

377
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,030
Wow, they are so cute.

378
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,210
Come here, now.

379
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,720
The dolphin show is about to start.

380
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,740
Come one, let's go.

381
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,360
Okay.

382
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,540
Wait a second.

383
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:50,970
Hello?

384
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,750
Got it. I'll be there soon.

385
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,390
Mr. Zhong,

386
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,100
it's the thing I told you before.

387
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,960
I have to go now.

388
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,070
Why are you in a rush?

389
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,400
Actually, I bought a second-hand air conditioner.

390
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,090
Now I need to find a car

391
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,430
to get the air conditioner from the seller.

392
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,830
I also need to install it.

393
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,610
Do you know how to do that?

394
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,050
The air conditioner is installed.

395
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,240
Call me if you need anything.

396
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,820
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

397
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,710
Mr. Zhong,

398
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,770
I'm glad you're here. I'm here. I'm here. Let's go.

399
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,820
Otherwise, I would be fooled

400
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,880
and overcharged again.

401
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,200
Yeah, sure.

402
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,470
He definitely would recommend

403
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,560
a few things you don't need

404
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,180
to trick you.

405
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,690
At least I can be a little useful here, right.

406
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,950
Sorry to trouble you again, Mr. Zhong.

407
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,700
Mrs. Zhen, just call me Zhong.

408
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,360
I'm happy to help.

409
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,560
You don't need to thank me.

410
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,330
Zhong.

411
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,400
That sounds nice.

412
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,590
I wanted to cook for you here,

413
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,910
but she insisted on ordering takeout.

414
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,430
I was worried Mr. Zhong

415
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,750
wouldn't like our home-made meal.

416
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,790
Do you remember

417
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
the last time I ate your food? Well…

418
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,470
Well, let's eat. Dig in.

419
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,920
Okay.

420
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,670
Let's invite Mr. Zhong over for dinner

421
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,490
when my cooking is good.

422
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,760
Is there a leak in the house?

423
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,060
It's just the faucet in the kitchen

424
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,130
that has gotten loose.

425
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,470
But we can make do with it.

426
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,960
Last time, it cost us a lot

427
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,750
to have the gas stove repaired.

428
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,410
But this… You can fix this.

429
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,250
Mom, what are you talking about?

430
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,400
Mr. Zhong is our guest.

431
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,800
How can you ask him to do this?

432
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,800
How about

433
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,080
I make an appointment online and have it fixed later?

434
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,970
You still want to look for a repairman?

435
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,500
Did you learn your lesson from last time?

436
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,590
And how much money were you overcharged?

437
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,980
It's better to save the money

438
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,070
and invite Zhong for dinner at our home in the future,

439
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,570
isn't it?

440
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,920
Well, then... I'll take a look.

441
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,950
It shouldn't be difficult.

442
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,860
Let me try.

443
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,590
It's here, right?

444
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,270
Close the water valve!

445
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,670
Mr. Zhong.

446
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,880
The pipe is… is fixed.

447
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,480
Hurry. Get a towel and dry your hair.

448
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,870
I'll get some clothes for you to change.

449
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,080
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhong.

450
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,390
I should've asked for a repairman,

451
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,170
so you wouldn't get soaked.

452
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,060
It's okay.

453
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,360
It was my fault.

454
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,460
I wanted to tighten it,

455
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,390
but I winded it too tight.

456
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,600
And the water valve wasn't closed. So here we are.

457
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,390
Sorry, I messed up.

458
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,890
My mom and I have never been

459
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,580
in a situation like this before.

460
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,320
That's totally fine.

461
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,390
Plus, this is a new

462
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,660
shared experience with you.

463
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,140
But…

464
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,520
I only want to share

465
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,710
some positive experience with you.

466
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,370
Such as

467
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,160
feeling happy,

468
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,630
or the sense of accomplishment.

469
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,200
That's what friends should share with each other.

470
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,160
If we're more than just friends,

471
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,700
can we share some more?

472
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,630
Mr. Zhong,

473
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,270
your clothes are probably dry now.

474
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,820
I'm going to use my hair dryer to finish up.

475
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,610
[54 Guang Da South Road]

476
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,320
I've confirmed

477
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,980
that her boyfriend is fake.

478
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,990
You guessed right.

479
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,630
You're so happy.

480
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,990
Are you going to do something about the situation?

481
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,910
I...

482
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,980
Well, this has nothing to do with me.

483
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,620
Do you think it is possible

484
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,510
that Gaogui is the love child of our boss?

485
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,690
She works here just to have some life experience.

486
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,840
Then you need to be careful with your words in future.

487
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,450
Mr. Lin is so charming, indeed.

488
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,800
I wish I was the one who dated him.

489
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,680
Let me see.

490
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,330
Well, Gaogui has improved

491
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,180
her professional skills

492
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,520
really fast.

493
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,150
If I were in her situation,

494
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,940
I would've resigned long ago.

495
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,350
I have a job related to public opinion.

496
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,870
But we don't have the budget for outsourcing it.

497
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,810
I was going to ask Zhen Gaogui to do it.

498
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,070
How about I give it to you?

499
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,770
That's not necessary.

500
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,920
What job?

501
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,780
Gaogui,

502
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,580
well, I can't help you with this.

503
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,410
You know I have my own work.

504
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,610
Me too.

505
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,590
Here, we have a client of a dairy brand.

506
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,670
There have been some negative news about them recently.

507
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,420
They want

508
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,360
a 24-hour news summary,

509
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,390
which means you must

510
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,510
gather all the data and news

511
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,300
of the past 24 hours,

512
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,720
and categorize them into positive, negative,

513
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,880
and neutral news.

514
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,150
After that, you make a statistical chart.

515
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,830
And send it to them

516
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,880
before 4 o'clock in the morning.

517
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,310
Before 4 a.m.?

518
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,390
Can I send it during business hours?

519
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
No, you can't.

520
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,870
Their director lives a very healthy lifestyle.

521
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,300
He gets up at 4 in the morning and starts his work.

522
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,590
We must send it to him before he gets up.

523
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,150
No way.

524
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,660
This is ridiculous.

525
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,040
You've done some excellent work lately.

526
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,130
I trust you.

527
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,540
Meton's project is finished.

528
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,550
You're not busy, are you?

529
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,190
I can do this.

530
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,410
Please send it with the client template.

531
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,870
The template is in the attachment.

532
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,290
There's no attachment here.

533
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,800
Ju Ran forgot to sent it to me.

534
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,200
[Ju Ran]

535
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,030
All done.

536
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,080
Mr. Zhong,

537
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,350
you have to understand that it's my honest advice.

538
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,030
I’m not saying it's impractical to promote new products.

539
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
I just think we should

540
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,710
consider the company's current situation.

541
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,350
Is it necessary to do this now?

542
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,350
I've sent the feasibility report

543
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,350
to everyone.

544
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,640
You must have read it too, Mr. Sun.

545
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,100
Yes, I did.

546
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,840
Even so, do we have to do it?

547
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,600
We need to be realistic

548
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,360
and think about our specific situations.

549
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,170
Look.

550
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,530
Once the new Product R&D Department is established,

551
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,120
we need to find new distribution channels.

552
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,560
We'll die if we don't make a change.

553
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,750
Anyway, everything has to be in the company's best interest.

554
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,210
I won't allow you to make an impulsive decision.

555
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,430
Come in.

556
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,590
The factory manager got a new car.

557
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,630
Mr. Sun,

558
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,590
please think about it.

559
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,390
Zhen Gaogui,

560
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,860
how can you act like this after I complimented you?

561
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,830
You used the wrong template to send

562
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,960
the email I asked you to send yesterday morning.

563
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,450
No…

564
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,120
There's no template in the email you sent me.

565
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,100
And you didn't answer

566
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,170
when I called you later that day.

567
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,660
You can't blame me for this.

568
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,890
I gave you such an important job

569
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,520
because I thought you were competent.

570
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,210
What could I have done?

571
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,480
You didn't answer my call. And you didn't tell me beforehand.

572
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,440
Mr. Zhong is here.

573
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,590
Are you busy?

574
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,780
You didn't answer my call.

575
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,990
I'm having a little problem now.

576
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,150
You want to see me?

577
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,360
I need you to help me with something.

578
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,410
Okay, give me a minute.

579
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,610
I'll deal with this issue with my colleague first.

580
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,150
Okay, I'll wait outside.

581
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,860
Ju Ran,

582
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,570
you definitely didn't send me the template.

583
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,190
If you want me to be responsible for this matter,

584
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,330
I won't have it.

585
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,190
Now, I have to go.

586
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,250
We have two choices.

587
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,630
The first.

588
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,570
What's going on?

589
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,310
We can waste more time on this when I come back.

590
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,550
The second,

591
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,170
I go out and we'll move on from it.

592
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,260
Are we going to...

593
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,950
You said I didn't look into

594
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,900
the safety inspection of the popcorn factory?

595
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,080
Now I've got a clue.

596
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,350
I'm going to show you.

597
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,880
Where? Where did you scratch the car?

598
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,580
This… I…

599
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,680
I have no say in this.

600
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,140
I'll have to ask my boss.

601
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,340
Don't. Please don't.

602
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,680
We're here to talk business with the factory manager.

603
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,050
But I accidently

604
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,360
scratched his car

605
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,510
when I was parking.

606
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,450
I'm so sorry.

607
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,850
I need to ask you for a favor.

608
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,450
What? A favor?

609
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,610
No. Knock it off.

610
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,900
Look, I'm not rich.

611
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,570
Do you know how expensive this car is?

612
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,860
I can't help you.

613
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,890
I can't afford it.

614
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,600
No, I didn't mean that.

615
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:26,900
It's just

616
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,920
my dashcam ran out of battery.

617
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,260
I saw that you also had one in your car.

618
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,930
Could you show me the record.

619
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,410
We'll pay as much as we should.

620
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,370
Yes. Yes.

621
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,120
Let's

622
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,590
solve this problem together.

623
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,790
If the director comes back and says you didn't handle it well,

624
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,740
it will cause you trouble.

625
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,060
I'll check the dashcam first.

626
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,790
You can check it on your phone now.

627
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,930
The new technology is so cool.

628
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,600
You're so professional.

629
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,990
How many days of records does it have?

630
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,210
You have a good eye.

631
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,320
I picked this dashcam myself.

632
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,390
You have to do a great job for your boss.

633
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,150
It doesn't only keep the records for the past few days.

634
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,800
I can even find the records

635
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,030
from more than a week ago.

636
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,900
Here. Check it out.

637
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,600
That's true.

638
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,790
It has the records

639
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,550
from a week ago.

640
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,470
Look.

641
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:19,990
Sir,

642
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,070
I suddenly found that the scratches can be wiped off.

643
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,710
Don't pull me along.

644
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,400
Take a look.

645
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,780
Right?

646
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,760
How come you can just wipe them off?

647
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,430
Right?

648
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,180
Hey, come here. Look at this.

649
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,270
This is strange.

650
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,590
All gone.

651
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,550
You scared me to death.

652
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,230
I'm relieved now.

653
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,190
You really scared me.

654
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,590
This is great.

655
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,580
This expensive car is fine.

656
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,330
You really wiped them off.

657
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,650
Here's your phone.

658
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,880
It's a misunderstanding.

659
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,030
Sorry.

660
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,550
Look how scared you two were.

661
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,000
You have no wisdom at all.

662
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,520
You're worse than me.

663
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,510
- Sorry. -We'll be careful in future.

664
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,280
I'm sorry.

665
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,750
Anything could happen.

666
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,150
Did we get it?

667
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,030
Mr. Zhong,

668
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,590
I didn't expect you to be so resourceful.

669
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,980
Well, this thing

670
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,610
looks authentic and it doesn't damage the car.

671
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,330
What should we do next?

672
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,890
Are you going back to the company to get your payback?

673
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,540
I have a plan.

674
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,610
Let's go.

675
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,580
Why did you ask me to bring popcorn here?

676
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,320
Follow me.

677
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,390
I'm going to give you a great customer experience today.

678
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,050
I'm not playing.

679
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,190
You know?

680
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,910
Game players and non-players

681
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,660
taste the popcorn differently.

682
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,720
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

683
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,550
The quality control of our product is excellent.

684
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,330
Let me ask you something.

685
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,600
When was the last time

686
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,470
you played a thrilling game?

687
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,790
I've never done that.

688
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,350
Well,

689
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,470
you don't have any entertainment in your life?

690
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,310
When I was a kid,

691
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,900
I always went to cram school on weekends.

692
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,680
After that, I grew up and started working.

693
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,870
Then today,

694
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,950
let's have a fun experience

695
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,170
for your work.

696
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:52,880
Are you scared?

697
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,340
What's there to be afraid of?

698
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,280
It's a game for children.

699
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,180
Oh, no. No. No.

700
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,890
That's brutal. Oh, my gosh!

701
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,990
Take one to calm yourself down.

702
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,870
How is it?

703
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,890
Does it taste a bit different?

704
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,470
Yes, it is a little bit better.

705
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,630
Do you know why kids like anime?

706
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,870
No, I don't.

707
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,460
Because the heroines in the anime stories

708
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,960
live the life that they

709
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,350
could never have.

710
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,140
Games exist for the same reason.

711
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,120
How are they like?

712
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,690
Like what we played earlier.

713
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,620
I'm here for the story today.

714
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,010
You like gossips too.

715
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,130
I'm just curious, like a normal person.

716
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,410
Curious?

717
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,830
The story of Zhen Gaogui and I

718
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,990
was fiction.

719
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,990
Since it was a fiction,

720
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,960
it was all made up.

721
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,590
Made up?

722
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,160
Zhen Gaogui and I

723
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,340
are old friends.

724
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,050
If we were in a relationship, our child would be

725
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,820
riding a kiddie ride at the grocery store that sings,

726
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,240
"Daddy's dad is grandpa,"

727
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,100
"Mommy's mom is grandma."

728
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,340
Right.

729
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,570
That's right.

730
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,630
There are also rumors about

731
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,030
Zhong Yiming and Zhen Gaogui, right?

732
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,360
You guys

733
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,740
definitely don't like

734
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,080
office romances, do you?

735
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,690
I did a good thing.

736
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,690
Are you hungry?

737
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,560
No.

738
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,280
Are you cold?

739
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:30,920
No.

740
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,380
Well, can you…

741
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,850
No?

742
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,350
Can you just give me a little chance?

743
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,030
What chance?

744
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,710
The chance… the chance that you thought about.

745
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,140
This is the chance.

746
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,510
Brother,

747
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,300
you've read the information

748
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,230
of the new product.

749
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,710
We are fully staffed

750
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,950
in our new Product R&D Department.

751
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,600
Even if you disagree,

752
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,310
I'm going to give it a try.

753
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,909
Launching the new product

754
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,989
can be the new opportunity you're bringing

755
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,820
into the company, as the new CEO.

756
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,150
Seize this opportunity.

757
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,900
But you have to

758
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,820
convince the others.

759
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,350
Thank you, brother.

760
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,190
Vice President Sun disapproves the plan,

761
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,139
but I’ll make it work.

762
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,400
The PR strategic plan for the new product launch

763
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,280
[Conference Room]

764
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,949
will need the PR company to cooperate

765
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,989
with our marketing department.

766
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,510
Xinda PR did a good job.

767
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,530
How about we continue to work with them?

768
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,320
It will be more time efficient.

769
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,710
Okay.

770
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,650
I think it's workable.

771
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,500
Mr. Zhong,

772
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:49,190
Xinda PR is inexperienced.

773
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,989
The launch of a new product is such an important job.

774
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,429
We can't just give it to a young girl.

775
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,230
What are you thinking?

776
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,780
I think we should find

777
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,130
the best PR company in the field,

778
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,330
and choose the best team.

779
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,270
Mr. Sun, you made a good point.

780
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,910
But the best team is not necessarily the most suitable team.

781
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,710
Mr. Zhong,

782
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,780
are you trying to be a monarch here?

783
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,450
It's not ideal for our company's

784
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,720
future development.

785
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,240
Director Lu, you can go back to your work now.

786
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:30,850
Okay.

787
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,390
You can leave too.

788
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,000
Okay.

789
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,040
Mr. Sun, wait a second.

790
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,440
I have some good stuff for you.

791
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,480
Guo,

792
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,710
thank you for your cooperation on the safety inspection.

793
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,950
It's great that we can start now.

794
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,850
I missed the key promotion events several days ago.

795
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,120
That was a huge loss.

796
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,410
Fortunately, you introduced Mr. Xue to me

797
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,910
and I've got the orders of the next quarter.

798
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,990
So now I can make more money.

799
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,580
I've got several food brands,

800
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,560
and food processing businesses.

801
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,460
You can have a chat.

802
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,340
Is Mr. Zhong going to find out that it was fake?

803
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,730
He came here once.

804
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,090
Safety inspection is

805
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,630
for everyone's safety.

806
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,980
What risk can there be?

807
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,030
No…

808
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,230
Where did you get this?

809
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,680
That's not your concern.

810
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,410
If you know

811
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,930
what you should do,

812
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,060
then this

813
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,920
is going to become our secret.

814
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,030
I understand.

815
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,030
I understand.

816
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,430
Good.

817
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,310
I have good news.

818
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,890
Meton Food

819
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,360
has a new project.

820
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,950
The budget is 2 million.

821
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,060
They decided to let us

822
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,740
promote the new flavor.

823
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,730
Two million.

824
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,590
Two million.

825
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,490
Oh, my gosh!

826
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,800
How about

827
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,750
we have a meeting in half an hour?

828
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,700
We'll talk about the details.

829
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,570
Roger that.

830
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,530
Get ready.

831
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,180
Zhen Gaogui,

832
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,760
you really did this?

833
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,080
Two million.

834
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,620
I've never done such a big project before.

835
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,160
I'm awesome.

836
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,960
I'm going to have a cup of Americano to reward myself.

837
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
Unbelievable.

838
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,280
Ju Ran,

839
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,950
I didn't expect that

840
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,550
Meton Food would have that much budget.

841
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,890
I used to ignore them,

842
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,760
but now I'm not good enough for them.

843
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,340
We don't need to do competitive presentation this time.

844
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,550
If we seize this opportunity, we might win.

845
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,800
Besides,

846
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,480
Zhen Gaogui is not in a relationship with Mr. Zhong.

847
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,200
We deserve a fair competition.

848
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,670
I think I can win.

849
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,430
Meton Food has sent us

850
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,370
the latest project requirements.

851
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,010
What we need to do next is

852
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,060
to pick the leader of this project.

853
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,290
Boss,

854
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,340
I want to take charge of this project.

855
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,880
I'd like to do that too.

856
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,070
Anyone else?

857
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,230
Before this project.

858
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,810
no one was interested in Meton.

859
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,440
Even if no one competes with you here,

860
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,150
there're other firms that want this job.

861
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,130
This means

862
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,910
"the winner takes all."

863
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,850
The winner takes all?

864
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,470
Ju Ran and I are colleagues

865
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,180
who work in the same team.

866
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,880
It's not necessary

867
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,210
to compete this way.

868
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,680
We can use a healthy competition

869
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,680
in this work environment.

870
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,410
If we stay in our comfort zone for too long,

871
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,000
what are we going to do when we have to leave?

872
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,560
Let's use the old rule.

873
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,900
What old rule?

874
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,880
How about this?

875
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,630
I've thought about it.

876
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,680
Since it's hard to evaluate the ideas,

877
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,080
let's compare

878
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,100
the media resources,

879
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,980
the spending, and the gross rate of return

880
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,480
in Ju Ran's and Gaogui's proposals.

881
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,530
The one with the low cost–performance ratio wins.

882
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,950
Does everyone agree?

883
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,030
I have an issue.

884
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,730
I don't think it's fair.

885
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,550
I'm just a newbie. I've just started in this field.

886
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,250
I'm definitely not as resourceful as Ju Ran.

887
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,690
Making the most profit for our clients

888
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,600
is the value of our firm.

889
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,540
This is the fairest way

890
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,910
I can think of.

891
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,500
How to complete the task

892
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,660
is totally up to you.
