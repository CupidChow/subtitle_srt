Yes, I did.

Yes.

I don't dare to drink too much usually.

12

Yeah, I don't understand, either.

Thank you.

62
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,149
I heard that your project was carried out early.

63
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,230
Yes.

64
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,670
There are some issues.

65
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,680
That's why we start it beforehand.

66
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,240
Didn't our boss ask Ju Ran to help you?

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,350
If you need extra help,

68
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,790
you can just ask Ju Ran.

69
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,790
She has her own project to do.

70
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,710
Besides, I'm still a newbie.

71
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,270
I can't always bother her.

If I know how to do the work,

73
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,550

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,230
She always asked you to do things for her, didn't she?

80
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,350
Well, don't put it like that.

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,670

82
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,150
ask me to do things for her often,

We'll take a pause now.

95
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,350
If we deal with him now,

96
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,910
it will affect the company too much.

97
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,910

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,110
there will be a new problem.

101
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,909
We've known how he operates very well.

102
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,030
Just keep an eye on him.

103
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,590
Besides,

104
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,540
he's not going to do anything now.

I forgot to ask for your contact number last time.

120
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,990

121
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,710

126
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,710
why I changed the piano player.

145
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,030
you can just call me by my name.

146
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,230
I don’t really want to be the president,

147
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,030

148
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,910
Okay.

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,830
Thank you, Zhong Yiming,

150
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,470
for taking me home the other day

151
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,680
when I was drunk.

153
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,590
When I woke up that morning,

154
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,550
I found myself lying on the couch.

155
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,240
The last thing I remember

156
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,909
is you drinking by my side.

157
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,990
My mom told me you sent me home.

158
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,909
But you told me

159
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,360
you had never got drunk.

160
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,990
I was with you,

161
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,270
so I had nothing to worry about.

162
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:53,550
Really?

163
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,710
What's so special about me?

164
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,590
You're special.

165
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,150
Because

166
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,800
you're Zhong Yiming.

167
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,710
In my mind,

168
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,590
you are very responsible.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,350
When I didn't believe

170
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,790
I could do all those things,

171
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,030
you believed in me.

172
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,390
So I will believe in you too.

173
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,830
Because trust

174
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,830
should be mutual.

175
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,110
Your compliments

176
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,150
made me feel like I'm really amazing.

177
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,670
Why did you ask me

178
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,910
to eat with you today?

179
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,150
Nothing in particular.

180
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,710
I did some things

181
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,480
that upset you before.

182
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,789
I was worried you wouldn't forgive me.

183
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,120
Do you have something to tell me?

184
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,440
I do have something to tell you.

185
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,960
Actually, I need to ask you something.

186
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,630
But I didn't get the chance before.

187
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,590
And I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it.

188
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,870
No, you're not.

189
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,630
I haven't said it yet. How did you know?

190
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,510
Excuse me.

191
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,110
This is our freshly arrived salmon.

192
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,310
I picked the best part for you.

193
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,350
Please try it.

194
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,870
Thanks. Thank you.

195
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,510
Enjoy.

196
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,480
Shall we eat first?

197
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,840
The fish looks very fresh.

198
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,710
Actually, you did so many awesome things

199
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,990
not because I trusted you.

200
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,120
I always think you're an amazing person.

201
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,990
You say things that I dare not to say,

202
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,710
and do things I dare not to do.

203
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,110
You are the same, aren't you?

204
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,350
I can do those things

205
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,830
only because I've met you.

206
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,990
I never wanted you to know the old me.

207
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,590
The old me was hateful

208
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,470
and self-centered.

209
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,710
I was selfish

210
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,950
and a trouble-maker.

211
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,350
I was bad for others and for myself.

212
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,430
What did you do exactly?

213
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,590
I made a huge mistake.

214
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,950
It was so huge that others wouldn't forgive me,

215
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,110
and neither would I.

216
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,870
Zhong Yiming,

217
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,740
though you wouldn't tell me

218
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,190
what happened,

219
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,830
but I don't think it matters.

220
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,070
It was

221
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,990
in the past.

222
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,070
It's like those junk programs

223
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,950
that you can't delete in your computer.

224
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,230
They will only keep the bad memories.

225
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,710
The moment I met you

226
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,870
was the beginning of many troubles in my life,

227
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,230
but it was also the beginning of many wonderful things.

228
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,110
I lived a dreamy, carefree life,

229
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,710
but now I'm down to earth

230
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,470
and it's more reassuring.

231
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,350
Zhen Gaogui,

232
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,070
I'm glad you're here.

233
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,630
Thank you.

234
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,990
I should thank you.

235
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,710
Thank you for going through

a very difficult time with me,

237
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,230

238

239
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,590
Hold on.

240
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,430
Hello?

241
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,350
Yes, I am.

242
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,190
Okay, I'll be there soon.

243
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,590
What happened?

244
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,350
My mom is in the hospital.

00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,310
Excuse me. Could you tell me

248
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,110
which room is Ms. Qin Fenfang in?

249
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,190
Here. In this room.

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,510
What happened to you, mom?

255
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,830
Talk to me.

256

You can't even talk, mom.

257
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,870
What should I do?

258
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,870
Gaogui,

259
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,070
I'm here.

what happened?

264
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,990
I'm not sure.

265
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,630
Well…

266
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,590
I was teaching a class,

267
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,860
and suddenly I couldn't move my lower back.

268
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,990
The doctor said

269
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,950
it was lumbar strain,

270
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,190
and ordered me to rest for a week.

271
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,860
Other than that, I'm fine.

272
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,830
Mrs. Zhen, call me anytime

273
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,830
if you need anything.

274
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,350
Okay.

276
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,590
were you two

277
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,710

Mom.

279
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,710
Why is that your focus

280
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,310
at this moment?

281
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,710
I can't believe you.

282
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,830
You didn't go home after work,

283
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,710
but went to teach yoga?

284
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,110
A student asked me to give him

285
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,430
an one-on-one aerial yoga class.

286
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,870
This kind of private lesson

287
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,830
charges several hundred yuan per hour.

288
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,950
Why didn't I make the money?

289
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,710
Look at you now.

290
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,830
You didn't earn the money,

291
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,310
but you damaged your health.

292
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,600
Don't do that again, okay?

293
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,110
Be careful.

Okay.

Mom, don't say that.

366

00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,099
I don't know.

377
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,470
But

378
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,950
I want to leave home.

379
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,510
The further, the better.

380
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,030
What about you?

381
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,030
I want to travel around the world.

382
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,880
My dad said

383
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,710
the world outside is wonderful.

384
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,190
I can't stay at home forever.

385
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,190
It's a shame

386
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,150
that in future,

387
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,910
I can only travel with my mom.

388
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,110
This is my chat account.

389
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,270
Do you use chat software too?

390
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,350
Yes.

391
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,550
I suddenly realised

392
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,230
I don't even know your name.

393
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,710
Can you tell me?

394
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,310
Just call me Nana.

395
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,870
I want to be mysterious.

396
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,790
I want to go somewhere far away from home.

397
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,350
A place where no one knows me.

398
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,230
What about you?

399
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,470
Me too.

400
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,790
I'm probably going to study abroad.

401
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,110
But I haven't decided where to go yet.

402
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,790
Go to Paris, then.

403
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,510
I heard it's a romantic city.

404
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,900
We might meet in Paris someday.

405
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,830
I've been in France for a month.

406
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,870
I think life here is interesting.

407
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,790
Thanks to your advice.

408
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,350
I really envy you.

409
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,630
I gave you some advice,

410
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,670
but I didn't make it myself.

411
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,830
I hope I won't fail any exam this time.

412
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,070
Yeah-huh!

413
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,670

416
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,750
I let my mom go to bed.

417

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,710
tasted exactly the same as this.

563
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,630
Really?

564
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,150
Why are you back so early?

565
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,710
I took a leave.

566
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,620
Zhang Feiyang gave you a leave?

567
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,630
He said I worked overtime a lot before.

568
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,110
So he gave me a compensatory leave.

569
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,510
You leader is quite nice.

570
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,670
Anyway, for my work,

571
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,660
I can communicate with you face to face.

572
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,350
But you,

573
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,150
you just decided to work with the Dooro Bear.

574
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,870
Shouldn't you be busy?

575
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,870
No, I'm not busy at all.

576
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,190
Not at all.

577
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,870
Really?

578
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,440
There are more than 90 emails that need your reply.

579
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,550
Replying them one by one, I'll finish it anyway.

580
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,440
Are you going to keep doing this?

581
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,670
Go to her house during the day

582
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,000
and come to the office at night.

583
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,750
I can't leave the two of them

584
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,950
alone at home, right?

585
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,430
You've been working hard lately.

586
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,670
If this is done, I'll give you a promotion and a raise.

587
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,840
[Unread, Administrative Department]

588
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,840
[Unread, R&D Department]

589
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,150
Thank you.

590
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,110
Mr. Zhong, your takeout is here.

591
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,710
Okay, thank you.

592
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,910
Enjoy your meal.

593
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,710
Here.

594
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,470
I haven't worked overtime for a long time.

595
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,710
That's true.

596
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,430
This is a special situation.

597
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,470
You don't have to wait for me tomorrow.

598
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,390
I'll handle these unfinished documents.

599
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,030
No need.

600
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,150
I'm not that old

601
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,270
to sleep on time every day.

602
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,380
Why do I feel

603
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,270
you've changed?

604
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,390
When you first came to the company,

605
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,910
I really

606
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,870
hated you.

607
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,270
I wished you could make a mistake

608
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,710
and then leave.

609
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,430
But after these days,

610
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,150
I realized that maybe only you can save Meton.

611
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,750
I hope I was right about you.

612
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,630
I don't want to take such a big responsibility.

613
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,190
I just thought there was an opportunity

614
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,750
and wanted to give it a try.

615
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,510
You weren't like this before.

616
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,910
Do you remember

617
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,430
that one year when your brother organized

618
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,030
an executive meeting in the suburbs?

619
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,190
You were three hours late.

620
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,710
It seemed like you went to participate in some

621
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,190
motorcycle off-road race.

622
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,710
That meeting had nothing to do with me, okay?

623
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,110
I told him not to wait for me.

624
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,710
He insisted on it.

625
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,710
What could I do?

626
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,470
But all the executives were there,

627
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,710
only you were late.

628
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,440
You embarrassed him a lot.

629
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,470
I thought you were so unreliable at that time.

630
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,990
But now, I admit

631
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,230
I misjudged you.

632
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,350
Thank you for seeing through me.

633
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,200
I haven't even seen through myself.

634
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,910
I'm telling the truth.

635
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,630
Okay.

636
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,270
By the way,

637
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,110
you should discuss it more with Lin Yue

638
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,470
about the Dooro Bear's project.

639
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,190
Just tell me the progress and the result.

640
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,950
No problem.

641
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,390
Our final confirmed plan is this series

642
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,670
and that series.

643
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,630
So please ask your company's designers

644
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,710
to make some changes.

645
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,710
Is Zhong Yiming busy recently?

646
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,990
Or you just wanted to see me

647
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,630
and discuss it with me alone?

648
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,390
Both.

649
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,190
We've worked together in advance.

650
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,150
Can't you be more gentle to me?

651
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,950
Our company paid for our cooperation.

652
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:21,910
You...

653
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,670
Today's work is done.

654
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,880
Now it's break time.

655
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,390
Let me take you to a serious place to rest.

656
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,100
This is the serious place you mentioned?

657
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,640
It involves health and science.

658
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,950
Definitely serious.

659
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,190
Dear, you're here.

660
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,910
What project are you going to do today?

661
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,390
Today, we have a store celebration event.

662
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,710
There are promotions for recharging.

663
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,190
It's very cost-effective.

664
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,670
Recharge 1000 and get a 10% discount.

665
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,150
Recharge 2000 and get a 20% discount.

666
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,790
Recharge 3000 and get a 30% discount.

667
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,630
Recharge 4000 and get a 40% discount.

668
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,750
If you recharge 5000...

669
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,230
Alright, alright.

670
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,150
We haven't started yet.

671
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,470
You keep promoting that.

672
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,230
We'll talk after we're done, okay?

673
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,150
Okay.

674
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,160
Come with me.

675
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,630
This way, please.

676
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,430
People in this industry are all like this.

677
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,950
It's not easy for them.

678
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,430
How's it?

679
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,150
Does it hurt a lot?

680
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,470
Ouch! It hurts!

681
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,950
You know what?

682
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,510
Last time when you gave me a shoulder massage,

683
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,750
it was much more painful than this.

684
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,920
I didn't

685
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,990
use such force.

686
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,960
How should I put it?

687
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,390
Little help

688
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,710
brings much return.

689
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,350
Ouch, ouch, ouch, it hurts.

690
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,680
Enjoy it.

691
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,750
If I had known it would be like this,

692
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,990
I wouldn't have come with you.

693
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,750
You sit in the office all day long,

694
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,750
not exercising at all,

695
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,390
you'll definitely have backaches and soreness.

696
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,750
What can I do about it?

697
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,510
See?

698
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,680
You're so tense when it comes to work,

699
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,510
and too busy at work.

700
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,910
It will definitely affect your health.

701
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,200
I have OCD.

702
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,870
I have to do everything perfectly.

703
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,750
Otherwise, I'll feel uncomfortable.

704
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,030
No mistake is allowed

705
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,950
for things within my control.

706
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,230
But when your life is very tense,

707
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,630
it will affect your health.

708
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,550
It doesn't want to make mistakes either.

709
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,510
But life itself is prone to mistakes.

710
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,510
I remember I read a saying online.

711
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,270
It said that when people are in their teens,

712
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,430
they don't know what knowledge is,

713
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,270
but they have to choose to study liberal arts or science.

714
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,550
When people are seventeen or eighteen and know nothing about careers,

715
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,230
they have to choose a major.

716
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,830
When people know nothing about society,

717
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,469
they have to find a job.

718
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,550
When people know nothing about human nature,

719
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,270
they have to get married and have children.

720
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,070
All of it is very prone to mistakes.

721
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,790
About what you said,

722
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,909
I don't think I made the right choices.

723
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,510
In high school, I wanted to be an artist

724
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,230
and draw comics for a lifetime.

725
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,670
But my parents thought there was no future in it,

726
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,150
so they sent me to France

727
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,760
to study classical art.

728
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,270
After graduation, I wanted to start a business in China,

729
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,510
but they wanted me

730
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,469
to find a stable job.

731
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,989
My major didn't match,

732
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,310
so I couldn't find one.

733
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,310
In the end, I chose to start my own business.

734
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,950
You see,

735
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,350
my life has no plan.

736
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,870
So in my opinion,

737
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,870
experience is more important than plans.

738
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,070
Whether it's right or wrong,

739
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,480
it will become

740
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,990
right in the end.

741
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,030
Can you do it?

742
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,510
If not,

743
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,230
I'll go to the supermarket and buy some frozen ones.

744
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,780
Mrs. Li said

745
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,950
the handmade dumpling wrappers are more delicious.

746
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,310
Look, Zhong did a pretty good job.

747
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,230
Pretty good?

748
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,950
His sleeves are in the flour.

749
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,230
I think it's not bad.

750
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,390
Mrs. Zhen,

751
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,070
is the fan heater working well?

752
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,030
It's great.

753
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,070
I'm telling you, if it weren't for that fan heater,

754
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,390
I would have been freezing.

755
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,990
Thanks to Zhong always accompanying me

756
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,510
at home these days.

757
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,760
We're like a family.

758
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,830
What family?

759
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,220
Of course...

760
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,590
I'll go.

761
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,630
Mom.
