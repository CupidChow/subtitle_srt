They didn't agree at first.

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,540
They agreed at the second time.

00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,270
What they cared about were not my opinions,

00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,780
but some people's opinions.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,120
I didn't expect that you would be in such a difficult situation, too.

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,350
It was also my first time doing something like this.

This is not okay.

It'll cost much of your time.

14
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,990
I'll take it to a repair shop to fix it.

Just listen to me.

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,000

00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,310
It might take a longer time to repair it.

114
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,430
I'll go there to investigate the historical stories of their development

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,960
On my way here,

130
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,250
I passed by a breakfast stall.

131
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,920
But it was the only one which was open there.

132
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,700
I didn't want to make you feel neglected,

133
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,600
so I specially bought you the most luxurious version.

134
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,550
Two eggs and one sausage were added to it.

135
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,030
It's such a long way. We'll starve to death if we don't eat something.

136
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
What about yours?

137
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,990
It's the same.

138
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,710
However,

139
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,770
the boss gave me one more egg for free.

140
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,920
He said that I should eat more since I had to work overtime on weekends.

141
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,700
When I was studying abroad,

142
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,670
people added butter

143
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,470
and chocolate to pancakes there.

144
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,110
I felt that my belly was greasy after eating them.

145
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,270
They were not as delicious as this sausage.

146
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, do you know that this sausage

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,220
is full of starch?

148
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,280
Starch sausages are the most delicious.

149
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,070
Besides, do you know that

150
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,530
my mom and I almost can't afford the cost of food now?

151
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,720
We can't be so picky about the food.

152
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,130
You're quite adaptive.

153
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,670
I have no choice.

154
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,670
When I was a kid, my mom didn't allow me to eat the snacks bought from street stalls.

155
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,070
But now I think it tastes better than before.

156
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,470
What's the problem with street stalls?

157
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,910
When I was a kid, I followed my grandpa to run a street stall.

158
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,910
That's how Meton Popcorn was founded at first.

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,590
Of course.

187
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,190
Let me give it a try.

188
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,560
Okay.

189
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,520
Alright.

190
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,110
Class is over.

191
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,990
Ma'am,

192
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,350
could you tell me

193
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,420
where have you gone by following your meditation?

194
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,280
I've gone to the forest.

195
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,310
I can only go to

196
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,750
this forest on weekends.

197
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,940
Then, could you tell me

198
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,110
what you saw

199
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,870
in the forest?

200
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,750
Sunshine,

201
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,340
trees,

202
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,110
and a golden deer.

203
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,710
Then, let me ask you again.

204
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,730
Did you see me?

205
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,040
I'm waiting for you across the river.

206
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,350
No.

207
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,350
There's a pig on the other side of the river.

208
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,090
Alright.

209
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,470
Next time,

210
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,630
let's go to the same forest again.

211
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,240
Miss Li,

212
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,830
who was the male student

213
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,220
having meditation by my side just now?

214
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,950
Our manager brought him here.

215
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,980
Just now, I also heard that

216
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,230
he's a big boss.

217
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,950
It's the Dooro Bear which has been very popular recently.

218
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,830
It was him again?

219
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,190
Anyway, I've heard that he has many fans.

220
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,720
One of our regular customers recommended him to come here.

221
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,370
Okay. See you next week.

222
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,750
Mr. Zhong, we've arrived.

223
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,930
Today,

224
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,890
the weather is fine.

225
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,170
It's fine indeed.

226
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,470
The living conditions at a farm are a bit tough.

227
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,590
You're not even afraid of the tough conditions.

228
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,780
Why should I be afraid of them?

229
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,110
Let's go.

230
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,310
Mr. Zhong.

231
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,230
We'll have to walk a kilometer?

232
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,070
You think this is far?

233
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,990
When I walked on the mountain road with my grandpa,

234
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,910
[Corn Farm]

235
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,720
it was farther.

236
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,840
But the road is too difficult to walk on.

237
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,950
I should have worn a pair of boots.

238
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,070
Are you okay?

239
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,950
Yes, I am.

240
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,830
Mr. Zhong, how far is it from here?

241
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,110
Why haven't we arrived yet?

242
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,310
We'll arrive soon.

243
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,290
It's okay.

244
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,710
Come on.

245
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,830
What should I do now?

246
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,470
We'll arrive soon. Just hang in there.

247
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,590
Let's deal with it when we get there. Come on.

248
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,430
It's cold.

249
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,870
It's okay. Just hang in there.

250
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,910
Grandpa Shen!

251
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,630
Hello, Zhong.

252
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

253
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,650
Hello, Grandpa Shen.

254
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,470
You have a girlfriend?

255
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,720
No, I'm not his girlfriend.

256
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,530
The corn planting technology of our village

257
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,140
has improved a lot.

258
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,820
It's better than the corn planting technology

259
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,070
in your grandfather's times.

260
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,900
When your grandfather sold popcorn back then,

261
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,720
he had never used such good corn.

262
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,710
No, he hadn't.

263
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,940
Coincidentally, there's a pot here.

264
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,520
Let me make some popcorn for you.

265
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,600
-Okay.
-Okay.

266
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,740
Hurry.

267
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,340
Corn.

268
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,170
Add some butter.

269
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,130
This is the most original way

270
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,750
to make Meton Popcorn.

271
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,510
All the ingredients are natural materials.

272
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,490
Add some sugar, too.

273
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,350
Alright.

274
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,430
Let's start the fire.

275
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,620
The old Mr. Zhong

276
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,250
bought corn from me.

277
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,960
He went back and took pains to study

278
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,820
how to make the most delicious popcorn.

279
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,660
Later, he expanded his business.

280
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,750
All the corn in our village was sold to him.

281
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,990
Our life became better.

282
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,710
The old Mr. Zhong also suggested that

283
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,350
I should move to the city.

284
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,750
I said I was born here and grew up here.

285
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,630
I've lived here for over half of my life.

286
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,070
I'm used to this place.

287
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,270
Look.

288
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,220
Those small houses

289
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,660
were all newly built

290
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,690
by your company for our villagers.

291
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,590
The old Mr. Zhong

292
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,000
was lucky enough.

293
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,350
He even did business abroad.

294
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,190
Now, you're the one

295
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,710
who has taken over his job.

296
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,710
Your company will be better in the future.

297
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,190
I'm flattered.

298
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,990
It smells so good.

299
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,430
I grew up smelling it.

300
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,830
This is the purest taste of Meton Popcorn.

301
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,620
It's done.

302
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,630
Let me tell you.

303
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,940
My feet are very painful now.

304
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,430
This is work injury. You have to take responsibility for it.

305
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,950
Fine.

306
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,270
I'll buy you a pair of slippers, okay?

307
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,720
Ma'am, how much is it?

308
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,630
Ten yuan for one pair.

309
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,750
Miss, buy some slippers.

310
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,070
This pair of red slippers suits you.

311
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,320
It'll make your skin look fair.

312
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,650
They look good.

313
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,590
Stop laughing, Mr. Zhong.

314
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,320
I'm doing this for your company.

315
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,980
Alright. Wait for me.

316
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,420
I'm also wearing red slippers with you, okay?

317
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,820
Stop joking like this, Mr. Zhong.

318
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,550
There's a truck ahead which has turned over.

319
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,390
The road is blocked. We can't get through.

320
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,480
Let's go and have a look.

321
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,270
What did he say?

322
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,630
Wait a moment. I'll make a call and ask about it.

323
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,320
Hello, Mr. Li. What's going on?

324
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,710
Okay. I got it.

325
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,370
You should stay safe, too.

326
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,630
What did he say?

327
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,160
Our car is blocked, too. It can't come inside here.

328
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,480
The earliest time it can arrive is tomorrow morning.

329
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,900
Let's go back to the farm first.

330
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,110
Otherwise, we'll have no place to stay tonight.

331
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,490
You can't buy this new kind of corn in the city.

332
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,950
I'll roast two for you.

333
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,030
Just taste them.

334
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,230
Let's taste the delicious food.

335
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,230
It's almost done.

336
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,750
Go on roasting them.

337
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,650
I'll clean up your room.

338
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,680
Don't bother, sir.

339
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,840
We can do it ourselves.

340
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,070
You are not familiar with the positions of the necessities.

341
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,950
I'll go clear it up.

342
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,430
Thank you.

343
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,290
Thanks, sir.

344
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,790
You're welcome.

345
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,270
Luckily, we had breakfast today.

346
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,450
Otherwise, we would have starved till now.

347
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,180
Pancakes are the food of the laborers.

348
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,930
Corn is also the harvest of the laborers.

349
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,150
Today, you said that when you were a kid, you followed your grandfather

350
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,670
to sell popcorn outside.

351
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,320
You must have been exposed to the sun and wind inevitably.

352
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,570
It was tough, right?

353
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,660
When I was a kid, I could run fast.

354
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,600
I followed my grandfather to run a stall on the street.

355
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,480
As long as there was someone coming,

356
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,790
I would tell him to shout louder.

357
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,980
At first,

358
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,870
we just kept running around like that.

359
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,270
Later, my grandfather opened his own shop.

360
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,190
After that, my dad expanded the business increasingly,

361
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,710
and opened some chain stores.

362
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,270
He also opened a company and a factory.

363
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,270
He even went abroad

364
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,810
to make all kinds of snacks.

365
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,440
Your grandfather started his business from scratch. That's amazing.

366
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,150
I envy you for having such a happy family.

367
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,030
I think they also loved you very much, right?

368
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,150
They did love me.

369
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,260
But as I grew up,

370
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,790
I went through the rebellious phase.

371
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,150
They thought that I was too naughty

372
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,270
and I always caused trouble.

373
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,040
They thought I would probably be a loser.

374
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,650
So, they just let my elder brother stay by their sides

375
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,400
and made him get more and more excellent

376
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,430
so that he could become their pride.

377
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,310
I see.

378
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,770
It was so unfair.

379
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,290
Hearing that, I feel unhappy, too.

380
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,350
It's okay.

381
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,780
I think it's nothing.

382
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,030
Just think about it.

383
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,210
I actually lived an easy life back then.

384
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,780
I wasn't as stressed as my brother.

385
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,250
However,

386
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,950
there's still someone to whom I should say sorry.

387
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,710
There's someone to whom you should say sorry?

388
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,030
Forget it. Let's not talk about this. It's useless to talk about it.

389
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,750
Usually,

390
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,500
I can see all kinds of lights at night.

391
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,670
I haven't seen stars so clearly for a long time.

392
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,500
Look.

393
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,230
That brightest one

394
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,620
is Sirius.

395
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,360
It's the brightest star that humans have known so far.

396
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,070
Where is it?

397
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,520
Look. It's over there.

398
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,470
That area

399
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,660
and the area over there.

400
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,230
If it's connected with other stars

401
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,670
of the Canis Major, the shape is like a dog.

402
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,630
Sirius is at the mouth of the dog.

403
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,990
Can you see it?

404
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,070
Thank you.

405
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,060
It's been a long time since someone just had

406
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,510
a casual chat with me like this last time.

407
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,770
What's wrong?

408
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,950
You're so busy that you don't even have friends?

409
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,790
Not really.

410
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,230
I don't know whether it's because my situation has changed.

411
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,390
I always feel that I don't know

412
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,270
what to talk about with my friends.

413
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,940
I don't know if they can be considered as my friends.

414
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,690
♫If one day♫

415
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,230
Gradually losing some friends

416
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,500
♫Life is off track♫

417
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,430
might be the normal state of life.

418
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,270
I'm sorry for

419
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:35,340
♫We'll still be laughing and playing the freest melody♫

420
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,790
what happened before.

421
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,190
What kind of apology is that?

422
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,150
During the phase of offering proposals,

423
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,750
I made you waste so much time.

424
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,750
♫We won't fall♫

425
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,640
I did have some selfish motives.

426
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,080
♫We'll fly higher in the sky♫

427
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,550
What selfish motives were they?

428
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,230
Our group might not need

429
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,940
♫Gently and firmly♫

430
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,390
such a small popcorn company.

431
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,570
♫We're getting closer♫

432
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,750
But I know

433
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,800
how hard it was when my grandfather started the business.

434
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,710
♫Bid farewell to the past, turn around and go♫

435
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,680
If it weren't for you,

436
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,150
I wouldn't have come this far.

437
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,660
♫To the next destination♫

438
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,230
Because of me?

439
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:05,390
♫The starlight along the way falls in our palms♫

440
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,270
Because I saw

441
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,390
efforts and and passion on you.

442
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,240
You were very energetic.

443
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,770
♫Look at the sea of stars♫

444
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:13,040
♫We snuggle up to each other under the night sky♫

445
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,870
It was because I had no choice.

446
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,470
You saw the situation of my family.

447
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,050
♫I start looking forward♫

448
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,270
If I didn't work hard,

449
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,210
♫To growing up and being loved♫

450
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,510
I would live a miserable life.

451
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,230
It's the same to me.

452
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,230
Since both of us have no choice,

453
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,570
♫Time flies♫

454
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,750
let's do our best together.

455
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,610
♫Someone's there to share my happiness and sorrow♫

456
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,990
If we can't defeat our fate, let's just lie down.

457
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,030
At least, we can see

458
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,510
the stars more clearly.

459
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,030
We can go farther if we stand up.

460
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,310
♫That's you♫

461
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,750
Come on.

462
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:40,520
♫You're an expected surprise♫

463
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:33,990
It's done.

464
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,110
It smells so good.

465
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,540
Mine is burned.

466
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,350
Look.

467
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,470
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,910
We don't have any extra rooms here.

469
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,030
I'm afraid you have to

470
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,230
make do with it and stay in the same room for a night.

471
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,630
Forgive me if I'm not looking after you well.

472
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,270
It's okay.

473
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,990
We've disturbed you, too.

474
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,790
Right.

475
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,990
If you weren't here,

476
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,110
we wouldn't know where to sleep.

477
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,490
We should thank you.

478
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,660
You're welcome.

479
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,280
Come on. Have a rest.

480
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,160
How can we sleep like this?

481
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,770
It's too noisy.

482
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,530
Grandpa Shen prepared the breakfast.

483
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,990
Thank you, Grandpa Shen.

484
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,690
Finally, we made it till the next day.

485
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,190
It's daytime now.

486
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,260
All the barriers on the road have been cleared.

487
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,910
You can go back after breakfast.

488
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
That's great.

489
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,190
Enjoy your breakfast.

490
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,670
Thanks for your breakfast, Grandpa Shen.

491
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,230
Eggs.

492
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,680
It'll get dark after you finish peeling it.

493
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,300
Just eat it at once. The driver will arrive soon.

494
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,180
We're finally back.

495
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,740
I feel like my whole body is going to fall apart.

496
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,820
I need to get energetic to put out the fire.

497
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,670
What fire?

498
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,710
Before I tell you,

499
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,460
I should solve the problem myself.

500
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,430
Bye.

501
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,480
Bai Lele.

502
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,940
What's wrong with you?

503
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,630
Why did you take away the printing factory's scheduled time for my project?

504
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,170
I made the decision with them first.

505
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,510
Talk responsibly.

506
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,000
What do you mean by taking it away?

507
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,340
We did cooperate with each other,

508
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,770
and I used a reasonable way.

509
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,470
Director Zhang told me that

510
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,560
the scheduled time had been occupied.

511
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,200
They can't help me print the buckets

512
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,800
because they've taken your order.

513
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,710
They did take my order.

514
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,230
I heard that you went to see them,

515
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,170
so I asked them, too.

516
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:19,990
I told them that

517
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,150
I was in a hurry to print

518
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,400
a big batch of propaganda posters.

519
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,570
I even increased the price.

520
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,710
They also agreed.

521
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,750
I didn't ask them to cancel your order

522
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,510
so as to finish my work.

523
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,510
But it was still due to the fact that you asked them.

524
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,270
What if you didn't ask them?

525
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,360
Both of you should calm down.

526
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,870
Hearing what you said,

527
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,860
it's the printing factory's fault.

528
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,690
They didn't keep their promises, and they forsook justice for interests.

529
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,820
We are colleagues from the same department.

530
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,080
There's no need to hurt our friendship, right?

531
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,630
What do you think I should do now?

532
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,010
Gao, wait a moment.

533
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,480
I'll call them and ask about it for you.

534
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,710
Lele, don't do this again.

535
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,180
Got it.

536
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,200
Thank you, Ju Ran.

537
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,850
Since Ju Ran is going to help you, your problem will be solved quickly.

538
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,760
Okay.

539
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,550
It's done.

540
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,640
Although the cost has increased by 10%.

541
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,120
they can start working on time.

542
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,710
Thank you, Ju Ran.

543
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,510
You're awesome, Ju Ran.

544
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,230
Be careful.

545
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,190
Why do you have to go to the printing factory personally?

546
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,510
Your company cooperates with a supplier in order to solve problems,

547
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,870
instead of letting me create problems.

548
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,470
Although I haven't been in this industry for long,

549
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,190
I still know this small principle.

550
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,230
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

551
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,010
No, I can do it myself.

552
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,670
Come on. I can take this chance to ride my motorcycle.

553
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,200
Time to eat. Come on.

554
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,750
My mom has learned to cook so many dishes now.

555
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,150
Just taste them. They must be delicious.

556
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,480
How is it?

557
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,270
How come

558
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,630
its taste is a little strange?

559
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,700
Really?

560
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,630
Let me try another one.

561
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,950
This one is delicious.

562
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,720
It's delicious.

563
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,390
This dish is delicious.

564
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,400
Let me taste it.

565
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,270
How is it?

566
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,630
This one is the most delicious.

567
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,730
My mom is amazing.

568
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,790
It's delicious, isn't it?

569
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,510
What's wrong?

570
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,710
How come

571
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,870
my belly is aching?

572
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,920
Really?

573
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,600
Hello.

574
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,180
What?

575
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,270
Okay. I'll be right there.

576
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,340
What's wrong?

577
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,730
Nothing.

578
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,320
I have to...

579
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,710
Really?

580
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,630
They told me that

581
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,050
the water pipe on the second floor of the warehouse was broken.

582
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,990
If we don't protect the buckets well tonight,

583
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,470
all of them will become useless tomorrow.

584
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,870
The point is that now we don't know the exact position of the leakage,

585
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,190
so we need to take protective measures on all of them.

586
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,690
Mr. Zhong, I've brought you the waterproof cloth.

587
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,910
Okay. You can handle the buckets there. We'll handle the ones over there.

588
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,390
Okay.

589
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,070
Give it to me.

590
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,800
The takeout food.

591
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,380
Hello, here's your takeout food.

592
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,750
Enjoy your meal.

593
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,560
Thank you.

594
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,990
It seems that there are still many people working

595
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,650
at this hour.

596
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,070
Why do you look so pale? Are you sick?

597
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,310
Don't mention it.

598
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,470
I ate a feast prepared by my mom.

599
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,170
I suffered from loose bowels after eating it.

600
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,240
When I heard that something wrong happened to the factory,

601
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,770
I immediately came back to life.

602
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,990
I'm totally exhausted now.

603
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,990
You should have told me about it earlier.

604
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,550
I could have hired some workers to do this.

605
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,270
You didn't have to risk your life

606
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,510
for the sake of our company's business.

607
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,990
You even took the lead to protect the buckets.

608
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,510
How could I not do this personally?

609
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,710
Besides,

610
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,060
now I'm relieved to see that all the buckets

611
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,130
are protected well.

612
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,280
I didn't expect that

613
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,670
every segment of this event

614
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,070
would be so worrying.

615
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,480
As people always said,

616
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,710
when suffering ends, happiness will come.

617
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,790
If we finish enduring all the hardships

618
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,310
in this project now,

619
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,990
then we'll only have good days left.

620
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,170
It's 4:30 now.

621
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,510
Now it's not too late for you to go back and sleep.

622
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,830
I'm afraid I won't be able to get up after I fall asleep.

623
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,950
Are you the kind of person who can't get up after falling asleep?

624
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,990
Of course not.

625
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,270
Be careful.

626
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,310
Hello.

627
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,030
I called you all morning but you didn't answer the phone.

628
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,000
I thought that you couldn't get up after falling asleep.

629
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,410
I haven't got up yet indeed.

630
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,680
What's the matter?

631
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,710
Maybe I've

632
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,150
let you down again.

633
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,470
Did something wrong happen?

634
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,450
They told me that

635
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,350
there was something wrong with the circuits in the popcorn factory.

636
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,710
They might have to suspend the work for some time to inspect the circuits carefully.

637
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,850
Otherwise, the workers' safety can't be guaranteed.

638
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,380
Well, what do you mean?

639
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,190
I heard that Gaogui went to collect materials

640
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,710
with our client today during the weekend.

641
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,310
Gaogui, you can take this chance

642
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,190
to share your joy with us.

643
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,550
How about this?

644
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,239
Let's all report the progress of our recent work.

645
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,949
Zhen Gaogui.

646
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,060
You should report it first.

647
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,480
Tell us the good news.

648
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:26,010
Recently, I've been in charge of

649
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,940
the Mid-Autumn Festival promotion event for Meton Popcorn.

650
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,440
You need to mention the specific schedules in your report.

651
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:36,270
Haven't you just been to the farm to collect materials?

652
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,719
The buckets have been printed, too.

653
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,270
What's the next step?

654
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,949
Next,

655
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,280
we'll need to pay the deposit of the printing cost.

656
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,510
Then we can deliver the goods and promote the sales of them.

657
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,670
However,

658
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,360
a small accident happened.

659
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,980
Did your team have this accident

660
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,490
or their company have this accident?

661
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,460
Only until this morning did I find out that

662
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,530
the factory couldn't deliver the goods.

663
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,330
Maybe our goods

664
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,470
can only be delivered after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

665
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,750
Such an unreliable client should be

666
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,990
abandoned as soon as possible.

667
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,270
They will go bankrupt sooner or later.

668
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,550
Does the packaging of this batch of goods

669
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,310
have the patterns of the Mid-Autumn Festival?

670
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,830
I seem to remember that

671
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,090
there are the pictures of the fairy tale world.

672
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,320
It seems that the words

673
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,620
"Reunion on Mid-Autumn Festival" are written on it, too.

674
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,760
If this batch of goods

675
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,470
can't be sold on Mid-Autumn Festival,

676
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,090
they'll become waste products, right?

677
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,610
Well,

678
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,980
now you mean that

679
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,830
our company has to take the risk?

680
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,700
No, no, no.

681
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,940
My heart can't take it.

682
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,100
Does our company need to transfer the money

683
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,230
to the printing factory?

684
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,550
I promised that

685
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,870
the cost would be paid by our company first.

686
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,430
Zhen Gaogui.

687
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,830
Come with me.

688
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,140
Director.

689
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,060
I know this problem is a bit tricky.

690
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,270
But don't worry.

691
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,830
I said that I would solve it myself,

692
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,230
and I'll keep my promise.

693
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,100
Are you really going to bear the responsibility yourself?

694
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,430
Of course.

695
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,070
I'll keep my word.

696
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,340
Actually, when you took this project,

697
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,480
you should have anticipated the result in advance.

698
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,950
In the implementation process,

699
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,300
there would be all kinds of unexpected problems,

700
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,860
which might lead to suspension of the project.

701
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,360
Very good.

702
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,260
Director, what are you talking about?

703
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,390
Something wrong happened, but you said this was good.

704
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,340
I mean, although you are a bit reckless while working,

705
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,880
you still keep dreaming and keep working hard.

706
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,910
You're much better than other colleagues.

707
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,220
When I was still a newbie like you,

708
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,550
I was not as bold as you.

709
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,930
But it seems that

710
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,190
you're quite similar to me when I was a newbie.

711
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,380
Have you figured out what to do?

712
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,630
What do you mean by showing me this?

713
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,300
Director.

714
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,750
I plan to try one last time

715
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,890
to solve this problem.

716
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,310
If I fail,

717
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,390
I'll bear the cost myself

718
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,900
as I said.

719
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,950
This credit card was left to me by my dad when he was alive.

720
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,730
Its credit limit

721
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,340
is high enough to pay the printing cost.

722
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,670
Now,

723
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,060
it's time to use it.

724
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,550
Are you going to ask our company

725
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,280
to transfer the money to the printing factory first?

726
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,890
If Meton doesn't pay us the money,

727
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,820
you'll fill the gap yourself.

728
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,930
If Meton successfully pays us the money,

729
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,500
can I become a regular employee in advance?

730
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:02,950
Sure.

731
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,900
I'll apply to the company

732
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,690
for paying the printing fees on time.

733
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,690
I'm returning this to you.

734
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,290
Work hard on the following process.

735
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,030
Thank you, Director.

736
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,450
I'll do my best.

737
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,280
Go for it!

738
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,410
What a painful lesson I've learned.

739
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,910
I have to endure all the work pressure alone.

740
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,630
What kind of company is that?

741
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,920
Your leader even asked you to be the scapegoat.

742
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,720
Actually, I didn't want to make things difficult for my leader.

743
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,120
I bet all my money on this project.

744
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,670
I can only stake everything on this one last chance.

745
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,730
Don't indulge in your work too much.

746
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,470
There's no need to

747
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,430
take such a big risk.
