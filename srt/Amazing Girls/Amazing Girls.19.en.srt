Tomorrow, after checking out,

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,030
we'll gather in the hotel lobby.

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,270
Is that all you wanted to say?

42
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,150
What do you take me for?

43
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,030
Does what you did just now mean nothing?

44
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,430
Well, it was an urgent situation.

45
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,630
I didn't want you to get hurt.

46
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,710

And at that moment,

48
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,590
I was afraid of losing you.

49
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,710
You didn't lose me in the end.

50
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,630
Seeing me safe and sound, you decided to keep the game going, right?

51
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,110
No, that's not what I meant.

52
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,870
Don't you think you've gone way out of line?

There's a new proposal in northeast China.

58
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,110
Tomorrow you'll leave with them.

59
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,190
Is that okay?

60
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,030
It's okay.

61
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,270
Thank you for your hard work.

62
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,390
I planned to tour around the city with you

63
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,070
but now there's no time for that.

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,420
I'll find a chance to make it up to you.

65
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,390
This is supposed to be a business trip.

66
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,950
We shouldn't go out for fun.

67
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,270
Have you heard this before?

68
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,270
Spenders can be great money makers.

69

That's why those who play hard

70
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,070
also work hard.

71
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,830
I've just become a regular employee.

72
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,270
I should be more devoted to my job.

73
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,830
There's nothing wrong with improving your work performance.

74
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,950
But

75
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,620
you can just be yourself when I'm around.

76
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,030
Mr. Zhong.

77
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,390
Mr. Zhong.

78
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,750
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,430
An new matter just came up.

80
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,380
I'm afraid I need to leave early.

81
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,750
I'm handing over the summary report

82
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,950

83
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,430
I appreciate your team's work in these days.

84
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,070
We're just doing our job.

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,510
I'll leave you two alone so you could talk.

86
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,630
I have nothing to talk about with him.

87
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,820
I've got work to do. I should get going.

88
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,830
Wish you a safe trip tomorrow.

89
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,950
Thanks.

90
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,950
Look at you.

91
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,390
You always appear spirited in the office.

92
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,150
You're so full of vigor.

93
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,150
How could you be so deeply upset by someone?

94
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,390
Upset?

95
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,390
I'm not.

96
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,750
I've spent too much time working with him.

97
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,070
So I get a bit annoyed when I see him.

98
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,390
The fact that you're upset by him

99
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,630
means you expect something from him.

100
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,310
I don't know what you're expecting from him,

101
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,190
but it seems to me

102
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,190
that he can't live up to your expectations.

103
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,510
I'm not expecting anything from him.

104
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,950
Plus, whether he can meet

105
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,830
anyone's expectations or not doesn't matter.

106
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,750
After all, he doesn't know

107
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,310
what others expect from him.

108
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,950
When the company was in a mess,

109
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,510
you were not as sad

110
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,830
as you are now.

111
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,150
Is it because of Zhen Gaogui?

112
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,430
Stop making random guesses.

113
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,830
Nothing is going on between me and her.

114
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,510
You feel melancholy

115
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,830
exactly because nothing has happened.

116
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,750
Can't you take the initiative?

117
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,590
Are you really afraid of

118
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,070
rumor and gossip?

119
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,310
I'm not concerned about those.

120
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,510
But I do have my own reasons.

121
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,510
I'm a little tired.

122
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,590
I can't imagine you would actually say that.

123
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,750
When others say they're tired, I believe them.

124
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,270
But I don't think an athlete like you

125
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,830
would get tired even if the expo

126
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,070
goes on for another month.

127
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,390
Director Lu.

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,270
I want to be alone for a while.

129
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,190
Okay. Bye.

130
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,070
Are you really in a relationship

131
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,150
with Director Lu?

132
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,750
Yes.

133
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,870
But she and I are gonna keep it secret.

134
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,830
To help maintain her image,

135
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,270
we've decided not to disclose our relationship.

136
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,310
Did you ask her to be your girlfriend?

137
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,510
Not really.

138
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,830
She said that's unnecessary.

139
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,510
She just suggested

140
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,310
that we should get together.

141
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,990
I'm so envious of you two.

142
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,470
I've been hanging out with you everyday.

143
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,430
That makes me an intruder, doesn't it?

144
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,710
No.

145
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,390
She and I will have many opportunities to spend time together.

146
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,510
In fact,

147
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,830
I'm a little worried about you.

148
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,750
What is it about me that makes you worried?

149
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,270
I'm great at my job.

150
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,669
Life is not just about jobs.

151
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,549
Every now and then,there would be

152
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,750
pleasant surprises in your life.

153
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,030
For example,

154
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,670
you go to paint in a mountain.

155
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,030
Let's say you are drawing a tree.

156
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,470
As that goes on,

157
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,550
you feel hungry.

158
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,670
Suddenly, you find a bunch of wild fruits.

159
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,510
The fruits are a pleasant surprise for you.

160
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,350
It's a gift.

161
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,150
Do you think

162
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,750
everything you own now

163
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,110
is what you have expected?

164
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,380
When you get what you have expected,

165
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,110
that's already an achievement.

166
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,750
If you get something unexpected,

167
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,270
take it as a bonus.

168
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,150
I've done a lot of thinking since I returned to the country.

169
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,630
In the past,

170
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,030
I used to take everything I owned

171
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,550
for granted.

172
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,270
But now,

173
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,750
I find nothing is more reassuring

174
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,910
than what I've created with my own hands.

175
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,510
But there are many occasions

176
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,740
where hard work is not helpful at all.

177
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,750
If you think hard work can bring you

178
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,510
everything you want, then you must be

179
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,150
oversimplifying how the world works.

180
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,550
Are you having trouble conquering your boss

181
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,150
Mr. Zhong?

182
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,390
Conquer whom?

183
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,990
Nothing's going on between me and him.

184
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,470
I don't want to hear his name.

185
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,030
Don't you think everyone has found it out?

186
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,240
Only you two think you're hiding it well.

187
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,990
You have no idea. He even...

188
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,350
Anyway, he refuses to face the problem.

189
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,630
I don't know what's on his mind.

190
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,150
Everything will be much better if it's easy

191
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,340
to figure out what a person is thinking.

192
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,750
If you don't think he's a good match for you

193
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,510
then you shouldn't waste time on him.

194
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,630
Scumbag! Men are scumbags!

195
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,870
The guy I told you about turns out to be a pure scumbag!

196
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,870
Not all the men are like that.

197
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,030
Maybe he has his own reasons.

198
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,790
Are you my friend or his?

199
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,350
Why would you defend someone you don't know?

200
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,430
You should join me in the trash talk!

201
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,830
I don't mean to defend him.

202
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,670
I'm just objectively

203
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,670
analyzing the situation for you.

204
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,390
You still have feelings for him.

205
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,870
And this hat...

206
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,110
Stay away from me.

207
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,870
What's wrong? I'd love to be closer to you.

208
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,150
Just move over.

209
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,990
That's no good.

210
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,150
There you are.

211
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,350
Have a seat.

212
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,670
Have you had breakfast yet?

213
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,150
What did you eat?

214
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,270
I can't recall it.

215
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,750
What made you unhappy in the morning?

216
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,030
Did something happen?

217
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,510
Gaogui!

218
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,750
There you are.

219
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:35,990
Good morning.

220
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,550
-Morning.
-Morning.

221
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,390
Have you had breakfast yet?

222
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,270
Yes.

223
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,230
Well... Right!

224
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,150
You should sit here.

225
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,270
I'll take a seat over there.

226
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:42,870
Don't bother.

227
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,630
I ate too much during breakfast. Standing is good for digestion.

228
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,110
What did you eat?

229
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,390
I can't recall it.

230
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,870
Have you two had breakfast yet?

231
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,860
Yes. We had it together.

232
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,390
No. I mean...

233
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,390
We were eating separately when we ran into

234
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,030
each other in the restaurant.

235
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,230
So we ended up having breakfast together.

236
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,240
Gaogui,

237
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,630
why don't you sit down?

238
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,670
Okay.

239
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,390
Anything wrong?

240
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,910
Has the car arrived yet?

241
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,870
It'll be here soon, I guess.

242
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,630
Shall we wait outside?

243
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,390
Sounds nice.

244
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,390
Let's go. We'll go out there.

245
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,870
Look at them!

246
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,390
The car is here. Let's go.

247
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,270
Give it to me.

248
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,550
What's that about?

249
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,750
Did you have a fight with her?

250
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,230
What on earth happened?

251
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,910
Last night I was wondering

252
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,150
why she was so upset.

253
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,660
She even had drinks.

254
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,990
Did she have drinks with you?

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,860
What did she say?

256
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,630
Don't you already have an answer to that?

257
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,630
Just tell me what she said.

258
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,390
She said a particular man annoyed her.

259
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,510
Obviously, that man wanted to have a closer relationship

260
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,630
with her, but he just wouldn't admit it.

261
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,750
She said that man must be a scumbag.

262
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,470
That said, it's possible for a scumbag

263
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,270
to change and correct all his mistakes.

264
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,510
There is still hope.

265
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,910
As for what remains unsaid, think about it.

266
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,630
That's all I can do for you.

267
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,390
Let's get in the car.

268
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,510
Is it delicious?

269
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,270
Yes.

270
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,790
Right? Have some more.

271
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,270
Did you go on a business trip with Zhong?

272
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,550
My job was to help him with an event.

273
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,740
Young people like you

274
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,230
in group activities

275
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,390
could easily click with one another, right?

276
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,230
Did you and Zhong

277
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,910
develop feelings for each other?

278
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,110
No.

279
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,500
No?

280
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,270
You meant to say yes, didn't you?

281
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,750
I had told Zhong

282
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,910
that he'd better

283
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,990
create chances and fight for you.

284
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,790
What?

285
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,470
What did you just say?

286
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,510
I mean, look at him.

287
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,270
He doesn't seem to be a bad person, does he?

288
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,350
How come it sounds like

289
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,140
he's a liar?

290
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,750
What liar?

291
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,750
What can he lie to me about?

292
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,150
What good can he get from lying to me?

293
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,150
Well, liars scam people

294
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,510
for love

295
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,550
or for money.

296
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,150
As for money,

297
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,630
we have to save it up to repay our debts.

298
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,870
As for love,

299
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,750
I don't think

300
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,270
you're able to offer much of that,

301
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,230
are you?

302
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,750
So, mom, in your eyes,

303
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,510
I'm not even worth being lied to, am I?

304
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,990
That's not I'm saying.

305
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,470
See, there is an expiration date

306
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,510
on things between people.

307
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,270
Don't you think so?

308
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,790
Look. It's just like the fried chicken here.

309
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,150
It says the chicken

310
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,510
[It tastes best within two hours.]

311
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,870
had better be consumed within 2 hours.

312
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,030
Right?

313
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,910
What I am saying is

314
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,550
that you and Zhong should quickly move on to

315
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,750
the next step at the most appropriate time.

316
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,470
If you let go of this chance,

317
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,910
who knows

318
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,030
when you will get another chance?

319
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,550
This is what I really mean.

320
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,790
The joint marketing campaign

321
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,390
for Dooro Bear and Meton Food

322
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,990
has progressed to the stage

323
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,270
where we'll release a series of vertical scrolling comics and advertising copies.

324
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,750
Please tell the designers in your company

325
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,390
to coordinate with the plan.

326
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,350
No problem.

327
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,120
You're the boss's girlfriend now...

328
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,870
Get back to where you were seated.

329
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,230
You're the boss's girlfriend now.

330
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,480
It goes without saying that my company will go along with all your plans.

331
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,270
The working hours aren't over yet.

332
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,110
I'm the brand manager of my company.

333
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,870
Everything unrelated to business

334
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,510
will be discussed after work.

335
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,230
We're off work now.

336
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,630
The working hours ended seven minutes ago.

337
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,150
What have you planned for us?

338
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,540
We'll do something interesting.

339
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,620
For instance,

340
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,869
we can make an oil painting.

341
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,030
Painting?

342
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,109
But I don't know how to do that at all.

343
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,910
Just spend 5 minutes learning it.

344
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,030
A smart lady like you

345
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,710
will surely get the hang of it in 5 minutes.

346
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,310
It'll be an immersive stress relieving experience.

347
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,670
Let's go.

348
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,349
Wait.

349
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,960
[One person only; Do not tag along]

350
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,510
Isn't that Director Lu?

351
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,830
Her image as a tough woman is ruined.

352
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,470
I'm sending you a photo.

353
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,830
What is it about?

354
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,430
Look at that!

355
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,190
This photo is going viral.

356
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,990
It must be secretly taken outside a hotel.

357
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,780
Things are ramping up quite fast.

358
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,180
[One person only; Do not tag along]

359
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,790
No way! Look at this!

360
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,950
Is it her?

361
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,270
Never have I expected...

362
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,310
It's her.

363
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,030
Look, it's her exactly!

364
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,580
It really is her.

365
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,190
She's so different from usual in this photo.

366
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah.

367
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,470
Ding Longlong.

368
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,310
There's a problem with your daily report.

369
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,350
Daily report?

370
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,230
Is it just me or do you also notice

371
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,550
that people are behaving oddly today?

372
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,270
Has anything happened in the company?

373
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,030
Don't tell me you have no idea of this.

374
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,670
How can you not know about your own business?

375
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,550
My own business?

376
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,790
Spill it. Don't waste my time.

377
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,230
I need to attend a meeting soon.

378
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,820
Bye.

379
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,710
I saw it online.

380
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,110
Everyone in the office has seen it.

381
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,990
The photo looks like a poster.

382
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,190
I thought you must be very happy about it

383
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,670
and that you'd like to announce it yourself.

384
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,300
But you don't seem quite happy now.

385
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,030
Go back to your work.

386
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,590
Come in.

387
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,950
These contracts await your signatures.

388
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,670
The two of you...

389
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,030
I don't want to talk about it.

390
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,910
I saw the photo.

391
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,590
I've told you I don't want to talk about it.

392
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,310
Lin Yue

393
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,230
is a great guy.

394
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,750
Zhen Gaogui is a great woman.

395
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,990
Enough. Let's change the subject.

396
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,990
When we talk about that, it's like

397
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,270
two underachievers copying each other's homework.

398
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,030
I don't think "underachiever" will ever be

399
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,550
a suitable description for me.

400
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,550
Fine.

401
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,470
Anyway,

402
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,750
I'll pretend not to know about your stuff,

403
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,750
and you pretend not to know about mine.

404
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,350
The previous snacks expo

405
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,230
has brought us a tiny bit of publicity.

406
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,670
Some companies want to cooperate with us.

407
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,550
We need you to decide the details.

408
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,670
Please come in.

409
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,030
Boss?

410
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,550
Are you busy?

411
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,550
Your work schedule says you'll have

412
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,270
a meeting in Meton today. Right?

413
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,950
Yes.

414
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,310
I'd like to discuss it with you.

415
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,110
Can I not attend the meeting today?

416
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,750
It's just about some routine reports.

417
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,270
I've sent over the files.

418
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,070
Could you fill in for me?

419
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,030
You don't want to go, do you?

420
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,990
What's the reason?

421
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,030
I'm not saying that I don't want to go.

422
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,190
It's just that a colleague has met

423
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:10,910
an urgent matter that requires my help.

424
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,430
I don't have time for the meeting.

425
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,030
An urgent matter?

426
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,990
How come I didn't know a thing about it?

427
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,990
It happened all of a sudden.

428
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,110
We couldn't find a chance to tell you.

429
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,910
Enough talking. I should probably get going.

430
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,230
Li Yingxiong, come here. Come.

431
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,230
What's up? Anything wrong?

432
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,680
Please do me a favor.

433
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,270
When Boss comes out later,

434
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,310
just pretend that you need my help

435
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,310
with something urgent.

436
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,750
I can't believe it.

437
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,110
Did you refuse an assignment from Boss?

438
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,270
It's nothing like that.

439
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,310
I'm a bit tired today

440
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,710
so I don't feel like attending a meeting.

441
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,750
Can you do me a favor?

442
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,550
Okay.

443
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,710
But I really need your help with something.

444
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,350
Be quick. What is it?

445
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,030
This is my favorite.

446
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,710
I also think it's pretty.

447
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,580
Let's go. We've got a meeting to attend.

448
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,750
Boss, look.

449
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,430
I’m in the middle of something.

450
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,030
Maybe I should stay while you go for the meeting.

451
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,590
The data shows we've delivered good results.

452
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,710
As the one in charge of the event,

453
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,590
you should do the report in person.

454
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,270
Even if you don't mean to take the credit for it,

455
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,790
you need to let people know what you've achieved.

456
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,990
I was just doing my job.

457
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,540
I shouldn't claim any credit. I'm not going.

458
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,820
You must show up or people would think

459
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,030
I'm doing everything within my power

460
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,580
to steal the fruits of victory from you.

461
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,030
If your dear Mr. Zhong Jr. thinks it's true,

462
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,190
he's gonna eat me alive.

463
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,470
He's not my dear.

464
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,230
There's nothing going on between me and him.

465
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,190
Grab your stuff and meet me at the door.

466
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,670
I've detected something unusual.

467
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,590
During that business trip,

468
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,510
something must have happened.

469
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,430
Nothing.

470
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,070
Mr. Zhong is way out of my league.

471
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,550
Director Lu.

472
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,780
Director Lu.

473
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,510
Are you looking for him?

474
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,550
He has gone out.

475
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,310
I'm the one you'll have the meeting with.

476
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,990
Sounds good.

477
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,360
[54 South Guangda Road]

478
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,270
Hello, aunties.

479
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,510
Come on.

480
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,990
There you are, Gaogui.

481
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,030
Welcome back.

482
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,430
What are you doing here?

483
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,900
We needed a fourth mahjong player

484
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,710
so we asked Zhong to come.

485
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,030
You could have invited anyone.

486
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,310
Why must it be him?

487
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,750
Listen to yourself!

488
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,480
You two went on a business trip, didn't you?

489
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,070
It's been long since I last saw Zhong.

490
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,550
I missed him.

491
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,670
Besides, he said he's not busy at work.

492
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,590
That's not true!

493
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,950
He's swamped.

494
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,750
Let's not waste Mr. Zhong's time.

495
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,230
No. I'm free. I was given a leave from work.

496
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,790
Gaogui, why don't you play with the aunties?

497
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,030
I'll cook for you.

498
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,310
No need.

499
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,030
Sorry, there's nothing you can cook here.

500
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,910
Shall I order takeout?

501
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,070
It's neither tasty nor nutritious.

502
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,990
I'll shop for food in the supermarket then.

503
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,950
It's not too late yet.

504
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,790
We can't trouble you with that. I'll go.

505
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,750
I'll go with you.

506
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,790
Zhong, I'm about to win!

507
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,070
We've lost a player.

508
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,030
Alright. Just sit down.

509
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,190
Let them go. We'll chat.

510
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,950
You are a guest.

511
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,510
I should do the food shopping.

512
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,070
Aunt Li doesn't eat leeks.

513
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,110
The aunties are on a low-calorie diet now.

514
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,550
Aunt Li doesn't eat seafood.

515
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,910
You stay here

516
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,030
and wait.

517
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,470
I need to make a call.

518
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,230
Hello?

519
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,720
Come out to meet me.

520
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,550
Just give me a second.

521
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,710
There's one more dish to go.

522
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,070
I'll be right back.

523
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,550
Zhong is capable of so many things.

524
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,750
He's diligent, too.

525
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,190
Yeah.

526
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,310
It's hard to find an ideal son-in-law like him.

527
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,750
I'm so envious.

528
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,500
Why didn't you bring your daughter

529
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,510
to the community speed dating event I organized last time?

530
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,580
Those men weren't good enough.

531
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,790
However,

532
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,710
if any of them had been half as good

533
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,070
as Zhong, I would've led my daughter there.

534
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,270
That's true.

535
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,430
Zhong is impeccable.

536
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,830
But he should really move things along

537
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,350
with Gaogui.

538
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,350
God knows what today's young people are thinking.

539
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,670
-Mom!
-They seem to be overly...

540
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,350
Stop talking about that!

541
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,710
They seem to be overly patient with it.

542
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,270
The fish is ready!

543
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,030
Here it comes.

544
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,830
Would you look at that?

545
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,060
You're such a quick learner.

546
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,950
Who did you learn it from?

547
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,430
No one. I watched a tutorial video online.

548
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,950
I'm not sure how it tastes.

549
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,030
Aunties, why not try it?

550
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,790
Sure. Sure.

551
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,990
Sure.

552
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,750
Hold on.

553
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,990
Let me take a photo first.

554
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,500
I'd like to take a photo of it.

555
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,350
Fenfang, I really envy you.

556
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,910
At this rate,

557
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,750
you'll get well soon.

558
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,350
Gaogui.

559
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,950
Why are you sitting there alone?

560
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,070
Come and eat.

561
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,910
I'm not hungry.

562
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,470
Let's eat. It's okay.

563
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,150
I made it specially for you.

564
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,830
He's so nice.

565
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,430
Hypocrite!

566
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,790
Isn't it good?

567
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,510
Definitely. So good.

568
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,790
It tastes wonderful.

569
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,990
You owe me money! Pay me back!

570
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,190
Everything's fine. Dig in, ladies.

571
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,950
You owe me money! Pay me back!

572
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,950
Open the door!

573
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,310
You've gotta repay your debts!

574
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,540
Didn't I transfer money to you last week?

575
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,820
Why would you come again?

576
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,070
You've paid off the principal

577
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,430
but not the interest!

578
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,990
Shut up and open the door now!

579
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,990
He just can't let me have a good night.

580
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,510
I'll talk to him.

581
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,270
You stay put.

582
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,310
You...

583
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,950
Alright.

584
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,670
Shout louder, I dare you!

585
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,260
You...

586
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,790
Listen.

587
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,710
Recently, my mom and I can't fall asleep

588
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,430
without you yelling.

589
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,750
Come on. Give me a louder shout.

590
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,470
I'll record it so that I can listen to it

591
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,190
as if it's white noise for my sleep. How's that?

592
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,910
Knock it off.

593
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,230
Just pay me back.

594
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,790
We agreed to pay you once half a month.

595
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,190
The next payment isn't due yet.

596
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,590
I've always been gentle to you

597
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,670
because you are my creditor.

598
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,030
If you stop doing what you're doing now,

599
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,190
I'll lodge a complaint about you disturbing us.

600
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,910
But...

601
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,710
Actually, my wife forced me to come.

602
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,030
She was afraid that you wouldn't repay us

603
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,030
if we didn't pressure you a bit.

604
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,270
I put a lot of trust in you.

605
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,910
You won't let me down, will you?

606
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,030
Do I look like a deadbeat to you?

607
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,430
Rest assured.

608
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,550
We’ll pay you as soon as we're able to.

609
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,190
Fine. Just make it quick.

610
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,990
Zhong Yiming.

611
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,110
Thank you for taking care of my mom these days.

612
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,790
Now you can put an end to that.

613
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,030
I already owe you a lot.

614
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,670
That's not true.

615
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,270
You don't owe me anything.

616
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,750
What on earth do you want?

617
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,710
You're nice to me while you deny

618
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,510
the possibility of further developing our relationship.

619
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,270
What's on your mind? I'm truly curious.

620
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,030
I care about you. That's all.

621
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,950
Do you know how abominable

622
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,310
that your so-called "care" is?

623
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,310
Can't you see it as a way I show care

624
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,990
to a good friend?

625
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,790
Do you do the same to the other good friends of yours?

626
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,830
I don't know.

627
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,110
I just

628
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,550
need some time.

629
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,270
Do you know

630
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,910
that people could run out of patience?

631
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,590
Has this matter put you in a tough spot?

632
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,830
Don't take it the wrong way.

633
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,230
It's not what you think it is.

634
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,950
But you haven't said anything.

635
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,230
Given your silence, I can only assume

636
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,990
that you're not serious about this at all.

637
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,270
Thank you, Mr. Zhong,

638
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,110
for showing me the complexity of humanity.

639
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,990
I...

640
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,310
Alright. Stop it now.

641
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,670
Come on. Cough it up.

642
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,830
What is it that you want to say to me?

643
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,350
Are Director Lu and Mr. Lin really dating each other?

644
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,830
Who could see that coming?

645
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,790
I don't think they are. She has denied it.

646
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,470
Even my mom said

647
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,710
her image as a smart and cold devil woman

648
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,990
would soon collapse.

649
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,750
You must be talking about that she-devil.

650
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,260
Yeah. What a pleasure to look at!

651
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,950
She spends 3 days and nights fighting monsters.

652
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,750
Come in.

653
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,550
Some friends of mine have told me

654
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,030
that during the Snacks Expo

655
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,030
Meton Food shined brilliantly.

656
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,310
Our comics platform also

657
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,230
gained more registered users on that day.

658
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,310
Dooro Bear enjoys great popularity.

659
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,350
The current media survey shows

660
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,670
that the conversion rate attributed to video platforms is especially high.

661
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,550
Next,

662
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,700
we'll carry out promotional plans.

663
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,270
We've gotta work harder.

664
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,480
Our team has written a proposal

665
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,750
about offline activities.

666
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,830
Today, we'll give final confirmation to it.

667
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,550
I'll leave it

668
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,200
to the two of you.

669
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,990
If Ke'er is okay with it, I'm okay with it.

670
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,510
Ke'er and I have good chemistry.

671
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,440
I'm sure everything will go perfectly.

672
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,750
I don't care what chemistry you have.

673
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,190
What matters to me is the result.

674
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,710
Ke'er.

675
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,470
We'll launch the plan we confirmed a week ago.

676
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,830
Now is a proper time for that, isn't it?

677
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,550
What do you think?

678
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,310
What did you post online?

679
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,830
We're at work. Let's focus on our job.

680
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,950
You two continue with the discussion.

681
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,510
I'm leaving.

682
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,030
Take your time.

683
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,710
What's wrong with you two?

684
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,190
Did you also make her mad?

685
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,260
No. I didn't.

686
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,110
We're on good terms.

687
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,310
She's gotta work hard in front of you.

688
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,780
After all, she's your employee, isn't she?

689
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,550
Is that so?

690
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,830
Haven't you made up with Zhen Gaogui yet?

691
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,470
We're on good terms.

692
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,670
I take it that nothing has changed.

693
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,060
What is it supposed to mean?

694
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,270
You make it sound like you're doing great.

695
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,310
I'm doing...

696
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,470
[Ke'er]

697
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,470
[Hang up]

698
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,710
What's up?

699
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,790
Well...

700
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,510
Shall we go out for dinner tonight?

701
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,470
No way!

702
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,590
[Ke'er]

703
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,590
[Hang up]

704
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,510
What does this mean?

705
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,270
I sincerely apologize to you.

706
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,750
I'm sorry.

707
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,550
Do you think a bouquet of flowers

708
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,270
can keep my anger at bay?

709
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,270
Wildly fluctuating emotions

710
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,590
lead to lower work efficiency.

711
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,710
I just want to cheer you up.

712
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,949
Is your way of cheering me up

713
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,070
including revealing our relationship

714
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,670
on the internet?

715
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,510
Do you remember our agreement?

716
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,389
We agreed to keep our relationship secret.

717
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,510
But now you've broken your promise!

718
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,070
I didn't want you

719
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,670
to bear too much pressure.

720
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,350
I thought the disclosure could stop...

721
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,350
By doing that, you've put more pressure on me.

722
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,710
I think we should have a break.

723
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,110
We need to calm down.

724
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,469
Wait... Wait a minute.

725
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,909
Let's talk it out.

726
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,550
We haven't really talked about it, have we?

727
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,310
Please talk with me.

728
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,030
Thank you so much

729
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,710
for playing mahjong with my mom.

730
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,630
You're very welcome.

731
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,190
I'm bad at mahjong.

732
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,790
I've gotta thank your mom for teaching me.

733
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,630
I had told you not to come but you came again.

734
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,230
I was worried.

735
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,510
Hello?

736
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,230
Can you come and help me?

737
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,350
I'm having a fight with Director Lu.

738
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,670
Okay. Send me an address.

739
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,870
I'll be right with you.

740
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,510
Who called you in the middle of the night?

741
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,510
Lin Yue.

742
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,470
What did he want?

743
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,790
I thought he's on a date with Lu Ke'er.

744
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,070
They're on the verge of breaking up. So he asked for my help.

745
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,350
Breaking up?

746
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,470
I'll go with you then.

747
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,190
Why?

748
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,630
I might be able to help.

749
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,150
Right?

750
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,470
Let's go.

751
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,910
Have I agreed to let you tag along?

752
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,310
Hello. How many people are in your party?

753
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,470
Two.

754
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,910
Can you lead us to Table 20?

755
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,310
Sure. This way, please.

756
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,590
I'd like to order this cocktail.

757
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:05,950
Thank you.

758
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,350
No problem.

759
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,310
Well, she drove here.

760
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,390
Get her a non-alcoholic drink.

761
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,910
Okay.

762
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,990
Who do you think you are to change my order?

763
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,230
I'll take this cocktail. Thank you.

764
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,540
Make it two.

765
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,430
Okay.

766
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,030
You...

767
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,670
Aren't you having a fight?
