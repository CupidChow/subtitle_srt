go downstairs and get me my coffee.

382
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,540
Ju Ran.

383
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,420
My surname is Zhen.

384
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,270
We're friends. It doesn't matter.

385
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,590
Go ahead.

386
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,750
I don't want the coffee if the ice melts.

387
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,070
Ju Ran.

388
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,070
Your coffee is here.

389
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,830
Put it here.

390
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,470
Make ten copies of this.

391
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,270
Then bind it up and bring it to me.

392
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,300
Okay.

393
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:50,970
Gaogui.

394
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,950
Are they asking you to help with odd jobs?

395
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,370
I'll do it.

396
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,670
How many copies do you want?

397
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,430
Ten.

398
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:02,950
Okay.

399
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,380
Let me tell you.

400
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,990
Our company is like this.

401
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,570
Although we don't rank by seniority,

402
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,140
we do rank based on performance.

403
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,510
Only when you have more signed clients and higher performance

404
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,900
can you ask others for help with odd tasks.

405
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,630
Otherwise, you can only work for others.

406
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,660
But it's normal.

407
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,070
You're a rookie.

408
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,670
So you have to seize the chance.

409
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,750
Sooner or later,

410
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,990
you'll have your own clients.

411
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,470
I'll do my best.

412
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,230
The brief for Meton Popcorn's

413
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,510
Mid-Autumn Festival promotion.

414
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,430
Do you understand what I said?

415
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,610
Okay.

416
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,910
The next step

417
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,230
is the final stage of our meeting.

418
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,190
There's a new marketing need recently.

419
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,150
Meton Popcorn.

420
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,150
Raise your hand if you want to join.

421
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,460
Me.

422
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,140
Zhen Gaogui.

423
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,870
Get ready then.

424
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,630
You guys continue to discuss.

425
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,950
The rest of you can be dismissed.

426
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,870
Gaogui. You're a rookie.

427
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,790
You don't have to do this.

428
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,030
I'm a rookie, so I need to learn a lot.

429
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,180
I'm not afraid of trouble.

430
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,430
I'm just afraid that I don't have a chance.

431
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,870
The reputation of Meton Popcorn in the industry...

432
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,610
Their result is always pre-decided.

433
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,230
They have fixed suppliers.

434
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,670
You're just playing along when you go for proposals.

435
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,990
You can't even make money. Why bother?

436
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,310
Only kids will give up.

437
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,470
Adults

438
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,440
would flog a dead horse.

439
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,110
Let's go.

440
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,260
[No work, no food]

441
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,300
Hello.

442
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,030
I was sent by the PR company to meet Mr. Zhong.

443
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,350
Please show me the invitation.

444
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:09,890
Okay.

445
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,220
[Meton Food Co., LTD]

446
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,410
Please.

447
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,470
Please bless me.

448
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,950
She is Director Zhang from Wisdom PR.

449
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,360
It is said that she has strong connections.

450
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,710
Judging from her expression,

451
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,190
I don't think we have a chance.

452
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,290
Xinda PR.

453
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,350
Here.

454
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,190
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,560
Thank you.

456
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,230
This is Zhen Gaogui from Xinda PR.

457
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,880
This is Mr. Zhong,

458
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,070
CEO of Meiton Popcorn.

459
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,510
You're Zhen Gaogui from Xinda PR?

460
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:17,800
Okay.

461
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,390
Please start your performance.

462
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,920
These days, it seems like

463
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,240
anyone can become a CEO.

464
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,330
No wonder your company has such a bad reputation.

465
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,710
What a weirdo!

466
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,640
Meton Popcorn, right?

467
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,570
A subsidiary under the Meiziwei Group.

468
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,070
In the last five years,

469
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,350
your sales dropped by 10 percent every year.

470
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,940
Your marketing strategy is exactly the same as ten years ago.

471
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,550
That means

472
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,630
you haven't improved at all.

473
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,470
Look at other companies.

474
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,580
They want to change their marketing strategy every quarter.

475
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,690
You guys are good.

476
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,060
You never changed.

477
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,910
And you still want to increase sales with our PR company?

478
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,000
Dream on.

479
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,510
Gaogui, what are you doing?

480
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,870
It's meeting time.

481
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,050
Is the printer broken?

482
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,140
The administration department said the printer ran out of ink,

483
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,010
so they asked me to refill it.

484
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,350
You...

485
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,690
Come to the meeting now.

486
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,560
I'll be right there.

487
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,790
Our first half year's work is still ideal.

488
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,650
Despite encountering some problems,

489
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,510
we should learn

490
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,430
from them and keep growing.

491
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,300
Zhen Gaogui.

492
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,190
Yes.

493
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,790
Boss.

494
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,190
I'm here to be scolded.

495
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,950
Do you know what you did wrong?

496
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,790
Tell me.

497
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,790
I...

498
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,510
I shouldn't be late for the meeting.

499
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,430
What else?

500
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,970
I should have learned to change the ink box long ago.

501
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,550
Guys.

502
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,190
Let's give Zhen Gaogui a round of applause.

503
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,430
Our client Meton

504
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,400
had some grudges

505
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,520
against us before.

506
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,600
But because Zhen Gaogui is a newcomer,

507
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,020
she had no concerns.

508
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,890
She expressed her opinions boldly

509
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,630
and gained their recognition.

510
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,750
And you still want to increase sales with our PR company?

511
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,790
Dream on.

512
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,000
How could you say that?

513
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,030
Do you have any ideas?

514
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,390
I have many ideas.

515
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,630
I feel like

516
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,120
your product packaging,

517
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,110
positioning, and image

518
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,950
all need to be changed.

519
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,520
You'd better change your brain.

520
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,710
The consumers are much smarter than you.

521
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,390
Wait.

522
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,630
Which company did you say you are from?

523
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,220
Xinda PR.

524
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,710
Complain about me if you dare.

525
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,840
I'm leaving.

526
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,350
How well did you prepare for the Mid-Autumn Festival promotion?

527
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,910
I'm looking forward to your wonderful performance.

528
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,780
Mr. Zhong.

529
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,190
There are so many companies we can work with.

530
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,520
Since that's her attitude,

531
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,430
just forget it.

532
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,160
What do you mean?

533
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Can we

534
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,710
make a proposal?

535
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,190
Go back and prepare well for the proposal.

536
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,610
I think

537
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,440
your idea is good.

538
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,720
Actually

539
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,910
I didn't do anything.

540
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,150
No matter what the result is,

541
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,000
it's worth learning

542
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,630
that you dare to try.

543
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,350
Thank you, Boss.

544
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,030
Alright, don't be late for the next meeting.

545
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,520
I bought breakfast for everyone.

546
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,440
What's wrong?

547
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,870
I heard you created a miracle

548
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,180
due to fearlessness at Meton.

549
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,790
Actually,

550
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,420
I don't know what happened.

551
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,990
Actually, I had some

552
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,420
grudges with Mr. Zhong.

553
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,430
Then,

554
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,870
I scolded him.

555
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,270
I thought

556
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,970
I wouldn't have a chance to propose.

557
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,070
I didn't expect him to be so happy after hearing it.

558
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,950
He asked me to prepare for the proposal well.

559
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,150
Do you think

560
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,650
he likes to be scolded?

561
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,550
That's possible.

562
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,230
Let me tell you.

563
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,550
Many people

564
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,940
flatter people like him every day.

565
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,990
Maybe being scolded like this

566
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,510
he might feel you're different.

567
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,870
But let me tell you,

568
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,140
don't think he's born to like being scolded.

569
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,180
You better take advantage of this momentum

570
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,920
and give him some sweet talk.

571
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,710
Maybe

572
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,130
you can have him in a tight grip.

573
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,810
That makes sense.

574
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,870
Smile beautifully.

575
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,030
Even if you're out to experience life,

576
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,110
you still need to make money.

577
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,150
Boss, you know what?

578
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,850
[Director's Office]

579
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,910
Mr. Zhong Jr. unexpectedly invited Xinda PR,

580
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,850
a company outside our supplier database, to pitch.

581
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,710
They even scolded our company.

582
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,790
They scolded us?

583
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,750
I doubt Mr. Zhong's

584
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,100
professional ability.

585
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,480
When choosing partners, he's being too frivolous.

586
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,350
Anyway, in the end, it's not up to him to decide.

587
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,180
Please follow the process

588
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,790
and cooperate.

589
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,370
Got it.

590
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,020
[President's Office]

591
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,480
Good morning, Mr. Zhong.

592
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,990
My secretary told me you came early in the morning.

593
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,790
What is it?

594
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,710
Actually, there's nothing important.

595
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,710
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

596
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,150
You need a cup of coffee in the morning.

597
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,070
Two buns.

598
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,190
Sandwich.

599
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,560
Freshly fried dough sticks.

600
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,540
And a bowl of porridge.

601
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,640
No, thanks.

602
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,440
It's a little cold, right?

603
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,790
Mr. Zhong, your coffee.

604
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,630
Your parcels.

605
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,950
Mr. Zhong, I'll take out the trash for you.

606
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,330
Stop.

607
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,950
Is there a problem?

608
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,950
I've watered it.

609
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,710
What can I do for you?

610
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,710
Just tell me.

611
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,510
Actually,

612
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,510
nothing important.

613
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,710
Then why are you here?

614
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,970
Do I look idle?

615
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,700
No, no.

616
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,440
I just...

617
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,420
I'm here to maintain a client relationship.

618
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,870
You should go back and prepare for the proposal.

619
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,140
There's no need

620
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,430
to maintain our relationship.

621
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,280
Mr. Zhong,

622
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,350
are you still angry?

623
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,470
Here.

624
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,910
Did you take the helmet to Italy

625
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,240
for Varent to re-sign?

626
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,350
No.

627
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,790
There wasn't enough time for it to go back and forth.

628
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,220
Well.

629
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,910
I found a picture

630
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,990
of his autograph online.

631
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,150
I drew one based on it.

632
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,950
It's quite similar, isn't it?

633
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,080
I tried my best to make up for it.

634
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,760
Don't be angry.

635
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,330
Please forgive me.

636
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,230
Come in.

637
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,990
Zhen Gaogui?

638
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,470
Director Lu.

639
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,630
I've never seen someone come this early

640
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,970
to deliver breakfast to a client before.

641
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,100
If everyone is as hard-working as you,

642
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,160
we, as the clients, would be so pleased.

643
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,150
She didn't come here to deliver breakfast.

644
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,600
I had an appointment with her

645
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,080
to discuss something this morning.

646
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,630
She brought it along.

647
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,160
Mr. Zhong.

648
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,820
Take a look at this contract.

649
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,710
Okay.

650
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,300
If there's nothing else,

651
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
I'll leave now.

652
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,720
Goodbye, Director Lu.

653
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,380
Mr. Zhong.

654
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,710
Actually,

655
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,710
I came to know more about

656
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,890
the company culture and atmosphere

657
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,630
of Meton Popcorn.

658
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,010
Apart from the products,

659
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,720
I think these intangible things

660
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,950
can also help me with my proposal.

661
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,700
A smart boss like you

662
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,510
must know what I mean.

663
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,640
What are you doing?

664
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,320
Your motorcycle is a little dirty,

665
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,470
so I wanted to wipe it for you.

666
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,830
It fell accidentally.

667
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,100
This shabby motorcycle is too...

668
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,140
This wonderful motorcycle is so heavy.

669
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,350
It got dented because of you.

670
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,520
This...

671
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,510
Well...

672
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,750
I didn't mean it.

673
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,880
I'm sorry.

674
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,990
Zhen Gaogui.

675
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,350
Just do your

676
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,270
job well.

677
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,140
Don't play any trick like this.

678
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,390
Why so arrogant?

679
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,350
How was it after returning to the country?

680
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,670
There's no news from you.

681
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,410
I wanted to meet you.

682
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,370
No need.

683
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,070
It's more relaxing for us to be online penfriends.

684
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,450
Lately, my life has been full of surprises.

685
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,180
My whole life has changed.

686
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,310
What happened?

687
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,780
Do you need help?

688
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,630
It's okay.

689
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,130
I'm already content with complaining to you.

690
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,270
No matter how hard life is, I have to be tough.

691
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,100
I smile every day on the outside,

692
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,370
but inside, I feel miserable.
