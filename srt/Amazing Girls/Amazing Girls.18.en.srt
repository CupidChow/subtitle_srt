don't let her see you.

760
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,920
Hide first.

761
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,550
Where can I hide?

762
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,630
It's fine.

763
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,110
This way.

764
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,870
No.

765
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,350
Where can I hide?

766
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,430
In fact, Gaogui can know about this.

767
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,030
Coming.

768
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,070
Director Lu.

769
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,100
Gaogui.

770
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:16,230
Can I talk to you inside?

771
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,750
Yes.

772
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,070
Okay.

773
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,150
Director,

774
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,670
I've sent the data report to your email.

775
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,989
The exposure this time

776
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,750
is ten times higher than expected

777
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,540
because of the foodie.

778
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,030
Look.

779
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,949
Right?

780
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,380
The data on the Internet is much better.

781
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,070
I remember that Lin Yue also lives here.

782
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,910
I'll ask him if he wants to meet.

783
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,070
No...

784
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,590
need...

785
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,270
to...

786
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,990
I...

787
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,590
You...

788
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,030
Hi, Gaogui.

789
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,710
I heard you wanted to meet me.

790
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,630
You come quite fast.

791
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,430
It's okay. Then...

792
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,150
You guys continue.

793
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,910
I'll leave you alone.

794
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,280
It's okay. You can stay.

795
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,990
Didn't you say we were going to meet?

796
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,800
I saw nothing.

797
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,030
Don't go. Stay here.

798
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,990
Bye-bye.

799
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,750
I heard that today's spread is good.

800
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,990
You are saying this,

801
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,880
then it looks like it's really good.

802
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,070
Thank you for your clever move today.

803
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,750
Are we going

804
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,710
to be so polite now?

805
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,150
Thank you for the last few days.

806
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,060
Good night.

807
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,880
[Three days later]

808
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,510
The Snacks Expo is over.

809
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,870
We're packing up now.

810
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,470
About tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

811
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,750
Okay.

812
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,910
Got it.

813
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,150
Okay, bye.

814
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,070
Zhen Gaogui.

815
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,230
Come here.

816
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,630
Coming.

817
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,510
Come here. Here.

818
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,030
Slowly.

819
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,070
Be careful. Slowly.

820
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,590
Be careful.

821
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,580
This way.

822
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,150
This way. This way.

823
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,270
Here, here, here.

824
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,510
Watch your steps.

825
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,150
Watch out! Move!

826
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,310
Someone was hit!

827
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,750
[Because it's delicious
That's why it's meton]
