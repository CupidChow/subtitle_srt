Yeah. I guess so.

Have you found out about Gaogui's father?

I never told you about him, did I?

11

Right. I was...

14

I was talking with Gaogui about it.

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,390
I asked if she had told you about her dad.

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,950
She said you were busy at work.

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,230
If she had told you, you'd insist coming.

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,350
So she didn't mention it to you.

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,590
That's right.

20
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,430
How did you figure it out?

21
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,990
Mrs. Zhen.

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,630
Gaogui.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,989
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,680
I knew it a long time ago.

25
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,039
You knew it a long time ago?

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,750
Were you an acquaintance of my dad's?

27
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,920
That's impossible.

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,910
We were little back then.

29
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,630
That's not the reason.

30
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,190
Were your parents friends with him?

31
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,270
I don't think so.

32
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,750
I don't recall seeing you in the past.

33
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,390
That's not the reason, either.

What?

38
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,750
You were the child that he saved?

That's...

40
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,270
Mr. Zhen sacrificed his life to save mine.

41
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,039
I owe you an apology.

44

Zhong,

51
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,670
I think the moment my husband saved you,

52
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,829
nothing much was crossing his mind.

53
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,550
As a kind person and a father,

54
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,550
he did it out of instinct.

55
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,350
An accident happened

56
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,870

None of us did anything wrong.

59
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,230
I hate myself.

60
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,710
I've always resented myself in these years.

If I hadn't been

71
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,150
It's a shame

72
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,670
that my husband passed away too early

73
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,470
to see you and Gaogui become a couple.

74
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,270
Actually, last time,

75
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,470
when I sent you home from the hospital,

76
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,830
I saw the photo of you, Gaogui and Mr. Zhen.

77
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,590
I didn't mean to conceal the truth.

78
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,909

79
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,790
I would never be able to see you again.

No need for this.

84
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,790
At that time,

85
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,230
it was hard for us to relieve

86
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,910
from the pain of losing a loved one.

87
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,150

I'm not mad at you.

99
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,790
On my way back,

100
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,350
I thought twice and made this decision.

101
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,390
You still can't

102
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,470
accept the truth. Right?

103
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,030
It's nothing like that.

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,790
I just can't stand you anymore.

105
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,590
I can't accept that you knew everything

106
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,590
but you just wouldn't tell me.

107
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,909
You always do that.

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,110
Why do you always assume

109
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,710
that I can't accept the truth?

110
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,780
It's your father we're talking about.

111
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,350
I...

112
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,909
I'm actually quite disappointed

113
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,390
though I don't know by whom, myself or you.

114
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,590
Now I can't...

115
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,790
I can't calm down and think straight.

116
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,350
I'm not sure

117
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,230
whether you're genuinely in love with me

118
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,830
or just feel guilty about me.

119
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,830
So,

120
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,270
we're over.

121
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,030

122
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,150
What happened?

123
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,030
Did you have a fight with Zhong?

124
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,710
We...

125
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,590
We broke up.

126
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,360
Broke up?

127
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,110
That's quite abrupt. How come?

128
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,350
Was it because of your dad?

129
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,830
It was just one of the reasons.

130
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,710
Anyway, none of those matter.

131
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,230
What I can't accept is

132
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,910
that he knew about it the whole time

133
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,540
and he was with us the whole time

134
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,110
but he never talked about it.

135
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,910
That's true.

136
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,470
However,

137
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,150
if you were him,

138
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,590
could you bring yourself to tell the truth?

139
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,350
It's just a fight with your boyfriend.

140
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,430
I'll beat him up for you.

141
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,110
It's not just a fight. It's a breakup.

142
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,470
Don't make hasty decisions.

143
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,310
Why don't you give him one more chance?

144
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,590
I believe he will mend his ways.

145
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,430
Did he bribe you or what?

146
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,990
You're soaked in sweat.

147
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,070
You wore yourself down on that treadmill.

148
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,990
What made you so emotional?

149
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,830
A small hiccup in your love life?

150
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,430
Kind of.

151
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,710
What's wrong?

152
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,320
Did you irritate your girlfriend?

153
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,710
Was there a fight?

154
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,840
Do you remember when I was little,

155
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,430
one time, after quarreling with my parents,

156
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,590
I ran away

157
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,600
and jumped into a reservoir out of anger?

158
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,590
A kind man

159
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,230
saved my life

160
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,590
but ended up losing his.

161
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,630
Why would you suddenly bring that up?

162
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,510
Didn't we agree

163
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,360
not to speak of it anymore?

164
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,830
If

165
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,510
the girl I like

166
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,600
is his daughter,

167
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,710
do you think she will ever forgive me?

168
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,110
That kind man had to choose

169
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,110
between his own life and yours.

170
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,950
And he

171
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,190
chose to let you live.

172
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,350
I'm sure he wished you a healthy and happy life.

173
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,950
No one would sacrifice his own life

174
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,190
for someone else's and pray the latter to be miserable.

175
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,110
But in all these years, not a day goes by

176
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,990

177
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,110
Do you know why when I was little,

178
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,310
I enjoyed doing all kinds of things

179
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,110
that you wouldn't understand at all?

180
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,990
I was looking for thrills.

181
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,350
That's my way to avoid

182
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,860
thinking about him.

183
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,590
I never wanted to face him.

184

185
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,430

which is so important that we must solve it.

190
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,950
When the solution is wrong,

191
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,460
we'll have to revise it again and again

192
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,950
until

193
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,960
a correct version comes up.

194
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,590
That's when

195
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,950
we can finally get over it.

196
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,070
Otherwise,

197
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,430
the problem will repeatedly

198
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,070
pop up before us.

199
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,070
Perhaps in the very beginning,

200
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,510
I already gave a wrong solution.

201
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,350
What's her attitude?

202
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,110
Did she say

203
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,710
she wouldn't forgive you?

204
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,430
No.

205
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,310
My efforts to hide the truth from her

206
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,190
drove her mad.

207
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,000
Maybe it's just impossible

208
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,070
to bury the truth forever.

209
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,470
When you made that choice,

210
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,590
you should've prepared yourself

211
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,990
to bear the consequences of it.

212
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,120
I know.

213
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,990
What I'm afraid is

214
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,590
that I'll involuntarily shun it again.

215
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,030
[Meiziwei Group]

216
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,200
We've finally given a reasonable explanation

217
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,950
to the people online regarding the plagiarism incident.

218
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,590
We've also yielded positive marketing results.

219
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,510
But the sales this time

220
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,190
are not as high as those we made last time

221
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,830
when we received the widest publicity.

222
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,110
I'm just glad that the matter is settled.

223
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,870
Anyway, we can't leave Lin Yue in the lurch.

224
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,710
Everything else will be proceeded

225
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,310
in compliance with the marketing timeline.

226
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,590
The sales will rise.

227
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,470
When we commence cooperative operations with

228
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,480
Wanmei MCN, there will be huge media exposure.

229
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,220
Just rest assured.

230
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,190
We'll launch campaigns online and offline

231
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,470
to deliver better and better results.

232
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,710
By the way,

233
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,110
can the Xinda PR meeting be moved online?

234
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,590
Online?

235
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,190
Is it a bad time?

236
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,230
I drafted several marketing plans

237
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,240
for the offline store.

238
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,510
I want them to be confirmed today.

239
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,190
I must have caught you at a bad time. I should get going.

240
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,190
We'll talk online later.

241
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,430
Well, since you're already here,

242
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,070
we might as well talk about the plans now.

243
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,190
I've only got a few reminders for you.

244
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,830
The materials should be released

245
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,440
according to the progress of offline events.

246
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,480
Then we'll see if there are trending topics

247
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,830
that can interact with our campaigns.

248
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,310
That's all.

249
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,710
I'm leaving then.

250
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,310
Wait a minute.

251
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,720
What else do you have to say?

252
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,830
I wanna talk about us.

253
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,480
We have broken up. It's over.

254
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,190
Thank you for everything you did for me.

255
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,350
From now on,

256
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,710
I'll continue working hard.

257
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,590
I've given you a second chance to write proposals.

258
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,470
Can't you give me a second chance too?

259
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,110
I'm sorry, Zhong Yiming.

260
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,110
You don't need to say sorry about anything.

261
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,070
Now I just don't think

262
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,070
what you had for me was love.

263
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,350
Instead, it was sympathy.

264
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,510
You found out I was Zhong Baishu's daughter a long time ago.

265
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,360
Did you approach me and care for me

266
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,230
because you pitied me?

267
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,430
Our relationship wasn't built on pure love.

268
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,720
I never thought of it that way.

269
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,630
Maybe you didn't think it that way.

270
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,990
Or maybe you just didn't know

271
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,110
what your heart really wanted.

272
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,110
You're in charge of a corporation that hires

273
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,320
the company where I work as a lowly employee for service.

274
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,310
Why would you fall in love with me?

275
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,830
Have you asked yourself that?

276
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,110
Anyway, your feelings for me

277
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,830
were mixed with too many other things.

278
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,220
Maybe

279
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,590
you feel wronged and upset.

280
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,350
Actually, I feel the same.

281
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,190
I'm reluctant to cut you out of my life.

282
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,110
I would think about you every now and then.

283
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,190
However, I can't bear the thought

284
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,710
of having a relationship infused with

285
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,120
sympathy and pity.

286
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,070
When I fell in love with you,

287
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,190
I didn't know you were related to this matter.

288
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,510
It's true.

289
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,830
You couldn't pluck up the courage to tell me that you loved me

290
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,350
because when you sent my mom home,

291
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,510
you saw our family photo. Right?

292
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,830
What we had seemed to be something

293
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,990
you could easily throw away. Isn't it true?

294
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,230
I was afraid of how you would react

295
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,110
when you knew I was the boy

296
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,310
accountable for your father's death.

297
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,840
What could I have done?

298
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,470
What made you think I would

299
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,110
cling to past grievances?

300
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,710
It's my fault.

301
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,350
I should've taken your thoughts into consideration.

302
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,070
I just hope you will

303
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,830
give me a chance to make up for my mistakes.

304
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,590
Babes, that's all for today.

305
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,470
Good night.

306
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,190
Terrific!

307
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,950
Right?

308
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,990
I've got positive feedback

309
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,870
for several videos here.

310
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,830
Really?

311
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,830
The number of fans has increased to over 100,000.

312
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,950
That's a lot of fans!

313
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:28,990
Let's check it out.

314
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,000
They even asked me to start live streaming.

315
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,710
I tried it just now.

316
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,870
The results seemed great.

317
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,110
Let me see. Let me see.

318
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,880
[The live stream is over.]

319
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,310
Is it over?

320
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,590
Yes.

321
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,310
It's a new cartoon series.

322
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,430
There won't be new episodes until next week.

323
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,710
If I had known that,

324
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,230
I wouldn't have watched it today.

325
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,990
I had told you so before you watched it.

326
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,870
But you just wouldn't listen to me.

327
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,360
I thought you had stocked up on

328
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,840
all cartoons.

329
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,710
I'm not a genie in a magic lamp, am I?

330
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,349
I can't show you unreleased episodes.

331
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,109
Besides,

332
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,270
isn't it time to go to bed?

333
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,990
I want to watch more cartoons. I can't asleep.

334
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,230
Now that you can't sleep,

335
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,230
let's have a chat then.

336
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,990
About Zhong Yiming and Gaogui,

337
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,069
are they having a fight lately?

338
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,300
Gaogui has told me about it.

339
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,950
She wants a breakup.

340
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,990
How serious is their fight?

341
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,390
Why must there be a breakup?

342
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,710
She hasn't told me the details.

343
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,950
But she does seem quite determined about it.

344
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,470
As long as they're still in love,

345
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,510
they won't break up.

346
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,030
Look.

347
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,150
When we had a fight,

348
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,310
weren't we also on the brink of a breakup?

349
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,240
We...

350
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,870
At that time...

351
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,270
You can't call that a breakup.

352
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,750
We were just

353
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,790
having a break.

354
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,190
See,

355
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,710
you've admitted it's just a tamper tantrum.

356
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,230
How about this?

357
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,270
A good friend of mine

358
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,790
has a private hotel in the suburban area.

359
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,270
He has extended several invitations to me

360
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,430
but I've never been there.

361
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,870
Why don't we

362
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,240
ask Zhong Yiming and Zhen Gaogui

363
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,920
to go there with us?

364
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,230
It'll be a chance for them to settle their dispute.

365
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,750
Even if they can't talk it out,

366
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,910
given that it's the outskirts of the city

367
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,070
where it's hard to hail a ride,

368
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,430
they'll be stuck there for some time.

369
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,230
What do you think

370
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,310
of this idea?

371
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:33,990
That's awesome.

372
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,470
Wait!

373
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,150
I'll text Gaogui now.

374
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,950
I haven't elaborated on the...

375
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,270
Can't you just wait till I finish?

376
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,240
You seem to be more excited about

377
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,870
other people's romance than ours.

378
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,950
Ju Ran.

379
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,990
I'll get you a cup of tea too.

380
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,230
No need.

381
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,710
Boss.

382
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,230
Are you in a relationship with Ju Ran?

383
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,510
How could I be so forgetful?

384
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,990
That day, in your absence,

385
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,150
I announced my relationship with Ju Ran.

386
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,310
It's okay.

387
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,270
Lele has told me about it.

388
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,910
Gaogui.

389
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,630
Don't you have a confession to make?

390
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,000
I...

391
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,750
Don't bother.

392
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,430
Lele has also told me about it.

393
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,750
Wait, Boss,

394
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,150
aren't you surprised at all?

395
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,710
It doesn't matter.

396
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,030
I came out of my office

397
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,920
to ask for

398
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,710
today's competitor analysis.

399
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,750
It'll be soon completed, Boss.

400
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,960
I get it.

401
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,190
Boss means to say that our work desks

402
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,630
will be our permanent homes. Right?

403
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,150
Zhen Gaogui.

404
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,630
Do you understand?

405
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,910
Understand what?

406
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,900
You've gotta remember

407
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,870
where your permanent home is.

408
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,200
I get it!

409
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,190
A weekend getaway in a suburban private hotel.

410
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,660
I have called for a meeting today

411
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,910
to make

412
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,390
an important announcement.

413
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,950
From today on,

414
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,190
I'll disengage from the company's operation.

415
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,710
The focus of my work will be shifted to Meiziwei Group.

416
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,990
As you might have guessed,

417
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,990
the CEO of Meton Food

418
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,640
will be Zhong Yiming.

419
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,980
His job won't be temporary anymore.

420
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,510
Is it true?

421
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,470
The company is on the right track now.

422
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,510
I hope you will keep up the good work.

423
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,700
I also hope Mr. Zhong

424
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,680
will do a good job.

425
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,160
Congratulations, Mr. Zhong! Now you've officially become the CEO.

426
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,550
From now on, you can't think of yourself

427
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,430
as a temp anymore.

428
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,150
My brother should've told me about

429
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,910
such important news in advance.

430
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,790
If he had, it would've ruined the surprise.

431
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,430
I've been too busy lately

432
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,270
to talk with my co-workers.

433
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,190
How's the offline experience store going?

434
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,950
Nearly all the work is done.

435
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,550
We've entered the final completion stage.

436
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,230
Soon there will be many new colleagues.

437
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,950
We're gonna be very busy.

438
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,470
This weekend, Lin Yue and I are gonna stay at a suburban private hotel.

439
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,670
Why are you telling me this?

440
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,310
You don't need to ask for a leave from work since it's a weekend.

441
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,710
He'd like to invite you to go with us.

442
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,390
I'm not going.

443
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,630
He has also invited Zhen Gaogui.

444
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,750
You know what that means, don't you?

445
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,640
[Pine Garden]

446
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,310
Here she comes.

447
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:52,990
Go meet her.

448
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,310
I haven't got my suitcase yet!

449
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,230
Thank you.

450
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,510
Are there gonna be just the three of us?

451
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,990
Yes.

452
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,150
We thought it'd be boring

453
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,710
if there were only me and Lin Yue.

454
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,990
Now that you're here, we'll have more fun.

455
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,230
Shall we go into the house?

456
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,030
You can pick a room you like.

457
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,030
Let's take some photos.

458
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,860
It'll be a good advertisement for this place.

459
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,030
Has she arrived yet?

460
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,230
She just went into the house.

461
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,150
You'd better not use this entrance.

462
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,190
Or you'll be easily spotted.

463
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,270
You should use the rear door in the yard.

464
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,270
That's all I can do for you.

465
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,510
As for the rest, you'll count on yourself.

466
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,470
Thanks.

467
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,150
No problem.

468
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,950
I'll use the front door then.

469
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,670
Go ahead.

470
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,510
This home-made dinner is on the house.

471
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,990
Try it. Let's see how it tastes.

472
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,000
It's delicious!

473
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,480
Thank you for treating me to this place.

474
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,990
Since I started working,

475
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,670
this is the first time

476
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,990
I go out for a relaxing weekend.

477
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,190
There are so many rooms here

478
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,950
just to accommodate the three of us.

479
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,990
Isn't it a bit wasteful?

480
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,510
On weekdays, we're surrounded by so many people.

481
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,630
We deserve to enjoy solitude during a weekend getaway.

482
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,790
By the way,

483
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,510
why didn't you invite Zhong Yiming?

484
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,710
He's my boss.

485
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,230
What kind of employees would like to see

486
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,630
their employers at weekends?

487
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,710
Aren't you having a fight with him?

488
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,390
What?

489
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,430
Do you want him here?

490
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,790
Of course not.

491
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,550
That's great.

492
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,030
We're gonna have our own fun.

493
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,630
I'll see if there are beverages.

494
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,150
In that huge refrigerator,

495
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,510
there isn't a single can of drink.

496
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,790
Let me see if there's food delivery service.

497
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,790
Gosh.

498
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,230
The nearest carryout store is 20 km away.

499
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,430
Forget it.

500
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,710
We're in a remote place.

501
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,430
It's why the hotel owner sent us free food.

502
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,630
I'm full.

503
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,150
Wipe your mouth.

504
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,990
Thank you.

505
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,030
Who can that be?

506
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,160
Well...

507
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,430
Gaogui, you're close to the door. Why don't you go get it?

508
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,870
Sure. I'll go.

509
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,550
Who is it?

510
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,230
My goodness!

511
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,390
What a sweet hotel owner!

512
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,510
Look how many drinks he has sent us!

513
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,590
So tasty.

514
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,870
Are you gonna pass?

515
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,990
Fine. My turn. A "king" it is.

516
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,310
And for my turn, a "joker".

517
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,020
Here comes a bomb!

518
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,750
What's wrong?

519
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,950
No big deal.

520
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,750
Just a small paper cut on the finger.

521
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,910
Are you okay?

522
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,910
Well, do you have a Band-Aid?

523
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,790
Who would think of bringing a Band-Aid to this place?

524
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,430
I'll clean the wound with water then.

525
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,510
What kind of poker cards did you buy?

526
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,150
They made a small cut on Gaogui's finger.

527
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,710
Maybe it's because the cards are new.

528
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,510
A pair of sixes, a pair of sevens, and a pair of eights.

529
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,430
You're gonna pass on that, are you?

530
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,150
Here comes a "joker".

531
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,700
And a full house.

532
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,670
Yes!

533
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,710
I won't play with you anymore!

534
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,150
You're ganging up on me!

535
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,750
You shouldn't keep calling dibs on being

536
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,630
the "landlord". That's why you lose.

537
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,470
Biggest loser, you'll get the door.

538
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,070
Fine. I'll get it.

539
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,990
Guess what it is.

540
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,190
A box of Band-Aids!

541
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,630
Is this a magic house or what?

542
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,670
It's still raining.

543
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,270
You scared me.

544
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,310
What a coincidence to meet you here!

545
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,990
Why are you sneaking around

546
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,230
like a thief?

547
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,510
They told me

548
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,230
you thought the house was too empty,

549
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,710
so they asked me to come as a makeweight.

550
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,950
All that stuff we got yesterday

551
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,510
was bought by you, right?

552
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,310
No.

553
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,630
The magic house made your wishes come true.

554
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,910
Liar. Do you think I'm stupid?

555
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,750
There isn't any magic at all.

556
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,630
You must be in cahoots with them.

557
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,190
They mean well.

558
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,230
I haven't seen you for days.

559
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,310
I feel rather uneasy.

560
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,710
I said to Ke'er yesterday that there should be a sausage grill for our party.

561
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,630
Is that why you got this machine here?

562
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,710
I rented it from a sausage restaurant.

563
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,390
You've talked about this for many times.

564
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,500
I know you enjoy unhealthy food like this.

565
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,870
I apologize to you on behalf of Ke'er and Lin Yue.

566
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,510
The sausage here is an apology on behalf of me.

567
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,910
It smells so good.

568
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,430
We were gonna sleep in when we smelled this,

569
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,910
so we came to take a look.

570
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,470
This must the grilled sausage you talked about yesterday.

571
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,950
It's delicious.

572
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,230
I want one too.

573
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,390
Last night, didn't you say

574
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,640
you wouldn't eat junk food?

575
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,430
It's morning time.

576
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,910
Eating a bit of sausage wouldn't hurt.

577
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,630
I'm getting one as well.

578
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,670
Hold on. Hold on.

579
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,230
It's not done yet.

580
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,710
Look at you two.

581
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,910
You knew he was here

582
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,990
but you just wouldn't tell me about it.

583
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,150
If it weren't for him,

584
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,430
you wouldn't be eating a grilled sausage now.

585
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,030
Hello?

586
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,790
Okay. I got it.

587
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,150
Have fun, guys.

588
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,510
I need to leave for an emergency.

589
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,430
I'll go with you.

590
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,990
Grandpa Tong knew he was in poor health

591
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,430
and the final stage of cancer.

592
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,990
He told me not to reveal the truth to you.

593
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,390
Now I get it. He asked me to take him out

594
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,310
for fun trips because...

595
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,310
His last wish was for me

596
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,990
to inform you of the truth

597
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,150
after his body was cremated.

598
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,470
Mr. Tong was always a free spirit.

599
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,230
He probably didn't want to see

600
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,640
sorrow in your eyes during his last days.

601
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,750
These used to belong to Mr. Tong.

602
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,230
He specifically told me

603
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,710
that he had no relatives

604
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,630
and that you were his last family.

605
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,430
I'll leave these to you.

606
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,670
Thank you.

607
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,470
Alright.

608
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,990
You can stay a bit longer. I'll get going.

609
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,950
Thank you.

610
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,870
If I knew this would happen,

611
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,910
I would have taken Grandpa Tong

612
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,710
to watch many, many movies

613
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,470
and eat many, many desserts.

614
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,470
He must be sad when he passed away alone.

615
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,300
Let's see how it is.

616
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,710
Isn't it great?

617
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,670
Come on, guys.

618
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,630
I'm making a video of you!

619
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,670
Tong!

620
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,230
The sun is shining brightly.

621
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,880
Isn't it nice?

622
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,870
It sure is!

623
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,480
Gaogui.

624
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,150
Watching a video of me

625
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,710
at this very moment

626
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,640
is quite a surprise, isn't it?

627
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,550
Everything's fine.

628
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,000
It's all over now.

629
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,310
I've gone to another world

630
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,060
to live a happy life.

631
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,510
I only hope

632
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,950
your life can be full of joy.

633
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:04,230
Thank you for often taking me out.

634
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,710
My old friends

635
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,910
saw me film videos with a smartphone.

636
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,910
They were so envious of me.

637
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,240
I have nothing to worry about.

638
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,400
I just wanna leave a footprint in the world.

639
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,230
These videos will be stored in the phone

640
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,950
to keep you company as if I'm there with you.

641
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,270
How I wish

642
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,990
that you're watching this video of mine

643
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,710
with Ming!

644
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,710
You have found true love in each other.

645
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,510
I'm genuinely happy for you.

646
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,990
Don't easily give up your relationship

647
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,710
because of some trivial matters.

648
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,230
You should cherish each other.

649
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,310
In this world,

650
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,990
the greatest thing is for two souls

651
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,550
to get truly and deeply in love.

652
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,390
Live in the moment.

653
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,630
Cherish the people you are with.

654
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,830
I didn't see that coming.

655
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,790
We should've visited him for one last time.

656
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:44,949
Maybe

657
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,550
Grandpa Tong didn't want to

658
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,270
see us getting upset.

659
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,990
What is it?

660
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,630
Dad

661
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,590
and we made donations to Grandpa Tong.

662
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,270
But he never spent the money.

663
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,630
In the end, it's returned to us in this way.

664
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,470
I've written the password on the card.

665
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,470
From now on, we don't owe you anything.

666
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,910
I hope

667
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,460
you'll stop harassing my mother.

668
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:20,960
[The password is your birth date.]

669
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,190
Boss.

670
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,430
I've sorted the document out.

671
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:44,950
Okay.

672
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,950
Gaogui,

673
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,790
what happened?

674
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,790
You look sad.

675
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,510
Do you need to take a leave?

676
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,350
No. I'm good.

677
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,870
It's just that

678
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,150
a senior in my family passed away.

679
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,190
I'm sorry to hear that.

680
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,510
My condolences.

681
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,350
It's alright.

682
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,660
All of a sudden, I feel like

683
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,430
everything is changing so fast.

684
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,670
The people who I think will always be around

685
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,990
may suddenly disappear from my life.

686
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,750
There is no advance notice of how one's life will change.

687
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,760
Sometimes, life can be fragile.

688
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,350
That said, it reinforces my determination

689
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,440
to cherish the people I'm with,

690
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,390
to cherish the job I have now,

691
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,470
to cherish you, my boss,

692
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,990
and my lovely colleagues.

693
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,590
It sounds quite pleasant,

694
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,110
though it's somewhat weird.

695
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,790
Boss,

696
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,990
I'm getting back to work.

697
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,510
Bye. Bye.

698
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,110
Ju Ran.

699
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,190
There is a list of media invited

700
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,750
to the offline store of Meton.

701
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,270
Let me check that out.

702
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,510
Gaogui.

703
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,430
Ju Ran.

704
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,190
These are for you.

705
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,270
Though Ju Ran and I are working hard on the marketing materials,

706
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,510
we don't need this much nutrition.

707
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,550
I heard from the HR department

708
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,110
that you're gonna resign. Is it true?

709
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,190
Resign?

710
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,350
Yes. I've handed in my resignation letter.

711
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,270
Next month, I'll be leaving.

712
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:20,950
This month,

713
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,830
my job is to clean up my desk.

714
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,840
This news really comes out of blue.

715
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,470
Just between you and me,

716
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,260
I've been hired by another company

717
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,830
that makes commands and waits for service.

718
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,910
I won't have to work overtime anymore.

719
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,960
Congratulations on advancing your career!

720
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,990
When there are new projects,

721
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,310
don't forget about us!

722
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:41,830
Sure thing.

723
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,750
You've quietly hopped to another job

724
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,990
and amazed everyone.

725
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,190
Alright. Get back to your work.

726
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,830
I'm going back to my desk. Bye.

727
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,590
Mom.

728
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,590
You should've had dinner before I got off work.

729
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,790
Next time, stop doing live streams when you're hungry.

730
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,110
Starvation could harm your health.

731
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,910
I get lazy when I'm full.

732
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,800
I think

733
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,790
that would affect my performance

734
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,990
in front of the camera.

735
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,830
That's not an excuse.

736
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,670
Maybe you can try having an early dinner.

737
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,110
Otherwise, when I work overtime knowing that

738
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,190
you're doing a live stream alone at home,

739
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,360
I would be very worried about you.

740
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,990
Fine.

741
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,270
See,

742
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,510
I've finally found something I'm happy to do

743

and it has given me so much pleasure.

744
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,150
My live stream channel has attracted more and more fans.

745
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,390
They outnumber the students I used to teach.

746
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,750
That's great.

747
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,510
I'm so glad to be living in this era.

748
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,870
I guess, without my live stream channel,

749
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,510
I must be a grumpy stay-at-home mom.

750
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,870
You haven't been on a date with Zhong lately, have you?

751
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,910
Mom,

752
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,790
I don't want to talk about it now.

753
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,590
How do you know recently I haven't been on a date with him?

754
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,270
I do live streams every day.

755
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,190
He always tips me on the platform.

756
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:02,790
And?

757
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,190
He also encourages other fans to tip me.

758
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,510
Here's what I think.

759
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,390
If the two of you are going on dates,

760
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,470
why would he have the time

761
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,470
to do all those things for me?

762
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,190

How is it? Quite fast, right?

766
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,110
What do you think?

767
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,670
You've tried all the motorcycles here.

768
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,790
Which one are you gonna take?

769
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,310
This one.

770
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,910
It's so cool.

771
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,470
Isn't this motorcycle a perfect match

772
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,610

So cool.

775
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,630
It blows my mind, Ming.

776
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,590
Now I see why you take joy in this.

777
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,150
Can I ride it for another lap?

I'd like to talk to Zhong Yiming.

785

He's away. Didn't he tell you?

786
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,390
Where has he gone?

787
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,590
He's gone abroad for meetings about business cooperation.

788
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,390
When will he come back?

789
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,870
He didn't tell me.

790
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,670
Did he not tell you either?

791
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,070
Haven't you two been reconciled yet?

792
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,390
Not yet.

793
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,630
I'll talk to him when he returns.
