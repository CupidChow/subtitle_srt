No one is allowed to touch this batch of goods.

3
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,330
I'll see who dares to touch them!

4
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,420
Boss, who…

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,940
Who should we listen to?

6
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,220
What's going on?

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,340
Hello, Mr. Sun.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,950
The goods are to be left in the warehouse.

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,990
After all, I'm the boss now.

10
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,590
If you go too far,

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,830
no one will look good.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,120
Mr. Zhong.

13
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,290
Listen to me.

14
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,030

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,720
All right, I've counted everything.

18
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,669
None is missing.

19
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,470
Why don't you take care of yourself?

20
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,380
That was so dangerous.

21
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,110
No matter how anxious you are,

22
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,670
you can't risk your life.

23
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,230
Am I right?

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,450
I had no choice.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,950
You sold your favorite motorcycle

26
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,180
just to pay for these.

27
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,990
I must protect them.

28
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,590
I don't care.

29
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,670
I don't even have the matching helmet. What do I need the bike for?

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,360
What would you be

31
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,270
if I had come here too late?

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,900
Mr. Zhong,

33
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,150
thank you for coming and helping me.

34
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,390
I misunderstood you

35
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,270
last time in the factory.

36
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,020
I had no choice myself.

37
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,070
Hello, we're going off work.

38
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,170
Aren't you leaving?

39
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,620
Yes, we are.

40
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,840
No, we're not.

41
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,090
We're not leaving.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,790
We'll stay here and guard the boxes.

43
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,240
You go back first.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,170
Okay, I'll turn off the lights and lock the door.

45
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,030
While we are free now,

46
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,200
why don't we talk about

47
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,760
how the cooperation with Dooro Bear Anime

48
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,150
should go on

49
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,040
and how can we sell this batch of goods?

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,410
How about this?

51
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,910
Before dawn,

52
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,020
let's make decisions about all the details.

53
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,329
When the day breaks tomorrow morning,

54
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,430
we'll load the goods and deliver them directly.

55
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,079
What do you think?

56
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,800
Oh no!

57
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,470
You...

58
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,320
You think I want to?

59
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,590
My weak nerves

60
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,160
can no longer stand any problems in your company.

61
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,030
I never thought

62
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,010
I'd go through so many things as a boss.

63
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,150
And there is no standard answer for reference.

64
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,840
I didn't expect either

65
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,900
that in such a short time after I came back home,

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,630
I'd encountered so many bad things with you.

67
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,190
Have you ever thought about this?

68
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,330
Since I became the president,

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,600
I've been with you

70
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,060
when I encountered all the bad things.

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,420
Look, the warehouse is locked.

72
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,160
It's like the past we can't go back.

73
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,710
We can't go back.

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,790
I like being locked up like this.

75
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,760
When I was young,

76
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,990
I used to sell popcorn with my grandpa.

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,270
He has a small room for storing corn.

78
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,270
Later,

79
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,350
I took it

80
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,550
as my secret base.

81
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,740
I have a friend just like you.

82
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,970
You two are so alike.

83
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,110
It's a boy, right?

84
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,790
It's none of your business.

85
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,110
Boys usually like to play like that.

86
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,159
Now that you mentioned it, I remember

87
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,990
when I was young, I lived in an old house.

88
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,530
There was a storage room.

89
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,230
I liked to lock myself in there

90
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,700
and to play hide-and-seek with adults.

91
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,110
It's good for us to hide like this.

92
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,910
When we go out tomorrow morning,

93
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,590
we'll have to act mature

94
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,710
and behave like adults again.

95
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,710
Who wants to be an adult?

96
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,470
Are you really going to work?

97
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,250
I have an idea.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Our Meton Mid-Autumn Festival promotion

99
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,710
used the images of the fairy tale world.

100
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,270
Now we're cooperating with Dooro Bear.

101
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,070
Their style is also a fairy-tale one.

102
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,470
Why don't we combine them?

103
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,570
As for the audience…

104
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,550
Why don't we target the wage slaves?

105
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,230
And this way, it won't be limited to the holiday.

106
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,230
We can also make up some quotes

107
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,370
for this Dooro Bear.

108
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,480
For example, I don't want to work overtime today.

109
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,000
Please let me go, boss.

110
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,910
I want to get off work early, etcetera.

111
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,570
We can also sell

112
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,150
popcorn and Dooro Bear stickers together.

113
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,710
Then it'll be exposed twice.

114
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,720
That's a good idea.

115
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,770

What...

143
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,790
My arm.

144
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,740
Is it?

145
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,350
Definitely.

146
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,000
What's wrong?

147
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,420
Zhen Gaogui and I have determined the plan.

148
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,530
[Pre-heat Sales Plan for Meton Popcorn on Singles' Day]

149
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,300
You changed it into the pre-heat promotion on Singles' Day.

150
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,659
I don't think there's a problem.

151
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,790
That way we won't miss the hot season.

152
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,930
The factory can reopen in two days,

153
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,870
so the supply will be fine.

154
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,550
The core problem now is

155
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,790
that we need to re-design

156
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,830
the collaboration package with Dooro Bear.

157
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,910
This is the solution.

158
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,830
For this event,

159
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,720
we'll still use the package for the Mid-Autumn Festival promotion.

160
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,180
We can just paste the Dooro Bear stickers with its slogan

161
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,090
on it.

162
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,830
I've arranged everything for the promotional page.

163
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,030
Let Zhen Gaogui launch it this afternoon.

164
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,860
What are you busy with?

165
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,830
You look serious, nervous,

166
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,330
and a little anxious.

167
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,280
People would think

168
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,270
you're launching a rocket with your mouse.

169
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,140
The promotional page is going online today.

170
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
If anything goes wrong,

171
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,440
my heart won't take it.

172
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,390
You'll get used to it later.

173
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,930
What's the progress now?

174
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,420
I just clicked "send."

175
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,990
Now,

176
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,430
it's been three seconds.

177
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,980
Gaogui.

178
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,110
The time-limited promotion of Meton Popcorn is very successful.

179
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,740
The page views have increased tenfold!

180
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,050
Get up and take a look.

181
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,720
The effect is better than we expected.

182
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,900
Congratulations, Zhen Gaogui.

183
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,160
Go check the messages.

184
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,740
Open the electronic version and let me have a look.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,470
Longlong.

186
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,460
Close the door.

187
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,380
What's wrong, Vice President?

188
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,050
Well, help me

189
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,910
review all these materials

190
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,500
and see if there are any typos.

191
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,270
Look carefully.

192
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,640
Don't worry.

193
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,510
Who is it?

194
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,760
Hello?

195
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,590
What?

196
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,120
Mr. Zhong Jr. stayed in the warehouse

197
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,160
with Zhen Gaogui from Xinda PR all night?

198
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,450
Don't tell anybody about this.

199
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,330
Do you hear me?

200
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,150
Delete the surveillance footage too.

201
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,920
We can't have the reputation of Mr. Zhong Jr. damaged.

202
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,310
Okay.

203
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,590
I forgot you were here.

204
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,350
You didn't hear anything, did you?

205
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,220
What?

206
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,150
I don't know.

207
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,920
You'll have a bright future.

208
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,030
All right, take them back to read.

209
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,950
Mr. Zhong and Zhen Gaogui from Xinda PR

210
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,470
stayed in the warehouse all night.

211
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,900
What's wrong?

212
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,420
I heard on the grapevine

213
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,760
that Mr. Zhong and Zhen Gaogui from Xinda PR

214
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,470
stayed in the warehouse all night.

215
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:56,830
Really?

216
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,710
When they came out in the morning,

217
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,110
both of them looked tired.

218
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,590
They've been doing it all night.

219
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,350
They're definitely boyfriend and girlfriend now.

220
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,620
Do you know?

221
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,110
Zhen Gaogui is with Mr. Zhong from Meton.

222
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,720
Really?

223
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,820
Of course.

224
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,390
A classmate of mine is working in Meton.

225
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,360
She told me in person.

226
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,780
Don't tell anyone.

227
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,830
I won't.

228
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,750
Zhen Gaogui is in love.

229
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,580
Don't look.

230
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,560
With whom?

231
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,070
Mr. Zhong from Meton.

232
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,880
Interesting.

233
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,950
I told you alone. Don't tell anyone else.

234
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,830
Rest assured.

235
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,580
Are you in a relationship?

236
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,380
I heard that love will make you produce

237
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,480
miraculous oxytocin,

238
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,920
which will make you look good.

239
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,830
I was just wondering why your skin condition

240
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,350
has been kind of enviable.

241
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,430
I'm in a relationship?

242
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,710
With whom?

243
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,110
With Mr. Zhong.

244
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,000
That's ridiculous.

245
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,270
Enough talking.

246
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,860
I'm going to Meton to report work.

247
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,960
I'm so disappointed.

248
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,830
Why are you disappointed?

249
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,870
I didn't mean that.

250
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,250
I mean

251
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,560
I always thought Gaogui

252
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,430
is an independent woman

253
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,910
who would reach the top step by step by working hard.

254
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,840
I didn't expect her to enjoy her life so soon.

255
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,860
She did make a great step.

256
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,000
Some people

257
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,750
put up a hard-working image in the company every day.

258
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,580
In the end,

259
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,470
she did do a great job.

260
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,340
She did work hard, too.

261
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,370
But it was not about the career.

262
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,990
She just climbed up the ladder by her relationship.

263
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,990
This trick of selling a dummy

264
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,020
is just great.

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,180
I don't think you can say that.

266
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,840
But I've figured out one thing.

267
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,260
Meton was such a difficult project,

268
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,690
but she accepted it without hesitation.

269
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,110
And she insisted on taking it.

270
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,820
It seems that she was quite foresighted.

271
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,590
Right, Ju Ran?

272
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,230
If you had thought further,

273
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,420
you would have been promoted long ago.

274
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,260
I...

275
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,780
So you don't like me because my position is not high enough?

276
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,110
She thinks you are stupid.

277
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,440
Why am I stupid?

278
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,510
Line up.

279
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,990
Look at that girl.

280
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,330
The one in white.

281
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,900
Do you know that Mr. Zhong

282
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,940
is in a relationship with the Xinda girl?

283
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,870
I heard that they are so in love now.

284
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,870
Of course.

285
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,000
Her name is Zhen Gaogui, right?

286
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,860
Yes.

287
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,050
They even dared to be intimate

288
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,200
in the warehouse.

289
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,600
Finding a good job is much better than working hard.

290
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,880
She seduces the boss himself.

291
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,620
Exactly.

292
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,130
The young girls nowadays are really clear-headed.

293
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,820
Yes, yes, yes.

294
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,150
Are you buying coffee?

295
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,120
I don't feel like drinking suddenly.

296
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,840
Why don't we talk in the office?

297
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,810
I want to buy coffee.

298
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,380
You buy it here.

299
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,310
I'll wait for you back in the office.

300
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,710
What's the rush?

301
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,480
Buy it with me. My treat. Let's go.

302
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,800
They are coming!

303
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,880
Hello, Mr. Zhong.

304
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,570
Morning.

305
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,880
Why are you going to the third floor?

306
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,550
Mr. Zhong, I forgot something there.

307
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,910
Did you forget something too?

308
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,720
Mr. Zhong, we forgot something too.

309
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,790
It's her, right?

310
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,340
Yes, it's her.

311
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,070
I didn't expect her to be so smart.

312
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,870
Yeah.

313
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,960
We can't help it. We're no match for her.

314
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,800
Come on. Let's go to my office.

315
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,470
About the data of this event,

316
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,310
there are still many places that we need to analyze and compare.

317
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,810
Well,

318
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,990
the air is not circulating in the office.

319
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,770
Let's talk here.

320
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,110
Okay.

321
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,930
Give me the material.

322
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,610
It's her.

323
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,310
After the delivery is over,

324
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,230
you need to summarize

325
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,470
the transformation rate of all expenses

326
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,870
and compare it with the products of the same type.

327
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,680
Also, we need to analyze

328
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,630
the market feedback

329
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,550
on our cooperation with Dooro Bear.

330
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,589
Anyway, you did a good job with the project this time.

331
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,430
It's already 12 o'clock.

332
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,599
Let me buy you lunch.

333
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,510
No, thanks.

334
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,440
It's just what I should do.

335
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,640
You're welcome.

336
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:16,849
Let's go.

337
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,230
Look at them.

338
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,609
Put this in my office.

339
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,310
What are you doing?

340
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,900
We didn't steal the food. Why are you acting furtive?

341
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:41,970
Mr. Zhong.

342
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,470
I don't know

343
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,650
if I should tell you this.

344
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,320
Is the thing you talked about

345
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,150
that people in the company

346
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,510
that we're in a relationship?

347
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,900
That's right.

348
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,230
What should we do now?

349
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,080
There are so many gossipers.

350
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,490
How can we prove our innocence?

351
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,630
How?

352
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,120
There's no way to prove it.

353
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,720
Have you heard of this saying?

354
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,890
The more you explain it, the harder you can prove your innocence.

355
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,430
If we act furtive, we'll prove it's true instead.

356
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,120
So, relax.

357
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,870
It doesn't matter if they believe it or not.

358
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,670
How can that be?

359
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,710
If you strongly deny it,

360
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,310
they will think I'm forcing you.

361
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,150
How will I survive in the company in the future?

362
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,410
If I can't survive, you can't either.

363
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,600
Let's eat.

364
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,930
I can't even eat.

365
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,930
Mr. Zhong, Zhen Gaogui.

366
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,560
You're eating here too?

367
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,910
Longlong, let's go to the next table.

368
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,860
No, no.

369
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,460
Since you're here, let's eat together.

370
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,360
Sit down. Let's eat together.

371
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,130
Have a seat.

372
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,550
Are you sure?

373
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,030
It's nothing.

374
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,790
Will we disturb you?

375
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,670
No, no.

376
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,930
Have a seat.

377
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,840
Waiter, two sets of tableware, please. Thank you.

378
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,310
Okay.

379
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,130
Let me do it.

380
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,240
You've been working so hard lately.

381
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,610
I feel concerned for you.

382
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,150
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

383
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,750
Why are you so polite?

384
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,290
Well, that's necessary.

385
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,570
We'll be family in the future, right?

386
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,930
I remember you love spicy food.

387
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,540
Eat more if you like it.

388
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,070
Hello.

389
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,430
Thank you.

390
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,240
I need to use the bathroom.

391
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,770
I'll go with you.

392
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,080
Enjoy your meal, you two.

393
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,130
Aren't you overdoing it?

394
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,750
It looks more real.

395
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,020
You're playing with fire!

396
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,580
It's too late. There's no turning back.

397
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,520
Listen, there must be something between them.

398
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,550
Absolutely.

399
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,230
Boss.

400
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,930
What are you doing?

401
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,210
The lunch break ended at 1:30 p.m.

402
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,440
It's 1:35 now.

403
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,180
Sorry, Boss.

404
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,240
I had lunch with Mr. Zhong.

405
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,340
Can you be late just because you ate with Mr. Zhong?

406
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,630
Didn't your meeting

407
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,850
end this morning?

408
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,190
We should

409
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,750
keep our professionalism

410
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,680
and keep proper work distance.

411
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,190
Got it?

412
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
I understand. I won't do it again.

413
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,820
Don't do it again.

414
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,030
1:26.

415
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,240
I'm not late.

416
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,100
Gaogui.

417
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,570
You and Mr. Zhong from Meton…

418
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,130
Is it real?

419
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,790
Even you believe it?

420
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,990
Of course it's fake.

421
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,670
But the gossip is full of details.

422
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,710
I think it's going to become true soon.

423
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,470
I...

424
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,980
The problem is not whether you did it or not,

425
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,710
but whether others believe you did it or not,

426
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,230
especially whether your boss believes it.

427
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,810
No matter how I explain it,

428
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,410
no one will believe me.

429
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,980
Anyway, think of a solution.

430
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,250
If this goes on,

431
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,230
there will only be three consequences for you.

432
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,430
Which three?

433
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,890
The first one,

434
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,480
you'll be isolated and experience social death in the company.

435
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,190
The second one,

436
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,160
if you have a bad influence on the company,

437
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,510
the company will fire you.

438
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,380
The third one…

439
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,020
The third one is?

440
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,130
Make it real with Mr. Zhong,

441
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,640
become the wife of the rich man,

442
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,060
and climb to the peak of your life.

443
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,710
What are you talking about?

444
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,000
Am I that kind of person?

445
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,020
I'd rather eat instant noodles every day and die of poverty

446
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,550
than being called that.

447
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,100
How is that possible?

448
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,610
The promotion of Meton popcorn

449
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,120
[Meton Popcorn]

450
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,460
[Meeting Room]

451
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,850
is our first joint cooperation

452
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,680
with the anime IP Dooro Bear.

453
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,470
Now the estimated KPI

454
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,670
is already completed.

455
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,100
The detailed data are as follows.

456
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,430
This time we chose

457
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,680
three online social media platforms

458
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,790
and worked with 20 KOLs.

459
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,470
That's all I have to report.

460
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,390
Thank you.

461
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,950
Zhen Gaogui,

462
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,000
your report lacks

463
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,790
the summarization and analysis of the mistakes and errors in your work.

464
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,630
This part…

465
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,330
I don't think it's the right time yet

466
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,660
for the summary and analysis of the mistakes and errors.

467
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,540
But Zhen Gaogui,

468
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,190
there's one more thing we need you to do.

469
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,570
After all, this project is very successful.

470
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,870
You need to add some content about brand research

471
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,710
to see the prospect of the cooperation

472
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,710
of our company and the animation companies.

473
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,870
Okay, I'll do it now.

474
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,880
Wait.

475
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,270
You may not know

476
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,310
about specific products so well.

477
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,390
I'll go with you.

478
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,300
It might be more efficient to communicate face-to-face.

479
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,160
You'll go with me?

480
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,980
Yes.

481
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,830
Mr. Zhong.

482
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,230
Don't worry about the things in the company. I'll handle them.

483
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,630
Mr. Zhong.

484
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,790
I can help Director Lu

485
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,740
if there's too much work for her.

486
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,090
Just do your own thing.

487
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:51,610
Let's go.

488
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,670
I've talked to the supermarket manager.

489
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,660
We can go in now.

490
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,340
I've summarized all the brands suitable for research,

491
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,180
occupation, purchase channels,

492
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,940
purchase frequency,

493
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,680
and impression of Meton popcorn,

494
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,030
etcetera, etcetera.

495
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,900
Let's work early and get off work early, okay?

496
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,630
Let's go.

497
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,470
Wait a minute.

498
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,870
I think we should wait a little longer.

499
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,560
I have something to do.

500
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,510
What are you waiting for?

501
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,710
Boss!

502
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,980
Hello, Mr. Zhong.

503
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,570
Director Zhang, why are you here?

504
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,600
I'm helping you with the market research.

505
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,840
Can't Zhen Gaogui do such a trivial thing alone?

506
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,030
Why does she need you to come in person?

507
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,470
Aren't you busy at work?

508
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,550
I'm not busy.

509
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,180
Not very.

510
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,510
Zhen Gaogui

511
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,150
still doesn't have much experience in market research.

512
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,470
Yes, yes, yes.

513
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,510
As her leader,

514
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,950
I have to come personally to control the quality, right?

515
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,750
Yes, yes, yes.

516
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,870
Now our project is closing.

517
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,220
I have to make sure nothing goes wrong.

518
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,340
Am I right, Zhen Gaogui?

519
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,790
Well,

520
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,880
thank you.

521
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,390
Well,

522
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,660
thank you.

523
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,000
Hello.

524
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,620
Can you fill out a questionnaire for me?

525
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:20,970
I'm sorry.

526
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,920
You can draw a lucky draw if you fill it in.

527
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,580
All right then.

528
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,740
Thank you for helping me.

529
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,250
Don't come to me for such things in the future.

530
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,550
Who else can I come to?

531
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,910
Besides,

532
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,350
you told me to keep professional.

533
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,510
I'm doing what you said.

534
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,640
You listen to whatever I say, right?

535
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,140
Done.

536
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,640
Okay, thank you.

537
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,790
You go that way. I'll go this way.

538
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,710
See you later.

539
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,410
See you later.

540
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,130
See you later.

541
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,760
From 20 to 30…

542
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,460
And then...

543
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,350
Zhen Gaogui, let's watch a movie together.

544
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,370
Men From Tomorrow is very popular.

545
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,910
This movie

546
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,620
is sponsored by our competitor.

547
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,120
You

548
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,940
can study the implantation technique by watching it.

549
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,340
We'll think about it in the future.

550
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,230
Well, I...

551
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,840
Mr. Zhong.

552
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,820
Aren't you going to invite me too?

553
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,400
It's such a great thing

554
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,950
to learn about other brands' implantation techniques.

555
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,360
You should have invited me.

556
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,990
What back luck!

557
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,230
It is the golden period.

558
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,310
Look.

559
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,200
There are only two seats left.

560
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,060
I'll invite you next time, okay?

561
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,710
It can't be helped.

562
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,590
But now it's time for our employees

563
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,710
to get off work.

564
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,780
Mr. Zhong, if you need her to work overtime,

565
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,550
please pay attention to

566
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,470
her rest time.

567
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,110
Don't worry.

568
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,840
We'll have a long-term cooperation in the future.

569
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,750
I'm counting on her to do big projects for me.

570
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,150
Boss, I'm going then?

571
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,210
Study hard.

572
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,390
Don't think about anything irrelevant to study.

573
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,260
Big projects.

574
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,060
I'm off now.

575
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,090
Thank you.

576
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,230
Okay.

577
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,230
See you.

578
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,710
Viewers of "Men From Tomorrow"

579
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,470
can enter now.

580
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,390
Hello, is this the place?

581
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,710
Yes, come in.

582
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,750
Where is the bathroom?

583
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,370
Just go ahead.

584
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,190
Okay, thank you.

585
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,100
Here, your ticket.

586
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:44,810
For two.

587
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,280
Okay, come in.

588
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,900
I think we are next to each other.

589
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,220
Ju Ran, this way.

590
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,670
What's wrong?

591
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,240
Don't look over there. Look over here.

592
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,550
My colleagues are there. We can't let them see us.

593
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,990
What are you looking at?

594
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,260
He looks familiar.

595
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,980
Does he really know you?

596
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,640
He didn't even recognize you.

597
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,810
Not necessarily. He looks familiar.

598
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,370
Don't you think so?

599
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,750
His girlfriend is right there. They're having a date.

600
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,230
Why are you staring at them? It's embarrassing.

601
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,790
Here.

602
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:47,970
What?

603
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,510
If you act, act the full set.

604
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,070
All right.

605
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,550
They can't see us now.

606
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,800
Let's go!

607
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,150
Wait. Don't move.

608
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,390
Okay, hurry up.

609
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,810
Don't put on makeup in the bathroom.

610
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,010
Mr. Zhong.

611
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,470
Did they leave?

612
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,880
No, not yet.

613
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,200
Are they still here?

614
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,310
Yes.

615
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,620
Didn't they already leave?

616
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,390
They left?

617
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,580
Okay.

618
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,370
Let's go, too.

619
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,390
You said you wanted to buy something.

620
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,510
Why didn't you say it earlier?

621
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,030
I saw it before.

622
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:17,870
Look.

623
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,530
Only for the two hours before closing.

624
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,550
[Limited-time discount for bread]
[Only for the two hours before closing]
[Surprise! 50% off]

625
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,410
The near-expired bread is 50% off.

626
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,750
I'll buy some too.

627
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,190
There's no bread at home.

628
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,630
You go out first. Later I'll pay it all.

629
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,450
Okay, remember to give me the receipt.

630
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,680
I'll transfer the money to you.

631
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,590
Okay, go.

632
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,120
Hello.

633
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,840
Which is the freshly baked bread?

634
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,410
This is all freshly baked bread over here.

635
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:19,820
Okay.

636
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,320
Bill, please.

637
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,440
Okay.

638
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,530
Thank you.

639
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,980
These are not the two I chose.

640
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,030
I forgot to take yours.

641
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,070
Just eat mine.

642
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,010
I just remembered that I don't eat breakfast recently.

643
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,500
Just eat it for me. Thank you.

644
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,350
How much is this? I have to transfer it to you.

645
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,020
No need.

646
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,790
Mom, I'm home.

647
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,310
You're back.

648
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,150
You work late every day?

649
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,120
Do you want to die?

650
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,060
No, I went to a movie.

651
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,510
A movie?

652
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,070
With whom?

653
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,890
You were on a date, weren't you?

654
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,960
No.

655
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,300
I was talking about work with Mr. Zhong.

656
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,470
We watched a movie passingly.

657
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,930
Talking about work

658
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,440
and watching a movie…

659
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,110
Does he like you?

660
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,180
What do you mean?

661
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,390
Stop, Mom. Enough talk about that.

662
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,430
Look, so much bread.

663
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,310
It's all your favorite.

664
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,790
Why did you buy so much bread?

665
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,630
No, Mr. Zhong bought it.

666
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,620
He said he didn't want it, so he gave it to me.

667
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,890
Not only were you on a date, but he also gave you a gift.

668
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,430
Mom, it's not a gift.

669
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,630
You'll know about it later, right?

670
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,860
I hope you won't be proven wrong.

671
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,440
Don't worry.

672
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,350
I won't be proven wrong.

673
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,120
Well, when you're free,

674
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,030
find a chance

675
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,670
and invite him home.

676
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,580
If you want to see him, ask him out yourself.

677
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,860
You look so happy. You got a new project?

678
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:24,790
Congratulations.

679
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,410
It's just a small project of hundreds of thousands.

680
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,220
But the person who interfaced with me

681
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,270
gave me some benefits.

682
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,010
He gave me two tickets for the movie

683
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,030
"Men From Tomorrow".

684
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,940
Let's watch it together.

685
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,160
Men From Tomorrow.

686
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,870
That movie?

687
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,990
What? You've watched it?

688
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,850
It was just on yesterday.

689
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,140
Who did you watch it with?

690
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,650
I haven't.

691
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,850
I just read about it online.

692
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,220
It seems to be a romantic tearjerker, right?

693
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,350
You like it too, right?

694
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,590
I'm not going.

695
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,310
Aren't you not working overtime today?

696
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,380
Are you going on a date with Zhong Yiming?

697
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,580
How is that possible?

698
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,000

Everyone is crying.

702
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,110
How could you fall asleep?

703
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,360
It's over?

704
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,670
What's going on with you?

705
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,320
Maybe I've been too tired lately.

706
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,830
I get sleepy whenever I'm in a dark place.

[Zhong Yiming]

708
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,889
Hello, Mr. Zhong. What's the matter?

709
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,350
I sent you an email.

710
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,710
After watching the movie,

711
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,010
I had some new ideas.

712
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,679
After you finish your research on the same type,

713
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,460
we'll talk about it face-to-face.

714
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,060
Please say it again.

00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,110
I'm sorry then.

719
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,210
I might disturb your movie-watching today.

720
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,460
I still have work for you. Please come back and work overtime.

721
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,950
Mr. Zhong, I'm back.

725

I've listed them in detail for you.

726
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,810
Look, the analysis of the most popular taste

727
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,500
needs more data to support it.

728

What is the ratio?

732
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,130
What exactly is the negative public opinion?

733
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,570

First, analyze the taste and search the data.

00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,790
Yeah. Gaogui.

747
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,720
Aren't you in a relationship with Mr. Zhong?

748
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,370
He doesn't care about you at all.

749
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,920
He even orders you around.

750
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,790
Exactly.

751
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,390
Maybe

752
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,310
Zhen Gaogui will take on big projects in the future.

753
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,190
She might be our Party A.

754
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,350
In that case…

755
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,510
Didn't your family teach you when you were young?

756
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,230
Don't talk when eating.

757
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:27,920
Focus on eating.

758
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,560
I'm sorry, everyone.

759
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,260
I've taken up a lot of public resources recently.

760
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,800
Now I have something to announce.

761
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,910
You want to see me?

762
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:49,350
Yes.

763
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,440
Have you finished the contract?

764
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,680
Almost.

765
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,480
I heard that Zhen Gaogui has changed a boyfriend.

766
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,960
Changed a boyfriend?

767
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,950
When?

768
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,600
Actually,

769
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,620
I've always had a boyfriend.

770
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,770
But it's not Mr. Zhong.

771
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,840
What did you say?

772
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,320
Shouldn't her boyfriend

773
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,310
be me?

774
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,430
It's Lin Yue.

775
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,950
Lin Yue?

776
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,390
No way.

777
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,420
I heard it from the people from Xinda PR.

778
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,150
Her boyfriend is you?

779
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,160
Are you sure Zhen Gaogui's name

780
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,410
wasn't mentioned during your communication with Lin?

781
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,810
Yes, I'm sure.

782
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,030
How did they get to know each other?

783
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,940
My boyfriend and I

784
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,260
met abroad.

785
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,960
We are very close.

786
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,300
He was busy with work,

787
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,990
so we didn't disclose it to the public.

788
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,190
This is...

789
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,340
Is this Lin Yue who is very popular online?

790
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,720
Yes.

791
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,590
You have a sharp eye, Ju Ran.

792
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,070
Isn't Lin Yue the boss of Dooro Bear

793
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,310
that cooperated with Meton?

794
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,290
I wanted to work with him before.

795
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,430
He charged too much, so it didn't work out.

796
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,080
Gaogui,

797
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,050
are you kidding?

798
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,180
How can I be kidding?

799
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,390
Look at the photos.

800
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,410
It's real. Look.

801
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,360
What's wrong?

802
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,520
You look exhausted.

803
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,350
I don't know if you're really asleep or pretending.

804
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,350
I had an international meeting at 3 a.m. yesterday.

805
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,600
I thought you would definitely come to class,

806
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,810
so I got up and came here early.

807
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,200
You came here to see me?

808
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,380
Yes.

809
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,950
I want to play badminton

810
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,550
with you more.

811
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,020
You came to the yoga club to play badminton?

812
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,530
Can you lie more glibly?

813
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,710
How many girls have heard you lies?

814
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,820
Which one am I?

815
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,230
What do you mean?

816
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:57,870
Sorry.

817
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,720
What on earth do you mean?

818
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,760
Everyone knows. Stop pretending.

819
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,430
What am I pretending?

820
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,250
I...

821
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,690
The woman you're hiding behind you.

822
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,790
I'm hiding…

823
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,670
Did you hear something?

824
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,510
Do you know what one needs

825
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,470
to play badminton well?

826
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,110
I don't know.

827
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,630
Please enlighten me, master!

828
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,590
You're not qualified

829
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,760
to be my disciple.

830
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,590
Look at you.

831
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,550
You even fell asleep in a yoga class.

832
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,830
It means you must have suffered a severe muscle strain.

833
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,070
If you go on like this,

834
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,730
you might not be able to move anymore.

835
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,540
Wait.

836
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,250
Is there a causal relationship between muscle strain

837
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,190
and sleeping in class?

838
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,390
Master is right.

839
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,630
Whatever Master says is correct.

840
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,720
Turn around.

841
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,020
Why?

842
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,870
Get down.

843
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,020
What are you going to do?

844
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,520
Just lie down.

845
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,590
Okay.

846
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,240
Whatever the teacher says.

847
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,070
Get down.

848
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,220
Then what?

849
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,540
Give me your hand.

850
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,500
No, wait.

851
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,560
No, no, no.

852
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,470
Are you trying to murder me?

853
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,910
If everything is fine inside your body, you won't feel pain. If you feel pain, there must be something wrong.

854
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,450
I guess you won't be able to get well again!
