2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,880
Xinda PR's solution

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,750
is really good.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,070
The transformation rate of individual influencers will be better.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,020
It's mainly about the targeted resources.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,830
What do you think, Director Lu?

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,670
We seldom engaged in online marketing before.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,270
I think it will work

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,510
in this way.

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,830
Objection.

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,830
The influence of our brand has always been very weak online.

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,230
If we don't use our brand influence

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,310
in our new products,

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,030
it's like starting from scratch.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,310
Or what?

16
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,710
How strong is the influence

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,830
of our brand?

18
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,150
If we don't explore new methods or new channels,

19
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,550
what else can we do?

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,910
Do you have a better idea, Mr. Sun?

21
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,870
Tell us.

22
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,230
So we didn't wait for nothing.

23
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,950
Xinda PR gave us

24
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,270
a satisfying answer.

25
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,880
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

26
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,990
I'll wait for

27
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,540
Director Lu's detailed plan.

28
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,230
Okay.

29
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,740
Let's have dinner together after work.

30
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,870
Dinner?

31
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,590
Will we still talk about work?

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,670
No, we don't talk about it after work.

33
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,789
This...

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,870
Hello?

35
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:23,950
I know, Boss.

36
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,789
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,350
Director Zhang has something urgent.

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,230
He asked me to come over.

39
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,310
Boss.

40
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,509
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

41
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,030
Didn't you say it's just a work meal?

42
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,590
Yes.

43
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,870
Isn't this also a work meal?

44
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,229
I thought it would be fast food.

45
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,710
It's so formal.

46
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,860
You've been in the company for some time.

47
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,950
I haven't had a chance to talk to you.

48
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,710
About what?

49
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,789
Boss, don't worry.

50
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,590
I will work hard

51
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,960
and live up to your expectations.

52
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,590
No.

53
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,030
Just a casual chat.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,270
For example, do you have any problem at work

55
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,710
or difficulties in getting along with your colleagues?

56
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,829
How do you feel about your boss?

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,750
You can tell me.

58
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,910
Good.

59
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,870
I'm still a newbie.

60
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,120
I'm not familiar with many links.

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,270
I may make mistakes.

62
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,550
But I'll work hard.

63
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,870
I think it's normal.

64
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,310
I believe when you were a newcomer,

65
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,590
you had encountered many troubles.

66
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,150
I've been working in Xinda for many years,

67
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,430
from an ordinary operation executive

68
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,100
to today's account director.

69
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,870
I often made mistakes when I was a newbie.

70
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,710
Boss.

71
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,710
You're being modest.

72
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,550
I heard from colleagues

73
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,590
that you are the legend of our company.

74
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,710
There's no such thing.

75
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,430
Success is all about 70% of efforts

76
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,710
plus 30% of luck.

77
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,750
If we want the company to sustain,

78
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,310
we have to work for it first.

79
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,630
But the definition of work

80
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,560
is different.

81
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,030
Some people

82
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,430
are elites.

83
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,270
Some people

84
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,870
just make do with life.

85
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,140
You're right.

86
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,390
But when it comes to work,

87
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,590
there must be something

88
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,590
other than money.

89
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,910
For example,

90
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,590
happiness,

91
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,310
sense of accomplishment,

92
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,030
or self-value.

93
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,310
And

94
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,110
you may meet someone.

95
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,470
You are right.

96
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,710
I know

97
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,550
you

98
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,190
spare no effort

99
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,750
to your job.

100
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,310
But sometimes,

101
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,870
it's better

102
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,190
to face challenges with someone else.

103
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,270
So

104
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,590
if you have any difficulties,

105
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,160
just let me know.

106

[Amazing Girls]

107
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,140
[Episode 13]

108
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,630
Mom, I'm home.

109
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,390
What took you so long?

110
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,710
My boss

111
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,030
treated me to a meal and we had a chat.

112
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,180
So we talked for a while.

113
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,720
Did your leader invite you to dinner

114
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,150
because you performed well

115
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,060
at work recently?

116
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,830
You are right.

117
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,950
I signed a big contract recently.

118
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,390
I haven't told you yet.

119
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,070
It's still Mr. Zhong's company.

120
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,310
Is he taking care of you?

121
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,950
Probably not.

122
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,190
I won with my skills.

123
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,830
Besides, there were others in this competition.

124
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,110
Actually,

125
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,590
I won

126
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,670
by a narrow margin.

127
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,630
My daughter is mature.

128
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,270
Actually,

129
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,070
I haven't realized it until I am today's old

130
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,270
that winning or losing is only a result.

131
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,630
No one cares you win by a narrow or large margin.

132
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,070
When you're having a good time,

133
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,830
everyone applauds for you.

134
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,630
When you fail,

135
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,310
everyone is gone.

136
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,430
Mom, why are you

137
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,150
this philosophical now?

138
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,270
Gaogui.

139
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,060
I have some samples of lipstick.

140
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,070
Come and try them on.

141
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,950
So many?

142
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,630
Let me tell you.

143
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,310
I think this color suits you very well.

144
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,950
It's called Victory Red.

145
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,190
Use this color for your proposals.

146
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,870
Try it.

147
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,950
You always wear the so-called man-mesmerized colors.

148
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,830
How many men have you mesmerized?

149
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,060
There's always a chance of failure.

150
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,940
It's not surprising that I'll fail.

151
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,390
I think I'd better wear my Victory Red

152
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,870
combined with your man-mesmerized red.

153
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,870
Double luck.

154
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,870
But everything's gone well

155
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,430
with your work lately.

156
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,150
If I knew you were so good,

157
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,150
I wouldn't have let you work for Zhang Feiyang.

158
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,750
If you joined our team.

159
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,710
I could get some honor from you.

160
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,390
I haven't had one single good day.

161
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,310
Don't worry.

162
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,870
You are my talent scout.

163
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,190
I will never forget you

164
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,270
if I can live a good life one day.

165
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,400
[Come to the meeting please.]

166
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,870
I haven't slacked off today.

167
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,160
I need to work now.

168
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,030
Bye.

169
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,390
Bye.

170
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,390
The design drawings of Dooro Bear are just drafts.

171
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,070
The authorization hasn't been completed yet.

172
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,030
They're still designing.

173
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,950
I'll start with the PR releases for the hot topic.

174
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,190
The influencers' schedule

175
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,830
will be confirmed when the new product is launched.

176
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,270
You said you were busy.

177
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,710
You were busy with this, right?

178
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,390
Yes.

179
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,510
Is it helpful for you

180
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,070
to hide from me?

181
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,510
You may think so.

182
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,750
It's helpful,

183
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,190
but not much.

184
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,830
Will it affect you negatively

185
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,030
if we meet?

186
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,590
You know what others say.

187
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,070
Whenever I make some achievements now,

188
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,140
everyone thinks I'm taking shortcuts.

189
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,160
There are not so many shortcuts.

190
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,390
I don't even dare to take any shortcut now.

191
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
Do you think I became what I am now

192
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,060
by taking shortcuts?

193
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,510
Do you think I'm happy to do that?

194
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,830
I think...

195
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,960
There will be more difficulties after that.

196
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,830
It's like to push out

197
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,750
a new flavor of popcorn.

198
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,630
Meton needs to update its brand image.

199
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,020
It may be harder for the company in the future.

200
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,150
We are responsible for updating new products.

201
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,390
You're not the only one.

202
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,630
But

203
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,150
if

204
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,630
maybe

205
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,140
apart from work...

206
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,990
Apart from work,

207
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,630
we are just

208
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,910
business partners.

209
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,270
Everyone,

210
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,750
I have a new project too.

211
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,910
Let's have afternoon tea.

212
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,790
Here.

213
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,510
Thank you, Yingxiong.

214
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,390
Lele.

215
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,750
Thank you.

216
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,230
Gaogui.

217
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,110
Thank you.

218
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,870
The prettiest one

219
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,390
goes to Ju Ran for sure.

220
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,150
Thank you.

221
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,630
Thank you, Ju Ran.

222
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,860
Congratulations.

223
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,110
Forget it.

224
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,990
Your project with Meton Food

225
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,350
profits more than

226
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,230
my projects in a year combined.

227
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,870
I wish your next project

228
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,750
more profitable than mine.

229
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,510
To be honest,

230
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,990
the project was introduced by Ju Ran

231
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,030
because she was too busy to handle it.

232
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,510
She thinks I have potential.

233
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,470
By gaining more experience,

234
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,390
I could do better.

235
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,630
So...

236
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,150
Thank you, Ju Ran.

237
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,110
You're welcome.

238
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,500
Gaogui.

239
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,150
Let's invite team members from Meton

240
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,110
on the weekend.

241
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,510
The colleagues from all departments

242
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,790
need to get in touch in the future.

243
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,870
It's better to take this time

244
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,230
to get familiar with each other.

245
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,110
Consider it as a team-building activity.

246
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,870
Okay.

247
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,230
Come in.

248
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,110
Well, Mr. Zhong.

249
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,510
I'm here to persuade you

250
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,230
about Cui Le,

251
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,030
our brand ambassador.

252
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,870
She...

253
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,270
First,

254
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,350
I promise you with my loyalty to the company

255
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,270
that this has nothing to do

256
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,870
with my personal benefits.

257
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,870
All these years since she became famous,

258
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,620
we've been renewing the contract with her.

259
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,750
It's about to expire.

260
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,750
Please think about it.

261
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,630
Since it's been so many years,

262
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,750
we need to change another brand ambassador

263
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,480
who is younger and more iconic.

264
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,390
And the contract is expiring.

265
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,630
It's reasonable not to renew it.

266
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,790
It's legal.

267
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,510
It matters the friendship of your family for years.

268
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,630
You always talk about the law.

269
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,030
You are too serious.

270
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,230
Director Lu,

271
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,390
please talk to Mr. Zhong.

272
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,030
You know how important Cui Le is

273
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,390
better than me, right?

274
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,750
Mr. Zhong.

275
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,030
How about this?

276
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,350
Let's

277
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,670
think about it carefully.

278
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,670
There's no law

279
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,630
stipulating that we must renew the contract with Cui Le.

280
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,990
But she has been our brand ambassador

281
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,870
for so many years.

282
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,150
Consumers

283
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,870
have got used to her.

284
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,990
Besides, Cui Le is not in a good condition.

285
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,150
I'm worried that she would make a false countercharge

286
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,750
if the contract is not renewed.

287
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,870
Okay, I'll think about it.

288
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,670
By the way, we'll have a party

289
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,390
with Xinda PR this weekend.

290
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,150
Let's go together.

291
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,470
Let's talk about this then.

292
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,030
OK.

293
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,910
I won't go.

294
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,750
I have a lot to do on weekends.

295
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,390
Everyone in the company knows it.

296
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,870
Okay, I won't force you.

297
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,630
I'll get back to work.

298
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,750
Thank you for your hard work.

299
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,550
Let's thank Director Lu first.

300
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,870
You're welcome. Thank you for your hard work.

301
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,110
Cheers!

302
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,470
We're finally together.

303
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,030
Yes.

304
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,350
I hope our cooperation

305
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,470
will go smoothly.

306
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,510
-Xue. -For sure it will.

307
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,790
Grill the wheat gluten longer for me.

308
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,870
Okay, Mr. Zhong.

309
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,870
Doesn't it taste good?

310
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,750
Yes.

311
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,230
How is it, Gaogui? Is it good?

312
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,070
Yes.

313
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,870
I want to have some sunflower seeds.

314
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,550
Where are Ju Ran and her team?

315
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,270
They are busy working overtime to change the plan.

316
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,750
They don't have time. Let's eat first.

317
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,510
Eat more if you like.

318
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,030
This looks good.

319
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,270
Come on, everyone, look at me.

320
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,030
It's the game time.

321
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,110
Count me in. Count me in.

322
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,390
Come with me if you want to join.

323
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,270
What game? Count me in.

324
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,150
Ke'er, join us.

325
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,110
It's boring sitting there.

326
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,510
Come on.

327
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,780
You'll know soon.

328
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,230
Mr. Zhong.

329
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,390
Do you want to join us?

330
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:42,870
Sure.

331
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,670
Hurry up.

332
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,750
But I want to stay here.

333
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,270
It feels good here.

334
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,990
Is everyone here?

335
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,670
Let me explain the rules.

336
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,030
Everyone puts one finger

337
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,870
into a hole.

338
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,870
Then I'll press the button.

339
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,910
The red light will sparkle.

340
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,750
When it stops,

341
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,350
electrical current will be sent out from where the red light is on.

342
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,870
Of course, you can pull out your fingers.

343
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,110
But if your light is not on,

344
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,230
you have to eat lemon.

345
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,910
Zhen Gaogui and Director Zhang lost.

346
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,510
Neither of you got an electric shock.

347
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,430
Director Lu got an electric shock.

348
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,340
You didn't say anything.

349
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,430
I had to put up with it.

350
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,110
Come on.

351
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,990
Then you share weal and woe together.

352
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,790
Can I eat for her?

353
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,870
No way.

354
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,670
Come on, Gaogui.

355
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,750
I'll eat with her.

356
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,390
Is Director Zhang okay with it?

357
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,030
This is...

358
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,470
It's sweet, for sure.

359
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,390
Then you may eat more.

360
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,870
Gaogui, you didn't get an electric shock, did you?

361
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,110
Mr. Zhong, your are cheating by doing it so slowly.

362
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,910
Come on. I admit defeat.

363
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,870
Cheers.

364
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,150
It's my turn to eat lemon with Director Lu.

365
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,350
Zhen Gaogui.

366
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,030
You didn't say anything when you got an electric shock.

367
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,620
Actually, I'm really scared.

368
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,150
But I don't want Mr. Zhong

369
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,630
to eat lemon anymore.

370
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,390
Are you out of your mind?

371
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,150
How about this? I'll take you to get some fresh air.

372
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,630
Let's go.

373
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,630
Call two more people here.

374
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,150
Where did they go?

375
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,150
You can ask Mr. Zhong later.

376
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,630
No.

377
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,110
I'm coming.

378
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,510
Coming.

379
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,270
Come on. Go on.

380
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,630
You two lost.

381
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,790

570
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,910

571
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,550
Right?

572
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,430

573

575
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,470

576
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,670
It doesn't look like we're just having a chat.

577
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,190
Let's sit down and talk.

578
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,110
I think

579
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,670
we will be in disadvantage

580
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,070
if we don't renew the contract with Cui Le.

581
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,710
She can do everything in exchange of her popularity.

582
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,510
She's completely in a goblin mode.

583
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,430
She is loose-lipped now.

584
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,590
It's the same as what I thought.

585
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,310
If she spreads some negative information about Meton

586
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,790
by hyping up the fact

587
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,230
that we don't renew the contract with her,

588
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,750
this will damage our brand greatly.

589
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,590
It's possible that she may take advantage of this

590
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,710
to bargain with us.

591
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,790
Yes.

592
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,230
Anyway,

593
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,950
we can't renew the contract with her.

594
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,750

598
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,470

602
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,670
Have you figured out what to say about Cui Le?

603
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,750
Just tell the truth.

604
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,460
Will they agree

605
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,590
with that?

606
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,830
I can't lie.

607
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,110
What's their attitude now?

608
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,550
I called her agent yesterday.

609
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,070
Her agent asked me to talk to Cui Le directly.

610
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,470
Isn't that obvious enough?

611
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,670
Obvious?

612
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,550
With her poor popularity,

613
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,750
Cui Le is made fun of

614
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,270
if she still has any cooperative program.

615
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,550
You started the conversation by not renewing the contract.

616
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,510
Who wants to talk to you?

617
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,190
Is Mr. Zhong going with you?

618
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,550
He said he would be late.

619
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,030
Take care.

620
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,510

621
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,070

622
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,310
Is this Mr. Zhong's excuse

623
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,710
for not wanting to see her?

624
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,510
Mr. Zhong

625
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,070

628
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,310

00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,830
When I was filming "Wonderful Days",

757
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,550
I was a popular female leading role.

758
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,750
I worked 12 hours a day

759
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,710
without a break.

760
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,720
Honey,

761
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,200
I have no choice.

762
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,550
I've asked everyone I can.

763
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,510
Just wait.

764
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,750
Hello, Tina.

765
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,950
I'm Zhen Gaogui, the one who contacted you.

766
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,230
Sorry, honey, I'm still busy.

767
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,590
You can talk to Ms. Le directly.

768
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,270
She'll be done soon.

769
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,590
Where is my juice?

770
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,230
I want sugar free.

771
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,620
The sweetness kills me.

772
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,710
She has such a temper.

773
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,190
Ms. Le,

774
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,710
you'd better have

775
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,190
a new assistant.

776
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,710
I'll finish the handover before I leave.

777
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,989
I haven't get paid for two months.

778
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,030
Will you pay me

779
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:45,830
when you're free?

780
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,710
I need to pay the rent.

781
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,590
You don't have to come tomorrow.

782
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,760
I'll transfer the money to you tonight.

783
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,310
Leave.

784
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Many of them are on the waiting list to be my assistant.

785
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,670
Boss.

786
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,310
She's angry right now.

787
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,550
I think we'd better not come to her now.

788
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,990
You've improved.

789
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,300
You can notice

790
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,830
the timing to speak.

791
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,110
But she is pitiful to some degree.

792
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,190
She's waiting for the female lead.

793
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,710
The assistant wanted to resign.

794
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,790
Her agent disliked her too.

795
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,180
When she was popular,

796
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,990
she didn't even need to walk by herself.

797
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,360
Who can bear it?

798
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,470
She has to.

799
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,230
It's all for life.

800
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,470
Why are you suddenly so mature?

801
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,550
You shared the same experience with her?

802
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,110
Nothing.

803
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,910
Boss, you may get back to work.

804
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,630
I'll be here,

805
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,310
and think about other solutions.

806
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,830
Okay.

807
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,310
I'm going to have a telephone conference.

808
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,590
It's so remote here.

809
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,190
I'll give you a ride later.

810
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,350
Tell me when you're done.

811
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,710
And tell me if you can't solve it.

812
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,470
Okay.

I am not sure

828
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,870
if we have found a way out

829
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,550
for the issue of Cui Le.

830
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,630
So?

831
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,910
