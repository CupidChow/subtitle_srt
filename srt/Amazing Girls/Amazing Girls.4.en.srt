You don't think Xinda PR's proposal is not good enough?

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,190
It's too complicated.

I don't think it will work well.

12
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,570
The proposal done by Xinda PR

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,230
has some merits.

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,000

Wisdom PR's proposal

19
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,910

But there isn't any problem with it.

We've been working with them for so many years.

I'm so old.

191
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,390
I've been through all kinds of difficulties.

192
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,630
You

193
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,630
will meet a lot of difficulties

194
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,830
in your workplace.

195
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,820
You need to learn to solve them wisely.

196
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,750
I will always remember

197
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,270
what you just said.

198
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,980
Okay.

199
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,140
Have some grapes.

200
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,150
Are they good?

201
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,830
So sweet.

202
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,510
Really?

203
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,750
Grandpa Tong.

204
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,830
Actually,

205
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,750
something happened to my family recently.

206
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,870
So we didn't give you allowances.

207
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,070
It's okay.

208
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,920
I don't want your money.

209
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,510
Actually, I didn't spend

210
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,270
the money given by your family at all.

211
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,510
I saved it.

212
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,669
I think

213
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,940
when you grow up,

214
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,909
you need money to do a lot of things.

215
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,669
If you meet any major difficulty,

216
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,429
the money can help you a lot.

217
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,230
What happened to your family?

218
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,950
If you need it,

219
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,950
you can ask me for the money anytime.

220
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,710
Grandpa Tong.

221
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,440
We gave you the allowances

222
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,350
because we wanted you to take good care of yourself.

223
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,350
Don't save it.

224
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,790
Besides,

225
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,840
the thing that happened to my family is not a big deal.

226
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,710
We just have some financial difficulties.

227
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,840
We'll be fine.

228
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,670
Please take good care of yourself

229
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,670
so that I won't be worried.

230
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,790
Let me see her off.

231
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,550
Okay.

232
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,030
Watch the steps.

233
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:11,950
Gaogui.

234
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,910
Be honest with me.

235
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,070
You really don't need money to solve your problem now?

236
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,950
No, we don't.

237
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,350
Don't worry.

238
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,670
Look at you.

239
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,790
Why are you hiding it from me?

240
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,980
I can see it.

241
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,950
My problems are not serious ones.

242
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,630
I can solve them by myself.

243
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,710
You can rest assured.

244
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,590
Do take good care of yourself.

245
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,910
Look at you.

246
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,430
I need to go now.

247
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,210
-Okay.
-You can go back now.

248
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,070
After your problem is solved,

249
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,790
come visit me often.

250
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,960
I will.

251
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,190
Please go back to your room. Bye.

252
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,790
What's wrong with the outfit?

253
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,470
Mom, I don't think I can wash it clean.

254
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,820
I didn't buy it. I borrowed it.

255
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,070
It's very expensive.

256
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,890
-Where?
-How can I return it now?

257
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,070
Let me see.

258
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,150
This big stain?

259
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,110
If you can't wash it clean, you can't return it?

260
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,190
Let's try every possible way.

261
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,830
More of this.

262
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,590
Mom.

263
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,230
Will this work?

264
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,030
Mom.

265
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,470
There's smoke.

266
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,130
Forget it, Mom.

267
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,360
I shouldn't have borrowed it.

268
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,590
I can only take it as a gift that only lasted one day.

269
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,070
Don't we

270
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,420
have some credit cards

271
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,590
with high credit limit?

272
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,480
Mom.

273
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,310
They have a credit limit of hundreds of thousands yuan.

274
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,790
But we can't use them.

275
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,950
If we use the credit cards, how will we pay off the credit card debt?

276
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,350
Alright, Mom.

277
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,070
Hello, sir.

278
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,290
Do you like this dress?

279
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,350
Do you want to buy it for your girlfriend?

280
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,790
Sort of.

281
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,430
You have a good taste.

282
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,830
This dress

283
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,200
is from the new collection for this quarter.

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,790
There're only two dresses for each size.

285
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,950
Last week, we just sold one of this size.

286
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,710
What is your girlfriend's size?

287
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,310
What is the size of the dress you sold?

288
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,310
It's S.

289
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,770
I'll take an S size.

290
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,060
Okay, please pay the bill there.

291
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,950
I'll pack it up for you later.

292
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,570
Okay.

293
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,350
These are the materials for the previous meeting.

294
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,190
I arranged them in an order of their importance.

295
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,950
Okay.

296
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,910
The collaboration with Wisdom PR has started.

297
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,910
They want to talk to you in detail.

298
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,350
Got it.

299
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,130
The receptionist said you weren't here for the whole morning.

300
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,190
Don't think it is inappropriate

301
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,960
to be absent during working hours?

302
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,710
I was absent

303
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,070
for a reason.

304
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,790
I...

305
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,190
I went out to do some research.

306
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,070
Ke'er, what's wrong?

307
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,950
You look so serious.

308
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,030
I think there is something going on

309
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,070
between Mr. Zhong and Zhen Gaogui from Xinda PR.

310
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,950
We may hear some news about them in the future.

311
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,830
Tell me more details.

312
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,450
After she showed her proposal last time,

313
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,000
she got a coffee stain on her dress, right?

314
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,430
Yes. I remember it.

315
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,310
I saw a new dress

316
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,280
in Mr. Zhong's office just now.

317
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,840
It's exactly the same as the one Zhen Gaogui wore last time.

318
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,930
It's just a dress.

319
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,030
Can it suggest anything?

320
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,740
It's not a simple white T-shirt

321
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,820
that can be found everywhere.

322
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,070
I'm a woman with the sixth sense.

323
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,950
I have a feeling that the dress is for Zhen Gaogui.

324
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,070
So?

325
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,190
So he will be in love soon

326
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,430
and then he'll care less and less about his work.

327
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,430
I see.

328
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,550
Hello?

329
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,070
Hello, Gao.

330
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,620
Where are you?

331
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,830
The deliveryman left the coffees downstairs.

332
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,040
Bring them up when you come back.

333
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,500
There are many coffees. Be careful.

334
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,630
No problem.

335
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,350
Next, it's about the arrangement.

336
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,270
There are seven areas.

337
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,510
The client wants to

338
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,030
get as many people as possible to know their products.

339
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,510
Your coffees.

340
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,270
Gao.

341
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,260
Ju Ran.

342
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,350
Are you free now?

343
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,540
Do you know how to use the camera?

344
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,910
Hello.

345
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,900
Excuse me.

346
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,070
Please listen to me.

347
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,150
There is a special activity in our shop.

348
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,910
As long as you take a photo

349
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,710
with our panda doll and post it on your Weibo account,

350
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,990
you'll get the chance to win a reward.

351
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,870
Be happy.

352
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,510
Sir, relax.

353
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,790
Look at me.

354
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,110
One more, kid.

355
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,750
Lower.

356
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,390
Two, three.

357
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,670
One more. Show a new pose.

358
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,750
Thank you.

359
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,910
Smile, please.

360
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,230
Come on.

361
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,270
Okay.

362
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,630
Thank you.

363
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,670
Stand on each side of the panda.

364
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,390
Okay.

365
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,080
Careful.

366
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,630
Brother Panda!

367
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,670
-He fell!
-Are you okay?

368
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,990
Sorry.

369
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,790
You go there first.

370
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,510
I'll send you the photos later.

371
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,870
Sorry, sorry.

372
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,510
Okay.

373
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,150
Brother Panda.

374
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,000
You must be tired too.

375
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,590
I'll buy you a bottle of water.

376
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,270
Wait here.

377
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,070
Hello?

378
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,990
Zhen Gaogui, where are you?

379
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,870
Director said he couldn't find you.

380
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,630
Their leader wants to take a photo with the doll.

381
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,230
You've just joined the company.

382
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,450
How can you be absent from work?

383
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,130
I'm sorry. I'll go back now.

384
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,040
I failed to impress them.

385
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,240
I feel so bad.

386
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,310
I feel really bad.

387
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,670
I also got a huge blow recently.

388
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,030
But it's okay.

389
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,630
Do every little task well

390
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,110
and you'll gain a sense of accomplishment.

391
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,310
You're right.

392
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,869
If life gives you a slap,

393
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,630
give it a five.

394
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,150
What are they doing here?

395
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,790
Take a look.

396
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,550
Let me see if there're any new jobs posted?

397
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,950
The Community Center is looking for yoga teachers.

398
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,800
But applicants are required to have three years of experience.

399
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,590
Yoga teacher?

400
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,870
This kind of part-time teachers

401
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,630
must earn a lot per month.

402
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,310
It's not a job that everybody can do.

403
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,590
Stop daydreaming.

404
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,340
This job is not for you.

405
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,870
It's late. I need to go back and cook.

406
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,720
Let's go home and cook.

407
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,730
It's time to go home and cook.

408
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
Hello, madam.

409
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,630
Are you here to sign up for the classes?

410
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,310
We haven't begun to offer the classes.

411
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,430
I'm here for a job interview.

412
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,510
Job interview?

413
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,150
Yes.

414
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,390
My name is Qin Fenfang.

415
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,790
I've been practicing yoga since I was 30.

416
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,910
It's been

417
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,890
over twenty years.

418
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,770
Madam, be careful.

419
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,060
Don't push yourself.

420
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,630
One-hand Tree Pose.

421
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,900
Koundinya Pose.

422
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,860
She's good.

423
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,790
Yes, these are very difficult poses.

424
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,060
Scorpion Pose.

425
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,150
Very professional.

426
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,390
Very good.

427
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,870
Really good.

428
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,630
So I've got hired?

429
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,670
These are all difficult poses.

430
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,020
But our students are all middle-aged people.

431
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,720
They don't need to learn those difficult poses.

432
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,030
Madam.

433
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,630
You don't look well.

434
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,790
Do you suffer insomnia?

435
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,910
Have you reached menopause?

436
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,110
By the way,

437
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,950
you're sometimes very bad-tempered, right?

438
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,310
Show me your tongue.

439
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,900
Show it to me.

440
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,310
Look, the coating on your tongue is thick.

441
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,070
I think

442
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,160
there is something wrong

443
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,950
with your intestines, stomach and spleen.

444
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,230
And you don't have much appetite, right?

445
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,110
You're right.

446
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,670
I've taken a lot of Chinese medicine.

447
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,150
Do you know how I can solve my problem?

448
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,870
Take yoga classes with me for two months

449
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,430
and you'll be all fine.

450
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,550
Fenfang.

451
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,260
Can you come to work tomorrow?

452
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,700
I'll come to work on time.

453
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,750
Thank you.

454
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,440
Ju Ran.

455
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,150
Gaogui.

456
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,870
If you feel you can't

457
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,870
do the dirty work anymore, just stop doing it.

458
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,910
It's not embarrassing.

459
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,470
I can do it.

460
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,710
As long as I don't give up,

461
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,760
I'll have chances sooner or later.

462
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,630
Good.

463
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,830
You're better than me.

464
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,590
Back then, I did all the dirty work for no longer than a week

465
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,910
and I almost came to Boss and told him

466
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,910
I really couldn't do the job.

467
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,870
Then you got a project later?

468
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,960
The project

469
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,030
is like love.

470
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,870
It will come to you eventually.

471
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,670
I want to do projects.

472
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,860
But I can't refuse

473
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,070
to do the dirty work.

474
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,230
If I don't do it, people will think I'm hard to get along with.

475
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,070
Right?

476
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,150
Yes.

477
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,550
Good luck.

478
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,670
Gaogui.

479
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,310
These are the documents for the client.

480
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,150
Please mail them for me.

481
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,150
I'm too busy.

482
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:58,860
Okay.

483
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,310
Gao.

484
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,070
Copy this document for me.

485
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,590
I need ten copies. Remember to bind them.

486
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,590
Okay.

487
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,830
Gaogui, the client in Building D wants this.

488
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,210
It's not far. Help me take it to him.

489
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,230
Okay.

490
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,110
Go downstairs and get me my coffee.

491
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,950
Thank you.

492
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,820
[Director Office]

493
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,030
Check it again.

494
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,540
Got it.

495
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,230
Boss.

496
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,630
Actually...

497
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,950
I want to say something to you.

498
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,200
Since Gaogui joined our company,

499
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,190
everyone has been lazy.

500
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,150
They ask Gaogui to do everything for them.

501
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,110
You okay with that?

502
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,070
Let me ask you.

503
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,350
Is making money something easy and comfortable?

504
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:47,870
No.

505
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,110
And

506
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,230
do you agree that doing more dirty work

507
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,590
is good for her development in the future?

508
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,190
Got it.

509
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,070
Okay.

510
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,590
Come in.

511
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,430
I'll go back to work.

512
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,920
Boss.

513
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,920
I have something to tell you.

514
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,430
What is it?

515
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,070
If you meet a problem in your work, solve it yourself.

516
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,760
That's for sure.

517
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,640
But actually, I want to tell you

518
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,910
that I found that there is a lot room for improvement

519
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,190
on the way we work at our company.

520
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,610
If we can make some improvement, we'll save time and money.

521
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,150
What improvement?

522
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,310
For example,

523
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,430
I've been taking parcels

524
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,150
and sending things for my colleagues recently.

525
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,150
Those who always receive the parcels

526
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,070
are some of our big clients.

527
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,350
So I put some boxes on the reception area

528
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,710
and labeled them.

529
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,860
In this way, if the things should be sent to the same person,

530
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,160
they can be sent together at one time.

531
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,870
Also,

532
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,040
there is often a paper jam in our printer.

533
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,730
I've found the reason.

534
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,030
It's because our pieces of paper are too thin.

535
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,830
Our paper and our printer are not matched.

536
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,430
So I contacted several new paper suppliers.

537
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,320
So Boss, you need to tell it to the staff in Administration Division.

538
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,230
And sometimes, the elevator is too crowded.

539
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,560
Many colleagues waste their time waiting for the elevator.

540
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,920
I talked to the property management staff about it.

541
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,640
I asked if they could lift out the restrictions when many people need to use the elevator.

542
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,010
They said they needed a formal letter

543
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,700
with a signature of the company's person in charge.

544
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,150
So Boss, please sign the letter.

545
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,640
Sure, no problem.

546
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,910
I'll talk to them.

547
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,430
Good.

548
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,630
You've improved a lot.

549
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,910
Thank you, Boss.

550
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,110
I'll keep working hard.

551
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,720
I'll go back to work.

552
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,250
Go ahead.

553
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,070
Yingxiong.

554
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,150
Tell us about your work plan for this week.

555
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,390
This week, I'll finish the monthly summary report

556
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,740
for my client

557
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,890
and I'll finish three designs.

558
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,150
And I need to keep in touch with an illustrator

559
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,870
to confirm when he will finish his work.

560
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,950
Okay.

561
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,630
I hope you can finish all your jobs on time.

562
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,110
Don't make the mistake you made last time.

563
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,140
Boss, it was an accident last time.

564
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,390
Okay.

565
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,470
Gaogui.

566
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,270
My plan for this week is...

567
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,950
I don't know.

568
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,790
Help me

569
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,780
collect the work reports of last quarter.

570
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,830
And bring me the data analysis reports

571
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,910
of several sectors.

572
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,630
Okay.

573
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,520
I'm not done yet.

574
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,330
I need to know every division's process of doing a project.

575
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,310
Write it in detail and Gaogui will collect all the documents of the process for me.

576
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,310
If Zhen Gaogui needs your help,

577
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,350
I hope you can cooperate.

578
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,430
Did I make myself clear?

579
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,330
Yes.

580
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,710
Did I make myself clear?

581
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,630
Yes.

582
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,470
Yes.

583
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,110
Gaogui, help me...

584
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,910
I'm sorry.

585
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,700
I'm really busy now.

586
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,110
If it's not urgent,

587
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,970
I can help you do it tomorrow.

588
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,350
It's urgent.

589
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,550
I'll do it myself.

590
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,420
Mom, I'm home.

591
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,670
You're back.

592
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,420
Let me tell you some good news.

593
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,350
What is it?

594
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,550
I've found a formal job.

595
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,150
Really?

596
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,590
Is it something about lining up and getting something again?

597
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,290
Although it is a part-time job,

598
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,950
I've officially become

599
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,110
a yoga teacher of the Senior Activity Center.

600
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,430
Great.

601
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,070
I have a fixed salary every month.

602
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,760
Mom, you're great.

603
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,350
The yoga classes you took finally pay off.

604
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,190
If we keep working hard,

605
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,550
we'll be able to pay off our debt sooner or later.

606
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,390
Pay off the debt?

607
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,430
The money we have is far from enough.

608
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,390
But next month,

609
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,580
we don't have to eat the lunchbox food every day.

610
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,150
What's wrong, Mom?

611
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,470
It tastes the same every day.

612
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,910
Let me tell you.

613
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,880
The moment I bought it,

614
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,740
I got full.

615
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,630
Me too.

616
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,550
Mom, wait for me.

617
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,220
What are you doing?

618
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,970
Let me show you a magic trick.

619
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,630
Don't spill it.

620
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,390
Okay.

621
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,190
Wait for me.

622
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,130
Do you need my help?

623
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:36,860
It's okay.

624
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,870
With these decorations you made,

625
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,830
I now want to eat more food.

626
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,070
Really?

627
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,030
Let's raise our glasses

628
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,580
and drink to your new job.

629
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,880
Okay.

630
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,550
-Who is it?
-Open the door!

631
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,620
Keep quiet.

632
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,710
It must be one of our creditors.

633
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,070
What should we do?

634
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,350
Pay back my money right now!

635
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,550
Open the door!

636
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,550
Qin Fenfang.

637
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,230
I saw you turn off the light.

638
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,150
Hiding inside is no use. Pay back my money.

639
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,030
Qin Fenfang.

640
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,070
If you don't pay me back today,

641
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,230
I'll come and make a scene every day.

642
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,590
Qin Fenfang, come out!

643
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,630
Shame on you! Are you a coward?

644
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,070
You think I don't know you're inside?

645
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,950
I saw you turn off the light?

646
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,810
Don't be a coward.

647
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,770
You shameless bastard!

648
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,520
How dare you not pay back my money?

649
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,590
Qin Fenfang, come out now!

650
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,470
Dude.

651
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,250
Are you here to collect the debt too?

652
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,310
The people inside

653
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,280
are shameless.

654
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,000
They owe me money and do not pay me back.

655
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,150
Qin Fenfang.

656
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,090
Show up!

657
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,070
I'll hang a banner here.

658
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,150
Pay back my money right now!

659
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,300
Shame on you!

660
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:50,730
[Pay back my money right now!]

661
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,950
Did he leave?

662
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,460
I think he left. It's quiet outside.

663
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,600
He was horrible.

664
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,630
Mom.

665
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,150
He is hanging a banner there.

666
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,180
No.

667
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,950
That's too much.

668
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,550
Where are you going? What are you doing?

669
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,550
Let me see who you are.

670
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,790
How dare you do this to us?

671
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,300
Who are you?

672
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,670
-Stop.
-Get down!

673
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,310
You got it wrong.

674
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,340
What did I get wrong? I just want to hit you.

675
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,430
Get down!

676
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,920
It's me. I'm Zhong Yiming.

677
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,530
Why are you here?

678
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,630
What are you doing up there?

679
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,870
I just want to take it down for you.

680
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,870
It's such a nuisance.

681
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,350
I'm sorry.

682
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,370
I'm sorry.

683
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,800
I mistook you as the creditor.

684
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,430
Mr. Zhong.

685
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,250
I don't know

686
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,800
why you're here.

687
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,790
You saw

688
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,100
what happened.

689
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,880
It's really inconvenient for me now.

690
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,940
You'd better go home first.

691
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,430
Okay.

692
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,430
Don't cry.

693
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,850
We are not hurt.

694
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,630
Seeing you crying

695
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,190
makes me feel bad.

696
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,230
It's all my fault.

697
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,300
It has nothing to do with you.

698
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,430
I shouldn't have studied abroad.

699
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,980
I wasted so much money.

700
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,470
If we had kept

701
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,680
my tuition fees and living allowances,

702
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:27,430
we wouldn't live a life like this.

703
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,500
I chose a stupid major.

704
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,630
No one likes me at the company.

705
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,390
When we pay off all our debts,

706
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,860
we must be very old.

707
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,470
Mom.

708
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,910
It's all my fault.

709
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,070
I failed to protect our family.

710
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,070
Don't say that, Mom.

711
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,870
I was just giving vent to my bad feelings.

712
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,630
I need to cheer myself up.

713
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,910
Tomorrow...

714
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,140
I'll keep working hard tomorrow.

715
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,550
I believe you are the best.

716
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,150
Don't cry, Mom.

717
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,160
Boss, everything is going well at the company.

718
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,950
The problem has been solved.

719
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,130
What do you want to report to me this time?

720
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,830
It's something else.

721
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,360
Mr. Zhong has been quite close

722
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,390
to a girl from Xinda PR recently.

723
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,400
My brother always does that.

724
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,060
It's only been a few days.

725
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,680
Can't he learn to be a good man?

726
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,310
Don't worry. He's not a bad guy.

727
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,670
We don't know much

728
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,870
about this young girl.

729
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,720
I don't know if it will have a bad influence on the company.

730
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,580
Ke'er, how about this?

731
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,990
Keep an eye on them.

732
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,530
One day,

733
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,710
if I think he'll never be qualified for the position,

734
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,860
I'll replace him with someone else.

735
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,880
Boss, don't worry.

736
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,910
I'll always help Mr. Zhong Jr.

737
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,390
This is the meeting arrangement for the next week.

738
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,430
Please check it when you're free.

739
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,710
Okay.

740
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,310
That dress has been there for days.

741
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,320
It's a dress of my friend's.

742
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,870
A girl you like?

743
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,920
Of course not.

744
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,640
I've been working here for only a few days.

745
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,630
My priority is to do my job well.

746
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,390
I need to learn more from you.

747
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,150
Besides questions about work,

748
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,390
you can also ask me

749
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,310
other questions.

750
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,490
I'll try to help you.

751
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,590
For example, you can ask me

752
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,390
about romantic relationship.

753
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,070
Thank you, Director Lu.

754
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,390
You're an excellent worker.

755
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,670
But in terms of having a romantic relationship,

756
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,110
I think I'm much more

757
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,430
experienced than you.

758
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,910
Director Lu.

759
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,150
Our companies are close together.

760
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,360
If you need anything, you can just ask me to go to your office.

761
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,830
I passed by.

762
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,030
I want to say that your proposal

763
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,670
last time was quite impressive.

764
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,000
Let's keep in touch.

765
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,910
Maybe we can collaborate next time.

766
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,910
So you mean

767
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,020
you've got a new project for us?

768
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,110
No.

769
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,980
This is...

770
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,120
Dinner invitation.

771
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,030
Tonight?

772
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,429
Xinda didn't win the bid last time.

773
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,850
But we appreciate your hard work.

774
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,949
Mr. Zhong has been feeling sorry for you.

775
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,130
He wants to treat you to dinner and thank you.

776
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,610
Why didn't Mr. Zhong tell me directly?

777
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,860
He has my number.

778
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:28,310
Mr. Zhong seems outgoing.

779
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,469
But sometimes he's shy.

780
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,070
How about you two meet and talk to each other?

781
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,750
Bye.

782
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,810
Director Lu...

783
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,639
He's shy?

784
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,230
Help!

785
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,270
I've already got so much work to do.

786
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,620
Please get off work on time and have dinner with someone special after work today.

787
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,750
Ask someone else to do that in the future.

788
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,790
I have no appetite

789
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,790
and I don't drink.

790
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,760
Zhen Gaogui wants to treat you to dinner.

791
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,430
Why didn't she call me?

792
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,270
Girls

793
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,640
are all shy.

794
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,670
You know.

795
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,630
Are you implying something?

796
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,630
This is an ordinary dinner, okay?

797
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,990
I need some time to consider it.

798
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,590
Okay.

799
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,790
Wait.

800
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,430
I've finished reading them. Take them away.
