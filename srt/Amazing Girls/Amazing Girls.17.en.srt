I learned it from you.

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,710
What did you learn from me?

384
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,990
Say one thing and act another.

385
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,150
I'm not that kind of person.

386
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,990
You've been acting weird lately.

you are hiding something from me.

389

It takes a step further to say "together".

Gaogui.

757
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,550
Thank you.

758
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,790
for getting me a little bonus.

759
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,949
I'll treat you to barbecue after work tomorrow.

760
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,030
I should be thanking you.

761
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,070
You became a regular employee in advance,

762
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,440
so, I can get the bonus in advance. That's all that matters.

763
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,590
All I want now is wealth,

764
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,030
not a thread of any true love.

765
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,790
Here comes the work.

766
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,910
The Snacks Expo is about to start.

767
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,510
The booth for Meton is arranged to

768
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,150
a very indistinct corner.

769
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,260
It's also next to the bathroom.

770
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,630
Who can stand that?

771
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,830
The marketing department wants to change it.

772
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,210
[International Snacks Expo Promoting materials]

773
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,710
One display board.

774
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,510
Three roll-up banners.

775
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,630
Five posters.

776
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,070
Three boxes of pamphlets.

777
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,360
One box of materials.

778
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,710
You scared me.

779
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,150
Why are you here?

780
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,880
The warehouse belongs to my company.

781
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,790
Do I need a reason to be here?

782
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,350
You're checking the inventory?

783
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
[Meton Snacks Expo Material Inventory]

784
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,630
The Snacks Expo is coming.

785
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,670
I must send these packages in advance.

786
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,190
Have you confirmed the location of the booth?

787
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,510
Not yet.

788
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,870
We're still communicating on it.

789
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,430
You're here

790
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,350
just to talk about this?

791
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,190
Not really.

792
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,190
I just came to have a look.

793
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,150
Many problems occurred in the warehouse recently.

794
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,990
I came to check around.

795
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,070
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

796
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,150
Goodbye.

797
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,750
I don't hear from you again.

798
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,830
Recently, I feel like men are so complicated

799
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:24,790
I don't understand them.

800
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,100
So,

801
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,710
do you have any concern?

802
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,070
Let me ask you.

803
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,910
Do all the boys know

804
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,550
how to play hard-to-get?

805
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,230
I don't really know about that.

806
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,070
I've been busy lately. Let's talk another day.
