00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,510
The data in the new media has been increasing.

192
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,150
We'll update the data

193
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,750
every hour on the hour.

194
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,510
Send it after you finish your work.

195
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,390
Ju Ran, let me order a takeout for you.

196
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,510
You haven't eaten for a whole day.

197
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,020
No need.

198
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,190
It's urgent. I really don't have time.

199
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,390
Thank you, Ju Ran.

200
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,310
You have to deal with such urgent negative news.

201
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,510
It's my job.

202
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,630
I'll contact some media

203
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,070
and tell them

204
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,030
not to send out news

205
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,270
without verification.

206
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,630
I heard the negative news about Meton is serious,

207
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,630
can you handle it?

208
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,630
This topic on the Internet has become very serious.

209
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,630
We can only check it as soon as possible.

210
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,110
Have you contacted the media?

211
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,150
Yes.

212
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,870
But people online

213
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,030
are too sensitive to things like plagiarism.

214
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,910
So we can only dilute it and do some positive topics guidances.

215
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,630
Go to Meton.

216
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,750
We need to ask for their opinions on these things.

217
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,030
Don't do it on your own.

218
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,150
I'll be right there.

219
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,910
See?

220
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,390
Keep an eye on the feedback from e-commerce.

221
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,230
How is it, Ding Lonlong?

222
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,640
The e-commerce said half of the popcorn orders

223
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,870
have been cancelled.

224
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,110
If it continues,

225
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,750
the situation will be worse.

226
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,630
At this time,

227
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,350
the factory increased the shipments.

228
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,590
The cost will go up at once.

229
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:22,670
[Meton Food]

230
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,510
I've received

231
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,510
the public opinion report from Xinda PR.

232
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,390
When they come,

233
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,110
we'll discuss how to deal with it.

234
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,030
We're in a critical situation.

235
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,270
We should make a statement

236
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,120
to suspend our cooperation with Dooro Bear.

237
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,390
Brother, our relationship with Mr. Lin...

238
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,510
It's not about what we think.

239
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,150
It's about what the public thinks.

240
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,630
When we find out the truth,

241
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,870
and have an explanation,

242
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,150
it's not too late.

243
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,150
It's better than both companies going down together,

244
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,270
understand?

245
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,150
Our cooperation with the Dooro Bear

246
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,390
is only temporarily suspended.

247
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,150
What we need to do now

248
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,550
is to find out the truth

249
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,870
and give an explanation to the people online.

250
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,990
Since we're sure it's not plagiarism,

251
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,230
the problem must be with the designer.

252
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,990
Do you trust Lin Yue so much?

253
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,150
I've checked it.

254
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,270
Lin Yue and the designer

255
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,030
designed this poster together.

256
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,630
Every detail is original.

257
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,030
I can guarantee that.

258
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,740
In that case,

259
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,150
we should be on the same team.

260
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,270
There must be someone behind this.

261
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,550
Let's discuss the countermeasures with Lin Yue.

262
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,630
Good.

263
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,500
Stay calm.

264
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,870
I believe you two

265
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,630
will solve the problem soon.

266
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,030
Okay, we'll go then.

267
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,630
Well,

268
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,150
are you two together?

269
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,390
Brother, actually...

270
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,390
Mr. Zhong,

271
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,150
it's personal.

272
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,750
Don't be shy.

273
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,630
Let me tell you.

274
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,790
I've heard a lot

275
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,790
about you two.

276
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,990
I'm your brother.

277
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,630
Why are you hiding it from me?

278
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,630
Zhen, have some tea.

279
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,750
Let me tell you.

280
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,270
I met my wife

281
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,150
at work.

282
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,510
We've come this far.

283
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,750
So,

284
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,390
I think you two can do it.

285
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,030
I think we can

286
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,790
have more family parties in the future

287
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,470
Brother.

288
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,870
to have more communication.

289
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,790
That's going too far. We're leaving.

290
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,750
It's good to be happy.

291
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,510
Drink the tea. It's for you.

292
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,390
Bye, brother.

293
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,630
I don't want to keep it secret from our colleagues.

294
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,510
Why do you keep avoiding this question?

295
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,030
I don't want to be a burden on you.

296
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,910
Why?

297
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,390
Our relationship is real.

298
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,150
I don't want to keep it a secret all the time.

299
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,630
We're in this situation now.

300
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,150
You're still thinking about this.

301
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,790
How about this?

302
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,030
I'll promise you

303
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,780
after it's done.

304
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,510
Really?

305
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,910
I wish I could solve it today.

306
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,110
I hope what you said can come true immediately.

307
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,550
That's what it is.

308
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,390
You can understand

309
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,630
Meton's decision, right?

310
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,910
I know it's hard for you.

311
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,020
Even if you don't say it,

312
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,150
I will say.

313
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,660
We can't drag you down

314
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,350
with the poster thing.

315
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,750
I heard that there were quite a lot of refunds.

316
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,630
That's the right decision for business.

317
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,750
But I'm really worried about you.

318
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,030
I heard that people online

319
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,030
have been attacking your cartoon platform, right?

320
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,750
Everyone is talking about plagiarism.

321
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,030
I didn't do it.

322
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,020
Even if they said so,

323
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,390
I'll figure out a way to clear it all up.

324
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,670
I'm afraid no one will listen to you

325
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,630
when you want to clear it all up.

326
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,150
People nowadays are very interested in

327
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,270
the highly discussed part of the news in the beginning.

328
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,790
Who cares about the following parts?

329
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,550
My colleagues said

330
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,750
we've contacted the designer.

331
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,030
That's great. Let's ask him what he's up to.

332
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,870
No debts without creditors,
no hatred without cause.

333
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,630
I want to see

334
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,150
why they did this.

335
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,270
It's all because of them.

336
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,030
Otherwise, I wouldn't have become a sucker.

337
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,790
When the designer was designing the poster,

338
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,270
I was next to him.

339
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,870
I saw him designing.

340
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,510
How could it be a plagiarism?

341
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,230
Let's meet him together.

342
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,910
No need.

343
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,390
Let me see him first.

344
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,000
We don't even know him.

345
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,390
So he did this so suddenly

346
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,670
for the fame or the profit.

347
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,790
I really want to know

348
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,510
why he framed us.

349
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,150
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

350
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,550
What's so dangerous about that?

351
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,240
As the person in charge of this cooperation,

352
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,270
I should do it.

353
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,550
Besides,

354
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,390
if you two bosses meet him,

355
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,350
he will ask for more.

356
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,470
Think from another perspective.

357
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,550
You are not the only client in our company.

358
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,630
If I can't handle this well,

359
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,910
how will other clients think of us?

360
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,510
Right?

361
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,150
That makes sense.

362
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,740
But as your boyfriend,

363
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,670
I can't throw you under the bus.

364
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,270
Don't worry. There's nothing to worry about.

365
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,030
You have a lot of work to do in the company.

366
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,030
You go back first.

367
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,150
Hello.

368
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,270
I'm Zhen Gaogui, the PR of Meton Food.

369
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,510
You said the Meton Food

370
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,670
and Dooro Bear

371
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,910
have plagiarized your work.

372
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,270
Do you have any evidence?

373
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,910
I have posted

374
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,910
the evidence

375
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,110
on the Internet.

376
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,550
Did you do your research?

377
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,390
I designed a set of posters last year.

378
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,630
You can check the time of the post on the Internet.

379
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,510
Isn't it obvious?

380
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,270
Is it?

381
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,240
What is your request?

382
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,630
You copied my work.

383
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,740
You must compensate me.

384
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,380
Otherwise, it'll be unreasonable.

385
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,150
Then why didn't you

386
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,510
file a claim through legal channels?

387
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,550
As far as I know,

388
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,870
we haven't received any subpoenas.

389
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,350
Law?

390
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,670
I don't want to go through legal channels.

391
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,230
That's weird.

392
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,830
How do you want to solve it?

393
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:17,990
Fine.

394
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,390
You have been reporting us online for plagiarism.

395
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,390
Now I'm here to solve it.

396
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,990
You're not willing to

397
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,910
file a claim through legal channels.

398
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,870
Do I have a reason to doubt

399
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,630
the credibility of your evidence?

400
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,390
Well...

401
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,630
I-It's too troublesome to go through legal channels.

402
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,790
I just want to solve this online.

403
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,390
Check the Internet.

404
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,270
Now the people online

405
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,510
are all supporting me.

406
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,630
You should pay me as soon as possible.

407
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,390
Also,

408
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,270
you must make a public apology.

409
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,990
Can your evidence

410
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,230
stand up to scrutiny?

411
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,630
No, I...

412
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,150
I think

413
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,910
you are not sincere.

414
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,000
You've been talking about

415
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,630
the evidence all the time.

416
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,020
You just need to apologize and pay me for it.

417
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,350
You'd better ask someone else to meet me.

418
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,990
What a waste of my time.

419
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,630
Unbelievable. What's the matter with you?

420
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,780
How could the posters be uploaded last year?

421
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,870
We're so compatible with the stranger

422
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,380
that even our creativity is the same.

423
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,030
This is so strange.

424
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,150
There's a master in our IT department.

425
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,470
He suspected that
there was something wrong with the website

426
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,350
that the designer uploaded the poster.

427
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,510
Our cartoon website is famous for its original works.

428
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,870
Plagiarizing others?

429
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,030
It's embarrassing to tell others about this.

430
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,500
Don't worry.

431
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,270
Let's wait for news from Zhen Gaogui.

432
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,510
Come in.

433
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,750
Mr. Zhong, we found the evidence.

434
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,750
Take a look.

435
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,470
There's a bug in the  backstage of the website.

436
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,270
He can modify the information secretly.

437
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,270
The real date of posting the poster

438
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,510
is after our poster has been posted.

439
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,790
This technology is really simple.

440
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,310
People who know some technologies can do it.

441
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,829
This is obviously a scam.

442
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,510
Wait.

443
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,030
They usually set up scams to blackmail
famous people and influencers.

444
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,589
Why did he do this to us?

445
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,190
The public opinion online is losing control.

446
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,270
Even if we take the technology

447
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,000
used on the website as an explanation

448
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,480
to prove that we didn't plagiarize him.

449
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,950
I'm afraid there will only be a bigger backlash.

450
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,230
They will say we bully the weak.

451
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,270
It's just a small matter.

452
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,470
Why are there so many

453
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,110
influencers focusing on this?

454
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,270
Is Meton so influential?

455
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,030
I asked the platform.

456
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,030
They said the click farm is involved.

457
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,950
The competitors are likely to
take advantage of the situation.

458
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,960
Isn't this a normal operation?

459
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,310
Then we don't know who our opponent is,

460
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,830
so we can't find the one behind all this.

461
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,910
Since we can't explain it,

462
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,990
the one who started it should be the one who ends it.

463
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,340
I'll ask the designer

464
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,510
to clarify it in person.

465
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,190
So that we can solve this completely.

466
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,110
Don't worry.

467
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,310
Let's discuss it.

468
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,830
Brother,

469
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,750
I didn't treat you well these days

470
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,310
and asked you to eat takeout with me.

471
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,670
Speaking of which,

472
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,430
you've done so much work for me.

473
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,310
I should be the one to treat you.

474
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,110
To be honest,

475
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,550
I haven't been so busy for a long time.

476
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,510
I'm so busy that I can't even take a break.

477
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,510
It's quite fulfilling.

478
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,310
You are keeping your relationship a secret?

479
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,750
For now.

480
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,830
She's afraid that her colleagues will say

481
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,910
that she gets clients because of your relationship.

482
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,110
You know what?

483
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,680
I can't hide anything from you.

484
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,790
Actually,

485
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,310
I've been in contact with her

486
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,310
recently.

487
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,470
Although I don't know much about her,

488
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,540
I have a good impression of her.

489
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,430
She's very reliable.

490
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,440
And she's good at this job.

491
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,910
You two can be in charge of
the company together in the future.

492
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,470
I think it's good

493
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,510
if she helps you.

494
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,110
Brother, what are you thinking about?

495
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,750
She has her dream career.

496
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,830
Isn't it too selfish to ask her

497
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,950
to work at Meton for the rest of her life?

498
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,430
As you said,

499
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,310
this girl is quite intelligent.

500
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,350
She won't give up her career because of you.

501
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,750
That makes me more relieved.

502
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,580
To be honest,

503
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,990
I'm really lucky

504

you mentioned.

Where did you get the confidence?

514
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,030
Why should I explain it to you?

515
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,910

that you don't understand.

you were plagiarizing my work.

00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,680
Miss Li, don't go.

562
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,510
L-Let's talk about it.

563
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,070
Miss Li. Miss Li.

564
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,470
Don't go, Miss Li.

565
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,030
Miss Li.

566
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,270
You have to save me.

567
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,990
I told you before, but you didn't listen.

568
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,950
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

569
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,910
You deliberately framed others

570
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,440
and got caught.

571
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,750
I thought I wouldn't leave any evidence

572
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,000
and could run away.

573
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,830
So I made a false testimony

574
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,430
just for a little money.

575
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,110
Then I checked the law.

576
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,110
My goodness.

577
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,430
I will be sentenced severely.

578
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,270
No matter what you do,

579
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,110
everything leaves a trail nowadays.

580
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,260
It has already constituted the crime of defamation

581
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,950
under Article 246 of the Criminal Law.

582
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,270
You're committing a crime, you know?

583
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,710
You're scaring me.

584
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,750
Get a new lawyer then.

585
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,030
I can't help you.

586
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,670
Miss Li, don't go.

587
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,270
Miss Li.

588
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,310
We're from the same hometown.

589
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,270
Miss Li.

590
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,590
What solution did you just say?

591
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,750
Tell me in detail.

592
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,550
Forget it.

593
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,910
I'll see you in court.

594
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,750
No. No. No.

595
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,070
I

596
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,430
don't want to make a big deal out of it.

597
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,070
We should discuss

598
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,590
how to solve this matter.

599
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,740
It's better to discuss it.

600
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,020
Tell me.

601
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,910
Did you do this on your own

602
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,270
or did someone order you?

603
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,030
No one ordered me.

604
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,230
I did it myself.

605
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,190
No, no.

606
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,510
Someone ordered me to do it.

607
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,710
Tell me. Who is it?

608
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,950
Here's the thing.

609
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,470
The posting time on the website

610
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,310
was modified by technicians.

611
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,080
But I didn't want to do it.

612
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,030
Someone told me to.

613
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,590
Also,

614
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,310
he ordered me to

615
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,310
post the comments online.

616
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,310
I didn't do it willingly.

617
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,030
Then why did he ask you to do that?

618
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,950
I don't know.

619
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,270
B-But he said

620
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,070
if I did that,

621
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,230
I'd make a lot of money.

622
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,270
It's none of my business.

623
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,230
No, it's also my fault.

624
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,830
B-But I'm not the mastermind.

625
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,670
That person is the mastermind.

626
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,950
I'm actually a victim.

627
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,350
He lied to me. I mean it.

628
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,750
Unfortunately,

629
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,710
if you can't find him,

630
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,590
you'll have to take full responsibility.

631
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,590
No, no, no.

632
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,510
If I can't find him,

633
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,430
what will happen?

634
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,110
I just said it.

635
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,310
See you in court.

636
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,670
I-If I find him,

637
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,230
can you not sue me?

638
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,190
You can ask him out?

639
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,070
I...

640
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,750
Yes.

641
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,500
[Sengyi International Hotel]

642
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,590
Why did you choose this place?

643
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,030
We know here well.

644
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,190
And I’ve told the hotel’s security.

645
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,430
If he slips away,

646
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,790
the security will help us catch him.

647
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,950
You're so thoughtful.

648
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,270
Let me see if your method works.

649
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,950
Hello. Welcome.

650
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,310
He's here.

651
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,910
Are you the one?

652
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,430
Yes.

653
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,790
Why did you call me here in such a hurry?

654
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,430
Let's go.

655
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,950
Wait a minute.

656
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,340
Wait a minute.

657
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,710
Wait.

658
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,510
I-It's him!

659
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,430
He ordered me to do this.

660
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,070
You should ask him to explain it.

661
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,950
Don't talk nonsense.

662
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,470
It's not up to you
whether he's talking nonsense.

663
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,750
Your best choice now

664
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,790
is to tell the whole story.

665
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,590
We may consider leniency.

666
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,910
I'll tell you.

667
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,990
I'll tell you everything.

668
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,830
H-He gave me the money

669
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,990
and asked me to say you plagiarized.

670
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,910
I-I was short of money to get married.

671
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,750
It's none of my business.

672
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,110
I-It was all his idea.

673
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,430
It has nothing to do...

674
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,110
H-How dare you hit me?

675
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,830
Mr. Sun,

676
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,310
you did it on purpose,

677
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,270
right?

678
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,510
I can't accept it.

679
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,750
I've been working hard
in Meton for over 20 years,

680
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,790
and ended up quitting.

681
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,750
If you did such a thing,

682
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,910
it means you've never

683
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,350
cared about Meton.

684
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,110
You only care about your own interests.

685
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,910
Zhen Gaogui.

686
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,910
Let me tell you.

687
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,990
Other companies just take the opportunity.

688
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,950
You

689
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,550
deserve the consequences.

690
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,750
What does it have to do with me?

691
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,510
Fine.

692
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,510
Since you said so, I know it now.

693
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,350
Leave.

694
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,030
Let him go.

695
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,270
You should go too.

696
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,430
Thank you. Thank you.

697
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,750
Hey, you.

698
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,430
Wait. Wait.

699
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,440
Well...

700
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,960
I didn't expect

701
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,790
him to be such a person now.

702
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,750
Time has a terrible power.

703
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,950
You'll think you've known someone for a long time

704
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,670
but actually you have never known him.

705
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,750
At that time,

706
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,430
I didn't tell him anything.

707
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,790
I didn't know what to say.

708
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,990
Let the legal department directly contact him.

709
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,310
He tore the last fig leaf.

710
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,030
We don't have to show any mercy.

711
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,270
In this case,

712
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,030
we have to sue him.

713
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,310
The problem is solved.

714
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,790
Let the PR company make an announcement later.

715
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,030
Since you're still here,

716
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,030
let’s gather with
those employees from Xinda PR.

717
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,740
We've been really busy lately.

718
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,790
Okay.

719
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,270
Cheers.

720
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,110
Everyone.

721
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,230
This is the first time I've seen you all.

722
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,510
I'm so happy

723
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,790
that we can gather together

724
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,240
to overcome the dilemma

725
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,750
and difficulty.

726
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,190
It's a rare opportunity.

727
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,990
Meanwhile, I hope

728
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,750
we can continue to trust

729
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,230
and support each other in the future.

730
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,470
It was hard.

731
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,750
This time, we've solved the crisis.

732
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,270
You guys from Xinda PR

733
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,020
took a lot of effort

734
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,030
and hard work.

735
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,470
Here, I want to thank you all.

736
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,910
Especially Zhen Gaogui from Xinda PR.

737
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,830
You're welcome, Mr. Zhong and Mr. Zhong Jr..

738
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,670
We should thank you.

739
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,950
Our boss, Director Zhang Feiyang,

740
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,100
has a special meeting today,

741
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,230
so he couldn't come.

742
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,510
He has a message for you.

743
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,110
He said that he wanted to thank Meton Food

744
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,510
for giving us the chance

745
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,070
to grow and improve.

746
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,110
And we also have a good case

747
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,590
to show off to other clients in the future.

748
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,820
Right.

749
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,350
Since we are so happy today,

750
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,950
I'd like to officially introduce

751
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,440
my girlfriend.

752
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,590
Zhen Gaogui.

753
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,510
See? I knew it.

754
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,270
See? I told you.

755
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,750
I knew it.

756
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,790
Since you told all of us,

757
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,030
I have to say that you two were hiding too well.

758
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,230
Yeah.

759
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,950
B-But,

760
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,190
we still have a healthy partnership

761
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,020
in the office.

762
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,590
I hope you guys

763
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,310
don't pay too much attention to our relationship.

764
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,110
So that it won't affect the work.

765
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,670
Got it. Got it.

766
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,070
We are so sensible.

767
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,990
B-But

768
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,030
I was too happy

769
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,910
so I wanted to

770
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,310
share it with you.

771
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,510
Right, Gaogui?

772
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,030
Since you're so happy,

773
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,510
let's have a toast.

774
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,030
Come on.

775
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,750
Congratulations.

776
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,110
Cheers.

777
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,510
Gaogui, I'm really happy for you.

778
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,670
You must be happy with Mr. Zhong.

779
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,270
Shouldn't you

780
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,990
be happy for us?

781
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,670
You?

782
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,270
Since everyone is so happy today,

783
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,270
let me announce something nice.

784
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,230
Ju Ran and I

785
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,230
are also in love.

786
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,710
That's right.

787
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,510
I knew something happened between you two.

788
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,070
So soon?

789
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,070
Let's toast to all of you.

790
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,110
Brother,

791
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,440
it's such a big day today.

792
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,590
Do you need to do something?

793
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,910
I understand what you mean.

794
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,830
Today,

795
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,430
Mr. Zhong invited you for dinner,

796
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,030
and I'll pay for it.

797
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,230
Nice!

798
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,430
Here.

799
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,680
Since we're so happy,

800
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,820
let's have another toast.

801
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,670
We're really confident

802
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,270
to visit your dad this time.

803
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,440
Of course.

804
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,910
We can brag to dad.

805
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,830
My mom is a teacher now.

806
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,470
Your fans call themselves Fenfang Girls.

807
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,950
Now you have lots of students.

808
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,750
Have you booked the flowers?

809
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,790
Yes. I'll get it later when we go out.

810
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,780
Your dad loved lilies.

811
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,910
When we come back,

812
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,550
edit the video for me if you're free.

813
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,670
No problem.

814
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,500
I don't have to work this weekend.

815
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,670
I'll make it a good video.

816
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,110
Did you tell Zhong

817
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,300
about coming to visit your dad's grave today?

818
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,270
No.

819
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,030
Why didn't you tell him

820
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,470
about such an important thing?

821
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,230
If I had told him, he would definitely have come.

822
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,950
There have been so many things in the company lately.

823
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,110
I want him to have a good rest.

824
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:02,590
[The Tomb of My Beloved Husband Zhen Baishu]

825
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,670
I didn't expect

826
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,030
you to be mature.

827
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,510
Now you care about others.

828
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,950
Is that Zhong?

829
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,110
It seems so.
