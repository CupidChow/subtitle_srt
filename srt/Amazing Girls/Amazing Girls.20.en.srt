00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,550
Why are you here?

3
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,550
Didn't you two quarrel?

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,630
Mr. Zhong, you're here too.

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,110
Well, I thought there might be something between you two,

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,590
so I followed to check.

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,630
There wasn't anything that happened

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,910
between us.

00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,670
Mr. Zhong, you're quite nosey.

Wait. Lin Yue

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,470
called Zhen Gaogui to come over in the middle of the night.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,630
I thought there must be something extremely urgent.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,630
It's nothing.

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,390
Oh, well. Wait.

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,230

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,110
I'm Zhen Gaogui

He was at my place.

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,590
How fast is your relationship developing!

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,230
Thank you.

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,600
Well. Please enjoy.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,629
I hope I didn't disturb you two.

23
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,910
Not at all.

24
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,590
Speaking of which,

25
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,670
what's the situation with you two?

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,550
We just broke up,

27
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
but then I thought about it again.

28
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,670
Breaking up won't solve our problems.

29
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,390
Arguing will only waste our precious time.

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,990
Instead of that, I could apply a face mask,

31
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,190
do some yoga,

32
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,030
or even work overtime.

33
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,470
Being in a relationship is like a job.

34
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,830
It requires compromise.

35
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,110
If our relationship has to be open,

36
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,830
I will adapt to this change.

37
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,030
So we've made up again.

38
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:36,750
So

39
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,830
it's nothing to do with us.

40
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,270
Since we're here,

41

43
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,390
Yes.

44
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,550
We can not solve problems

45
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,670
by arguing.

46
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,750
City folks, especially couples, should argue less

47
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,390
and focus on making money when they can.

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,759
Once you get a bit older,

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,910
you'll realize that

50
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,270
deep sleep is much more meaningful than arguing.

51
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,910
Wait, why did you tell us this?

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm going to the restroom.

53
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,670
Is the restroom over there?

54
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,270
The restroom is over there.

55
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,829
Over there?

56
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,150
You said you were going to the bathroom,

57
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,960
and I waited for you for long time. I was worried something would happen to you.

58
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,550
I'm fine,

59
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,670
just suddenly feel sleepy.

60
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,790
So I'm going home to sleep.

61
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,270
Let me take you home.

62
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,230
No need.

63
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,950

the problems between us.

67
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,990
It's possible I'm overthinking,

68
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,510
but I don't feel like I've done anything wrong,

69
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,270
nor do I want you to feel that way.

70
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,270
I think what Director Lu said was right.

71

Nonsense.

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,350

eat something

No, I don't want to.

It's a blind date,

she can't explain it to the sponsor.

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,390

It's "The Shawshank Redemption."

381
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,750
I was able to secure the new project this time

382
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,710
with a lot of assistance

383
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,830
from Li Yingxiong.

384
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,430
I can't take all the credit alone,

385
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,349
which I have learnt from Zhen Gaogui.

386
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,430
When someone helps you,

387
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,510
you should learn to be grateful.

388
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,869
This time, I helped Zhen Gaogui

389
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,630
with the Meton Food project,

390
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,470
and Zhen Gaogui really touched me.

391
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,270
I used to think I was experienced

392
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,230
and could do everything.

393
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,710
But now I realized

394
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,750
that I should stay humble.

395
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,910
Otherwise, I might be replaced

396

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,670
you are our role model.

399
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,220
We should all learn from you.

00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,190
Let's go to that trendy shop you mentioned before

401
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,710
to take some photos tomorrow.

Okay!

What do you want to talk about?

405
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,710
There was something wrong between you and Ju Ran lately.

406
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,670
Didn't she always ignore you?

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,030

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,750
my client called me at 2 a.m.

415
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,950
and asked me to present the proposal

418
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,510
why do you always take Gaogui on business trips?

419
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,070
Are you biased?

420
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,430
I also want to get the travel allowance.

421
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,030
Do you really want the travel allowance?

422
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,780
Only 80 yuan a day.

423
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,030
Can it help you buy a house?

424
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,440
Well, not really.

425
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,230

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,430
But cooperation

564
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,710
is a two-way street.

565
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,470
You can't just make demands

566
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,990
without considering our situation.

567
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,190
I understand.

568
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,190
I'll follow your proposal.

569
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,310
I won't change it.

570
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,230
The budget will be ensured.

571
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,680
Come. Let's continue our discussion.

572
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,550
It's quite interesting.

573
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,200
I didn't expect Mrs. Chen to

574
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,430
yield to force but reject soft approaches.

575
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,470
I just guessed.

576
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,430
Mr. Zhong Jr.

577
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,790
With the current pressure on new product sales

578
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,430
and the high cost of cooperating with Dooro Bear,

579
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,990
do we have a fallback strategy?

580
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,990
I've checked last month's department

581
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,030
cost report,

582
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,550
and it stressed me out.

583
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,790
I believe in Mr. Zhong.

584
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,430
Fine.

585
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,790
Even if you believe,

586
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,950
it's not wise to stick to a single strategy blindly.

587
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,230
I've reached out,

588
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,310
but some things

589
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,870
need to be confirmed closer to the end.

590
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,480
Are you Ju Ran?

591
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,860
Where is Zhen Gaogui?

592
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,070
Sorry.

593
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,230
Zhen Gaogui is on a business trip

594
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,720
with our director,

595
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,070
So I came here

596
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,870
for today's meeting.

597
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,790
I will synchronize the information with her later.

598
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,310
Okay.

599
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,870
Cheers.

600
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:05,790
Boss.

601
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,710
I can tell

602
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,230
that as you're the director,

603
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,990
it's not advisable to directly confront the client.

604
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,710
Next time you encounter such a situation,

605
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,430
just shift the blame to me.

606
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,870
Let the client vent their frustrations on me to calm down.

607
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,030
Great.

608
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,060
You've only been working for a short time,

609
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,310
but you're thinking ahead of me.

610
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,550
Offending people is something I should handle.

611
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,310
If it strains relations,

612
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,070
you can take other people next time.

613
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,870
After all, as the saying goes,

614
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,230
the director is the backbone, and the executor is like flowing water.

615
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,470
But I don't want you to do that.

616
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,790
Boss.

617
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,510
You didn't have to do that.

618
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,510
After all, you are our Boss.

619
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,790
Sometimes,

620
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,470
you need us to protect you.

621
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,070
Let's eat.

622
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,310
Hello, brother.

623
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,510
How's everything going on your end?

624
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,990
Your sister-in-law's recovery is going well,

625
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,470
so I have time

626
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,230
to check on your work progress.

627
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,740
The progress with the company's new products are going smoothly.

628
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,310
Really?

629
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,710
I've been receiving quite a few calls these days.

630
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,870
The channel agents we cooperated with before

631
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,950
all came to ask me

632
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,270
why you didn't continue to cooperate with them

633
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,950
on the new products.

634
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,990
They also mentioned that you're hard to reach

635
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,790
and insisted on meeting me to discuss.

636
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,310
The feedback I got from various sources

637
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,720
was casting doubts on you.

638
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,790
How do you explain this?

639
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,470
We are businessmen,

640
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,550
and the first thing is to ensure our own survival.

641
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,230
If the previous sales channels are not profitable,

642
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,710
I definitely have to deal with them.

643
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,260
Whether those relationships are maintained or not is not important.

644
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,710
We are not a charity.

645
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,190
Not only did I change channel partners,

646
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,950
but I also made new adjustments within the company.

647
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,030
Boss,

648
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,070
you’re really in a leisurely mood

649
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,670
to take a walk.

650
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,190
Aren't you tired

651
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,230
after revising the slide all night?

652
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,670
Gaogui.

653
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,390
I asked you to come out today

654
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,190
because I have something want to tell you.

655
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,710
If I

656
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,390
don't say these words today,

657
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,160
I won't be able to sleep tonight when I go back.

658
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,390
Why the sudden seriousness?

659
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,990
Go ahead, Boss.

660
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,230
Actually, you can see that

661
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,990
I like to

662
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,990
make a presence in the company.

663
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,510
But in private,

664
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,670
I'm not good at expressing myself.

665
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,550
That's so true.

666
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,510
I remembered that when I interviewed,

667
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,060
you didn't hold back saying tough words.

668
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,510
I didn't see through you as well at that time?

669
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,990
Same as me,

670
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,230
you kept things hidden.

671
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,910
It mainly because Boss led well.

672
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,670
Otherwise, I wouldn't be where I am today.

673
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,750
Gaogui.

674
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,190
The affection I have for you

675
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,470
is different from what it was in the past.

676
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,190
I like you.

677
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,150
I just wanted to say these words

678
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,670
and express my feelings to you.

679
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,990
Boss, I...

680
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,990
It doesn't matter.

681
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,190
Don't rush to give me an answer.

682
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,710
I just wanted to express what was on my mind

683
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,870
so that I wouldn't have any regrets.

684
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,310
If possible,

685
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,990
please take some time to think about it.

686
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,020
I'm sorry.

687
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,270
There's no need to apologize.

688
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,710
Way ahead of you.

689
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,710
I have already guessed the result.

690
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,270
We are all like that.

691
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,750
You don't necessarily have to agree

692
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,190
when someone makes a request to you.

693
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,790
I just wanted to express

694
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,630
my feelings towards you.

695
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,630
Actually,

696
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,230
I've always considered you my

697
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,870
best leader,

698
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,270
and the best boss.

699
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,030
In the company,

700
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,060
you've always been helpful

701
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,030
and caring for me.

702
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,910
I'm truly grateful.

703
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,790
I think it would be nice for us to be friends.

704
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,230
Don't be so nervous.

705
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,670
I've said everything I wanted to say,

706
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,190
at least I have no regrets.

707
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,990
What about you?

708
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,390
Are you still waiting for him?

709
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,990
As an observer,

710
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,190
I can feel

711
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,310
your disappointment over and over again.

712
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,950
But no matter what,

713
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,710
from my perspective,

714
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,030
whether it's work

715
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,510
or relationship,

716
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,780
Zhen Gaogui,

717
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,910
you deserve a better future.

718
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,270
I lost.

719
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:22,950
What was lost?

720
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,950
Maybe he didn't confess to me before

721
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,230
because he had his own difficulties.

722
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,990
I originally thought of giving up,

723
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,310
but after careful consideration,

724
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,550
I am still willing to wait for him.

725
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,390
You should really let him know how you feel.

726
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,750
Come in.

727
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,500
I've completed

728
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,670
all the tasks you assigned to me.

729
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,870
You've finished all the work

730
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,670
before the time to start working.

731
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,790
Lately, you've been replying to emails

732
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,990
at 5 a.m.

733
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,790
Colleagues all said that

734
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,880
the boss was involuted himself first.

735
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,070
Didn't you tell me that work shouldn't be delayed?

736
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,990
Since it can't be delayed,

737
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,230
I just finished them early,

738
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,740
giving myself some extra time.

739
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,670
What are you going to do with the extra time?

740
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,510
I need to go out during the day.

741
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,790
Give me a call if needed.

742
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:36,130
[Wanxi Road]

743
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,950
Hello.

744
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,110
Hello.

745
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,030
Take a look and see if it's these items.

746
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,270
Yes.

747
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,950
Is that so?

748
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,630
Exactly this.

749
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,230
Why did you call me urgently for a meeting? What's going on?

750
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,750
Why just you?

751
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,790
Didn't I tell you just now?

752
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,790
It's an impromptu meeting,

753
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,310
so there are just two of us having the meeting.

754
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,670
Just the two of us?

755
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,230
Let's go to the meeting room.

756
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,070
Wait.

757
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,030
Let's go to my office.

758
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,510
Why does it matter where we have it?

759
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,430
I won't go.

760
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,230
The meeting room was just painted,

761
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,390
and the smell is too strong. It might be toxic.

762
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,070
I'm not afraid.

763
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,990
But I'm afraid.

764
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:19,990
If I get poisoned,

765
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,070
how do you explain it to the company?

766
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,070
It's hard to explain.

767
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,750
Let's go.

768
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,070
How did you

769
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,480
find these things?

770
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,070
Just contacted the buyers

771
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,550
and bought them one by one.

772
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,179
-Yes. -Is that so?

773
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,710
I bought it from the girl.

774
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,980
Okay, let me have a look.

775
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:13,219
Okay.

776
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,989
I'll pay it on Wechat.

777
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,510
I've paid for it.

778
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,150
Didn't you tell me that

779
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,270
these things

780
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,030
are very important to you.

781
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,480
They are unique

782
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,510
in your heart.

783
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,670
Didn't you ask me here for a proposal today?

784
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,949
Today,

785
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,630
I will make a proposal to you.

786
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,630
You make a proposal to me?

787
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,909
Yes.

788
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,150
I remember my grandfather telling me that

789
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,790
in this world,

790
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,989
there are no two identical popcorns.

791
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,389
Each kernel of corn has

792
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,949
its own story,

793
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,989
just like our lives.

794
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,790
We don't know what the future holds.

795
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,870
Relationships between people are also the same.

796
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,990
Moving from one stage

797
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,510
to another,

798
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,590
we may be at a loss,

799
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,990
but we have to bravely move forward.

800
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,150
You have given me many chances before,

801
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,590
but I didn't cherish them.

802
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,030
I want to preserve today.

803
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,310
Do you know how long

804
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,030
I've been waiting for this day?

805
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,070
