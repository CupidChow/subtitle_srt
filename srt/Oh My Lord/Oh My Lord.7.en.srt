Bai Li is responsible for the construction of the palace.

00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,840
You wanted to see the koi fish in the lotus tank,

7
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,470
but he didn't allow?

8
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,799
Don't mention it.

9
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:09,960
Last time,

10
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,800
I broke his twin lotus flowers.

11
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,160
He almost ate me.

12
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,240
How could you be this aggrieved in Bai's Mansion?

13
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,840
You even need to enter the imperial palace secretly?

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,910
Will it work?

15
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,920

Are you busy? You don't need to be with me.

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,200
I was about to accompany my aunt.

19
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,280
But now that you're here,

20
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,320
I'll accompany you first.

21

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,880
This is for you.

23
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,640
It's convenient for you to go in and out of the palace.

With this token,

27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,280
-I can enter the palace and save my father. -Youyou?

28
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,679
Well, I'll let you go.

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,679
You don't need to accompany me.

30
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,679
It's OK. I'll accompany you.

31
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,440
Where did you go?

32
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,960
You are not busy enough

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,640
in Bai's Mansion?

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,240
Lord Bai,

35
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,679
didn't you ask me to keep an eye on Miss Chen?

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,520
Where is she?

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,360
She is with His Royal Highness.

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,240
At this critical moment,

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,880
she is still in the mood to make pastries in the Bamboo House!

40
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,110
Lord Bai,

41
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,280
how critical is the moment?

42
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,720
She also went to the palace

43
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,960
of Madam De with His Royal Highness.

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,160
Get out.

45
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,000
My lord.

46
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,960
Where did you go?

47
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,520
I just went out for a walk.

48
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,200
Alone?

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
You were in the mood for a walk, weren't you?

50
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Why do you suddenly care about me?

51
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
I didn't.

52
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,800
After all, you are now...

53
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,960
You're a member of my mansion.

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,200
When you go out,

55
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,480
you need to be aware of your identity.

56
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,960
Don't go out

57
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,960
if you don't have special things to do.

58
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,480
You...

59
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,160
Do you have anything to tell me?

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,600
No.

61
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,230
Really?

62

If anything happened to you,

63
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,270
you can tell me directly.

64
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,120
Lord,

65
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,240
I'm fine.

66
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,950

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,480
need some personal space.

68
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,640
Besides,

69
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,120
since you are so busy,

70
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,600
you don't always need me, do you?

71
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,040
Who said that?

72
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,480
I...

73
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,880

But it's only three o'clock now.

75
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Okay, I'll prepare dinner.

76
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,720
Gosh.

77

He wants dinner at noon!

78
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,800
It's obvious that he is against me.

79
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,920
Did I offend you?

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,800

Hi is making it so hard on himself.

85
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,880
On himself?

86
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,480
Once people begin

87
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
to have a bad time with themselves,

88
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,840
they will do many abnormal things.

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
For example,

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,590
this morning, General Gu

91
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,160
asked where you were.

92
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,640
I guess he must be sent to ask.

93
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,200
So,

94
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,390
he knew I was with His Royal Highness?

95
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,160

96
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,960

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,120
He likes you.

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,760
I guess he must be jealous.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,240
What are you talking about?

100
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,680
How can he like me?

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,440
Stop.

102
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,840
Cut it off.

can Lord Bai

105

finish all of these?

106
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,080
OK.

107
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
He must be

108
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,040
possessive.

109
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,440
Yes.

Have more vinegar.

114
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,720
Dinner is ready.

115
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,800
Why did you cook so much?

116
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,080
You said you were hungry.

117
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,120
Try them.

118
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,880
Is it tasty?

119
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,920
Why is it so sour?

120
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,759
General Gu said

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,480
you love the taste of sourness.

122
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,600
So I prepared the vinegar banquet.

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,640
The memorial anniversary will be held soon.

177
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,190
According to the rules of Fuxian City...

178
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,440
This must be Madam De.

179
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
If you can't make this gown,

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,520
you will be punished by flogging.

181
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,200
Who?

182
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,800
Well...

183
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,240
Madam De.

184
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm the wife of Lord Bai.

185
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,680
Do you know

186
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,840
trespassing into the palace

187
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
is breaking my rules.

188
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Madam De,

189
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,680
Chen Youyou came to the palace with me for the first time.

190
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,590
She didn't know the rules.

191
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,560
I didn't teach her well.

192
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Please...

193
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,520
Madam De.

194
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,990
I didn't mean to disturb you,

195
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,720
but...

196
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm here to share your burden.

197
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,920
Share my burden?

198
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,640
I'm good at knitting skills.

199
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,080
Give me two days.

200
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,320
Within two days,

201
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,400
I will make

202
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,360
the gown you like.

203
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,200
What if I'm not satisfied with it?

204
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm at your disposal.

205
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,520
You're so arrogant.

206
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,240
OK.

207
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,600
I'll give you two days.

208
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,640
If you can't make it

209
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,680
in two days,

210
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,000
I won't spare

211
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,280
both of you.

212
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,910
What are you doing?

213
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,640
Let go of me.

214
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,240
Let go of me.

215
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,160
You hurt me.

216
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,240
It hurts?

217
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,720
I thought you wanted to see if losing head hurts.

218
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,560
It's not that serious.

219
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,600
Although Madam De treats people well,

220
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,510
she has principles.

221
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,440
She keeps her promise.

222
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,760
She was the beloved wife of the former castellan,

223
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
and the most powerful person

224
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,480
in Fuxian city.

225
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,840
You know,

226
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
because of this gown,

227
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,800
a dozen tailors

228
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
were beaten black and blue.

229
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,440
But why didn't you stop me just now?

230
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,430
You looked so fearless. How could I stop you?

231
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,320
I...

232
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
I was just trying to save you.

233
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,870
I was afraid you would be punished.

234
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,680
Wait and see.

235
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,360
I'll make Madam De satisfied.

236
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,120
My Lord.

237
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,950
I've finished the design of the gown.

238
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,640
Look at this.

239
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,760
Isn't it beautiful?

240
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,560
Madam De will absolutely like it.

241
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,720
These are...

242
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,400
They're...

243
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,560
Gowns designed for Madam De

244
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,920
by all tailors in Fuxian City.

245
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,360
That's a lot.

246
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,480
Why didn't you ask her

247
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,160
about the styles she likes?

248
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,400
The last...

249
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,560
The last maid who asked about her preferences

250
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,880
has been seriously punished.

251
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,840
Madam De sounds more offensive than you do.

252
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,080
The former castellan...

253
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,560
After the former castellan died,

254
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Madam De changed a lot.

255
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,440
She relied on food to relieve her worries all day long,

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,960
and gradually became like this.

257
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,160
Even...

258
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,840
Even the most beautiful women ranking list of Fuxian City

259
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,000
was banned because of her!

260
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,360
I think

261
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,760
she must be very sad.

262
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,280
Chen...

263
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,280
Why can't I talk?

264
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,440
Look at this one.

265
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,840
Not bad, right?

266
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,720
This one is good.

267
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,040
-Is it necessary to be so close to each other? -Look at this one.

268
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,950
Too close!

269
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,680
-Have some tea, Lord Bai. -This one.

270
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,240
-Yellow stands for wealth. -Here.

271
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,500
What about the purple one?

272
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,200
I didn't expect Miss Chen

273
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,560
preferred to turn to His Royal Highness.

274
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,760
Why is the tea so sour?

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,800
Not sour at all.

276
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,520
Are you still jealous,

277
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:37,800
Lord Bai?

278
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,080
Get lost!

279
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,880
You don't know either?

280
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,400
Aunt didn't tell me these.

281
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Even you don't know it.

282
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,400
Then I guess in the whole Fuxian City,

283
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,800
no one can guess Madam De's preference.

284
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:57,920
Youyou.

285
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,240
Let me help you.

286
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,600
No matter how bad I do,

287
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,840
aunt won't blame me.

288
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,400
No way.

289
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,320
I should take the responsibility.

290
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,880
I need to do my best.

291
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,880
How should I revise it?

292
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:11,719
Youyou.

293
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,240
You have such a good taste.

294
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,110
I'm sure

295
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,080
-aunt will like it. -I...

296
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,439
Lord. Lord.

297
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,719
Calm down. Calm down.

298
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:17,360
How should I?

299
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,719
Then you go to fight with him.

300
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,840
I trust you.

301
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:21,270
Get lost!

302
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,480
I wish Madam De can think the same way.

303
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,160
I'm scolded again.

304
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,919
Give me some tea.

305
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,480
If the former castellan was still alive,

306
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
this wouldn't be a problem.

307
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,040
He always knew what my aunt liked.

308
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,920
I knew it.

309
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,080
It's a waste of time asking him.

310
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,880
How can I know without a try?

311
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,440
Besides, he only studies pastries all day long.

312
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,680
It's normal that he doesn't know Madam De's preference.

313
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,920
Do you know him well?

314
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Not really.

315
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,320
If you don't,

316
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,080
how do you know

317
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,040
what he does every day?

318
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,640
Lord, are you jealous?

319
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,630
No way.

320
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,040
In this world,

321
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,480
only couples can support each other.

322
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,360
It's useless

323
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,480
to turn to someone else.

324
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,720
Wait.

325
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,080
Couples?

326
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,320
His Royal Highness just said

327
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,080
if the former castellan was still alive,

328
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
he would know Madam De's preference.

329
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,960
I see.

330
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,640
But I may need your help, my lord.

331
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,480
You want to go to the Castellan's Palace?

332
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,320
The former castellan died

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,360
in Fuxian City in the year 195.

334
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,630
My lord,

335
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,310
according to the book,

336
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,480
the former castellan died young.

337
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,150
But Fuxian City was prosperous and peaceful.

338
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,280
And there was no war.

339
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,160
How could he...

340
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,120
The former castellan was poisoned

341
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,560
by the imperial physician Su.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,040
Poisoned?

343
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,240
How could the imperial physician poison the castellan?

344
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,080
I will find out the truth one day.

345
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,840
I'll tell you the details later.

346
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,950
Let's get down to business first.

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
How dare you bring her here?

349
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,960
This is called beauty... beauty disaster.

350
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,800
What a sin!

351
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,880
What if they are found?

352
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,280
Cheer up. Go and check over there.

353
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,350
Does it hurt?

354
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,120
The castellan and Miss De got married

355
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,960
in Fuxian City in 185.

356
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,640
The whole city celebrated it together.

357
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
The castellan promised Miss De

358
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,480
to grow old together.

359
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,960
They wished that they would live in harmony and mutual respect forever.

360
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,520
From then on,

361
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
on the year of their Tin Wedding, China Wedding,

362
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,040
Jade Wedding, Ruby Wedding and Golden Wedding anniversaries,

363
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,960
the castellan will make one gown for Madam De in person,

364
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,480
and build her a palace,

365
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,000
with the Sun and Moon as the witness,

366
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,440
and people in Fuxian as the proof.

367
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:31,760
My lord,

368
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,470
I have an idea now.

369
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,400
Think about it.

370
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,320
Only when you really love someone,

371
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,190
will you be willing

372
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,960
to make clothes for her in person.

373
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,640
When Madam De wears it,

374
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,440
it should be like

375
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,200
she's surrounded by all the love and care.

376

377

405
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,160
General Gu,

406
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,480
what's wrong with Lord Bai?

407
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,000
I must have seen it wrong.

408
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,350
He's cooking

409
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,080
fruit porridge, isn't he?

410
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,240
No way.

411
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,280
How can he do such things?

412
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,350
I have to help him.

413
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,600
If you don't want to be punished,

414
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,840
you'd better not do anything.

415
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,720
Tiao,

416
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,360
why you stop talking nonsense now?

417
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,840
I...

418
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,240
I don't say it all the time.

419
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,240
Wow, you can control yourself well.

420
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,520
Awesome!

421
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,800
If I can satisfy Madam De,

422
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,920
it will be possible to ask her to release my dad.

423
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,040
Tiao,

424
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,240
your cooking is getting better and better.

425
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,840
Help me get the scissors.

426
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,920
My lord.

427
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,520
How is the fruit porridge?

428
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,960
Is it sweet?

429
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,240
Yes.

430
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,680
Be careful.

431
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,760
My lord.

432
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,640
The sewing work has been finished.

433
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,200
Next,

434
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,120
it's your turn to assist me.

435
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,080
Me?

436
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,080
Hurry up.

437
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,520
Yes, I will.

438
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,200
Raise your hands.

439
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,320
My lord, please help hold here.

440
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,200
Hurry up.

441
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I'll be quick.

442
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,640
Just a moment, my lord.

443
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,320
Let me have a look.

444
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,840
Are you okay?

445
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,480
Are you okay?

446
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,480
I...

447
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,880
I'm fine.

448
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,320
What?

449
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,080
Is there a problem?

450
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,990
I suddenly found

451
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,080
you look pretty

452
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,680
in women's clothes.

453
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,200
Take it off.

454
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,600
Stand up.

455
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,000
How can I take it off if you don't stand up?

456
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,440
Get up!

457
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,880
You can't stand up.

458
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,000
Get up!

459
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,560
Chen Youyou, take it off for me.

460
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,790
No, I won't.

461
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,400
Stop running!

462
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,920
I won't help to take it off.

463
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,800
No.

464
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,920
You can't catch up with me, can you?

465
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:42,880
Lord Bai.

466
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,800
I won't help to take it off.

467
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,720
I won't.

468
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,760
Lord Bai.
