Miss.

5
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,320
Miss!

6
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,200
Tiao!

7
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
What's wrong?

8
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Are you okay?

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm fine.

10
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,000
I have no idea what happened.

11
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,000
They dragged me out

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
from Lord Xian's Palace last night.

13
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
They asked me to be the bride's maid

14
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,040
and follow the wedding sedan.

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,160
They didn't allow me to see you.

16
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,670
They said you were...

17
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
They said you were in the bridal chamber.

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,800
Tiao, I know this.

19
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,000
I know.

20
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,280
Miss,

21
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,920
what should we do next?

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,440
I heard that Lord Bai

23
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,520
has a bad temper.

24
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,679
It's hard to serve him.

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,840
Don't worry.

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,270
Let's keep ourselves safe first,

27
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,040
and then find a way to save my dad.

28
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,400
Miss, don't worry.

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
I won't go west if you ask me to go east.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,160
I won't go north if you ask me to go south.

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,200
I will do whatever you say...

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,760
Tiao!

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,960
I will work hard.

34
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,200
Lord.

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,270
I see.

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,320
Then, this will be easy.

37
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,120
What do you mean?

38
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,920
-What did you... -Shh!

39
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,120
Let's go.

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,040
Go.

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,360
If you keep being careless,

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
go and receive your punishment voluntarily.

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
It's my fault.

44
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,920

How's the investigation going?

48

Chen Youyou

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,320
came to Fuxian City six months ago.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,480
In the past,

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,480
she was just a wild girl on the street.

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,600
A wild girl?

53
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,560
Yes.

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
She left her hometown when she was little

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,640
and has been wandering around since then.

56
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,400
I have sent some men

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,240
to look for information in her hometown.

58
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,160
Keep an eye on her.

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,760
Report to me if anything happens.

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Lord,

61
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,920
although she is innocent for now,

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,800
she almost knew your real identity

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,320
in the House of Respectful Affairs that day.

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,560
She also saw

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
how you executed the eunuch.

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,240
If you let her stay,

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,720
I'm afraid...

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
She told a lie and said the eunuch was an assassin.

69
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,559
She must be afraid of being killed.

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,950
She's quite smart.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,960
Do you think we need

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,160
to tell her

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,240
the whole story.

74
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,280
I don't want to ruin your reputation.

75
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,800
There's no need.

76
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,720
You want to threaten Chen Youyou using this?

77
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,840
She is smart.

78
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,720
No matter what her purpose is,

79
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,400
she won't dare to do anything.

80
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,080
If she crosses the line,

81
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,440
just kill her.

82
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,440
Copy that.

83
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,440
Miss?

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
Today, you ran from east

85
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
to west in the city,

86
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,120
and then from south to north.

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,480
Right after a little break,

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
someone at the east gate asked for you.

89
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,760
Tiao, get to the point.

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,600
Here.

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,030
The butler from Lord Xian's Palace sent this apple.

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,030
Chen Youyou, you enjoyed yourself today?

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,550
You made a fuss in Castellan's Palace

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,360
and got married.

95
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,360
Most importantly,

96
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,840
you ruined my face.

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,960
We haven't settled that yet.

98
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,200
Your Highness,

99
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,150
if I offer a solution,

100
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,830
could you please

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
spare my father and Tiao?

102
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,160
Their lives depend on your performance.

103
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,560
Try your best to please Bai Li

104
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,710
and spy on him.

105
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,680
Chen Youyou!

106
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,880
Remember,

107
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,759
if you want to save your father,

108
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,350
you must be on the inside.

109
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,320
Who's there?

110
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,520
Chen Youyou?

111
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,280
What are you doing?

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,920
Make you satisfied and earn your trust.

113
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,120
My lord,

114
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,160
I'll help you with the clothes.

115
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,760
My lord,

116
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,510
you don't have to be shy

117
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,640
in front of me.

118
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,030
Chen Youyou,

119
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,040
are you out of your mind?

120
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,590
My lord, don't say that.

121
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,440
I didn't mean that.

122
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,240
Think about it.

123
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,880
We're so lucky to meet each other.

124
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,520
I just want to be closer to you.

125
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,070
Get out!

126
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,480
Chen Youyou!

127
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,120
Chen Youyou.

128
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,190
How dare you!

129
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,720
My lord, do you prefer

130
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,480
to be served by General Gu?

131
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,550
What do you want to say?

132
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,240
I just want to make you happy.

133
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,160
Nonsense!

134
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,240
How inappropriate!

135
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,120
My lord,

136
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,240
now that we are married,

137
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,560
I'll be honest with you.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,720
I know

139
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,759
you don't trust me now.

140
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,200
We suddenly got married.

141
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,840
It's hard for the both of us to accept it.

142
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,600
But now,

143
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,520
we are under the same roof.

144
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,640
We see each other every day.

145
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,800
So,

146
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,360
I want

147
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,240
to be good to you.

148
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
You've performed this in front of the castellan.

149
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,790
No need to do that again.

150
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,680
I don't care why

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,759
you married me.

152
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,390
But I warn you,

153
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,440
don't let me find out.

154
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,200
Otherwise, you'll suffer the consequences.

155
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,590
You're too serious.

156
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,760
I don't have any bad intentions.

157
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,470
My lord?

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,440
Didn't you say you would help me with this?

159
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,040
Do it.

160
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,640
You think I'm afraid?

161
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,680
Isn't she afraid?

162
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,720
Guess I was wrong.

163
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,840
She wasn't testing me.

164
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,960
She really meant it.

165
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,400
You have a personal guard.

166
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,040
Why the charade?

167
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,640
I don't believe you dare to do anything to me.

168
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,840
My lord, you...

169
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,640
My lord, what did you do?

170
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,040
I hate slick people

171
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
with smart mouths.

172
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,560
That was your punishment.

173
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,480
Punishment?

174
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,360
Do you feel hot?

175
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
Is your heart beating faster?

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,230
This is a special poison.

I said the insect is special,

183
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,270
because those who are poisoned can't lie.

184
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,840
Once they lie,

185
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,400
their hearts will beat faster.

186
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,800
The insect will feel it.

187
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,920
As a result, if you lie,

188
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,760
you will be devoured.

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,360
Let me have a taste.

526
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,110
It's much better than the one you gave me last time.

527
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,590
I didn't expect this.

528
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,480
I've been making pastries for years.

529
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,360
This is the first time I got positive feedback.

530
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,040
But, it was not because of my own efforts.

531
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,360
Maybe my uncle is right.

532
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,880
I'm not a good baker.

533
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,080
Don't say that.

534
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,240
Who can make life decisions

535
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,510
for other people just based on a few words?

536
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,390
You'll become

537
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,720
what you want to be.

538
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,920
Miss.

539
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,040
Can I have your name?

540
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,480
Nice to meet you.

541
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,720
My name is Qi Shengwen.

542
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,600
I'm Chen Youyou.

543
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,040
Will you be my friend?

544
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,840
Your Royal Highness,

545
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
of course we're friends.

546
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,560
Let's go!

547
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,830
[Zhou's Flower Cake Shop]

548
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,000
My lord!

549
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,680
My lord.

550
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,400
Chen Youyou?

551
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,520
What are you doing here?

552
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,680
Mrs. Zhao asked me

553
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,350
to serve you.

554
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,520
Gu Tianhe! Gu Tianhe!

555
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,160
My lord, you don't have to call him.

556
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,400
General Gu is busy today.

557
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
I'll do it for you today.

558
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,440
Chen Youyou,

559
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,000
I don't need your help.

560
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,960
Get out.

561
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,680
There's no reason to be shy.

562
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,240
Why are you acting like that?

563
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,040
Do you think I want to be your maid?

564
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
I just want to please you.

565
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,360
Otherwise, I would never do such a thing.

566
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,280
My lord, I don't understand.

567
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,200
Normally,

568
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,160
you treat General Gu well.

569
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,040
You're also nice to Miss Jiang.

570
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,040
Why do you...

571
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,680
Why do you treat me as if you've seen a ghost?

572
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,120
My lord,

573
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,160
do you

574
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,830
hate me?

575
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,240
That's none of your business.

576
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,280
You do hate me!

577
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,310
No, I don't.

578
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,280
I knew it. You're highly intelligent.

579
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,120
How could you not see

580
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,400
my love for you?

581
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,390
My lord,

582
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,320
your hand...

583
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,480
It's nothing.

584
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,400
Chen Youyou,

585
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,520
there's nothing else.

586
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,360
You should leave now.

587
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,920
Yes.

588
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,670
No, I haven't poured the milk yet.

589
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,800
Milk.

590
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,200
I'll get your clothes.

591
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,680
I...

592
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,720
I'll stay here for a while.

593
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,120
Chen Youyuo, get your head out of the clouds.

594
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,720
He is a eunuch!

595
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,320
The type who will kill without blinking.

596
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,880
Calm down.

597
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,720
This one...

598
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,600
is a bit old-fashioned.
