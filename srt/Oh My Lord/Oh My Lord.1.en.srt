Are you okay, Eunuch Bai?

Eunuch Li examined your body today, and

you found the evidence today.

To relieve the pain of missing him,

I had no choice but to take the risk

I don't think she is lying.

and will take good care of you.

500

00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,180
If you come any closer, I will...

520
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,740
Kill myself.

521
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,060
Just do it.

522
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,060
I don't care at all.

523
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:23,980
I...

524
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,980
I'll do it now.

525
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,700
Really!

526
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,620
I...

527
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,980
Go and sleep in the wood shed.

528
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,580
Do I need to repeat it?

529
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,100
No.

530
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,740
The wood shed would be nice!

531
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,020
My lord, I'll take my leave!
