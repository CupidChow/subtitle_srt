Why are you lying in my bed?

5
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,900
My lord,

6
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,299
since castellan has married me off to you,

7
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,460
we should share the same room.

8
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,820
I'm not used to sleeping with others.

9
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,820
But Mrs. Zhao and the others

10
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,380
are still watching from the door.

11
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,420
I even set up a gap.

12
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,380
We have our own spaces to sleep in, and

13
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,060
we won't disturb each other.

14

it has been so long.

18
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,890
Why is it so quiet?

19
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,570
Did something happen?

20
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,220
Calm down.

You are still a young girl.

Let me out!

I don't mean that.

135
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,300
It's just that my wife is so timid that

136
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,300
she was scared just by Your Highness's stare.

137

Please calm down, Your Highness.

But, you are bold.

140

I came to give you gifts, but

141
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,860
you made me upset?

I appreciate your kindness, Your Highness.

143
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,740
As for these things...

144
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,420
What?

145
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,900
Well...

146
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,220
Of course, we will keep these gifts.

147
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,220
I will put Your Highness's kindness

148

to good use.

149
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,780
These would make our relationship sweeter

150
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,020
and better.

151
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,740
We won't let you and

castellan down,

am I right?

[Bai's Mansion]

157
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,900
Your Highness.

158
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,740
Drawing.

159
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,330
I'm so pissed.

160
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,580
What is this drawing?

161
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,820
What I want is

162
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,100
the drawing of an embarrassed Bai Li to humiliate him.

163
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,980
This is clearly about Chen Youyou and Bai Li being

164
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,860
lovey-dovey!

165

Lovey-dovey?

She is right.

167
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,620
The better and more loving their relationship is,

168
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,700
the more useful

169
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,580
Chen Youyou will be to me.

170
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,020
This matter must be

171
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,020
known by everyone in Fuxian City.

172
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,620
Yes.

173
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,020
Also, tell Mrs. Zhao that

174
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,460
this marriage

175
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,740
is different from others.

we need to use extreme measures.

178
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,740
Since you're already in trouble,

179
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,940
why did you get involved in this?

180
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,540
If I don't do it myself,

181
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,100
our difficulties

182
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,660
will be more than these.

183
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,660
Miss, do you have any good idea?

184
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,940
Tiao,

185
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,460
pick out the jewelries and jades.

186
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,540
Then, pawn them at a suitable pawnshop.

187
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,610
Money is more realistic.

188
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,900
Miss,

189
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,820
the east side pawnshop's owner is the most honest.

190
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,380
The one in the south is the closest to us.

191
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
The one in the north gives the highest price.

192
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,380
The one in the west...

193
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:31,940
Tiao,

194
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,620
get to the point!

195
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,780
Miss,

196
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,020
what about these herbs?

197
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,770
These herbs are not worth any money.

198
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
Just take care of it.

199
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,460
Just take care of it?

200
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,140
My lord!

201
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,100
My lord!

202
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,690
I just cleaned up your room

203
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,740
and found this.

204
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,780
It's good.

Miss Chen.

206
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,940
Miss Chen is so meticulous to you.

207
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,740
She even sewed you a wrist strap.

208
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,780
It's nothing.

209
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,260
Miss Chen...

210
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,300
still protected you in front of Lord Xian today.

211
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,180
As a couple,

212
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,220
it's normal.

213
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,540
Miss Chen...

215
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,180
and even makes supper for you.

216
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,570
She got nothing else to do.

217
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:48,940
My lord,

218
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,340
I think Ms. Chen treats you differently.

219
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,980
I think...

220
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,540
she covets your beauty.

221
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,940
Stop thinking.

222
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,940
Go and receive your punishment.

223
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,170
Receive punishment for this?

224
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:08,980
Come back!

225
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,060
My lord,

226
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,020
you agree with what I said, right?

227
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,580
How is the investigation?

228
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,820
Lord Wang Renhou

229
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,500
has no relatives in his hometown.

230
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,460
I didn't find any useful clues.

231
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
But I did find out that

232
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,980
a year ago,

233
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,540
he sent a letter to

234
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,580
his distant uncle-in-law.

235
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,740
A letter?

236
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,450
So, we deducted that

237
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,300
Lord Wang is still alive.

238
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,100
I've sent someone to investigate it.

239

Tell me immediately if you have any news.

240
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,380
Yes.

241

Go and receive your punishment.

242
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,740
Still?

243
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,340
I'll go then.

she covets your beauty.

Lord Xian made my lord upset.

With so much money,

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,020
what are you doing up there?

354
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,900
My lord, come up!

355
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,210
Come on.

356
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,820
This is my secret recipe.

357
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,410
I've never told anyone about it.

358
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,020
There are only a few mouths of watermelon that are the sweetest.

359
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,250
It also needs to be frozen with well water for several hours.

360
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,020
Have a taste!

361
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,100
Is it sweet?

362
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,740
In life,

363
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,180
there are a lot of worries.

364
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,980
But, as long as you eat something sweet,

365
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,500
you'll feel better.

366
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,020
My lord, do you know that

367
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,140
when I was young, my family was poor.

368
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,660
I starved often.

369
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,100
One time, my father gave me something sweet.

370
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,420
Then, I realized that sweet

371
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,170
is such a wonderful taste.

372
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,020
From then on,

373
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,740
as long as I eat sweet,

374
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,260
I feel

375
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,460
there's nothing I can't do.

376
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,220
So,

377
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,500
don't be angry

378
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,340
for someone worthless,

379
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,420
okay?

380
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,090
Give me your hand.

381
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,970
Give it to me.

382
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,700
What?

383
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,060
What?

384
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,220
How dare you sneak around and eat?

385
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,490
What did I teach you?

386
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,660
You can only be respected after

387
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,820
you survive the bitterness of life.

388
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,620
Do you realize your mistake?

389
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,740
Yes,

390
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,340
I won't do it again.

391
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,420
My lord, make a wish!

392
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,820
When I was young, my father said

393
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,340
if eyelash falls, I should make a wish immediately.

394
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,180
It works!

395
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,780
Childish!

396
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,580
Forget it.

397
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,020
I'll make a wish for you then.

398
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,060
Wishing you

399
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,100
happiness every day!

[Wind Booth]

402
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,420
My lord, I...

403
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,300
I'll head back first.

404
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,060
[Wind Booth]

405
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,380
No good night for today?

406
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,580
Good night?

407
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,740
Good night.

408
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,700
Why is he so nice suddenly?

409
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,660
When he held me just now,

410
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,460
I felt safe.

411
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,620
Did he hold me with his left hand

412
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,380
or right hand?

413
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,890
Why is my heart beating so fast?

414
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,780
What am I thinking?

415
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,930
He is Lord Qiansui, an eunuch!

416
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,660
No, no!

417
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,620
Chen Youyou, go to bed.

420

Miss Chen,

421
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,540
next time, you can clean when

422
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,300
my lord is not around.

423
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
He is allergic to dust.

424
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,140
Go, go!

425
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,140
My lord, are you alright?

426
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,860
How about I call the imperial physician?

427
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,300
It's not me who's in trouble.

428
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,740
Let's go.

429
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,420
My lord,

430
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,020
there's a lot of dust recently.

431
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,660
I made some sweet soup to clear your lungs.

432
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,380
Thank you.

433
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,410
I still have work to do.

434
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,260
Chen Youyou, what are you thinking?

435
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,100
You better clean the house quickly,

436
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,620
so he won't sneeze again.

437
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,340
Why is there a secret chamber?

438
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,100
Why are there no names

439
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,940
on these spirit tablets?

440
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,610
I'm sorry.

441
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,820
I didn't mean to offend you.

442
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,260
I didn't mean to offend you.

443
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Chen Youyou, what are you doing?

444
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,700
I'm sorry,

445
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,580
I didn't mean it.

446
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,020
Who allowed you to search my things?

447
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,290
You are such a sneaky woman.

448
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,660
I just want to

449
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,620
clean the room.

450
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,620
Get out!

451
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,210
I'm not stealing anything!

452
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,460
I just want to clean the dust inside!

453
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,060
Never step in my room again!

454

But...

455
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,660
Well,

456
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,700
Mrs. Zhao is still in the mansion...

457
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,260
Get out!

458
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,300
I already apologized.

459
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,060
I said I didn't mean it!

460
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,460
Why are you so fierce?

Who dares to make a scene here?

My lord,

castellan arranged a banquet and

465
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,940
requested the attendance of the family.

466
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,060
The family...

467
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,340
ran away?

[Bai's Mansion]

469
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,260
My lord,

470
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,060
we've been planning this for so many years.

471
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,020
We can't afford to make any mistakes now.

472
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,980
Or, I'll just...

473
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,300
She won't be able to figure it out.

474
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,740
Maybe

475
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,140
I shouldn't have kept her by my side.

476
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
I see.

477
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,380
But, if she's not with me,

478
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,060
where can she go?
