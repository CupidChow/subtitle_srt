Have you heard that?

5
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,480
Yes, I have.

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,280
-It's true. -Yes, she came, too.

7
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,360
You must be Lord Bai's lovely wife.

8
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,510
You look no different from the painting.

9
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,990
Greetings, ladies.

10
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,040
Lovely wife?

11
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,360
She married a eunuch.

12
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,280
A nominal couple, that's all.

13
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,200
You are so humorous.

14
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,320
For small families,

15
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,240
even a nominal couple can enjoy dinner together.

16
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,840
Different from you

17
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,840
who came from extended and luxurious families,

18
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,320
I guess you have to line up

19
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,520
for dinner with your husband.

20
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,880
Marrying a eunuch,

21
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,270
why do you feel smug?

22
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,240
Precisely.

23
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,160
Right.

24
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,800
For you, a poor hoyden,

25
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,240
you have married up.

26
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,400
Actually, I am already satisfied

27
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
with the life that my Lord provides me

28
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,560
since I am fed and clothed.

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,280
Madam,

30
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,080
your clothes

31
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,270
must be last year's model.

32
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,440
Look at this.

33
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,270
My Lord customized it lately.

34
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,280
It took half a month to be made and delivered.

35
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,760
My Lord said

36
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,950
pink matched me the most.

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,800
As Eunuch Mastering the Seal waiting for castellan,

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,470
he didn't perform his duty

39
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,400
but used castellan's power

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
for private gain.

41
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
And you actually took it as glory.

42
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,920
Madam.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,600
Exactly.

44
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,280
You'd better think twice.

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,160
My lord has always been diligent

46
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,080
and dutiful.

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,760
He dare neither seek private gains

48
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,080
nor neglect any order of castellan.

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,720
Please pick your words with care.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,680

51
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,200
My Lord.

52
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,800
You're here.

53

Come on.

54

By the way, these ladies are struck

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,040
on the clothes you customized for me.

56
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,400
How about recommending the dressmaker to them?

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,600
Sure, Madam.

58
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,200
Look at yourself.

59
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,840
You miss me so much only after a short while.

60
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
So annoying.

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,160
See you.

62
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
Look how smug she is.

63

This wine tastes good.

71
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,790
It's been a long time since I drank such good wine.

72
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,250
You look quite well.

73
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,160
Your Excellency,

74
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,960
I heard that Lord Bai is a master of swordplay.

75
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,080
Why not ask him to perform

76
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,640
a sword dance of Fuxian City with imperial bodyguards

77
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
to cheer us up?

78
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,390
Great. Great.

79
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,680
Bai Li, go perform with them.

80
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,120
Yes.

81
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,080
It's rare to see a eunuch perform sword dances.

82
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,480
One always wants to prove what he lacks.

83
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,520
Lord Bai just lacks manliness, doesn't he?

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,240
That's true.

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,240
-Look! Look! -Look at Lord Bai.

86
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,400
Are my eyes playing tricks on me?

87
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,600
A eunuch has an Adam's Apple.

88
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,400
It must be the most weird thing in the world.

89
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,800
I heard that a few days ago, an assassin intruded into House of Respectful Affairs,

90
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,080
so Lord Bai didn't finish his examination.

91
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,760
Now he even has an Adam's Apple.

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,120
We cannot but

93
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,240
make a connection between these.

94

seize the day and check him?

96
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,160
Yes.

97
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,040
Yes.

98
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,160
Bai Li, what's wrong with that?

99
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,900
It's rare.

100
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,759
So weird.

101
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,950
It is really weird.

102
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,460
Yes.

103
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,040
Your Excellency,

104
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,200
that is not an Adam's Apple. Instead, it's a kind of laryngeal disease.

105
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,560
His Lord has been serving you all year long

106
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,840
and suffers from it due to excessive exhaustion.

107
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
It's not an Adam's Apple

108
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,600
but a sign of his loyalty.

109
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,240
The reason why his Lord always keeps reticent

110
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,800
is that he doesn't want to bother you with trifles.

111
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,160
Your Excellency, she's talking nonsense.

112
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
How can there be such a disease?

113
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,400
I've never heard of that.

114
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,120
That's easy. Imperial physician.

115

Your Excellency,

116
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,320
there is indeed a disease like that.

117
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,509
That's good.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Stop talking about that.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,040
Continue the banquet.

120
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,160
Luckily, I've journeyed north and south with Chen Pingzhi

121
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,920

You are still a little girl.

You won't understand even if I explain.

128

It's easy for a girl to pursue a man.

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,590
Youyou?

176
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,320
Help me!

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,520
Where is she?

178
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,760
She was in the carriage just now.

179
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,360
Look for her separately.

180
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,200
My lord,

181
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,000
what's done is done.

182
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,400
Why don't we seize the opportunity

183
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,800
and let her leave Bai's Mansion

184
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
to avoid following troubles?

185
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,990
When do I need

186
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,040
you to decide for me?

187
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,000
You said

188
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,920
you didn't want her to stay around, didn't you?

189
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,120
Never return

190
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
if you can't find her back.

191
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,240
My lord.

192
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,840
My Lord.

193
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,040
Do I misread him again?

You're awake.

Where am I?

198
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,110
This is the secret base for my snack research.

199
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,720
I didn't expect to invite you here in this way.

200
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,200
By the way, Youyou,

201
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,640
at a late night,

202
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,360
why are you in the wild alone?

203
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,520
Do you know how dangerous it is?

204
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:05,870
I...

205
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,520
was kicked out.

206
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,200
What?

207
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,920
How can Bai Li be like this?

208
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,320
How can he ignore your safety?

209
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,480
Yes.

210
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,320
I risked myself to get him out of a fix

211
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,630
but he still kicked me out.

212
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,760
I'm pissed off.

213
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,240
Why

214
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,360
do I lose my breath?

215
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,280
Youyou,

216
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,990
why is your face so red?

217
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,440
Could it be that sweet soup?

218
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,920
Are you allergic?

219
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,520
Don't come over.

220
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,830
I...

221
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,000
I still have something to do. I have to go.

Why do you come to me?

225
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,080
You drove me away, didn't you?

226
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,430
Let go!

227

She doesn't want to go with you.

Let go.

231

It's you who should let go.

232

She is my wife.

So where are you going to abandon me?

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,240
I'll take you

It's you who drove me away.

You...

You sent me away, didn't you?

262
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,430
You asked Gu Tianhe to hit my head

and it still hurts now.

264

It's okay for me to stay.

328

But we should set three rules.

329
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
I allowed you to stay but you made a requirement again.

and I sleep there.

345

Forget it if you don't agree.

346
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,360
Anyway, I have been used to sleeping on a small bed...

347
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,080
OK.

348
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,480
Good night.

My lord,

352
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,480
Mrs. Zhao was in a hurry

353
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,240
to pack up and leave Bai's Mansion

354
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,240
in the early morning.

355
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,720
I asked her to leave.

356
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,560

Youyou,

Mrs. Zhao didn't behave herself.

360
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,520
She put you at risk last night.

361
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,400
So I've asked her to retire.

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,960
From now on,

363
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,520
if anyone dares to bully you,

364
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,680
I will surely teach him a lesson.

365
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,880
Does his Highness know

366
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,360
why Mrs. Zhao came to work in Bai's Mansion?

367
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,840
So he knew

368
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,480
it was I who invited Mrs. Zhao here.

369
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800

But Youyou is my friend.

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,360
I won't allow anyone to hurt her.

373
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,280
It's a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding.

374
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,960
Youyou.

375
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,880
I am devising a new snack

376

you haven't recovered yet.

You should not run about.

have you cleaned the front yard?

In conflict with his Highness,

you're trying to vent your anger on me?

387
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,280
I've already cleaned it up.

388
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,800

00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,040
Now that Mrs. Zhao has left,

Yes!

I've heard a joke.

441
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,240
Once upon a time, there was an earthworm.

442
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,320
It went out for a walk.

443
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,040
While it was walking,

444
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,600
it crashed into a crab.

445
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,160
A crab?

446
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,960
The earthworm was mad and questioned the crab,

447
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,320
"Are you blind?"

448
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,120
But the crab felt innocent,

449
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,640
"I am not blind.

450
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
I'm a crab."

451
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,720
It's not funny at all.

452
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,400
Smell it.

453
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,640
Can you smell a faint scent

454
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,560
from this ginger?

455
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,840
This kind of wild ginger

456
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,760
is hard to pick.

457
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,640
But it tastes fresh and crispy.

458
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,360
It is a good ingredient.

459
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,160
Besides, it’s said that it can cure cold and headache.

460
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
So it should be that domain lotus in the poem.

461
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,880
Poem?

462
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,280
Domain lotus?

463
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,670
It is read that

464
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,560
Yan Emperor carried this edition forward and thought it precious.

465
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,320
After a harsh time, he got domain lotus and was able to survive.

466
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,870
Even Shen Nung suffered hardships to get it

467
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,720
and continued his life with it.

468
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,840
It's so precious.

469

You must have read a lot.

474
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,160
Unlike me,

475
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,870
I am almost illiterate.

476
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,480

and every journey you had

481
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,000
is what you've read.

482

It's my first time to have received such praise.

483
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,080
That is a fact.

484
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,600
It is a pity that they don't have a good taste.

485
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,360
You're right.

486
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,680
Let's continue the picking.

487
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,640
OK.

488
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,470
By the way,

489
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
we can try to

490
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,800
use this wild ginger in the snack.

491
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,760
There might be a special flavor.

[Bai's Mansion]

493
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,080
He really allowed Tiao to pack my stuff up.

494

Why didn't he stop Tiao?

495
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,960
Youyou.

496
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,320
Miss Jiang.

497
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,670
I've heard what happened

498
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,800
last night.

499
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,190
I didn’t expect Mrs. Zhao

500
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,800
to have played such a trick.

501
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,120
And General Gu

502
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,320
actually left you alone

503
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,160
in the wild.

504
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,920
For an ordinary girl,

505
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,640
she might have lost her chastity.

506
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,030
No need to worry about me, Miss Jiang.

507
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,040
I didn't meet any accident.

508
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,360
But Miss Jiang,

509
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,480
you should not behave like those yentas

510
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,760
and backbite me.

511
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,520
Come on.

512
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,960
Have some green tea

513
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,160
to reduce your internal heat.

514
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,440
I almost forgot it.

515
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,920
This is

516
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
the nutritious soup I specially cooked for you.

517
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,120
I used

518
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,720
precious herbs that his Lord gave me before.

519
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,360
After all this,

520
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,240
you should take good care of yourself.

521
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,390
Now that his Lord gave these herbs to you,

522
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,680
you should nourish yourself with them.

523
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,800
I still have a lot.

524
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,360
Don't worry for me.

525
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,040
On the contrary,

526
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,600
you are new in the mansion

527
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,160
and have no idea about his Lord's personality.

528
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,560
It’s common for you

529
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,720
to annoy him.

530
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,240
Miss,

531
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,960
you should be more careful.

532
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,200
But

533
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,320
if anything similar happens again,

534
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,280
you can come to me.

535
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,160
After all, I've known his Lord for years.

536
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,480
Somehow,

537
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,080
I weigh with him.

538
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,480
Indeed.

539
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,840
You weigh some weight.

540
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,680
My father used to be an official of Fuxian City

541
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,440
but was set up by villains.

542
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,240
The Jiang family then came down

543
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
and I got lost.

544
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,830
Thanks to his Lord's help,

545
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
I was survived.

546
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,560
His Lord is considerate

547
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,480
and takes good care of me.

548
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,200
Of course I know his regard.

549
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,280
It is a pity that

550
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,040
there is

551
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,760
an unbridgeable gap

552
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,910
between him and me.

553
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,600
A gap?

554
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,800
I see.

555
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,550
This gap

556
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,000
must be that He.

557
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,240
He and his Lord...they two...

558
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
Youyou, you misunderstood it.

559
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,040
Gu Tianhe is nothing but a guard.

560
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,880
I’ve lived with his Lord in Bai's Mansion for years.

561
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,600
I know him better than you do.

562
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,640
His Lord once

563
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,600
arranged a blind date for Gu Tianhe last year.

564
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,200
But General Gu was so stubborn

565
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,000
that the girl felt wronged and left.

566
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,160
General Gu does look like

567
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,800
a stubborn man.
