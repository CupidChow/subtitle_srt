00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,060
Madam De.

6
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,620
A lone green stem,

7
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,220
two shadows of red.

8
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,020
Hurry!

9
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,260
Open it and let me see.

10
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,220
Are the twin lotus flowers as spiritual

11
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,500
as you said?

12
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,490
Bai,

13
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,220
why are you being so mysterious?

14
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,700
Madam De can't wait any longer,

15
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,500
open it now.

16
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,620
Koi fish?

17
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,140
Madam De wants to see the lotus.

18
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,050
No!

19
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,020
My lord,

20
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,700
I think...

21
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,500
Madam De cares more about

22
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,660
the meaning of the twin lotus flowers.

23
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,980
What do you mean?

24
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,779
My lord, think about it.

25
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,900
No matter how beautiful a flower blooms,

26
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,020
it will wither someday.

27
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,650
What if that day comes, and

28
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,260
Madam De holds you accountable for?

29
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,460
What will you do?

30
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,100
Here.

31
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,300
Do you think we're blind?

32
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,610
-Are these twin lotus flowers? -What twin lotus flowers?

33
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,020
Isn't this a water tank?

34
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,860
Bai Li,

35
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,980
how dare you!

36
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,300
Madam De, please calm down.

37
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,779
Please look carefully.

38
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,779
Flowers bloom and wither.

39
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,900
I'm worried

40
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,300
when the flowers wither,

41
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,540
they may make you upset.

42
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,060
So, I present you with

43
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,690
the twin lotus flowers that will never wither.

44
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,860
Madam, look.

45
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,500
The lotus tank is visually intermingled yet picturesque.

46
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,690
Put it in the imperial palace, and

47
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,580
you can see it every day.

48
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,860
These green leaves and koi fishes represent fun,

49
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,660
symbolize auspice.

50
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,770
If it is placed in the imperial palace,

51
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,300
it will bring spiritual energy.

52
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,900
What a joke!

53
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,300
Bai,

54
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,820
you can really defend yourself.

55
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:21,140
I think you broke the twin lotus flowers, so

56
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,380
you use this fake flower as an alternative.

57
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,140
Madam De...

58
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,100
won't be fooled by your little trick.

59
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,580
My lord, think about it.

60
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,580
Twin lotus flowers are so rare.

61
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,859
Once you do this,

62
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,500
you give Madam De hope.

63
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,540
Even in a place where there is no life.

64
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,370
Once the master has hope,

65
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,620
the spiritual energy comes along with it!

66
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:58,850
Madam De,

67
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,580
twin lotus flowers are hard to find.

68
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,140
It's even harder to find like-minded people.

69
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,530
I believe that being pure-hearted is efficacious.

70
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,020
If Madam De still wishes to admire twin lotus flowers,

71
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,020
you can try planting this seed yourself.

72
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,540
If the twin lotus flowers bloom in the imperial palace one day,

73
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
the late castellan must have

74
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,770
felt your longing.

75
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Bai is indeed the most trusted person in this city.

This never withering twin lotus flowers,

77
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,220
I like it very much.

78

Tomorrow is the beam raising ceremony.

79
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,540
I want to see this yard filled with twin lotus flowers.

80
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,780
Don't miss the auspicious time.

81
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,460

find Chen Youyou.

appears at Madam De's imperial palace tomorrow,

93

I'll kill Chen Pingzhi immediately.

94
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,340
I've picked the flowers.

My lord,

98
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,700
the lotus tanks are ready.

99
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,859
All we need is to send them to the palace tomorrow.

100

Miss Chen is quite smart.

101

She accidentally broke the flower,

102
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,620
but prepared and

103
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,100
thought of a better way for you.

104
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,980
Of course!

105
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,460
She is my girl.

106
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,660
I mean

107
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,620
she has been in Bai's Mansion for more than three months.

108
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
She knows more or less about

109
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,980
the affairs in the palace.

110
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,460
She learned to be smart.

111
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,340
Be careful.

112
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,460

115
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,540
what a coincidence.

116
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,180
I made some flower tea.

You don't like tea?

121
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,820
I made other dishes as well.

122
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,420
Would you like to go back with me

123
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,220
and try them out?

Early this morning,

129
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,660
I sent soup noodle to my lord,

130
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,660
but he didn't eat it.

131
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,060
Now, you too refuse to drink my tea.

132
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,580
Did I do something wrong?

133
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,660
So this is what you want to ask.

134
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,220
My lord just doesn't want you to overwork yourself.

135
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,050
I knew it he cares about me.

136
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,570
Miss Jiang,

137
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,860
a noble lady like you

138
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,780
should rest more.

139
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,660
He cares about you a lot,

140
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,220
so don't make him worry.

141

Miss Jiang,

142
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,060
you told me last time...

143
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,620
if I have any questions, I can ask you.

144
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,260
Does it still count?

145
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,700
What's your question?

146
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:37,180
Miss Jiang has been with my lord for a long time.

147
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,619
You must know him well!

148
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:41,379
What are some of his

149
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,580
daily likes?

150
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,740
Normally...

151
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,420
other than eating soup noodles and drinking flower tea,

152
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,100
he also likes to drink liquor.

153
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,500
Very much.

154
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,900
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

155
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,540
Miss.

156
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,740
Miss Jiang is so nice.

157
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,620
She told you everything

158
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,900
once you asked her.

159
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,660
But,

160
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,620
does my lord really like drinking?

161
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,340
I've never seen him drinking

162
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,810
even once since I came here.

163
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,930
Are you stupid?

164
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,980
Judging from Miss Jiang's personality,

165
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,620
she must be telling us the opposite.

166
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
I guess

167
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,580
my lord can't really drink.

168
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,540

Today is not my birthday, right?

Besides,

182

Today is the 100th day of our wedding.

It's comfortable when you hold on to it daily too.

I sometimes couldn't find a pot.

215
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,580
Then I put the raw meat on stones

216
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
and roast them with fire.

217

227

My lord,

243
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,740
you can't eat the meat like this.

244
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,420

00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,890
A secret letter?

350
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,620
It looks very important.

351
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,020
If I give it to Lord Xian,

352
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,140
will it calm him down?

353
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,300
Can this save my dad's life for the time being?

354
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,820
But if it's important,

355
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,700
would Lord Qiansui be angry?

356
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,380
Forget it!

357
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,820
It's a life or death situation.

358
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,940
He will understand.

00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,540
I didn't expect Miss Chen

362
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,580
to be a spy of Lord Xian.

363
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,700
It seems that on the day of the body examination,

364
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,180
they already colluded

365
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
to set you up.

366
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,220
You've been plotting from the beginning to the end?

367
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,860
Do you have any sincerity at all?

From what I see...

don't hesitate, my lord.

what on earth

is Miss Chen up to?

Why did she go back?

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
For my conscience,
