4
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,940
Miss.

5
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,580
Miss.

6
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,180
Miss!

7
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,180
Have you figured it out yet?

8
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,490
Nobody comes here

9
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,100
except businessmen passing by.

10
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,180
How can I manage it?

11
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,180
Miss,

12
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,060
how about telling Lord Bai about this?

13
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,380
He must know what to do.

14
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,460
No.

15
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,300
We agreed to keep a distance

16
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,620
and calm down for a while.

17
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,620
Besides,

18
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,610
I'm the owner of the shop now.

19
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,660
I have to

20
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,020
solve problems on my own.

21
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,700
I'll help you, Miss.

22
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,100
OK.

23
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,450
What makes you here?

24
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,420
A gift for you.

25
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,460
A gift?

26
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,500
Did Lord Xian find out that my father didn't die?

27
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,420
The shop is reopened.

28
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,460
Your Highness sent me a gift for that.

29
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm flattered.

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
So I come to express my gratitude in person.

31
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,580
Chen Youyou.

32
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,220
Why did you move out of Bai's Mansion?

33
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,300
Your Highness,

34
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,180
the castellan entrusted the Fortune Shop to me.

35
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,660
I can't be distracted.

36
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,060
If I violate his trust,

37
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,860
I will be punished.

38
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,180
Please forgive me.

39
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,820
In the future,

40
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,700
I can't

41
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,220
spy on Bai Li for you anymore.

42
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,529
Spy on him?

43
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,820
When did I ask you to spy on Bai Li?

44
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,660
What does he mean?

45
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,660
Then...

46
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,380
Why did you send me apples?

47
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,180
Stupid.

48
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,820
You failed to understand my intentions.

49
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,780
This is you.

50
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,380
And this is Bai Li.

51
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,940
Two hearts are linked together.

52
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,380
This is my wish for your love.

53
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,220
What kind of wish it is?

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,450
It's more like a threat.

55
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,060
Now that you and Bai Li are married,

56
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,780
you should love each other.

57
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,420
Stay away from other men.

58
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,380
Especially Wen.

59
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,420
Your Highness, you misunderstood.

60
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,260
His Royal Highness helped me

61
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,660
because he has compassion for me.

62
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,900
He also deigned to be friends with me.

63
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,140
I'm very grateful.

64
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,180
I dare not think anything else.

65
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,530
You are a smart girl.

66
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,540
You should know what to do.

67
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,380
This time,

68
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,340
you should hurt his heart.

69
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,660
I smell smoke.

70
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,859
Is this Lord Bai?

71
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,380
He is cooking?

72
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,300
I guess he wants to burn down my house.

73
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,859
Lord Bai said,

74
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,140
"A good breakfast

75
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,500
makes you happy all day long."

76
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,300
So he got up early to tear down your house,

77
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,100
no, to cook you breakfast.

78
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,940
Retreat!

79
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,900
Turn back.

80
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,700
Run!

81
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,540
Go.

82
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,980
This is...

83
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,380
Glutinous rice cake with yams.

84
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,890
Yams?

85
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,980
Do yams look like that?

86
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,580
I guess you want to burn down my house

87
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,580
so that I can move back.

88
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,820
That sounds like a good idea.

89
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,140
How dare you?

90
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,500
Have a taste.

91
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,740
It tastes good.

92
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,900
Here.

93
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,060
Open your mouth.

94
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,020
Bai Li?

95
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,380
How dare you!

96
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,740
You ruined my garden!

97
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,420
Your Royal Highness,

98
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,700
I have rhinitis.

99
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,420
The pollen makes me really uncomfortable.

100
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,540
It's better to plant vegetables here.

101
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,060
I got the flowers for Youyou,

102
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,540
not for you!

103
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,980
Nobody lets you stay here all day.

104
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,620
You come here every day too.

105
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,380
She and I...

106
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,980
You are divorced.

107
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,620
Bai Li,

108
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,540
you are in a position of influence.

109
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,100
But you trespass everyday.

110
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,500
How disgraceful!

111
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,100
You know the relationship between me and Youyou,

112
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,660
but interfered again and again.

113
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,980
That's improper.

114
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,460
I'm single.

115
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:34,540
So is Youyou.

116
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,060
Why can't I see her?

117
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,260
Not only will I come to visit her,

118
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,580
I'll take good care of her,

119
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,140
way better than you do.

120
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,380
Let's see

121
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,620
whether she will accept your kindness.

122
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,300
Youyou is the one

123
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,700
who makes the decision.

124
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,850
It's none of your business.

125
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,420
Plant the flowers back!

126
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:55,050
Go away.

127
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,420
What's all the fuss about?

128
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,180
Stop!

129
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,100
Stop!

130
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,180
What are you arguing about?

131
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,780
Youyou,

132
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,020
the kitten is fierce.

133
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,300
I think you'd better

134
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,380
stop sharing the room with it.

135
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,980
I made a cat nest for you.

136
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,700
The kitten

137
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,500
has run away.

138
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,660
Maybe because I've been too busy lately

139
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,100
and neglected it.

140
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,420
That's good.

141
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,060
I hope it can be adopted by a nice family.

142
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,900
Yes.

143
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,180
It's a pity that my handmade cat nest

144
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,980
and cat food are useless now.

145
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,660
It doesn't matter.

146
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,739
Just put them here.

147
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,460
Maybe one day

148
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,620
the kitten will come back by itself.

149
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,460
Right?

150
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,380
You said you need to buy something new

151
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,180
for the kitchen, didn't you?

152
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,780
Let's go.

153
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,500
I'll take you to the market.

154
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,020
I...

155
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,380
Lord.

156
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:54,860
Miss.

157
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,340
Youyou.

158
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,780
Miss!

159
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,700
Go away.

160
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,020
Miss.

161
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,380
Miss.

162
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,420
This bowl is plain.

163
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,380
It suits you well.

164
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,700
Youyou, it's too old-fashioned.

165
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,580
It doesn't suit you.

166
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,220
You have a sunny disposition.

167
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,500
Bright colors suit you.

168
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,660
Gaudy.

169
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,460
Youyou.

170
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,420
This one.

171
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,260
This one!

172
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,420
Miss.

173
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,540
Miss.

174
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,140
I don't think

175
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,780
we can buy something today.

176
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,260
Your Royal Highness.

177
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,570
Lord Qiansui.

178
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,780
When I shop with you two,

all dwellers in the city are so serious!

180
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,020
Step aside. I won't buy anything.

181
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,980
I don't want to buy anything.

182

Miss.

183
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,020
Don't cry.

184
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,900
Stop crying.

185
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,300
He knows nothing.

186
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,460
Sorry for offending you, Lord Qiansui.

187
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
Please forgive him.

188
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,140
Don't cry.

189
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,860
Move.

190
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,660
I'm so sorry, Lord Qiansui.

191
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,860
Good boy.

192
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,380
Look how nice Lord Qiansui is.

193

Look at me.

194

Stop crying.

195
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,020
Take the kid back.

196
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,580
OK.

197
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,780
You always look so serious.

198
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,060
Smile more.

199
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,300
But I smiled just now.

[Gorgeous Music House]

201
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,420
You smiled...

202
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,660
I'm going back to bed.

203
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:09,900
Guys,

204
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,260

-Youyou. -Youyou.

206
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,380
Well, lord.

207

Your Royal Highness.

208

A gentleman will never

209

break into a lady's home at night.

210
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,060
It turns out that Lord Qiansui also knows

211
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,660
what a gentleman should and shouldn't do.

212

Lord,

if word gets out,

229
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,740
I'm afraid...

230
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,610
What gets out?

231
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,220
Of course it's about

232
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,860
the fact that you and Miss Chen love each other.

233
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,380
It seems that the punishment is working.

234
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,140
Lord?

235
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,260
Why didn't you enter through the front door?

236
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,820
If you want to jump over the wall,

237
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,580
why did you choose the west wall?

238
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,180
The east wall is closer, isn't it?

239
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,620
Well,

Yes.

But

243
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,020
this is not the point.

244
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
What's the point then?

245
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,500
The point is

246
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,900
you

247
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,700
didn't see

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,140
anything at all.

249
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,300
My lord,

250
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,500
you've already said

251
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,780
"Good night".

252
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,100
You've finished the tea too.

253
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,660
It's getting late.

254
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,180
When I came back,

255
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,980
it looked like

256
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,220
it might rain.

257
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,020
Right, it's going to rain.

258
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,020
Rain?

259
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,820
But His Royal Highness didn't take an umbrella.

260
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,220
I'll ask Tiao to send one.

My lord, what are you thinking?

266
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,780
His Royal Highness and I are good friends.

267
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,580
I won't let him get caught in the rain.

268
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,220

Is that so?

Well, my lord,

Shouldn't you

275
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,340
go back to rest?

You are right.

My lord,

283
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,340
there's only one bed in my room.

284
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,620
It doesn't matter.

285
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,380
We can sleep together.

I know you want to stay here tonight.

How come there are official documents?

Lord Bai embarrassed himself at Chen's home

one looked like a peacock in these clothes

When did I say that?

Last year when Fuxian City

you were in the plainest clothes. Don't you remember?

Does Lord Bai want to win the pageant again?

It doesn't look like that.

Why are you all back?

We heard that

the castellan entrusted the shop to you.

341
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,180
So we decided

to seek your help.

When we fled to Fuxian City,

we were cheated.

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,900
Wang Dachui?

527
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,740
Yes. Wang Dachui!

528
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,660
Zhang Dali.

529
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,780
What talents do you have?

530
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,100
Got it.

531
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,100
I'm Chen Dahua. Don't make a mistake.

532
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,780
What's your name?

533
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,980
Jiang Yu. Jiang Yu.

534
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,660
Zither. I can play the zither.

535
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,220
-Play the zither. -Write it down.

536
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,100
-Okay. -Write it down.

537
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
You said no one was here.

538
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,700
Well, lord.

539
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,060
Next!

540
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,820
There...

541
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,370
There was no one here.

542
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,420
One at a time.

543
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,100
Help me with this.

544
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,220
Walk on water.

545
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,860
My lord, you're here.

546
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,010
What did you say? Say it again.

547
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:26,860
So he is

548
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,130
the stunt you've found?

549
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,300
Yes.

550
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,140
No one signed up for the talent show.

551
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,140
So I asked His Royal Highness to come.

552
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,900
He is talented and is an important figure.

553
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,820
In this way,

554
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,740
everyone will follow suit.

555
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,770
My lord, what's that look for?

556
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,020
Are you unhappy again?

557
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I'm not.

558
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,380
Of course not.

559
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,060
I can tell.

560
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,580
You looked just like this at the vinegar banquet,

561
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,820
with an ice-cold face and a frown.

562
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,540
You look angry.

563
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,130
I'm not.

564
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,140
I'm not angry.

565
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,620
I was about to invite you.

566
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
After all, my lord,

567
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,660
you are the most handsome man in Fuxian City.

568
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,620
But

569
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,060
you said you don't care about those empty titles.

570
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,700
I can't force you to do this.

571
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,740
I...

572
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,100
Miss, we're short-handed.

573
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,180
I'm coming.

574
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,220
My lord, take a seat. I'd better get to work.

575
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,620
One at a time, please.

576
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,970
Wait a minute.

577
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
Thank you.

578
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,340
Miss.

579
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,930
It's his turn.

580
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,900
He is the next.

581
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,480
Don't rush.

582
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,020
-Have a seat. -You'll get your turn.

583
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,780
Who can make life decisions

584
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,170
for others through several simple words?

585
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,850
You'll certainly become

586
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,220
what you want to be.

587
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,340
Really?

588
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,180
Mother,

589
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,580
I finally met the girl I like.

590
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:05,980
You can rest assured.

591
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,010
She is really nice.
