[Fortune Shop]

179
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,600
Please go back, Second Chief.

180
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,120
The backyard is the private residence.

181
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,760
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Although this is a place for businessmen to rest,

183
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,600
it definitely isn't that simple.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
There must be something fishy.

185
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,910
We must save Miss Chen.

186
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,840
Lord,

187
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,760
I'll

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,160
turn the place upside down.

189
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,880
Sit down.

190
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,120
She is hidden in such a secret way.

191
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,680
We can't alert them.

192
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,800
OK.

193
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,080
Now let's review

194
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
the movements we just learned.

195
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
Jiuyue, show us first.

196
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,040
There is a wall in the east, and there's no door.

197
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,120
Not bad.

198
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,920
Quite good.

199
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,400
Shiyue, show us too.

200
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,720
Someone is watching in the west. We can't get out there.

201
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,280
You need more practice.

202
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,800
OK.

203
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,680
Let's learn the new movements.

204
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,800
Follow me.

205
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,270
Like this.

206
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
Siyue, you did it wrong.

207
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,680
It supposed to be like this.

208
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
There's a cliff in the north. We can't run away.

209
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,200
How is it going?

210
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Five seconds.

211
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,800
Like this.

212
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,480
Good job.

213
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,240
Then, you guys practice hard here.

214
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,590
I'll take a break outside.

215
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,000
Keep practicing.

216
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,720
Keep practicing.

217
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
One, two, three, four.

218
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,080
Five, six, seven, eight.

219
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,760
Stop!

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,240
Where are you going?

221
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,120
Third Chief,

222
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm considering

223
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,920
the safety of our Fortune Shop.

224
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,400
Look.

225
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,400
No one is watching at such an important place.

226
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm here to help guard for Mr. Huang.

227
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,240
Do you think

228
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,080
you can cozy up to my brother by this?

229
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,720
Third Chief,

230
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,400
you were being a little narrow-minded.

231
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,400
We should be broad-minded

232
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,680
and open-minded.

233
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
I treat you as my brother.

234
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,870
Don't say things like that.

235
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,640
What I did is

236
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,360
for the business of Fortune Shop.

237
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:37,960
You know...

238
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
You two!

239
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,400
Where did you go?

240
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,040
I told you to eat light food,

241
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,760
but you only ate fish and meat.

242
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,320
Guard carefully!

243
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,640
I'm going to practice the dance.

244
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,280
Relax.

245
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,720
Guard carefully!

246
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,920
Yes.

247
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,310
Please.

248
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,040
General, we count on you.

249

271
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,120
Will this

272
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,840
really work?

273
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,320
Normally,

274
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
I should

275
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,480
take the lead and go for it bravely.

276
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,840
But I...

277
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm too ugly.

278
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,120
So you have to

279
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,800
do this in person.

280
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,510
Lord, you...

281
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
Look at you.

282

Your gestures are

283
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,480
not very...

284
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,680
Not very feminine.

285
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,160
Look at me.

286
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,000
Get away!

287
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,560
OK.

Yes.

sneak out today.

299

Let go! Let go!

I left you and put you in danger.

you wanted to ask Madam De for rewards and let your father go.

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,360
To protect you,

354
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,920
I hid it from you.

355
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,230
[Don't let Lord Xian find you. I'll pick you up later.]

356
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,240
Youyou.

357
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,200
I've left Fuxian City.

358
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,040
Lord Qiansui saved me.

359
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,720
Be careful.

360
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,040
Don't let Lord Xian find you.

361
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,160
I'll pick you up later.

362
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,480
This...

363
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,400
This is my father's handwriting.

364
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,440
Is he really alive?

365
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,150
Where is he now?

366
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,830
When the trouble dies down,

367
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,000
I will take you to him.

368
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

369
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,600
You didn't give me the chance to explain.

370
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,480
Why didn't you tell me until now?

371
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,390
It hurts?

372
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,640
It doesn't hurt anymore since I've found you.

373
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,480
Youyou.

374
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,000
In the future,

375
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,880
I will tell you everything clearly.

376
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Do you know

377
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
because of you,

378
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,280
I was caught by human traffickers?

379
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,920
If I hadn't been caught by them,

380
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
I wouldn't have ended up in this shabby place.

381
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,320
There are so many

382
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,720
rats, cockroaches and bugs.

383
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,280
They are big and fat.

384
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
Every day, they are wriggling here and there.

385
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,320
I am scared.

386
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,120
All right.

387
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,480
It's all over.

388
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,360
It's my fault.

389
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,550
My lord,

390
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,840
how about we deal with him first?

391
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,640
Let's go over there.

392
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:45,720
Lord.

393
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,000
-Castellan? -Bai Li, Chen Youyou?

394
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,550
I could get in thanks to my pet bug, General.

395
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,280
I didn't expect it to be so great.

396
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,760
To die for the people of Fuxian City

397
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,360
is also considered to die without regret.

398
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,640
What about you?

399
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,000
Why are you here?

400
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,360
I'm one of the missing women.

401
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,520
So am I.

402
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,440
That's not important.

403
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,280
The point now

404
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,120
is to save other women.

405
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,840
Do you have a good idea?

406
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,640
Castellan,

407
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,880
I have a plan.

408
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,680
They didn't look

409
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,360
so beautiful before.

410
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,720
You are really good at teaching.

411
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,080
Just so so.

412
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,880
Come on, guys.

413
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,630
Our Second Chief

414
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,160
made a lot of money for us.

415
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,720
Let's toast her.

416
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,440
Come on.

417
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,120
I'm flattered.

418
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,360
It's all thanks to your strategy.

419
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,670
Let me toast you.

420
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,280
You're quite humble.

421
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,760
Cheers.

422
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,280
Where is Third Chief?

423
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,520
Isn't he here?

424
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,200
Brother,

425
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,840
don't you think

426
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,040
he has prejudice against me?

427
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,080
Although he has

428
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,040
a full beard,

429
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,280
he is

430
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,480
very narrow-minded.

431
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,560
Exactly.

432
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,840
Forget about him. Come on guys.

433
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,790
-Cheers! -Cheers.

434
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,320
Cheers.

435
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,560
Cheers.

436
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,120
Cheers.

437
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,640
Brother,

438
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,720
I think you are in a good mood today.

439
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,830
Well,

440
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,920
I have another good news to announce.

441
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,160
Let them leave for a while.

442
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,440
You can leave now.

443
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,320
Leave. Leave.

444
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:08,920
Go.

445
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,640
You may leave.

446
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,240
Brother.

447
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,070
Have more.

448
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,760
Let's eat.

449
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,920
This is the customized rouge.

450
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,200
It will be available at our Fortune Shop.

451
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,480
Limited edition. There are only ten sets.

452
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,960
Ten sets?

453
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,560
How much can we earn then?

454
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,400
Brother, let me explain to you.

455
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,440
We won't sell it at the original price.

456
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
The one who offers higher price can get it.

457
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,880
Selling to the highest bidder?

458
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,920
Once it's available in our shop,

459
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,760
the rich people will try their best to get it.

460
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,720
Isn't that...

461
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,310
A hundred thousand.

462
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,560
A million.

463
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,440
Ten million!

464
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,560
A billion!

465
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,920
We're going to make a fortune, guys!

466
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,480
Cheers.

467
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,840
Come on.

468
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,880
Drink.

469
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,760
Cheers.

470
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,000
Brother, calm down.

471
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,800
This is just the first step.

472
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,840
Wait. I still have...

473
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,070
Look at this.

474
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,720
What is this?

475
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,200
This is the future of our Fortune Shop.

476
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,480
Future?

477
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,200
Future?

478
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,800
I think our buddies

479
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,040
are not very enthusiastic.

480
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:17,760
I...

481
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,630
Come on.

482
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,920
Guys, look at our future.

483
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,990
Come on.

484
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,760
Come on.

485
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
Come on. Look.

486
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,760
Look, this

487
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,480
is our Feng Shui land.

488
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,240
Well,

489
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,560
look here guys.

490
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,960
This is the residence for Mr. Huang.

491
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,680
Why is Chen Youyou so talkative?

492
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,200
Let's build a small yard here for all of you.

493
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,680
Bai Li,

494
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,280
get me

495
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,840
a set of rouge later.

496
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,920
Let's set up a rouge workshop first.

497
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,600
A rouge workshop.

498
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,280
Here?

499
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,400
Good. Good.

500
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,200
Look here.

501
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,640
And here.

502
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,110
Let's build a big house for Mr. Huang.

503
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,680
A big house?

504
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,200
A big house.

505
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,880
Brother!

506
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,480
Brother!

507
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,520
Look over there.

508
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,240
Look over there.

509
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,670
Run!

510
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,120
Run!

511
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,480
Chase!

512
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,240
Chase!

513
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,880
Chase!

514
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,800
Stop!

515
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,680
There's one here.

516
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,040
-Chase them! -Stop!

517
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,520
Don't come over!

518
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,430
Don't come over!

519
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,240
Go after her.

520
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,440
Let me go first.

521
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,880
Let me go first. I...

522
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,720
Are you alright?

523
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,120
Stop! Stop!

524
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,360
Leave me alone.

525
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,640
Don't chase me.

526
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,080
Go away!

527
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,040
Over there!
