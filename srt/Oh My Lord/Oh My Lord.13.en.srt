Youyou.

Chen Youyou!

388
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,800
My lord.

389
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,680
Where did Youyou go?

390
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,760
My lord,

391
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,680
you are hurting me.

392
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,240
Youyou?

393
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,080
Isn't she in Bai's Mansion?

394
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,600
There was something wrong with her

395
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,480
since she came out of your room last night.

396
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,880
What did you tell her?

397
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,160
We girls

398
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,920
just had some girl's talk.

399
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,670
Why would she

400
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,920
run away from home?

401
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,280
Enough!

402
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,320
Jiang Bihan，

403
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,960
you better pray for her safety.

404
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,360
My lord,

405
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,760
miss is not inside.

406
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,720
My lord, I...

407
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,400
Tiao,

408
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
this is an emergency.

409
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,430
My lord!

410
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,680
If my lord can't find Miss Chen,

411
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,560
I'm afraid the whole Fuxian City

412
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,830
will be destroyed by him.

413
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,760
Chen Youyou,

414
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,920
what are you doing?

415
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,920
My lord, you interrupted my drawing session.

416
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,400
Chuyi, Shiwu,

417
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,760
let's continue.

418
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,080
Who dares to touch her?

419
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,200
They are all my men.

420
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,880
I'm afraid they have nothing to do with you.

421
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,520
Go on.

422
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,640
Get out!

423
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,680
Don't move!

424
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,680
My lord,

425
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,630
this is my territory.

426
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,760
Who do you think you are?

427
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,480
You are mine.

428
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,360
Your place is my place.

429
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,040
I can drive away whoever I want.

430
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,440
I'm not yours!

431
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,240
Stop messing around.

432
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,030
Go on.

433
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,320
Let go of me!

434
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Let me go!

435
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,800
We were fine last night.

436
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Why did you suddenly change today?

437
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,520
What happened?

438
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm just tired of you.

439
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,150
I've found a few new boyfriends.

440
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,520
Can't you see?

441
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,000
Do you think you can drive me away with just one sentence?

442
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,280
Chen Youyou,

443
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,400
you are a clumsy liar.

444
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,840
I dare not lie to you, Lord Qiansui.

445
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,510
That's right.

446
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,400
I said I liked you before.

447
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,720
But after being with you,

448
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,630
I really feel bored.

449
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,440
My lord,

450
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,320
we are both adults.

451
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,480
Break ups should be amicable.

452
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,400
I don't like you anymore.

453
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,960
Stop bothering me from now on.

454
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,440
We once said

455
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,440
we should be honest to each other no matter what happens.

456
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,040
Now you tell me you are bored.

457
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,080
I don't believe it.

458
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,240
Do you have to make me

459
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,190
sound so harsh?

460
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,200
I was with you

461
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,360
just for fun.

462
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,720
I was good to you

463
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,480
just to save my father

464
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,840
and to get the Fortune Shop.

465
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,520
Now that I have achieved my goal,

466
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,880
I don't need to pretend anymore.

467
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,480
Now I'm always accompanied by handsome men and

468
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,880
earn tons of money every day.

469
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,470
Why not?

470
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,360
Chen Youyou,

471
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,960
this isn't you.

472
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,680
That's enough!

473
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,400
Stop being unreasonable.

474
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,480
Let's save some face

475
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,880
at the end.

476
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,160
When the house is settled,

477
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,800
you all can move in

478
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,800
and take turns to accopany me

479
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,720
every half month.

480
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,000
Go on.

481
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
When the drawings are done,

482
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,200
hand them all out.

483
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,960
Make sure everyone in the city sees it.
