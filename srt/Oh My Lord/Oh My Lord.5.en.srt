My mother died at an early age.

Since I was young,

57
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,820
I've been wandering around.

58
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,460
I always thought myself as

59
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,500
a kid without a home.

60
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,130
I didn't even know where to commemorate her.

61
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,420
Later on, I heard from an old man

62
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,220
that as long as I light a river lantern,

63
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,859
I can pray for her.

64
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,540
So,

65
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,740
I hope these river lanterns

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,540

I would not only avoid making you angry,

74
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,340

Other than dust, what else are you allergic to?

81
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,020
What spices do you use? How do you stay young?

86

88

to repay the favor.

90
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,820
Are you really just repaying the favor?

91
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
It's my turn to ask you.

92

107
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,300
don't ask all the questions and make you angry again?

Did noodles offend you?

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,690
He didn't look well

You really can't mess with him.

144

That's weird.

145

He always finished his vegetable soup noodles

149

this must have something to do with Chen Youyou.

Ever since she's here,

151
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,700
everything has changed in Bai's Mansion.

The emphasis on beauty

156

the imperial palace for the memorial of the late castellan

159
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,100
must be magnificent,

160

Do you not respect Madam De?

Madam's palace

170
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,620
is not suitable to be decorated with gold and silver.

171
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,810
First, it's too ordinary.

172
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,020
Second, the style is different from the palace.

173
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,740
I'm afraid it may be seen as a threat to the throne.

because I went to find a spiritual item, the twin lotus flowers.

176
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,020
Twin lotus flowers?

177
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,780
Also known as hibiscuses with the same heart.

It means to be together forever.

179

This imperial palace renovation is

180
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,900
for the late castellan.

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,900
it seems you just wanted to avoid punishment for being late

188
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,540
and blabbered out nonsense.

189

Don't worry, Lord Xian.

190

I'll be sure to satisfy madam.

191

It's decided then.

192

00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,260
for the renovation of the imperial palace.

Yes.

if you let me down,

197
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,620
I won't spare you.

But, the texture of this wild ginger cake

is really tender!

Really?

Let’s make something new.

208

and she is very hard to serve.

213
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,420
No one in the city dares to take on

214

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,090
Is it appropriate

222
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,260
if we act rashly now?

223
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,820
Lord Xian has provoked me many times.

224
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,060
I don't want to get involved with him.

225
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,450
However, he made Mrs. Zhao

227

347
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,220
rush for the construction.

348
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,980
I want to see Madam De.

349
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,540
Justice will be served!

350
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,340
Come on,

351
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,580
stop dreaming!

352
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,660
Why are you so harsh?

353
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,860
Now, my arm hurts.

354
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,900
We'll take you to the doctor.

355
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,940
No.

356
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,100
I'll lie down wherever I fall.

357
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
I'll wait for Madam De.

358
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,220
Go do your own work!

359
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,420
How can we work

360
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,500
if you are lying down here?

361
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,260
It’s none of my business.

362
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,660
You'll have to wait with me then.

363
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,300
Lord Qiansui is here!

364
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,420
Don't offend him.

365
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,970
The last person who disobeyed orders

366
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,700
was beaten to death in prison.

367
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,620
For Youyou, I'll do it!

368
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,970
Lord Qiansui.

369
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,940
My leg!

370
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,420
My leg!

371
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,100
My leg!

372
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,540
Well...

373
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,460
You broke this one?

374
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,690
Yeah?

375
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,660
Since it's broken,

376
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,930
it's useless.

377
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,580
I'll chop it off for you.

378
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:26,730
No!

379
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,290
No.

380
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,260
Not this leg?

381
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,820
Then, it's this one.

382
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,340
It's not completely broken.

383
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,780
I can still work.

384
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:42,980
Guys,

385
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,140
back to work.

386
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,060
Move!

387
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,260
-You should have told me earlier. -Get back to work.

388
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,340
Get back to work.

389
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,580
-Get up. -Let's go!

390
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,780
Your legs and feet are quite agile.

391
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,380
There should be no more mistakes

392
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,580
with the renovation of the imperial palace.

393
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,740
Don't worry, my lord.

394
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,300
I will keep a close eye

395
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,730
on him.

396
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,620
No,

397
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,500
Chen Youyou.

398
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,500
You can't do things that harm others!

399
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,290
I have to think of another way.

400
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,820
Then, my dad...

401
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,660
Forget it!

402
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,300
Just do it!

403
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,580
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,220
Forget it...

405
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,940
Forget it.

406
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,020
One is my dad,

407
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,140
and one is Bai Li.

408
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,940
What should I do?

409
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,940
What are you doing?

410
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,140
My lord,

411
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,340
if I say...

412
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,820
I picked the flowers to make lotus seed soup for you,

413
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,060
will you believe me?

414
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:19,820
What do you think?

415
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,660
I...

416
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,340
My lord.

417
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,580
Madam De will inspect

418
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,700
the twin lotus flowers in two hours.

419
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,820
Now the lotus is gone,

420
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,140
what should we do?

421
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,500
You...

422
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,260
It's over.

423
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,420
Now, it's all over!

424
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,780
I'm sorry...

425
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,620
I didn't mean it.
