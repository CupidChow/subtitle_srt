00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,420
We didn't know each other before.

6
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,180
Why are you looking for me?

7
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,900
I saw you yesterday

8
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,180
in my dream.

9
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,620
I drew a picture of you according to my memory.

10
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,620
I miss you so much.

11
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,300
We are destined to be together, like phoenixes.

12
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,540
I will show you my sincerity

13
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,540
with my painting.

14
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,740
I'm willing to

15
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,820
spend my whole life with you.

16
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
You visit me at midnight.

17
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,460
It must be a dream.

18
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,820
My dear,

19
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,820
I know you miss me

20
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,300
for not seeing me for ages.

21
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,850
That's why I'm here, meeting you in your dream.

22
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,700
I promised you once

23
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,260
I would give you a gown as the anniversary gift

24
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,220
every ten years.

25
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:03,900
Now,

26
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,540
it's the second decade.

27
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,820
Having you as my husband,

28
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
I am too content to expect more.

29
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,980
Unfortunately,

30
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,930
you and I now

31
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,940
are separated forever by death.

32
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,460
This gown will only

33
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,380
make me more lonely.

34
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,660
Don't be sad, my dear.

35
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,900
As the saying goes, if the love is deep enough,

36
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,690
the living one would be like dead,

37
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,370
and the dead one could also be alive.

38
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,020
I will live in your heart.

39
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,620
If you are unhappy,

40
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,220
I'll feel very depressed too.

41
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
This golden silk wide-sleeved fairy gown with mandarin ducks

42
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,250
is my second anniversary gift for you.

43
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,020
I hope no matter where I am,

44
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,540
we could be like these two mandarin ducks.

45
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,780
Either in the heaven or on the earth,

46
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,060
we will never be parted.

47
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,900
I didn't expect

48
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,900
after all these years,

49
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,859
there's still someone who can remember our love.

50
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,940
Madam De,

51
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,900
the former castellan loved you deeply.

52
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,900
I believe no matter how long it passes,

53
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,859
there will always be someone touched by your love.

54
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,340
Chen Youyou,

55
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,420
this gown

56
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,860
is indeed what I want.

57
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,450
But now,

58
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,540
I don't deserve it anymore.

59
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,060
Don't underestimate yourself.

60
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,340
May I ask you a question?

61
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,100
If the former castellan was still alive,

62
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,700
but he wasn't handsome anymore.

63
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,580
Madam, would you still love him?

64
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,860
Of course I would.

65
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,380
So if you really love someone,

66
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,900
no matter how your figure and appearance change,

67
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,860
love between you will still be eternal.

68
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,420
That's true.

69
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:47,260
Please try the gown on

70
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,460
and see if it fits.

71
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,420
Fine.

72
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,260
Chen Youyou,

73
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,940
I'm very satisfied

74
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,700
with this gown.

75
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,100
Tell me.

76
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,580
You eavesdropped outside my room before,

77
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,900
and tried everything to please me.

78
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,100
You must want to ask for a reward, right?

79
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,970
Madam,

80
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,900
I have been alone since I was young.

81
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,010
I used to earn my living

82
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,660
by working hard with others.

83
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,010
Hence I don't want others to suffer the same way as I did.

84
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,700
On the way here,

85
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,380
I felt sorry for the workers on the construction site.

86
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,060
So,

87
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,180
I'd like to ask for a reward

88
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,260
for the workers from you.

89
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,340
If you can...

90
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,020
Madam De,

91
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,940
I have always wanted to report something

92
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,180
about the reconstruction of the palace.

93
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,500
I didn't expect

94
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
to think of the same with Youyou.

95
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,740
May I ask for your approval

96
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,540
to let the chefs

97
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,060
cook some fine food for the craftsmen?

98
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,450
You...

99
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,380
Madam, I didn't mean that.

100
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,180
Please give them

101
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,540
another two hours' left.

102
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,860
It's my fault not making it precise.

103
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,380
No problem.

104
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,380
Both of you

105
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,580
are kindhearted.

106
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,540
I'm very happy about that.

107
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,050
It's all approved.

OK, Bai.

109
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,300
You are in charge of

110

this matter.

What reason?

128
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,820
I know.

129
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,540

As long as Madam De promised,

I could definitely save my father.

Chen Youyou, you still have a chance.

Calm down.

156
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,860
Do you have...

157

anything to tell me?

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,020
No.

If anything happens to you,

161

you can tell me directly.

How about

163

I tell him directly?

maybe he can save my dad.

How could he be so kind?

167
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,900
If he knows I'm the spy of Lord Xian,

168
