There it is.

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,420
Really?

7
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,020
Let's have a look inside.

8
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,700
This place is good.

9
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,100
Have a taste, guys.

10
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,380
Come on.

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,100
Have a try.

12
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,450
It smells so good.

13
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,180
Is it good?

14
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,380
It looks good.

15
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,860
Is it good?

16
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,260
How does it taste?

17
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,620
-Your Highness. -Great!

18
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,500
I didn't expect that His Highness would come too.

19
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,380
Ms. Chen is so capable.

20
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,540
She invited His Royal Highness, Lord Xian

21
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,340
and Madam De. And they all came.

22
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,500
We came to the right place today.

23
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,180
Everyone in Fuxian City loves beauty

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,460
and praises beauty.

25
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:53,060
I believe all guests here

26
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,300
are expecting surprises.

27
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:57,620
The talent show at the Fortune Shop today

28
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,530
will show you something different.

29
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,260
As you know,

30
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,260
an accident happened here several days ago.

31
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,620
The tears of fear were terrifying to everyone.

32
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,100
Why would that happen?

33
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,860
Because your pursuit for beauty has gone crazy

34
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,660
and is beyond your control now.

35
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,540
And you forget that

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,860
the most important thing is to follow your heart.

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,860
So today, we're not here to appreciate beauty,

38
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,020
nor will we criticize ugliness.

39
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,140
We're here to look inside ourselves.

40
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,420
If you find the beauty out of the ordinary,

41
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,060
your visit will be worth it.

42
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,540
If you don't,

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,060
just enjoy the show.

44
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,980
We won't appreciate beauty?

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,140
Why not?

46
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,060
What else can we appreciate?

47
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,200
Yeah.

48
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,220
How can we not appreciate beauty?

49
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,700
Let's begin.

50
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,420
Let's welcome the first performer.

51
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,700
-Great! -Great!

52
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,820
Great!

53
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,690
Cool!

54
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,740
-Good! -Good!

55
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,090
-Great! -Great!

56
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,810
-Great! -Great!

57
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,580
Youyou.

58
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,380
Your Royal Highness.

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,300
Fortunately, you invited Madam De.

60
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,810
The Fortune Shop is reinvigorated.

61
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,650
And your contribution is essential.

62
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,460
You really are my best friend.

63
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,380
Best friend?

64
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,500
Youyou, actually, I...

65
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,980
Miss, something happened.

66
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,180
Come on!

67
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,820
What happened?

68
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,300
Miss Chen,

69
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,060
you treat us so well.

70
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,220
But we...

71
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,540
We're useless.

72
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,740
It doesn't matter.

73
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
There will always be a chance.

74
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,340
But Miss,

75
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,260
Madam De

76
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,660
expressly asked for the final dance.

77
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,300
If anything goes wrong,

78
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,900
we will offend her.

79
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,900
Do you have other dancers?

80
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,700
I'll report to aunt now.

81
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,540
No.

82
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,980
If we cancel it now,

83
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,930
how can we win people's trust?

84
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,660
But what should we do?

85
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,370
I'll dance.

86
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,700
-Good! -Great!

87
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,060
It's amazing.

88
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,820
The Fortune Shop has been reorganized.

89
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,700
The castellan entrusted the shop to Chen Youyou.

90
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,620
That's why we got the chance to watch the magnificent show.

91
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,300
Fuxian City is full of capable, talented men.

92
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,580
The show really opened my eyes.

93
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,900
I'd like to take this opportunity

94
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,540
to make an announcement.

95
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,740
I'll restart the selection

96
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,180
of the most beautiful woman in Fuxian City.

97
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,180
The most beautiful woman?

98
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,020
But

99
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,180
appearance won't be the only standard.

100
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,420
One's morality and talents

101
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,500
will also be considered.

102
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,500
Great!

103
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,980
Nice.

104
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,010
The former castellan loved music.

105
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,180
He used to learn dancing with me.

106
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,580
The one we practiced most

107
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,340
was the double Zhezhi dance.

108
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,580
Come as flying swallows,

109
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,740
go as elegant swans.

110
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,130
Today,

111
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,980
the double Zhezhi dance

112
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,940
will mark the end of the show.

113
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,500
-Great! -Great!

114
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,700
My lord, why are you here?

115
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,380
You can only dance with me.

116
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,180
-Great! -Great!

117
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,220
Good job!

118
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,620
-Great! -Great!

119
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,260
Good job!

120
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,060
That's great.

121
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,900
-Great! -Great!

122
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,020
Look.

123
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,300
That's a good idea.

124
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,820
-It's special. -Yes.

125
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,740
My lord, hurry up.

126
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,340
It's time to celebrate. We are waiting for you.

127
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,540
I'm coming.

128
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,300
Your Royal Highness?

129
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,300
Youyou.

130
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,300
I...

131
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,050
I have something to tell you.

132
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,180
I made it special for you.

133
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,260
Wish the Fortune Shop success

134
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,900
and prosperity.

135
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,980
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

136
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,380
That's a lot!

137
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,100
Did you add wild ginger?

138
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,140
It smells fresh.

139
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,980
Youyou,

140
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,020
I like you.

141
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,540
Listen.

142
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,140
On the first day we met,

143
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,060
I decided you would be the most important person in my life.

144
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,740
When I saw you in danger,

145
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,380
I told myself

146
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,860
that I would

147
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,580
protect you forever

148
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,420
and I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.

149
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,140
Your Royal Highness, I...

150
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,580
Youyou.

151
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,140
Let me finish.

152
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,780
I thought

153
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,940
you were unhappy with Bai Li,

154
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,580
and wanted to take you away from him.

155
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,820
I wanted to find thousands of ingredients with you in nature,

156
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,940
and to try all delicious food

157
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,260
in the city.

158
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,700
In this way,

159
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,780
you could live a happy life

160
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,620
and be carefree.

161
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,820
But when I saw you holding his hands,

162
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,020
I suddenly realized...

163
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,340
Those were

164
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,100
just my dreams.

165
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,540
Your Royal Highness,

166
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,850
you are

167
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,860
the kindest person I know.

168
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,300
If you want something,

169
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,180
you will strive towards your goal.

170
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,020
When I'm with you,

171
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,980
I'm always happy.

172
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,820
Whether it was looking for ingredients,

173
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,980
or making cakes,

174
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,930
I was always happy.

175
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,660
But...

176
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,340
I only regard you

177
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,460
as my best friend.

178
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,900
Friends can make you laugh

179
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,540
and make you happy.

180
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,540
But your eyes shine

181
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,450
only when you see him.

182
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,020
Just like seeing the stars in the sky.

183
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,810
They all say

184
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,820
it doesn't matter who comes first in a relationship.

185
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,620
But I wish

186
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,860
I could meet you earlier.

187
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,620
Maybe in that case,

188
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,460
I would be the one dancing with you today.

189
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,900
Maybe...

190
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,410
I could replace him

191
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,260
and be the star you want.

192
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,820
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,020
Youyou,

194
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,450
don't say sorry.

195
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,540
As long as you're happy,

196
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,380
I'm happy.

197
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,180
Your Royal Highness,

198
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,900
thank you for caring about me.

199
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,540
I hope one day,

200
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,500
you can find your own star

201
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,180
and your own happiness.

202
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,300
All right.

203
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,780
Go back.

204
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,260
Everyone is waiting for you.

205
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,180
Go.

206
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,780
Youyou.

207
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,420
I don't want my feelings for you

208
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,140
to be your burden.

209
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,460
From now on,

210
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,740
I'll stand by you silently.

211
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,780
Want another one?

212
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,020
Actually, I'm satisfied with this one.

213
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,050
Where is Wen?

214
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,220
He was here just now.

215
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,140
When you left the Bai's Mansion that day,

216
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,420
I was afraid that he would get an opportunity.

217
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,140
So I was being hostile.

218
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,059
It was my fault.

219
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:11,819
You're admitting it?

220
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,980
You were so jealous

221
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,539
that you almost tore apart my house.

222
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,580
My lord,

223
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,420
aren't you

224
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,180
confident in yourself?

225
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,970
Seeing my beloved

226
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,460
be close to someone else,

227
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,019
how could I not be jealous?

228
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:25,620
Alright.

229
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,059
It was my fault.

230
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,019
From now on,

231
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,380
I'll trust you no matter what.

232
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,020
That would be nice.

233
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,100
What did you do?

234
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,740
Itchy.

235
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:39,900
Come here.

236
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,140
You can't catch me.

237
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,460
What did you do to my nose?

238
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,140
Well...

239
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,210
My lord,

240
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,700
don't drink tea tonight.

241
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,460
Otherwise, you can't fall asleep.

242
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,580
Okay.

243
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,820
You should be well tucked in when you sleep.

244
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,900
It has been cold at night these days.

245
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,930
Well...

246
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,860
Good night.

247
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,580
Good night.

248
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,620
I'll take you to the Fortune Shop tomorrow.

249
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,860
There's no need.

250
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,780
Won't you be on duty tomorrow?

251
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,740
Then take good care

252
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,140
of yourself.

253
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,180
You should release my hands now.

254
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,060
You first.

255
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,460
You first.

256
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,100
But I've already done it.

257
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,100
You must be hungry after waiting for so long.

258
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,620
Do you want some?

259
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,980
I'm full.

260
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,340
I'm leaving.

261
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,860
Bye.

262
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:14,980
It's...

263
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,010
My lord, my window is broken!

264
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,460
Can you fix it for me?

265
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,060
When did this happen?

266
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,700
I'll have a look.

267
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,820
-Lord, it's not a big deal. I'll... -Yeah.

268
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,540
Get lost!

269
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,980
Actually, I don't know how to fix it.

270
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,300
One doesn't want to leave,

271
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,340
and the other wants to go back with him.

272
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,490
One wants to stay,

273
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,700
and the other wants to leave.

274
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,060
Tiao, who's leaving? Who's staying?

275
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,180
What are you talking about?

276
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,220
You're so stupid. Take this.

277
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,060
The point is,

278
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,700
they

279
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,420
want to be together.

280
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,020
My lord.

281
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,500
Look.

282
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,700
This is the broken window.

283
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Look, it opens and closes so smoothly.

284
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,780
Wind will get in at night.

285
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,980
It's cold today.

286
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,620
I will catch a cold.

287
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,630
♫ Moonlight falls on your red lips ♫

288
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,060
♫ The autumn wind brings fragrance ♫

289
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,590
♫ Your beautiful hair is reflected in the pond. Memories fade ♫

290
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,850
♫ If the night breeze makes a difference ♫

291
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,490
♫ In the way you look back ♫

292
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,170
♫ Our fates are intertwined ♫

293
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,210
♫ We can't turn back ♫

294
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,850
♫ The handsome boy puts on a decent suit ♫

295
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,580
♫ Running at full speed on horseback ♫

296
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,980
♫ Sadness and happiness can't be seen ♫

297
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,080
♫ I'll hide all my worries ♫

298
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,810
♫ I'll be innocent all my life ♫

299
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,890
♫ And enjoy the colorful world ♫

300
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,990
♫ Together with you ♫

301
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,190
♫ I can wait for thousands of years ♫

302
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,980
♫ Love fills my heart ♫

303
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,040
♫ Time can't tell how bad I miss you ♫

304
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:52,860
My lord,

305
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
is the disease on your throat getting worse?

306
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,140
Why is it getting bigger?

307
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,500
Are you all right?

308
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,540
By the way, I know a doctor...

309
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,380
Youyou.

310
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,860
Actually, there's something

311
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,540
I've always wanted to tell you.

312
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,250
Youyou.

313
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,020
Do you remember the day

314
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,220
when we were in the Book Collection House?

315
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,340
You asked me why would the former castellan be murdered.

316
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,180
My lord,

317
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,220
according to the book,

318
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,340
the former castellan died young.

319
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,260
But at that time, Fuxian City was peaceful.

320
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,340
And there was no war.

321
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,820
How could he...

322
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,420
He was poisoned

323
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
by imperial physician Su.

324
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,740
Everyone knows that

325
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,580
imperial physician Su poisoned former castellan

326
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,770
and brought trouble to his whole family.

327
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,100
His entire family were executed.

328
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,820
47 people were killed.

329
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,340
The Su's Mansion was also burnt down.

330
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,220
But they don't know that

331
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,100
the real murderer

332
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,180
is still on the loose.

333
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,020
My lord,

334
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,210
why do you tell me this?

335
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,210
Because a kid named Su Wen

336
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,620
was saved by Wang Renhou,

337
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,180
the former castellan's personal eunuch.

338
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,500
He has been hiding his identity for years

339
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,420
and has pretended to be a eunuch.

340
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,540
All he wants is

341
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,180
to find out the truth someday

342
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,540
and to prove the Su family was innocent.

343
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,660
Are you

344
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,420
that kid?

345
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,140
My lord,

346
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,220
if you want to hide your identity,

347
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:01,700
I'll help you.

348
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,180
If you want to take revenge,

349
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,490
I'll be with you.

350
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,060
Anyway,

351
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,140
no matter what happens,

352
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,460
I will stay by your side.

353
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,330
I just hope

354
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,820
you can be safe and sound.

355
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,020
Youyou.

356
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,340
I'll solve these problems myself.

357
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,980
I told you the truth

358
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,780
because I want you to know

359
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
that one day,

360
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,460
I'll give you a new identity

361
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,620
and a real home.

362
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,460
I won't let you feel aggrieved

363
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,300
as a eunuch's wife.

364
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,620
I don't care about your identity at all.

365
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,500
At that time,

366
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,900
we will have

367
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,780
our own kid.

368
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,540
I didn't expect that you were keeping such a big secret.

369
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,700
I will be discreet

370
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,340
and protect you.
