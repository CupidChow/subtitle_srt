[Episode 15]

4
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,880
Once upon a time,

5
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
there was a little wild cat

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,989
who was always alone.

7
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,360
In order not to get bullied by others,

8
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,400
it sharpened

9
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,240
its claws.

10
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,760
Everyone was afraid of it.

11
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,950
But one day,

12
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,679
a girl appeared.

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,760
Although the cat was not easy to deal with,

14
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
the girl

15
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,590
treated it well.

16
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,960
She gave it the sweetest watermelon,

17
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,200
warm clothes to wear,

18
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,760
and showed it the brightest stars.

19
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,800
Her kindness

20
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
made the small cat

21
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
happy for the first time.

22
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,560
Gradually,

23
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,000
the little cat

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,080
got used to being patted

25
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,320
and hugged.

26
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,520
But one day,

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,590
it woke up

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,720
and the girl had disappeared.

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
She stole its heart.

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,120
It didn't know why.

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,920
But it knew

32
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
that without the girl,

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,990
its life

34
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,280
would be colorless.

35
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,800
So it looked for her.

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,920
Kept looking and looking.

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,040
It crossed the forest

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,480
and kept looking for her.

39
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,679
Kept looking and looking.

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
It crossed the hill,

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,760
and kept looking and looking for her.

42
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,480
[River]

43
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,280
It crossed the river.

[River]

45
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,120
Finally,

46
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,040
it found the little girl.

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,710
It told itself

48
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,440
this time,

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,480
no matter what,

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,120
it would never let her leave.

51
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,880
You stole my heart,

52
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,440
how could you leave me alone?

53
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,080
If this

54
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,440
can save your life,

55
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm willing

56
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,920
to give your heart back.

57
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,280
But I have fallen in love with you.

58
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,160
From now on,

59
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,200
my heart will only beat for you.

60
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,440
Do you remember our show for Madam De?

61
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,280
As long as we love each other,

62
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,800
life can mean death,

63
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,360
and death can mean life.

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
I would rather be dead

65
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,960
if you left me.

66
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,800
But Jiang Bihan...

67
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,440
So what if she knows?

68
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,350
I wouldn't be afraid even if I had to

69
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,240
break my bones and ruin my reputation.

70
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,270
Besides, she has left Bai's Mansion.

71
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,560
She won't bother us.

72
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,120
Youyou.

73
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,920
Since the moment I stopped being Su Wen,

74
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
my life has been full of darkness.

75
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,560
But you...

76
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
lit up my world.

77
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,840
Would you give me all of you?

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,480
No matter what hardships we encounter,

79
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,000
I will protect you

80
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,920
and our family.

81
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,400
Trust me.

82
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
I am the famous Lord Qiansui.

83
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,960
Everything can be figured out.

84
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,120
My lord,

85
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
I didn't mean it.

87
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,590
That's it?

88
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,200
You have been

89
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,320
with those pretty boys these days.

90
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,640
I felt really sad.

91
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
Stop talking.

92
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Weren't you in the room with Jiang Bihan?

93
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,880
You came back to see me?

94
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,520
If it's not you,

95
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,120
I won't lose control

96
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,640
even if I lose my life.

97
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,000
Does it hurt?

98
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,840
It hurts here.

99
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,160

100
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,360
Wait.

Come on. One, two, three.

I think I got it right this time.

00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,920
Lord looks really happy.

110
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,320
Tiao, why are you crying?

111
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,320
Retreat.

112
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,840
Don't cry.

113
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
If Lord Bai sees this,

114
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,830
I will get punished again.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,920
What's wrong?

116
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,520

117

bought...

118
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,510
She bought a yard in the northern city

119
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,190
and a house in the southern city,

120
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,520
and went back to the shop in the eastern city.

121
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,560
She...

122
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,800
What's your point?

123
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,680
It was really hard for her

124
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,070
to be this happy.

125
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,040
Yes.

126
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,680
I'm so happy.

127

It's fine, don't worry.

Call the imperial physician.

176
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,200
My lord,

177
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,960
I'm just on my period.

178
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,320
Come on. You will feel better after you drink it.

179
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,320
Hurry up. It's getting cold.

180
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,040
It's too bitter.

181
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,000
Then,

182
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,680
do you want me to feed you?

183
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,160
I envy you.

184
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,760
In the next life,

185
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,160
I also want to be a male.

186
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:05,960
OK.

187
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,560
I'll be your wife in the next life.

188
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,590
And I will

189

suffer this pain instead of you.

190
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,760
Miss Chen is usually very active.

191
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,600
Why did she suddenly get sick

192
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,360
after she got married?

193
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,000
Tiao,

194
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,720
do you know what's going on?

195
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,960

196
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,360
How would I know?

197
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,800
I've never been married.

198
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,680
Being married.

199
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,760
Not being married.

200
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,480
Got it.

201
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:43,920
Here.

202
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,640
Does it still hurt?

203
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,080
Much better.

204
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,030
But

205
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,920
if I eat something sweet,

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,880
I think I'll feel much better.

What?

211
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,440
What did you get?

212
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,120
Cakes, snacks, melons, and preserved fruits.

213
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,320
Lord instructed us

214
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,400
on the food you like.

215
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
We have them all in the kitchen.

216
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,680
And

217
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,310
iced watermelon.

218
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,760
Who asked you to prepare cold food?

219
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,280
Lord, I

220
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,680
made a mistake again?

221
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,960
Go.

222
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,680
You are here eating dog food

223
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,040
and we're going to get punished.

224

What are you doing?

226
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Get out of the way.

227
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,320
I asked the best physician in the southern city.

228
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,560
I also went to the eastern city to buy the best cinnamon from the west.

Yes.

You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

232
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,000
Anyway, this sweet soup

233

will relieve her pain.

What are they doing at this critical moment?

to go to the old place to be punished,

What's so funny?

Thank you, Your Royal Highness,

254

for bringing the Fortune Shop so many instruments.

255
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,040
I've seen the Fortune Shop

256

to get on the right track.

257

Does that mean that you're leaving?

I'll travel to all cities and learn to make new pastries.

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,000
It's inappropriate for men and women to share a room.

350
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,920
But the castellan made us husband and wife.

351
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,400
It's still inappropriate.

352
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,160
We're going to pray for blessings.

353
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Only when we put our whole hearts into it

354
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,760
will our wishes come true.

355
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,360
But

356
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,840
what if I had a nightmare tonight?

357
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,000
I have prepared

358
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,400
some soothing incenses for you.

359
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,560
Tanmen temple is really quiet.

360
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,400
You will sleep great.

361
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,480
My lord,

362
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,240
behave yourself.

363
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,840
No.

364
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,400
Tiao.

365
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,800
Don't look at what you shouldn't look at.

366
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:21,960
Yah!

My lord,

369
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,920
the supervisor in the temple

370
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,560
has arranged our rooms.

371
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,720
You should go to bed early tonight

372
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,680
and have a good sleep.

373
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,160
OK.

374
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,040
So cute.

375
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,320
My lord.

376
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,960
What's wrong?

377
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,760
Lord,

378
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,160
is there anything wrong?

379
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,350
Something feels strange.

380
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,040
I feel like I've been here before.

381
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,880
And that man,

382
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,760
I think I've seen him before.

383
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,280
I'll go check it out.

384
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,240
Don't act rashly.

385
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,760
Be careful tonight.

386
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,440
Don't worry.

387
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,320
I will do my best to protect you

388
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,960
and your wife.

389
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,720
Madam, don't worry.

390
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,560
I will protect you

391
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
against all dangers.

392
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,800
Tiao.

393
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,680
Is it because you've been spending too much time with General Gu lately?

394
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,600
You talk like him.

395
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,000
No way.

396
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,400
Let's go inside.

00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160

Buddha,

I, Chen Youyou,

401
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,920
live in Bai's Mansion in the south of Fuxian City.

402
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
I came to pay my respects.

403
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,000
I sincerely pray

404
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,040
so that Buddha can bless my husband,

405

Bai Li.

406
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,560
He helps the castellan uphold justice.

407
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,600
He does good deeds and helps people.

408
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,030
He's a good person.

409
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,760
He's also really nice to me.

410
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,360
For a long time,

411
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,440
he endured a hard life

412
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,880
full of secrets.

413
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
Finally he can settle down,

414
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,920
but is still suffering from nightmares.

415
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,520
Buddha,

416
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,440
please protect him

417
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,950
from nightmares.

418

Let me share his pain.

I'm willing to share his burden.

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,040
I just hope

422

he lives a happy and peaceful life.

please don't take it seriously.

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,040

for so many years,

432
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,200
I've been living in the darkness.

433
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,040
She is the only light in my life.

434
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,680
I just hope

435
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,760
she'll be by my side

in front of Buddha.

444

Who are you?

You're in a high position, but you're not doing your job.

451

You're disloyal.

452

You indulge in childish love and forgot your roots.

This is impious.

You broke your promise and forgot your original intention.

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,320
This is unrighteous.
