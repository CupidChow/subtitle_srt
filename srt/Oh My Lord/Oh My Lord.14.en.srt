00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,540
Where are you going?

7
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:18,900
The Fortune Shop.

8
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,540
No, you...

9
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,220
Step aside.

10
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,260
Could you not...

11
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,650
Don't go. Please don't go there.

12
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,300
Could you please not go?

13
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,980
They said you were divorced by Miss Chen.

14
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,529
They also said that a nominal couple couldn't last long.

15
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:36,460
Most importantly, they said

16
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,100
you couldn't...

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,020
But...

18
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,490
But they can.

20
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,180
What happened?

21
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,180
You promised to sell it to me.

22
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,420
Miss, the landlord suddenly said it was sold.

23
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,580
Why is there someone who has been one step ahead of me the whole time?

24
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,980
Since when the houses in the city

25
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,980
are so in demand?

26
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,700
I bought it.

27
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,860
Get out!

28
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,779
Bai Li, what are you doing?

29
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,820
What are you doing?

30
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,940
You tried to buy a house.

31
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,020
You gathered handsome guys together

32
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,700
and made people spread these paintings

33
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:30,740
and rumors

34
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,580
that I couldn't have sex.

35
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,100
Chen Youyou, you're really something.

36
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,100
Are you so eager to break up with me?

37
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,900
Or

38
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,940
you're hiding my identity on purpose?

39
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,460
You think too much of me, don't you?

40
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,140
Besides,

41
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,460
those people talk with their own mouths.

42
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,779
I don't control what they say.

43
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,060
What's more,

44
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,660
I made it quite clear last time.

45
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,810
Now I just want to have fun.

46
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,420
Can you stop bothering me?

47
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,580
But you said very clearly that night

48
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,620
you would be with me forever.

49
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,460
Youyou.

50
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,860
We said

51
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,020
we should be honest to each other no matter what happened.

52
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,580
If there was any misunderstanding, we needed to clear it up.

53
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,260
Why did you become like this?

54
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,980
Because it's not a misunderstanding at all.

55
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,500
I don't want to act as if

56
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,420
I liked you anymore.

57
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,099
If I explain in this way,

58
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,380
can you get it?

59
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,700
Chen Youyou,

60
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,540
I won't believe anything you say.

61
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,020
If you draw again,

62
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,020
I'll cut off all the painters' hands in the city.

63
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,140
If you hang out with handsome guys again,

64
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,380
I'll kill them all.

65
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,940
I am Lord Qiansui.

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,500
There's nothing I can't do.

67
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,900
What are you doing?

68
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,780
Get off of me.

69
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,940
I said I didn't like you.

70
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,260
Don't you understand what she said?

71
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,580
Youyou is with me now.

72
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,900
Stop pestering her.

73
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,340
Bai Li,

74
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,860
I'm just a swindler,

75
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,180
cheating on money and love.

76
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,620
Now I've got it,

77
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,220
so I don't need to stay here anymore.

78
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,500
I don't like you

79
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,130
at all.

80
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,500
If the love is a fake,

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,859
why do you keep it?

82
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,260
I surely have a position in your heart.

83
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,010
Both you and me know that.

84
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,620
Lord Bai is not a eunuch.

85
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,540
Deceiving the emperor

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,740
is a charge that would implicate the whole clan.

87
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,100
If I report it to the castellan...

88
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,050
You can't do that.

89
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,820
How would I do with it and whether I report it or not

90
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,930
is not up to me.

91
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,580
It's up to you.

92
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,700
Do you believe me now?

93
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,060
Youyou.

94
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,020
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

95
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,740
See what I brought you.

96
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,700
So sweet.

97
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,460
Youyou.

98
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,900
It's salty egg yolk flavor.

99
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,940
So salty.

100
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,740
Youyou.

101
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,820
If you feel sad,

102
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,380
you can talk to me.

103
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,900
If you keep all things in secret,

104
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,540
it is liable to cause misunderstanding.

105
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,810
We said

106
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,180
we should be honest to each other no matter what happened.

107
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,259
Now you tell me you are getting bored.

108
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,540
I don't buy it.

109
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,100
Youyou.

110
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,300
Whatever it is, it will pass.

111
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,060
I'm always here.

112
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,420
Bai Li.

113
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,140
I'm just a swindler,

114
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,260
cheating on money and love.

115
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,180
Now I've got it,

116
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,900
so I don't need to stay here anymore.

117
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,140
I don't like you

118
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,340
at all.

119
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,180
Chen Youyou,

120
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,980
have you ever liked me?

121
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,740
My lord.

122
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,420
What's for?

123
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,260
Since you're not on duty today,

124
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,420
I'd like to invite you to the market.

125
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,020
I'm not available.

126
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,380
My lord.

127
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,100
A few days later it will be

128
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,660
the anniversary of my parents' death.

129
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,860
I'd like to choose some oblations and sacrifices.

130
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,780
But Qingshu doesn't know anything.

131
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,340
That's why I'm here bothering you.

132
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,020
Please help me, my lord.

133
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,940
Rouge.

134
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,140
Cosmetics! All kinds of rouge!

135
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,780
-Fans. -Fancy umbrellas.

136
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,330
Beautiful umbrellas.

137
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,020
Youyou.

138
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,700
Youyou.

139
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,420
Do you think this one looks good?

140
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,020
Yes.

141
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,900
How about this?

142
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,940
It looks good.

143
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,900
Lord Qiansui is here.

144
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,340
Lord Qiansui is here.

145
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,660
Would you like to take a look at this?

146
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,850
My lord, which one is better?

147
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,020
This one or that one?

148
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,140
Whatever.

149
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,900
Why not take your lord away first?

150
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,260
Why?

151
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,740
If there is one who has to leave, it's your miss.

152
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,300
You go first.

153
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,060
No way. You go first.

154
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,740
We

155
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,330
will buy all these make-ups.

156
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,780
OK.

157
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
Buy both.

158
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,180
What does your lord mean?

159
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,260
Are you disgusting my miss?

160
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,060
It's your miss who changes her heart first.

161
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,860
She is with His Royal Highness now.

162
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,700
What do you know?

163
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,220
They are just true friends.

164
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,700
Your Lord Bai even gives Jiang Bihan a house.

165
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,090
That's for preparing room for your miss.

166
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,980
Why didn't she appreciate it?

167
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,410
She did appreciate it.

168
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,340
Obviously your lord is not faithful.

169
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,060
Youyou.

170
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,940
The snacks at home are ready.

171
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,300
Let's go back.

172
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,220
My lord.

173
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,300
Look. There's a new restaurant over there.

174
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:08,940

Since you are not used to the food outside,

179
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,340
I especially prepared

180
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,020
a home-cooked meal for you.

181
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,860
It's better to eat at home.

Yes.

as long as Chen Youyou left Bai's Mansion,

and then let me despair?

296
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,420

sooner or later,

let me tell you a joke.

Well,

316
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,940
once upon a time,

317
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,860
there was an earthworm.

318
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,250
One day, it wanted to go out for a walk.

319
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,900
Then it walked around

320
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,260
and met a crab.

321
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,740
The earthworm was hit by the crab

322
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,220
and was bounced off.

323
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,940
Then the earthworm said to the crab,

324
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,100
"You, you, you.

325
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,220
Are you blind?"("blind" sounds the same as "shrimp" in Chinese)

326
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,500
Then the crab said, "I'm not a shrimp.

327
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,620
Because I... I'm a crab."

It's so funny, isn't it?

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,180
Youyou.

348
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,700
Youyou.

349
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,140
Youyou.

350
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,410
Youyou.

351
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,420
Lord, Miss Chen is not here.

352
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,700
I've already told you she is not here.

353
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,970
Where did she go?

354
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,020
I don't know.

355
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,420
Why are you yelling at me?

356
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,450
[Fortune Shop]

357
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,820
[Fortune Shop]

358
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,140
Where did you hide Youyou?

359
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,660
You will never see her again in your life.

360
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,140
I will protect

361
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,660
the person who you didn't cherish.

362
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,140
I won't let her be with you.

363
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,580
This time,

364
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,730
I won't allow you to hurt her again.

365
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,540
What happened between us

366
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,780
has nothing to do with you.

367
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,930
Bai Li,

368
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,340
As long as Youyou says yes,

369
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,340
I will surely go far away with her.

370
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,300
But I know

371
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,820
the person she cares about

372
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,660
is always you.

373
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,940
Why do you two have to

374
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,300
suffer so much?

375
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,380
Bai Li,

376
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,740
I'll give you one last chance.

377
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,700
If you fail to live up to Youyou's expectations again,

378
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,020
I won't let you off.

379
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,810
Your Royal Highness.

380
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,340
Why do you bring me here?

381
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,140
Youyou.

382
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,780
Whenever it is,

383
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,060
as long as you look back,

384
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,100
I will always be behind you.

385
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,570
I don't deserve your kindness.

386
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
You deserve it.

387
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,780
Your Royal Highness.

388
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,970
Go.

389
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,100
Someone is waiting for you there.
