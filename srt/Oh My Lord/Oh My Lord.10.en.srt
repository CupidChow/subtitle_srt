[Episode 10]

4
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,860
It was all my fault. I was impulsive

5
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,300
and didn't trust you enough.

6
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,420
That's why you got hurt.

7
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,779
My lord,

8
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,260
you not only saved my father,

9
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,820
but also risked your life to save me.

10
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,090
I will do anything

11
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,540
to repay you

12
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,980
for your kindness.

13
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,340
My lord, you're awake.

14
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,420
Are you all right?

15
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,740
I'm fine. Get up.

16
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,779
How are you?

17
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,020
Are you hurt?

Tiao?

21
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,180
Lord.

22
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,450
Miss,

23
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,740
His Royal Highness entered the palace from the east gate.

24
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,779
He was about to

25
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:53,180
go to the backyard to see you.

26
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,420
But I'm so smart. I...

27
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,900
Tiao!

28
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,060
Get to the point.

29
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,660
The point...

30
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,140
The point is,

31
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,460
he said he was waiting for you in the vestibule.

32
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,780
He also brought a lot of snacks.

33
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,860
Really?

34
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,820
Let's go.

35
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,300
My lord,

36
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,100
what's wrong?

37
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,540
Are you okay?

38
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,660
I feel great pain all of a sudden.

39
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,770
You are in pain?

40
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,580
And I can't see clearly.

41
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,380
How come?

42
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,100
My lord,

43
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,700
Tiao said

44
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,620
His Royal Highness had been looking for me

45
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,100
when I was in trouble.

46
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,859
I should at least express my gratitude.

47
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,020
Besides, every visitor is our guest.

48
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,820
I can't be rude.

49
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,820
Am I right?

50
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,620
Fine.

51
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,900
OK, I should go now.

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:49,980
Let's go.

53
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,220
Isn't it obvious that he pretended to feel pain?

54
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,680
Shh.

55
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,940
Let's go.

56
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,860
Youyou,

57
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,180
I added some Dangshen

58
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,740
that can soothe your nerves.

59
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,130
Eat some more.

60
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,380
I'm fine now.

61
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,260
I feel better.

62
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,380
I've known about your father.

63
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,020
What?

64
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,460
It was such a big deal.

65
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,980
It's fine if you didn't tell him.

66
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,570
But how could you not tell me?

67
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,340
Youyou,

68
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,340
don't be afraid of Bai Li, the murderer.

69
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,180
I will protect you by your side.

70
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,980
Murderer?

71
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,700
You mean...

72
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,980
Actually, he was not...

73
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,780
Youyou!

74
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,500
You don't have to explain.

75
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,820
Bai Li did such a thing

76
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,380
to force you to stay with him.

77
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,010
So despicable!

78
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,420
I'm always on your side.

79
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,980
You can't say that way.

80
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,340
Youyou.

81
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,660
Because...

82
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,820
I know the pain of bereavement. It's unforgettable.

83
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,850
So don't mention it again.

84
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,860
I thought Your Royal Highness

85
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,180
came to visit us

86
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,020
because you care about us.

87
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,530
I didn't expect that you came to turn us against each other.

88
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,050
As a man, I won't deny what I've done.

89
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,900
I just don't want Youyou

90
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,700
to be forced to do

91
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,540
what she doesn't want to do.

92
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,260

93
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,500
are you unwilling to come back with me?

94
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,220
How dare you threaten her in front of me?

95
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,740
Your Royal Highness, listen to me.

96
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,980
This is not what you thought...

97
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,620
It has nothing to do with outsiders.

98
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,300
You're divorced.

99
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,820

the Fortune Shop

116

is the place where different parties communicate.

117
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,140
If we had reported it to the castellan earlier

118
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,020
and occupied this place,

119
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,460
we could have known

120

the whereabouts of Lord Wang Renhou.

121
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,460
But

122
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,940
it seems that the castellan has other plans.

It doesn't matter.

"When you look at him,

178
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,420
you feel happy.

179
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,500
When he looks at you,

180
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,940
you feel an itch inside you.

181
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,820
Anyway, you want to stay away from him at the same time."

It's not bitter.

184

It's sweet.

185
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,340
Why is my heart beating so fast?

186
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,220
Did I really fall in love with him?

187
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,300
Let me make this clear.

188
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,340
I can't aim the target

189
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,060
as accurately as Lord Bai does.

190
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,860
Do you think I can make it?

191
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,610
Yes.

No. No, you can't.

which hand you used.

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,140
What kind of a brother are you?

214

Lord Qiansui,

215
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,340
I confess. I'll tell you everything!

216
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,660
He did it!

217
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,300
With his left hand!

218
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,940
He beat her 25 times.

He beat me too.

220
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
It hurt so much.

221
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,260
He also scared her and made her cry.

222
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,570
He even wanted to bury her.

223

25 times.

224
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,140
You'll pay tenfold.

250?

226
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,300
It wasn't me, Lord Bai. It was him!

227
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,940
It was him!

228
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,660
It was him!

Your Royal Highness, why did you come to the prison?

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,500
To seek justice for Youyou.

240

Your Royal Highness, don't worry.

When it comes to justice,

Miss, should we tell the lord?

349
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,620
Or tell General Gu?

350
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,060
Don't say it.

351
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,900
I can't even find the north.

352
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,100
It's easy to find the north.

353
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,740
The lord lives in the northern room.

354
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,540
Youyou.

355
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,820
Chen Youyou!

356
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,220
Lord Bai!

357
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,580
Miss Chen and Tiao are missing.

358
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,500
Did she run away again?

359
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,940
And this time she took away Tiao.

360
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:34,230
[Fame Pavilion]

361
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,180
Great!

362
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,220
Finally, that bad woman

363
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,060
is gone.

364
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,380
Now, no one

365
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,580
can take the lord away from you.

366
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,060
Mistress, I'm sorry.

367
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,380
I made a mistake.

368
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,690
Chen Youyou is just a wild girl.

369
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,340
How can she compare with you?

370
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,260
Of course, I'm different from her.

371
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,900
She knows who she is.

372
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
She knows she doesn't deserve to live in the Bai's Palace.

373
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,620
Mistress, what shall we do next?

374
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,340
She is crazy.

375
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,890
Maybe she would pester the lord again someday.

376
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,570
We can't let our guard down.

377
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,900
Keep an eye on her.

378
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,220
Got it.

379
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,870
[Lord Xian's Palace]

380
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,860
Your highness,

381
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,540
she moved away.

382
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,980
I knew it.

383
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,490
Chen Youyou would hate the man who killed her father.

384
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,540
Then...

385
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,700
Don't worry.

386
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
No matter what happens,

387
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,820
she won't tell Bai Li about this.

388
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,740
That wouldn't do any good to her.

389
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,820
From now on,

390
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,580
we can just sit back and watch them fight.

391
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,660
By the way,

392
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,660
the beauty soup is good.

393
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,380
Bring some to Wen.

394
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,940
His Royal Highness is out.

395
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,380
Haven't we solved

396
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,580
the problems at the Fortune Shop?

397
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,340
Why does he still go out everyday?

398
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,780
He went to see Chen Youyou.

399
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,540
What?

400
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,380
Chen Youyou.

401
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,140
Miss, let me do it.

402
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,260
Give it to me.

403
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,820
Have some water and take a rest.

404
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,620
Thank you.

405
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,180
Well, I…

406
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,060
Stop.

407
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,340
Come here.

408
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:27,890
Follow me.

409
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:28,780
Go.

410
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,290
Chen Youyou,

411
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,540
why did you leave Bai's Mansion without saying a word?

412
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,780
What happened?

413
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,500
Nothing.

414
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,690
My lord, I left you a letter.

415
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,860
A letter?

416
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,100
What letter?

417
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,260
I didn't see it.

418
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,500
My lord!

419
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,300
The castellan has given me the Fortune Shop.

420
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,380
It's a mess inside the shop now.

421
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,420
I have to take care of everything.

422
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,620
So I moved here.

423
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,450
It's closer here.

424
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,180
It will be convenient to go to the shop.

425
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,620
My lord,

426
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,100
the castellan values me so much.

427
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,100
I can't let him down.

428
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,980
I have to stay focused

429
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,140
and run the shop.

430
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,380
That's it?

431
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,180
That's it.

432
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,100
What's that sound?

433
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,060
It's getting late.

434
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,780
I'm leaving for the Fortune Shop.

435
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,940
You should go back now.

436
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,340
Wait.

437
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,180
Youyou.

438
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:58,890
Youyou!

439
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,380
Why is my heart beating so fast?

440
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,820
Lord,

441
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,980
are you kicked out?

442
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,460
I have an idea

443
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,020
to make Miss Chen move back to Bai's Mansion.

444
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:30,980
Tell me.

445
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,500
Let's

446
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,860
break her windows.

447
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,340
You...

448
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,340
If you can't do that.

449
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,940
Then saw her bed.

450
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,140
How about

451
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,300
ripping her roof off?

452
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,540
Childish.

453
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,970
What if wind gets in and she feels cold?

454
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,260
No, no, no.

455
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,820
What if she catches a cold by sleeping on the floor?

456
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,340
No, no.

457
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,500
What if she gets wet in the rain?

458
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,300
No, no.

459
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,500
Tiao!

460
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,940
I forgot the ledger.

461
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,850
Childish.

462
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,500
-I'll... -Youyou!

463
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
Your Royal Highness,

464
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,020
why are you here?

465
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,420
I made some cakes

466
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,930
and didn't see you at Fortune Shop.

467
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,820
I am here to celebrate your new life.

468
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,740
A new life?

469
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,460
Youyou,

470
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,380
Why is there a hole on the roof?

471
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,340
Well,

472
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,740
actually...

473
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,780
You can't live here.

474
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,180
Youyou,

475
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,420
I have an empty house.

476
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,620
How about you move there?

477
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,180
No, no.

478
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
I'm fine living here.

479
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,540
It's okay.

480
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,860
Youyou, what are you doing?

481
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,820
Let me show you

482
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,060
how good the table is.

483
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,140
It's good, right?

484
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,300
What's that sound?

485
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,500
Well,

486
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,140
I adopted a kitten.

487
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,220
It hides in the cabinet whenever there's a stranger.

488
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,580
It's too shy.

489
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
A cat can make that sound?

490
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,500
Because it's the rutting season recently.

491
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,340
This doesn't happen quite often.

492
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,650
Did you hear it?

493
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,530
It's hiding in the cabinet?

494
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,460
I want to say hello to it.

495
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,660
There's no need.

496
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,340
The cat

497
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,820
is afraid of strangers.

498
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,100
If it meets strangers,

499
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,900
it will lose its temper.

500
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,900
Am I right?

501
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,180
Right?

502
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,660
See?

503
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,860
The cat is so hot-tempered.

504
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,900
Yes.

505
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,020
Youyou,

506
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,780
you should be careful.

507
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,060
Don't get scratched by it.

508
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,820
Don't worry.

509
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,100
It's quite gentle to me.

510
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,380
That's good.

511
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,140
Youyou,

512
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,740
I have something else to give you.

513
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,220
Come with me.

514
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,700
Youyou,

515
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,020
this is the house-warming gift for you.

516
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,260
Look,

517
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,980
the flowers are so beautiful.

518
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,740
Your Royal Highness,

519
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:24,980
this is...

520
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,620
I know.

521
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,620
If I send you other gifts,

522
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,140
you won't accept them.

523
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,980
Now that you've taken over the Fortune Shop.

524
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,140
you don't have much time to go out.

525
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:34,820
Now,

526
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,730
I move the garden here for you.

527
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,620
I hope you can be happy every time you wake up,

528
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,700
like when you were in the mountains before.

529
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,740
Just take it.

530
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,100
They are pretty.

531
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,900
Thank you.

532
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,900
Come out, kitten.

533
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,220
My lord.

534
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,940
My lord!

535
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,180
No!

536
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,180
Is the cabinet too stuffy?

537
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,090
My lord, I got something to do.

538
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,300
I must go to the Fortune Shop now.

539
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,300
Suit yourself!
