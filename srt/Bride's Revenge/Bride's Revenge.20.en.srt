[A Willing Replacement]

4
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,600
What am I thinking?

5
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,430
No matter how alike they look,
they can't be the same person.

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,350
(Young Master Tang has a complicated background.)

7
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,960
(He seems to have come to Jiangcheng)

8
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,600
(to do business with Mu Ancheng.)

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,350
(If I want to take Mu Ancheng down,)

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,230
(I can't let them form a partnership.)

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,070
I heard you got into the timber business, Mr. Mu.

12
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,150
I just started.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,510
I was lucky. I got a big order.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,280
It's a good start, I suppose.

15
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,120
But that's nothing compared

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,790
to your scale of business.

17
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,920
In Jiangcheng,
a place full of business opportunities,

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm but a newcomer.

19
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,950
You're too humble.

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,000
With your background in Shanghai,

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,430
I'm sure you'll find extraordinary success

22
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,350
in both politics and business in Jiangcheng.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,200
To be honest with you,

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,560
I've come to Jiangcheng

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,480
in search of a capable business partner

26
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,150
to develop a gold mine together.

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,760
Gold mine?

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,230
Tell me more.

29
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,400
You must let me join your venture.

30
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,760
First Young Madam!

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,640
What are you doing sneaking around over there?

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,000
I…

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,590
What are you doing?

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,630
You guys were talking.
I thought I would make you some tea.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,960
When did I tell you to make tea?

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,960
I…

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,360
This is unexpected.

38
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,910
All I did was mention
that the tea at dinner was good,

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,910
and Qinglan just brought some.

40
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,520
You're a lucky man indeed, Mr. Mu.

41
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,710
You have such a virtuous wife.

42
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,360
Yes, I am fortunate.

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,280
Master, First Young Madam was…

44
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,910
Silence.

45
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,280
You behaved poorly,

46
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,910
yelling and disturbing us.

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,680
Leave.

48
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,120
The way Tang Zifeng

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,030
defended Ye Qinglan last night

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,750
reminded me too much of Mu Anhe.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,000
I can't help but feel unsettled.

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,590
It can't be.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,430
Young Master Tang's personality

54
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,470
is completely different
from Second Young Master's.

55
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,400
One can never be too careful.

56
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,360
Here's what we'll do.

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,430
Get this done for me first.

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,310
Go on.

59
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,120
Yes.

60
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,000
Young Master Tang,

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,150
freshly baked flatbread.

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,030
Please try some.

63
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,960
Smells good.

64
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,710
I forgot to wash my hands.

65
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,430
Not bad.

66
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,750
Please enjoy, Young Master Tang.

67
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,680
Young Master Tang.

68
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,310
Is the food here to your liking?

69
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,480
You have a wonderful chef.

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,720
(Mu Anhe is severely allergic to peanuts.)

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,240
(This flatbread was made with peanut oil.)

72
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
(But he looks completely fine.)

73
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,070
(Was I being suspicious for no reason?)

74
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,750
(Is he really not Mu Anhe?)

75
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,480
Mr. Mu, join me.

76
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,310
No need.

77
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,510
I've already eaten.

78
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll take my leave now.

79
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,310
I'll let you enjoy your meal.

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,720
Be my guest.

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,830
(Thank goodness I was prepared)

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,430
(and took an allergy shot.)

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,360
(Otherwise, I would've been exposed.)

84
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,600
Yes.

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,630
As you expected,

86
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,680
Mu Ancheng's batch of timber

87
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,240
encountered a storm on the river.

88
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,600
All of them are moldy now.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,190
It's you.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,920
Why were you following me?

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
I wasn't.

92
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,270
I just saw a figure
that looked like you from the back.

93
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,830
I was curious and followed him.

94
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,040
Are you curious about me?

95
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,600
I guess you can say that.

96
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,430
I heard Mu Anhe was your first husband.

97
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,240
What?

98
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,630
Did I remind you

99
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,190
of your former love?

100
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,040
Shut your mouth!

101
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,270
Don't you dare mention his name!

102
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,190
A widowed sister-in-law

103
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,600
who couldn't wait to marry her brother-in-law.

104
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,720
What could you be after
if not the Mu Family's fortune?

105
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,000
Your reputation
is hardly pristine in Jiangcheng.

106
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,870
Don't bother pretending to be noble
and virtuous in front of me.

107
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,510
What I'm going to do

108
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,680
doesn't require anyone else's judgment.

109
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,390
What are you planning to do?

110
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,480
Nothing.

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,240
I was too agitated.

112
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,950
Sorry.

113
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,870
You won't be so lucky

114
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,310
next time.

115
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,160
What are you taking pictures for?

116
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,270
Nothing. Just reminiscing about the past.

117
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,630
You've been to this city before?

118
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,070
Where do you want to go?

119
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,870
I'm familiar with Jiangcheng.

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,560
Anywhere.

121
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,800
As long as the scenery is beautiful.

122
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,590
I know a place.

123
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,360
I'll take you there.

124
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,240
Consider it an apology.

125
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,950
The view of the sunset from here is beautiful.

126
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,950
What's wrong, Young Master Tang?

127
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,240
The bridge is still the same bridge,

128
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,830
but the people are no longer the same.

129
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,160
Enjoy the scenery.

130
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,750
I'll be going back now.

131
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,310
Wait.

132
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,080
Can I ask you

133
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,720
to be my model?

134
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
I think I'll pass.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,790
What if I say this can offset
the cost of the nightwear?

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,480
All right.

137
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,790
A model without a smile

138
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,080
isn't worth that price.

139
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,840
I think we can become friends.

140
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,320
I hope so.
