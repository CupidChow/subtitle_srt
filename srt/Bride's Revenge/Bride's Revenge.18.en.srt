00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,560
Master had too much to drink
with a supplier last night.

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,000
He hasn't woken up yet.

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,430
What's so urgent that you need to see him right now?

7
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,390
He wanted to run a timber business, didn't he?

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
I heard a major client

9
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,520
wants to place an order
for a large quantity of timber.

10
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,840
I heard it was urgent,

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,320
so I wanted to tell him right away.

12
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,960
You can tell me instead.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,710
I'll relay your message to him

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,710
once he wakes up.

15
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,870
All right.

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,480
I still need to go back
to take care of my father, after all.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,510
The order is from Mr. Jin.

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,950
I heard it's quite a significant amount.

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,870
It would be great
if we could sign the deal with them.

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,760
I heard Mr. Jin of Nancheng

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,000
needs a supply of timber urgently.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
A large amount of timber.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,590
If you can take that order,

24
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,680
maybe you'll be able

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,310
to establish a partnership with Mr. Jia.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,950
Is this news from a reliable source?

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,680
Of course.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,510
I heard the news from a friend.

29
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,070
All right.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll look into it.

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,150
If I manage to secure the deal,

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,430
you'll be rewarded for your contribution.

33

(You're still such a fool, Ye Qinglan.)

34
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,000
(There's no way
I would let you get credit for this.)

35
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,920
I didn't expect

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,920
to get

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,680
such a big order for timber so soon.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,080
An auspicious start to the business.

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
It's a good sign.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,120
With you at the helm,

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,080
the Mu Family will surely prosper.

42

If it weren't for the late madam

43
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,280
who used to get in my way,

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,470
this family wouldn't have gone

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,360
into decline now.

46
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,400
The son

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
of the richest man in Shanghai, Mr. Tang,
has recently come to Jiangcheng.

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,310
I heard that Young Master Tang
has strong political

49
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,080
and business connections.

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,400
He's planning to do a big business in Jiangcheng,

51
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,430
and he's currently looking for partners.

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,030
Where is he staying now?

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,910
Send an invitation to him immediately.

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
I want to meet him.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,430
Rumor has it

56
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,560
that he has an odd temper.

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,030
He is very picky.

58
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,430
He tried out all the inns in Jiangcheng.

59
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,000
None of them could satisfy him.

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,960
I heard he is looking

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,910
to rent his own residence now.

62
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,150
This is a good opportunity for us.

63
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,560
He won't find

64
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,120
a more magnificent residence

65
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,430
than the Mu's Residence in all of Jiangcheng.

66

Tell Wang to advise Mu Ancheng

to take the water route

Not at all.

This is the Third Young Master

Tang Zifeng.

He is an important guest of mine.

He has come to Jiangcheng

in search of a business partner.

93
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,070
He'll be staying in our residence for now.

Make sure that he has a comfortable stay.

my younger brother very much.

That's why everyone was confused for a moment.

101

Please don't take it to heart.

are you not going to give me a tour

around your grand residence?

106
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,430
Of course.

Sorry, Madam.

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,430
I was repairing the wall.

115
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:02,950
I didn't notice you.

I'm so sorry.

Never mind.

118
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,560
I'll just wash it off.

119
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,510
What?

120
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,720

Please give me more time.

It will be fixed soon,

please use another bath elsewhere.
