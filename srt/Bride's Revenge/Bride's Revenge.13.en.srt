[Don't Expect Me To Be Merciful
If You Betrayed Me]

4
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,900
Seek justice from the person who wronged you.

5
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,820
Don't come to me.

6
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,420
Don't come to me.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,340
Why are you here?

8
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,980
That's my question.

9
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,540
What's in the water
that made you act so strangely?

10
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,140
First Young Madam!

11
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,780
First Young Madam!

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,820
First Young Madam!

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,860
First Young Madam!

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,420
Are you all right?

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,380
You came at the right time.

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,820
I just dropped my heirloom hairpin
into the water.

17
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,180
Find it quickly.

18
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,860
Mother,

19
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,380
my hairpin fell into the pond in the backyard.

20
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,420
I had them retrieve it for me,

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,540
but we found something odd instead.

22
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,940
Mr. Hai, show it to my mother.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,740
Madam.

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,780
It's a gun.

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,260
This is

26
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,460
Anhe's gun.

27
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,020
I gave it to him

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,460
for his birthday last year.

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,300
I gave this to him so he could protect himself.

30
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,460
There were gunshot wounds on Anhe's body.

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,580
Could they have been caused by this gun?

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,860
But…

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,380
Why would this be in the residence's pond?

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,660
Could it have

35
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,660
something to do with Anhe's death?

36
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,420
But why is Ancheng's name on this?

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,460
Ancheng!

38
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,940
What exactly is going on?

39
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,620
Who in this residence dares

40
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,740
to use

41
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,580
such a despicable way

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,540
to curse me?

43
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,300
Curse you?

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,300
That's right, Mother.

45
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,780
Ancheng has been plagued by nightmares lately.

46
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,500
Qingqing even got a protection charm

47
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,100
from a master for him.

48
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,540
Who is cursing you?

49
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,340
Mother.

50
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,380
I happened to see

51
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,580
Zhixia

52
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,900
at the pond.

53
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,780
It's not me!

54
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,460
It's not me!

55
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,740
I was just feeding the fish by the pond.

56
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,660
I didn't do

57
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,700
anything else!

58
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,980
You again?

59
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,060
Are you telling the truth?

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,660
Yes, I swear.

61
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,540
I only have what I have today

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,580
because of First Young Master's love.

63
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,420
Why would I harm him?

64
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,060
First Young Master,

65
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,980
I've always been loyal to you.

66
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,500
You know that.

67
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,860
(How dare you threaten me.)

68
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,340
Mother,

69
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,700
Zhixia is my concubine.

70
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,140
If she really wanted to harm me,

71
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,340
she had plenty of opportunities.

72
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,580
There's no need for her to resort to this.

73
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,780
This matter

74
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,380
concerns two of the Mu Family's young masters.

75
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,140
It is suspicious indeed.

76
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,140
Investigate this.

77
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,260
Get to the bottom of this!

78
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,340
Yes.

79
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,820
How dare you try to harm me!

80
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,580
I could say the same thing.

81
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,500
You're the one
who transferred the resentment to me first.

82
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,300
You owe everything you have to me!

83
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,100
All I needed was for you to endure this for me.

84
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,220
Yet you're not even willing to do this for me.

85
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,460
Don't forget

86
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,740
who gave you the comfortable life you have now!

87
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,020
I was just scared

88
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,660
and made a foolish mistake.

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,060
Didn't you say

90
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,460
you already got rid of that gun?

91
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,100
I did throw it into the pond,

92
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,340
but I thought

93
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,020
we could use it to protect ourselves

94
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,180
in case of an emergency,

95
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,300
so I didn't get rid of it for good.

96
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,940
From now on,

97
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,620
if you act without my permission again,

98
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,820
don't blame me for being ruthless!

99
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,260
Don't you think something's off

100
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,220
with what happened today?

101
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,340
Why would Ye Qinglan

102
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,980
happen to be at the pond?

103
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,220
And why did she just happen

104
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,900
to drop her hairpin into the water?

105
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,340
You mean

106
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,540
Ye Qinglan is behind all of this?

107
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,260
At the very least,

108
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,820
she was definitely adding fuel to the fire today.

109
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,700
Could it be

110
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,140
that she suspects foul play in Anhe's death?

111
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,740
Don't tell me

112
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,260
she suspects us?

113
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,300
I can't be certain.

114
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,620
But

115
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,740
you can test her.

116
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,940
(She hasn't let you touch her)

117
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
(since marrying you.)

118
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,500
(If a woman won't even let you have her body,)

119
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,300
(it's obvious)

120
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,700
(that her heart isn't with you.)

121
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,820
Ancheng,

122
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,340
why did you have so much to drink?

123
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,020
(I'll find out)

124
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,260
(whether you're loyal to me.)

125
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:11,900
Ancheng!

126
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,860
What are you doing?

127
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,540
Let me go!

128
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,180
What do you want?

129
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,860
Ancheng!

130
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,820
Lan,

131
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,620
I want us to become true husband and wife.

132
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,140
Go away!

133
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,300
Go away!

134
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,220
Don't touch me!

135
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,940
What's wrong?

136
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,580
Get away from me!

137
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,980
Are you still

138
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,540
unable to forget Anhe?

139
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,300
No!

140
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,620
He only has my gratitude.

141
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,460
But it looks like

142
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,340
you still can't let him go yet.

143
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,140
I…

144
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,220
I didn't intentionally

145
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,500
want to bring him up yesterday.

146
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,540
I just wanted

147
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,180
to punish Zhixia.

148
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,380
Why would you

149
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,980
want to punish her?

150
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,140
You've been spending a lot of time with her

151
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,420
ever since you married her.

152
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,180
I didn't like that,

153
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,500
so I…

154
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,180
So you were jealous, Lan.

155
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,260
But you always push me away.

156
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,460
The more I reject you,

157
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,900
the more afraid I am.

158
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,420
What happened that night

159
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,900
is a nightmare that won't leave me alone…

160
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,660
I'm just afraid that you'll dislike me…

161
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,300
Lan,

162
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,900
my love for you

163
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,020
can overcome everything.

164
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,860
I remember now.

165
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,020
The person who raped me that night.

166
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,100
His face...

167
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,900
What do you remember?

168
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,020
I think I saw

169
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,980
a cross-shaped scar

170
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,300
on the lower back of that man.

171
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,140
I mean the person

172
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,260
who barged into my room that night.

173
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,780
It's him.

174
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,700
So it's him.

175
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,540
What a shame.

176
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,180
He managed to escape.

177
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,220
Will he keep lurking around?

178
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,060
Is there a mastermind behind him

179
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,820
in this residence?

180
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,780
Lan.

Lan.

182
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,020
Lan.

183
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,500
Lan.

184
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,780
Do not let your thoughts run wild.

185
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,580
Rest assured.

186
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,940
I'll definitely get to the bottom of it.

187
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,260
I can't accompany you tonight.

188
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,500
Get some sleep.

189
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,020
I'll head to the study now.
