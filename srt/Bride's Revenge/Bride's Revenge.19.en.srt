Anhe?

00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,520
These tricks won't work on me.

6
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,110
Get out.

7
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,640
You're not Anhe.

8
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,240
Who are you then?

9
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,480
Close your eyes and get out!

You…

12
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,920
My patience is limited.

Get out of here.

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,040
My nightwear is imported from France.

All right.

Do you want the money or not?

26
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,560
Fine.

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,560
The customer is always right.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,710

Why ask so many questions?

I heard you don't like tea.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,310
I brought some coffee just for you.

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,190
Mr. Mu.

36
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,400
You didn't have to do this.

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,080
Don't mention it.

38
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,520
I can't skimp on hospitality.

39
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,240
Thank you.

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,310
What's that sound?

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,310
Nothing.

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,910
I found a wild cat in your yard.

43
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,800
It's feisty.

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,400
I'll have them catch it right away.

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,430
I wouldn't want it to disturb your rest.

46
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,910
No need.

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,280
I find it interesting.

48
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,710
As long as you like it.

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,310
My younger brother used to live in this yard.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,030
It has been vacant for a while.

51
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,800
If there's anything you need at all,

52
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,030
don't hesitate to tell me.

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,190
No need for the trouble.

54
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,360
I like this place.

55
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,240
I'll take it. I'll pay you double the rent.

56
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,470
Oh, Young Master Tang,

57
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,190
that's not necessary.

58
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,520
You're so fond of this place

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,000
and you remind me so much of my younger brother.

60
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,910
It must be fate.

61
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,960
It seems

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
that you guys were close.

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,030
Yes, you're right.

64
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,960
Master.

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
This is a change of clothes
First Young Madam asked me to bring.

66
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,470
Where should I leave it?

67
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,080
Why would she be here?

68
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,630
Did you come to the wrong place?

69
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,240
I heard First Young Madam was bathing here

70
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,150
and wanted me to bring her a change of clothes.

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,870
Mr. Mu, why don't you find out for yourself

72
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,470
if your wife is here?

73
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,520
That's not necessary.

74
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,870
She can't be here.

75
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,400
How dare you barge in

76
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
and disturb our esteemed guest!

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,520
Leave!

78
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,520
Yes.

79
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,710
My apologies.

80
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,470
I didn't know

81
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,590
our guest was staying in this room

82
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
and almost took a bath here.

83
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,030
I noticed a stranger's belongings

84
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,080
and left in a hurry.

85
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,030
I didn't mean to disturb our guest.

86
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,270
You…

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,630
This is

88
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,190
a new friend of mine from Shanghai.

89
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,160
Young Master Tang, Tang Zifeng.

90
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,310
Doesn't he look just like Anhe?

91
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,630
Mr. Mu, who is this?

92
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,510
This is

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
my wife,

94
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,190
Ye Qinglan.

95
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,510
Greetings, Young Master Tang.

96
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,190
How about this?

97
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,600
I'll prepare some liquor

98
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,950
as an apology

99
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,920
for the inconvenience earlier.

100
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,120
Here,

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,720
Young Master Tang.

102
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,190
Thank you.

103
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,160
You can hold your liquor well, Young Master Tang.

104
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,950
Not as good as you, Mr. Mu.

105
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,870
Bottoms up.

106
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,390
(His behavior
is completely different from Anhe's.)

107
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,190
(Moreover, Anhe can't drink at all.)

108
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,240
You're pregnant. I'll drink that for you.

109
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,680
Oh, you.

110
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,720
You shouldn't help her
if you can't hold your liquor.

111
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,270
You'll get a rash again.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,630
Here.

113
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,720
(Mu Ancheng keeps making him drink)

114

(to test if he is Anhe.)

Mr. Mu.

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,120
A toast to you.

117
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,310
Bottoms up.

118
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,390
A toast to you, Young Master Tang.

119
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,160
Welcome to Jiangcheng.

120
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,870
All right.

121
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,830
Thank you.

122
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,560
You can hold your liquor very well, Qinglan.

123
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,160
It's rude for you
to call a married woman by her given name.

124
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
Was that

125
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,510
rude of me?

126
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,680
Not at all.

127
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,510
Not at all.

128
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
Young Master Tang used to study abroad.

129
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,600
He is more open-minded.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,680
Now that he has returned to his home country,

131
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
it would be better for him
to learn Chinese etiquette.

132
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,800
All right.

133
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,160
You can teach me.

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,950
How about this?

135
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,390
I can pay you for the lessons.

136
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
This is my offer.

137
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,040
100 taels.

138
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,680
All right.

139
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,120
Deal.

140
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,180
You don't know this, Young Master Tang.

141
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,300
My wife

142
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,100
knows her way around business too.

143
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,420
I've been made aware of it.

144
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,860
Mr. Mu,

145
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,820
speaking of business,

146
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,220
I've come to Jiangcheng to…

147
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,780
Let's not talk about that. Let's eat first.

148
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,380
We'll discuss that in detail later.

149
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,700
Here.

150
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,660
Here.

151
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,980
How did it go?

152
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,580
Did you learn anything?

153
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,860
Is he Mu Anhe?

154
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,420
I don't think so.

155
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,140
Can there really be

156
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,860
two people who look so alike in this world?

157
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,820
Anything can exist in this vast world.

158
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,020
I tested him several times.

159
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,180
He is completely different from Mu Anhe.

160
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,260
Mu Anhe got drunk
from the smallest sip of liquor.

161
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,580
But he can hold his liquor very well.

162
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,220
And judging from his interactions
with Ye Qinglan,

163
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,580
she can't stand him,

164
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,540
and he doesn't care about her either.

165
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,300
But whenever I see his face,

166
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,660
I get goosebumps.

167
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,820
I…

168
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,660
What's there to be afraid of?

169
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,100
This man

170
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,100
is going to lead us to great wealth.
