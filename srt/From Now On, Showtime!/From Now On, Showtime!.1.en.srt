It's a survival competition with several magicians.

328
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:08,884
You're late.

Webflix,

332
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:22,264
and many more.

333
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:27,634
These are business cards I received from producers today.

334
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,240
And yours...

335
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:35,184
I'll return it.

336
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,613
Bye then.

337
00:24:38,254 --> 00:24:41,683
Mr. Cha, our show is different from the others.

338
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:43,484
How so?

339
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:46,693
We're miles more desperate than them.

340
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,694
What are you doing, sir?

341
00:24:52,694 --> 00:24:55,403
Hurry up and get on your knees.

342
00:24:55,403 --> 00:24:59,803
Others are holiday special episodes or simple guest star appearances, but our show specializes in magic.

343
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:03,504
You'll be on it every week.

344
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:07,313
I'm not that cheap to appear as a regular anymore.

345
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:11,014
As you know, I'm on another level.

346
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:13,454
Right, another level. We'll comply with your needs.

347
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:17,383
I'll pay as much as you ask, even if the company goes bankrupt.

348
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,833
Lee Eungyeol and Cha Chawoong, the rivals of the century.

349
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:24,863
Please reconsider it.

350
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:28,993
Did Lee Eungyeol agree to be on the show?

351
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:34,903
Gosh, then I can't possibly turn it down.

352
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,573
It's a lot.

353
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:40,043
The community welfare center gave it to us.

354
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:44,784
I'm sorry for being incompetent.

355
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:47,883
I couldn't even buy you a gift for our wedding anniversary today.

356
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:49,523
Forget about it.

357
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:52,724
Raising Sarang will cost a lot, so we have to save up.

358
00:25:52,724 --> 00:25:54,694
I'm okay.

359
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:58,534
Gosh, you say such sweet words.

360
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:00,734
Sarang.

361
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:03,633
Oh, my! Look at you two love birds!

362
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:07,804
You two look so lovely!

363
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:09,644
Did you catch the mugger?

364
00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:11,714
Yes, thanks to you.

365
00:26:11,714 --> 00:26:15,173
- Your bike's tank is filled up and parked.
- Here it is.

366
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,030
That's great news.

367
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,084
This isn't mine.

368
00:26:21,153 --> 00:26:24,524
- Is that so?
- Mine has a dashcam on it.

369
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:27,054
Maybe it got switched somewhere.

370
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:29,823
That means...

371
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:33,933
I'm... I'm here to get my helmet.

372
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:35,734
You now have 1 second.

373
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:37,433
Cha Chawoong?

374
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:41,733
It probably happened at Cha Chawoong's show place. I'll be right back.

375
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,274
But will he still be there?

376
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:46,014
How about you visit his house?

377
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:48,744
Cha Chawoong, the famous magician, lives in our neighborhood.

378
00:26:48,744 --> 00:26:51,320
It's that big house beyond the playground.

[Magic Factory]

380
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:12,603
What? Who put this on the helmet?

381
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:14,303
I'm in charge of electronic equipment.

382
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:17,674
Isn't this a black box? I haven't seen it before.

383
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:19,374
A black box?

384
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:23,144
Mr. Cha, that jerk. I can't believe this.

385
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,443
What about him?

386
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:28,583
Can't you tell? He installed this to keep an eye on us.

387
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,853
Nonsense. The camera can't even catch us.

388
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:35,123
Even if it doesn't, Mr. Cha can tell if you're working or not by the things moving.

389
00:27:35,123 --> 00:27:36,594
You're right.

390
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:39,994
Then we should keep working. Let's finish before he gets here.

391
00:27:39,994 --> 00:27:43,534
Chief Nam, we're employees, not slaves.

392
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:46,974
We may be dead, but he's making us work like horses.

393
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:51,103
He gets all the glory... while we do all the hard work.

394
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:55,484
And he's got that height. Carrying him strains both my shoulders and back.

395
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:58,614
How will I get married without any stamina left?

396
00:27:58,614 --> 00:28:01,613
He's right. I'm a ghost, not MacGyver.

397
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,684
How can I open it within five seconds?

398
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,394
As a stand-in for Mr. Cha,

399
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:10,164
I have to work wearing shoe inserts, and they're as heavy as bricks.

400
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:13,593
My legs tremble and my whole body aches after the show.

401
00:28:13,593 --> 00:28:16,903
Driving ghosts hard with money. What a cruel world.

402
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,403
Darn it!

403
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:22,944
- Gosh.
- Hey. We need a labor union for ghosts.

404
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:24,704
A labor union?

405
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:29,543
Does our company need one?

406
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,753
I don't get it.

407
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:37,353
Do you think it's easy to find a boss who speaks the same language as you?

408
00:28:37,353 --> 00:28:39,693
What other companies

409
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:42,864
put a ghost's aptitude and specialty to full use like ours?

410
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:44,164
None, of course!

411
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:47,293
Plus, you only work for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week,

412
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:50,734
and I support your living family and you entering Nirvana.

413
00:28:50,734 --> 00:28:54,504
Other ghosts are dying to get into this company.

414
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:57,543
If a ghost labor union is formed, it'd be more than just that.

415
00:28:57,543 --> 00:28:59,344
It'd be a noble labor union.

416
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:00,974
You little...

417
00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:04,613
Hey, stop!

418
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:09,123
Stop chatting and wrap things up. The security company is coming soon.

419
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,823
Are you locking this place up again?

420
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:15,394
Once the shoot starts, you never know what the rivals will do.

421
00:29:15,394 --> 00:29:17,464
Our conversation and practices.

422
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,163
If it gets recorded by a dashcam or something and goes public, Cha Chawoong, God of Magic,

423
00:29:20,163 --> 00:29:24,733
will go down as a ghost-seeing crook in no time.

424
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:27,933
- Are you going to be on that show?
- Of course.

425
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:35,074
Lee Eungyeol, I'll crush you for sure this time.

Yes, that's me.

00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,444
What is it? Did something happen?

Tell us. What's going on?

435
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:13,154

00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:28,464
I agree. From my experience, those who don't come to one's funeral are heartless.

I'm from Kangguk Police Department.

My helmet was switched with Mr. Cha's. I'm here to return it.

Don't worry. It's all good since we found it.

489
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,450
All right.

490
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:09,060
- I'm Seo Heesoo.
- My gosh, Captain Seo.

491
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,194
I'm Kang Dalsoo. I run a junkyard.

492
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,244
We'll see each other a lot from now on.

493
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,300
I shouldn't. I drove here.

494
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,873
I'll take my leave.

495
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,184
- Yes, let's have a glass.
- Sure.

496
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:33,154
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

497
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,194
Seulhae!

498
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,770
It's Heesoo.

499
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,403
Are those to celebrate catching the purse snatcher?

500
00:33:57,403 --> 00:34:00,474
Oh, yes, with Naeun.

501
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:01,914
I heard you caught him on your way home from work.

502
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,943
Yes, I guess I can easily catch

503
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:08,713
a snatcher or two on my way home.

504
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,354
The detective division must really want me.

505
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,894
Are you that desperate?

506
00:34:14,894 --> 00:34:17,664
Of course, it's my dream job.

507
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:21,063
But you shouldn't have attacked him without any gear.

508
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:22,794
You made me worry.

509
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,133
- You were worried about me?
- Yes, obviously.

510
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,773
My dad feels guilty about what happened to your dad even now.

511
00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:35,373
It'd break my heart if you got hurt as well.

512
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,384
I see. Okay.

513
00:34:40,384 --> 00:34:42,084
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

514
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:43,923
Always have your gear with you.

515
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:46,753
Protecting ourselves is also our duty.

516
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,823
Yes, understood.

517
00:34:49,823 --> 00:34:53,134
- Let's go. Buckle up.
- Okay.

518
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:57,233
[Condolences]

519
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,473
Why tag along? It won't take long.

520
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,814
Take as much time as you can.

521
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,713
We're going to stuff ourselves off of the ancestral rites table.

522
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:13,084
Is it really okay to leave right after paying your respects?

523
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:16,823
It'll feel empty without the chief mourner.

524
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,794
No, listen.

525
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:27,194
Why did you do that? Goodness.

526
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:28,894
- Hey.
- Welcome.

527
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,903
- Here, dig in.
- Thanks.

528
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:32,604
Gosh.

529
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:35,173
- My goodness.
- Who are you?

530
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:38,543
Your grandfather must have been a virtuous man.

531
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:41,414
- My gosh, that's enough.
- Come on.

532
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:43,640
- Goodness.
- Stop.

533
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,153
My gosh, for real?

534
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:47,653
- Hey, over here.
- Okay.

535
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:49,153
What?

536
00:35:49,153 --> 00:35:50,783
What are you all doing?

537
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:53,493
The General Spirit's pupil is here.

538
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:55,854
Where are your manners?

539
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,593
Good evening.

540
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,403
This is the very reason I didn't want to come.

541
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:12,314
Chawoong, it's Granny Geumok from Okhwa House.

542
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:14,643
Why are you so late?

543
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,770
Mr. Shaman!

544
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,403
After the exorcism, my son recovered completely.

545
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:48,414
His hearing is back to normal and he doesn't talk gibberish now.

546
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,843
Words can't express how grateful I am.

547
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:52,044
I'm glad.

548
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:56,480
Please take this back and make rice cakes for your son.

549
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,693
That jerk is finally back home.

550
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:03,894
It's all thanks to your talisman.

551
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:08,763
We feel light-hearted after our consultation.

552
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,303
I didn't do it for the money.

553
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:20,974
Please take good care of each other

554
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:23,244
and live a happy life.

555
00:37:23,244 --> 00:37:26,184
Thank you, Mr. Shaman!

556
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,723
I'm home.

557
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,123
Grandfather?

558
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,364
Is he not back yet?

559
00:37:39,364 --> 00:37:42,064
Last night, the police rescued the woman who could have been

560
00:37:42,064 --> 00:37:44,034
the fifth victim of the culprit who only murders

561
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:47,604
during the full moon, also known as the Full Moon Murderer.

562
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:51,144
However, the detective in charge lost his life in the process.

563
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,943
The police rushed to the scene

564
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:55,644
and caught the shaman who interrupted the arrest.

565
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:58,383
The police are investigating whether he's an accomplice

566
00:37:58,383 --> 00:38:00,514
- of the Full Moon Murderer.
- Grandfather?

567
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:02,553
All he did was sell useless talismans.

568
00:38:02,553 --> 00:38:05,653
He must think he got something good from that notorious Full Moon Murderer.

569
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:08,253
We should just burn this house down.

570
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:10,523
He's an embarrassment to the whole town.

571
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:12,534
That quack shaman brought it on himself.

572
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:15,333
He kept going on about my son being possessed by a ghost

573
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,963
and tried to extort money from me.

574
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,764
- That's right.
- That fraud.

575
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,233
Take this!

576
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:22,233
My grandfather isn't a quack shaman.

577
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,473
He got the spirit out of you.

578
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:25,713
And what? A cult fanatic?

579
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:28,474
Didn't your husband come back home with my grandfather's talisman?

580
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:31,584
- You punk! A spirit in this day and age?
- Cheating?

581
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:33,553
- Watch your mouth.
- He's spouting nonsense.

582
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:35,113
- Get lost.
- That's his grandson for sure.

583
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,284
- He's so brazen.
- You saw that, right?

584
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:38,883
- I really can't...
- This is embarrassing.

585
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,354
I feel bad for myself...

586
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:42,564
- for getting scammed.
- I know, right?

587
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:43,864
Goodness.

588
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,073
Chawoong, why are you here?

589
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:55,004
What about school?

590
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,373
Why did you do it?

591
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,640
I'm sorry, Chawoong.

592
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,113
But I had to catch him at all costs.

593
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:10,523
And how will you do that?

594
00:39:10,523 --> 00:39:14,124
Not even the police can catch him, so how will you?

595
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,123
Are you eating well?

596
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,534
Ask the neighbors for some side dishes and...

597
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:22,903
The neighbors?

598
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:25,834
Do you even know what they're saying?

599
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:29,904
They're calling you a quack shaman, a fraud, and a cult fanatic.

600
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,644
I can't live in this town anymore.

601
00:39:33,644 --> 00:39:35,514
No, Chawoong!

602
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:37,714
You must protect the shrine.

603
00:39:37,714 --> 00:39:39,584
No.

604
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:42,213
I won't live like you, Grandfather.

605
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,724
No matter how much you help others,

606
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:47,523
they will only respect you when they need you.

607
00:39:47,523 --> 00:39:50,894
Nobody helps when you need it or believes in you.

608
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:52,693
So why should I follow in your footsteps?

609
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:55,194
Are you crazy?

610
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:57,234
Are you a fool?

611
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,643
It's all because of my incompetence.

612
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,143
I missed him when he was right in front of me.

613
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,143
If only I caught him...

614
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,484
What a fool.

615
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:33,834
Even until his last breath,

616
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:37,944
he was worried about you.

617
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:41,243
So he worried about someone else until the very end.

618
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,514
What a fool.

619
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:45,883
You're not just someone else.

620
00:40:46,454 --> 00:40:49,624
He was the nation's best male shaman.

621
00:40:49,624 --> 00:40:52,424
And you're his only living family.

622
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:56,724
It's time for you to serve the General.

623
00:40:56,724 --> 00:41:00,593
- Why would I become a shaman?
- Watch your mouth!

624
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:04,603
He had a great life

625
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:06,434
helping people.

626
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:09,773
They backstabbed him in the end!

627
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:12,844
I learned from him that sacrificing myself for others

628
00:41:12,844 --> 00:41:16,374
is the hardest thing in the world!

629
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:21,884
I told myself that day.

630
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,784
I will never trust...

631
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,893
nor help humans.

632
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,563
It's for the funeral. This will be more than enough.

633
00:41:43,374 --> 00:41:46,214
- Nice.
- Good job.

634
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:48,344
Well done.

635
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:53,483
Pyeonyuk is the best dish at funerals.

636
00:41:53,483 --> 00:41:55,914
Dip it in the salted shrimp.

637
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:59,173
Korean ghosts get energy from food. Eat a lot when you can.

638
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:01,653
I prefer street food.

639
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:05,164
Can't they put ramyeon or tteokbokki on the ancestral rites tables?

640
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:07,594
- Take this first.
- Let's go. Get up.

641
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:10,603
- What? Already?
- Let's move.

642
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,504
You can sit here.

643
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:23,384
Oh my. Look how tall he is.

644
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:25,884
He looks perfect.

645
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:29,413
Grandma, why is the chief mourner leaving already?

646
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,123
Should I go stop him?

647
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:33,154
Leave him be.

648
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:35,294
He was born to serve a spirit.

649
00:42:35,294 --> 00:42:38,994
He can't avoid it nor run away.

650
00:42:39,963 --> 00:42:42,734
The General will visit him.

Dear Yoojin.

I wanted to get your favorite cake.

Mr. Cha, can you slow down?

I died in a car accident. I have a trauma.

What is it?

It's raw rice.

- Rice?
- That's a spirit pot.

670
00:43:43,463 --> 00:43:45,463
Someone from the mourner's house put that in the car.

671

Why did she put that thing in my car without telling me?

She knows that thing could bring me bad luck. Throw that out now.

Mr. Cha you can't just throw this away.

814
00:51:58,254 --> 00:51:59,983
What?

815
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,064
What's this?

816
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:12,863
There's nothing here. Are you sure?

817
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,903
It was right here. Where did it go?

818
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:19,280
Could it be the security company engineer?

819
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,743
- Where did it go?
- It was right here.

820
00:52:24,743 --> 00:52:25,814
Yes.

821
00:52:25,814 --> 00:52:28,753
- Hello?
- This is Cha Chawoong.

822
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:30,653
Did anyone come in here yesterday?

823
00:52:30,653 --> 00:52:34,253
- Yes, a cop.
- What?

824
00:52:34,253 --> 00:52:36,823
Why did you let someone in while I was out?

825
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:38,323
Even if it's a cop!

826
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:40,163
I am sorry.

827
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:45,263
I knew I had a bad feeling about her from the start.

828
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,834
She didn't touch anything else.

829
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:49,173
Let it slide. She took what was hers.

830
00:52:49,173 --> 00:52:50,873
That's not the problem.

831
00:52:50,873 --> 00:52:52,944
It captured us talking and practicing.

832
00:52:52,944 --> 00:52:55,813
What if someone sees it?

833
00:52:58,984 --> 00:53:01,044
[Police]

834
00:53:06,053 --> 00:53:07,854
[Integrity is our highest value.]

835
00:53:07,854 --> 00:53:09,794
Let's go.

836
00:53:09,794 --> 00:53:12,124
Seulhae, why did you bring so many weapons?

837
00:53:12,124 --> 00:53:13,994
Oh, that.

838
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:16,863
I made a promise to a guy

839
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:22,103
that I won't wound this fragile body until I become his.

840
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:24,174
I guess he's not a cop.

841
00:53:24,174 --> 00:53:27,314
He's not aware of the Hulk of Kangguk Police Substation.

842
00:53:27,314 --> 00:53:30,244
I've been too nice to you, haven't I?

843
00:53:30,244 --> 00:53:33,494
I'll teach you how to show respect!

844
00:53:33,494 --> 00:53:35,453
You punk.

845
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:40,453
Timer guy?

846
00:53:40,453 --> 00:53:41,854
Where's the helmet?

847
00:53:41,854 --> 00:53:44,524
I put it back on the shelf in your rehearsal studio. Didn't you see it?

848
00:53:44,524 --> 00:53:47,064
Not mine, yours. The one with the dashcam.

849
00:53:47,064 --> 00:53:49,793
- Why?
- I was filmed on that.

850
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:53,364
I need to delete it. Give it to me now.

851
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:56,374
Is there something that shouldn't be filmed?

852
00:53:56,374 --> 00:53:59,104
That's why you should always behave.

853
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:01,704
It filmed me preparing for my performance.

854
00:54:01,704 --> 00:54:03,613
My business secret has been leaked.

855
00:54:03,613 --> 00:54:10,554
Oh, that super expensive performance that you charge by the second?

856
00:54:10,554 --> 00:54:13,283
Too bad. I don't have it.

857
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,553
No?

858
00:54:14,553 --> 00:54:16,694
Why? How come?

859
00:54:16,694 --> 00:54:19,224
Did you sell it off already?

860
00:54:19,224 --> 00:54:23,163
Who? Lee Eungyeol? Choi Hyunwoo?

861
00:54:23,163 --> 00:54:26,133
- A broadcasting station?
- What are you talking about?

862
00:54:26,133 --> 00:54:29,703
I borrowed it from my neighbor. So I gave it back to him.

863
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:31,973
The footage will be erased if there's no issue. What's the fuss?

864
00:54:31,973 --> 00:54:33,604
What if there is?

865
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,913
If it gets leaked, will you take responsibility?

866
00:54:35,913 --> 00:54:37,783
Will you take responsibility for my entire life?

867
00:54:37,783 --> 00:54:39,714
What responsibility?

868
00:54:39,714 --> 00:54:42,084
Okay! I'll find it for you.

869
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:44,354
Before that...

870
00:54:44,354 --> 00:54:46,153
What?

871
00:54:47,754 --> 00:54:49,694
You were driving with a broken headlight.

872
00:54:49,694 --> 00:54:52,294
You've violated the traffic law. You'll be fined.

873
00:54:52,294 --> 00:54:55,033
- Officer Go.
- It was an unfortunate accident.

874
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:56,564
Yes?

875
00:54:58,364 --> 00:55:02,104
A body has been found in the back hills.

876
00:55:02,104 --> 00:55:03,534
Wait.

877
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:05,974
I'll get it for you.

878
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:09,944
Hey.

879
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:11,713
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

880
00:55:11,713 --> 00:55:14,210
What's he doing?

881
00:55:26,964 --> 00:55:29,863
I saw something that looked like clothes on my way down.

882
00:55:29,863 --> 00:55:31,633
And it turned out it really was a man.

883
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:33,903
- Are you sure?
- I am!

884
00:55:33,903 --> 00:55:35,334
It was a young man.

885
00:55:35,334 --> 00:55:36,404
Where did you find him?

886
00:55:36,404 --> 00:55:38,803
It was somewhere... Oh, gosh. I don't know.

887
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:41,744
I was so shocked. I don't even know how I got here.

888
00:55:41,744 --> 00:55:43,273
You should come with us.

889
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,680
Where is she going?

890
00:55:53,524 --> 00:55:55,893
Nothing here.

891
00:55:55,893 --> 00:55:58,610
Nothing here, either!

892
00:56:05,264 --> 00:56:07,634
- Stop.
- Give it to me.

893
00:56:07,634 --> 00:56:10,134
You followed me here?

894
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:12,273
I said I'll get it for you later.

895
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:16,114
It has to be now. That's why I'm here.

896
00:56:16,114 --> 00:56:18,384
The number of the helmet owner...

897
00:56:18,384 --> 00:56:19,914
give it to me now.

898
00:56:19,914 --> 00:56:22,114
Fine. Okay!

899
00:56:22,854 --> 00:56:26,460
I'll call him now!

900
00:56:31,063 --> 00:56:33,563
Nothing here.

901
00:57:01,053 --> 00:57:03,093
Minho.

902
00:57:05,763 --> 00:57:09,763
I'm sorry. I just died. I'm still trying to figure things out.

903
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,863
I'm glad to meet people who can see me.

904
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,974
It's quite a relief.

905
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,010
Minho.

906
00:57:20,644 --> 00:57:23,543
You don't have time for this.

907
00:57:29,384 --> 00:57:31,484
We need to find the helmet first.

908
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:34,893
All my business secrets are on there.

909
00:57:34,893 --> 00:57:37,094
Hey. Are you out of your mind?

910
00:57:37,094 --> 00:57:40,423
A man is dead, and what? A helmet?

911
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:42,233
You freaking moron.

912
00:57:42,233 --> 00:57:44,663
Keep it down.

913
00:57:44,663 --> 00:57:47,634
If the other officers find it first, they'll check the dashcam right away.

914
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:50,973
I must find it before anyone else does.

915
00:57:54,044 --> 00:57:57,744
- The dashcam.
- Yes, the dashcam. The...

916
00:57:58,383 --> 00:58:00,944
That girl...

917
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:04,923
The estimated time of death is 12:00 a.m. last night.

918
00:58:04,923 --> 00:58:06,723
I think the accident occurred while he was on a delivery.

919
00:58:06,723 --> 00:58:09,423
If he was driving a bike, perhaps he was wearing a helmet.

920
00:58:09,423 --> 00:58:12,123
Could be.

921
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:14,633
Then, was he abandoned after a hit and run?

922
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:17,303
Captain Seo, it's the helmet.

923
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:19,834
He had a dashcam on his helmet.

924
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:21,703
It probably recorded the scene of the accident.

925
00:58:21,703 --> 00:58:25,044
What? How do you know?

926
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:27,104
He was my neighbor.

927
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:29,414
I borrowed his bike when I arrested the snatcher.

928
00:58:29,414 --> 00:58:30,914
Is that so?

929
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:34,544
Detective Ma, see if there's a helmet in this area with the support team.

930
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:35,484
Yes, sir.

931
00:58:35,484 --> 00:58:38,823
Are you nuts? Why would you tell them?

932
00:58:38,823 --> 00:58:42,454
Oh, it's the magician, Cha Chawoong!

933
00:58:42,454 --> 00:58:44,294
- What are you doing here?
- Be quiet.

934
00:58:44,294 --> 00:58:46,423
You've been hanging around.

935
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:49,694
Oh, because...

936
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:52,504
I was just out hiking.

937
00:58:52,504 --> 00:58:53,803
I was checking to see if anything happened.

938
00:58:53,803 --> 00:58:56,334
Can't you see? It says keep out.

939
00:58:56,334 --> 00:58:58,044
Get out of here now.

940
00:58:58,044 --> 00:58:59,604
Oh, okay.

941
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:02,444
You should go down. This area is dangerous.

942
00:59:02,444 --> 00:59:03,883
- Okay.
- Take him with you.

943
00:59:03,883 --> 00:59:05,013
Hurry up.

944
00:59:05,013 --> 00:59:06,443
- Bye.
- What does he think he's doing?

945
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,154
Bye.

946
00:59:11,783 --> 00:59:14,093
Gosh. This is crazy.

947
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:17,693
She's been causing unnecessary trouble since yesterday.

948
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:18,763
I feel bad for him.

949
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,863
It's sad enough that he's dead and he's abandoned in the mountains.

950
00:59:21,863 --> 00:59:25,864
I know. You should've listened to him yesterday.

951
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:28,403
Pull yourselves together!

952
00:59:28,403 --> 00:59:31,203
This is no time to worry about him.

953
00:59:31,203 --> 00:59:34,314
If the police find the helmet before us, we're done for.

954
00:59:34,314 --> 00:59:36,314
Why don't we take this chance to change our line of business?

955
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:39,514
A ghost show will be better than a magic show.

956
00:59:41,783 --> 00:59:45,523
So? Are you expecting us to find the helmet now?

957
00:59:45,523 --> 00:59:49,424
We work for the magic show company, not a private detective agency.

958
00:59:49,424 --> 00:59:51,323
We're about to shut down.

959
00:59:51,323 --> 00:59:54,533
You're about to lose your jobs!

960
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:55,764
- Lose our jobs?
- Lose our jobs?

961
00:59:55,764 --> 00:59:58,964
Chief Nam, you said that you are paying for your daughter's college expenses.

962
00:59:58,964 --> 01:00:03,134
Then you have to make a lot of money for her studies, enrollment fees, and tuition.

963
01:00:03,134 --> 01:00:05,774
Director Ma, you should get married before this year.

964
01:00:05,774 --> 01:00:11,114
No succubus would even look at you if a former thug is now unemployed.

965
01:00:11,114 --> 01:00:13,714
Areum, you said you were sad since you studied until you died.

966
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:15,754
You said you want to play games as much as you want.

967
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:18,984
Can you upgrade your character without any money these days?

968
01:00:18,984 --> 01:00:22,894
Life is all about money.

969
01:00:22,894 --> 01:00:25,823
Why can't you see the reality!

970
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:27,693
- My daughter.
- My wedding night.

971
01:00:27,693 --> 01:00:29,434
The guild war is next week.

972
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:30,604
- What do you want me to do?
- What do you want me to do?

973
01:00:30,604 --> 01:00:34,430
First, let's find the helmet owner.

974
01:00:46,444 --> 01:00:47,853
Minho.

975
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:51,424

- I was worried about you.

1140
01:10:55,994 --> 01:10:56,895
Wait. Let me go.

1141
01:10:56,895 --> 01:10:59,194
If you help me find the helmet...

1142
01:10:59,194 --> 01:11:00,393
Left turn.

1143
01:11:00,393 --> 01:11:02,263
I'll help you find the culprit.

1144
01:11:02,263 --> 01:11:05,603
How many ghost employees do you have?

1145
01:11:05,603 --> 01:11:08,474
Chief Nam, Director Ma, and Areum.

1146
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:10,573
- Was that a ghost?
- He'll unlock it soon.

1147
01:11:10,573 --> 01:11:12,604
Get out!

1148
01:11:12,604 --> 01:11:14,343
Are you nuts?

1149
01:11:14,343 --> 01:11:16,214
Oh, sorry.

1150
01:11:16,214 --> 01:11:17,983
I'm not only strong.

1151
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:19,914
I can tell your fortune, perform charms...

1152
01:11:19,914 --> 01:11:21,013
There is nothing I can't do.

1153
01:11:21,013 --> 01:11:24,110
All the evidence is gone. How are we going to catch him?

1154
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:27,140
From now on, it's showtime.

1155
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:32,294
