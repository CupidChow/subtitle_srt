00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,609
What about this one?

9
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,350
Are you sure he'll propose to you today?

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,780
I have no idea! I won't know until I see him.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,449
You said you caught the bride's bouquet at his employee's wedding.

What about this one?

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,719
You mentioned he said... you'd just have to get married within six months.

14

- But are you sure?
- This?

Yes! What about this one?

Hey! You little... Don't you dare act coy in front of me.

18

Enough. Hurry up and get changed into this.

Just put on this outfit and don't come home tonight, okay?

What are you thinking about? You seem lost in thought.

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,899
Come on. You don't have to try to look all serious and cool.

28
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:41,370
I came prepared.

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,009
I mean, I have no idea what you're going to say,

30

break up.

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,330
That was a joke, right?

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,699
You totally caught me off guard. What do we do about this?

37
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,063
No, I'm serious.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,219
I want to break up with you.

39
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:22,594
Why?

40
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,552
What's your reason?

41
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,299
Isn't the reason obvious?

42
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,489
I no longer feel the same way about you.

43

46
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,639
I don't know.

47
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,280
I've heard nothing from him...

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,379
for a week since he said he wanted to end things.

49
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,909
He hasn't even been home yet. It's so unlike him...

50
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,319
I'm sure he had his reasons.

51
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,003
Just give him some time.

52
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,210
In order for a spirit to come upon you,

53
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,750
your mind has to be a blank slate.

54
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,390
Let go of all your worldly desires and greed.

55
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,789
You must not let your fleeting thoughts distract you.

56
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:15,073
Can you do it?

57
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,559
I'll try.

58
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,012
No, I will do it.

59
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:38,241
The air here is much cleaner than what we're used to in the city.

60
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,007
Are you all right?

61
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,260
Yes.

62
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,600
We must catch the evil spirit before the next full moon.

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,539
But did you have to do that to Officer Go?

64
00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:00,100
She must be heartbroken without even knowing what's going on.

65
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,740
If she finds out,

66
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,000
she'll try to catch him herself and end up getting hurt.

67
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:11,049
It's not like she'll listen to me if I tell her to hide and do nothing.

68
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:15,649
That's true. She's certainly not the type to sit back and do nothing.

69
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,490
If the two of us join forces,

70
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,250
we can track down the evil spirit and get rid of him quickly.

71
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:29,189
I'll take care of this quickly and tell her everything later.

72
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:44,179
If I can stay alive...

73
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:46,519
and tell her everything, that is.

74
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,820
Darn it!

75
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,989
It was quiet for a while, but violent cases are happening again.

76
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:52,859
Should we really consult a shaman or something?

77
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:55,959
Because of the murder of the elderly lady at Kangguk-ro 2-ga?

78
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,143
Yes, it's such a headache. We've got no leads.

79
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,169
Who are you?

80
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:07,909
Such insolence! I asked you to identify yourself.

81
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,270
But I can't stop thinking that it's a copycat murder.

82
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,870
I was thinking that, too.

83
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,439
The victim was left in the same state... as the Full Moon Murder victims.

84
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,440
- Yes.
- The Full Moon Murder?

85
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,080
That's right. And it was the 15th according to the lunar calendar.

86
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,020
Darn it. Who is this lunatic that is copying the Full Moon Murderer?

87
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,280
The 15th according to the lunar calendar?

88
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,000
Officer Go.

89
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,770
But we have already sealed the evil spirit.

90
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,769
That wasn't the evil spirit.

91
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:46,539
It was the soul of the human possessed by the evil spirit.

92
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,970
Then Chawoong fell off the face of the earth because...

93
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,641
To catch the evil spirit, Chawoong...

94
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,679
decided to accept his fate as a shaman.

95
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,779
Then he should've told me everything.

96
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,649
Once he becomes a shaman, his life as an ordinary man is over.

97
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,549
He probably couldn't tell you because he felt bad.

98
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:11,459
But you seemed so devastated, so I came here to tell you.

99
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,428
I'll tell you where he is now.

100
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,600
Thank you.

101
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,700
He will accept his Worshipping Spirit to get rid of me?

102
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,928
I won't let that happen.

105
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,669
It's been a while.

106
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:51,969
- Oh, hello.
- Hi, long time no see.

107

Are things not going well between you and Officer Lee?

108
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,580
Why do you ask?

109
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,950
Yongryul is so quiet these days.

110
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,509
He just stares at his phone and sighs all day,

111
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,879
as if he's lost the will to live.

Did you think I wouldn't be able to understand your decision?

121
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,109
No, it's not that. I knew you'd understand...

122
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:40,203
and that you'd rush here like this.

123
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,520
That's why I wanted to keep you in the dark.

124
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,020
This path I've chosen is a lot harder...

125
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,289
and more dangerous than you think.

126

How hard could it be?

127
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,743
Will it cost you your life?

Will it kill you?

129
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,669
- That's not the case, so why...
- It could kill me.

130
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:06,769
- So let me do this alone...
- If you die, then what?

131
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,130
Am I to say... "Of course.

We're no longer a couple,

133

so why would I care whether he dies or not?"

134
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,079
Am I to simply shrug it off and move on?

135
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,855
If you think about it,

136
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,380
I may have been the root of your problems.

137
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,130
You've suffered enough.

138
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,096
All I wish is for you to have an easier life...

140
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:43,010
Stop that!

141

How stupid can you be?

142
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:47,140
How could I possibly have it easy?

143
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,810
I've been missing you like crazy, and the thought of you being hurt had me worried.

144
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,372
How could you do this to me?

145
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:57,740
Can't you see that I love you?

146
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,090
In no way... will I let you die.

147
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,699
But if it somehow happens, I will be by your side.

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,639
That is my definition of love.

149
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,283
Understood?

150
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,291
Senior, did you follow me here?

151
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,669
You choose to be with a shaman?

152
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:02,450
Your father would be thrilled.

153
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,090
Actually, he would be.

154
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,000
He would want me... to be with the man I choose and trust.

155
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,635
Get out of my way.

156
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,181
My patience has run out.

157
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,669
Now, choose.

158
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:22,094
Either be mine...

00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,270

00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:26,140
There's someone who is as handsome as I am?

330
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,420
I find that hard to believe.

331
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:34,609
Do you happen to know Mr. Nam Sanggeon?

332
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,380
- Nam... Who?
- Nam Sanggeon.

333
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,079
I don't know who that is.

334
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,250
I'm Go Seokyong. I'm 61, still single.

335
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,519
He's my brother.

336
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,020
I'm Go Kyupil, age 65. I'm single, too.

337
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,460
Anyway, why were you standing like that earlier?

338
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,979
Are you feeling sick?

339
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,500
Oh, no.

340
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,769
I walked all day but haven't eaten anything, so I'm just exhausted.

341
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:05,210
My goodness. Do you want to come to our place for some food?

342
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,280
May I?

343
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,079
For sure. Lunch must be ready now. Our sister must be waiting.

344
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,049
We'll just have her put an extra spoon on the table for you.

345
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:17,570
- Let's go, brother.
- Hold tight!

346
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:22,830
Let's go!

347
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,830
Why are you tired when you have done nothing?

348
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,560
My legs hurt so much.

349
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,929
You brats! Must I carry this at this old age?

350
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,329
- I got it.
- I worked all day.

351
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,999
My legs are killing me.

352
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,040
That hurts!

353
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,820
You're such a crybaby because I coddled you all your life.

354
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,490
You pig! It's rude to start eating before your guest does!

355
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,619
Even dogs should not be bothered when they're eating!

356
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:55,019
What are you waiting for? Eat! Dig in!

357
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,207
Thank you for the food.

358
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,704
Here.

359
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:14,133
Hand-torn aged kimchi tastes the best.

360
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,816
Try it.

361
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,330
It's good. You should eat too, Granny.

362
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,160
"Granny"? How dare you!

363
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,172
I'm Go Seoyeon. I'm 72, still single.

364
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,899
Are you single, too?

365
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,770
I'm not married.

366
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,654
Is that so?

367
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:47,509
How do you feel about dating an older woman?

368
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,420
You should go out with her. She's fine.

369
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,990
- Sorry?
- What?

370
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,509
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

371
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:04,289
- Stay still.
- Why did you eat so fast?

372
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,759
- That needle...
- Stay still.

373
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,069
- This is very dangerous.
- Stay put.

374
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:13,299
I have to be very careful with this. It's very dangerous.

375
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,427
Hey, relax!

376
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,383
- Hey, stay still.
- Don't move!

377
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,080
- Ouch!
- Hey! Just do it!

378
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,719
You're making it worse.

379
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:31,143
- What's that?
- What?

380
00:32:31,143 --> 00:32:34,319
What? I only see red blood coming out. It's supposed to be dark.

381
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,589
- What?
- Give me the other hand.

382
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,830
You fool! You can't get it right in one go? Give me that.

383
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,900
- Goodness.
- Calm down. You can't do it.

384
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,230
You could barely see, so you pricked Kyupil all over.

385
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,969
He nearly died because his blood vessels burst.

386
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:48,469
- My goodness.
- Oh, dear.

387
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:50,140
Wait, no!

388
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,909
I'm okay. It's all gone down now.

389
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:54,810
Yes, it's all gone down.

390
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,550
- Are you all right?
- Yes, it's all gone down.

391
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,680
But you still look pale.

392
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,847
Why don't you take a nap? Do you want to lie down?

393
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,189
- Sorry?
- Yes, you should!

394
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:06,559
It's getting late. You should sleep here tonight.

395
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,630
- Yes, you should.
- Sleep here!

396
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,046
- Yes.
- Go on in.

397
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,404
You jerks.

398
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:26,470
I packed you rice balls and some water.

399
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,240
Don't go around on an empty stomach.

400
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,823
Thank you.

401
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:32,809
I owe you a great deal for yesterday.

402
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,939
I'll be back to express my gratitude.

403
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:35,979
Yes, of course.

404
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:38,650
And nothing says "thank you" more than Korean beef.

405
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,650
Absolutely.

406
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,650
Stay healthy, young man.

407
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,119
The last thing you want is to collapse and faint.

408
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,019
Only looking healthy won't do you any good.

409
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:48,384
Yes, of course.

410
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:52,220
I won't forget your generosity.

411
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,599
Sure.

412
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,799
Get going, then. Have a good one.

413
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:02,110
Did you pack enough rice balls for him?

414
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,642
I did.

415
00:35:04,642 --> 00:35:06,510
I hope he'll be all right.

416
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,665
He has to be.

417
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:57,789
Grandpa,

418
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:03,660
my running away only brought you pain, and that I regretted.

419
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,777
I'm sorry.

420
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,730
Chawoong, are you in here?

421
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,450
My gosh. You startled me.

422
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,229
- Gosh.
- Unbelievable.

423
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:34,400
Does anyone have any spare socks?

424
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,383
I can't keep walking around in mine.

425
00:36:37,383 --> 00:36:40,139
Have we received any tips on his whereabouts?

426
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,875
I'm afraid not.

427
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,220
Evil spirits make their way into a body through blood.

428
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,579
We're at a hospital,

429
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,749
so it wouldn't be hard to find someone who's bleeding.

430
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:01,797
Detective Byun, did you visit Captain Seo at the hospital?

431
00:37:01,797 --> 00:37:05,530
Yes, right after Chief Seo informed me.

432
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,230
When did you hurt the back of your hand?

433
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,114
What, this?

434
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:13,139
I scratched it while out on a search last night.

435
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,439
Why?

436
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,139
It's nothing.

437
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,409
- Chief!
- Chief!

438
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:23,180
When will you people screw your heads back on?

439
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:27,280
You let him get away at the scene... and then lost track of him again.

440
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,889
You call this police work?

441
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:31,389
- We're sorry, Sir.
- We're sorry, Sir.

442
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:34,790
Go Seulhae, why are you still here?

443
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,803
She wished to come back to work... which I allowed.

444
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:41,000
You moron.

445
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,700
A police officer with personal ties to the suspect shouldn't be on the case.

446
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,440
- Get her out of here!
- Yes, Sir.

447
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,369
Get out.

448
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:52,510
You're off this case. Get out!

449
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:55,509
Get out this instant!

450
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,549
The gas station where Cha Chawoong was spotted is near his childhood home.

451
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,059
What? Is that true?

452
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:11,260
He could be hiding there, so get over there this instant!

453
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,859
Yes, Sir. Guys, let's go.

454
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,869
The phone is turned off. You will be redirected to voicemail.

455
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:19,570
Please leave a message after the tone.

456
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,526
[Kangguk Police Department]

457
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:26,880
Yeji, leave the house immediately.

458
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,920
The police will be there any second. Also...

459
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,000
The evil spirit...

460
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,930
What?

461
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,600
Were you going to say that it's right beside you?

462
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,727
Grandma, I ask for your guidance.

463
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,303
It's over. Are you all right?

464
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:51,209
I think I am.

465
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,729
Thank you.

466
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,343
You did well.

467
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,440
Seulhae.

468
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,438
Seulhae's in trouble.

469
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:27,659
All that you are is a feeble human.

470
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:30,789
Isn't it about time you acknowledged the truth?

471
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,400
This is not a battle you can win.

472
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,369
I may be powerless,

473
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,101
but at least I'm a living being.

474
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:46,232
Meanwhile, you are the remnant of a past life that is neither dead nor alive.

475
00:41:46,232 --> 00:41:49,547
The remnant of a past life?

476
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,079
Poong Baek is the one who made me this way!

477
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,489
How can you care more about him when I have loved you... for 2,000 years?

478
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:03,019
Love, my foot.

479
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:08,829
All that you are displaying is a deranged obsession.

480
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:11,400
Haven't you learned anything for the past 2,000 years?

481
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,199
How could you when you have never loved...

482
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,127
or been loved?

483
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,889
That's right. That is who I am.

484
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:37,970
I take what I desire... and eliminate those who get in my way.

485
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,969
I will possess your body, take control of your memories,

486
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:47,469
and seize the seven-star channel within you.

487
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:50,739
This is how I will make you mine.

488
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:54,560
No. You can't.

489
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,149
No...

490
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,160
Seulhae.

491
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,539
Haechunmoo.

492
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:03,220
Astounding. I did not expect this much power.

493
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:44,377
What? Can't you bring yourself to kill her?

494
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,559
Drop the sword.

495
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:54,327
Or this woman will die.

496
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,630
Why?

497
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:00,953
Haechunmoo, I admit defeat.

498
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:07,070
Take me instead.

499
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,139
What are you playing at?

500
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:11,769
Chawoong, what are you doing?

501
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,240
The evil spirit will push me out.

502
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,210
I will not be able to protect you!

503
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,493
We can't let him be in control of Seulhae.

504
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:24,550
Isn't Seulhae's love what you desire?

505
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:29,530
Possess me, erase my memories, and be reborn as Cha Chawoong.

506
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:33,730
That will earn you Seulhae's love and trust.

507
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,393
It wouldn't be so bad...

508
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,369
to trap your soul and endlessly hear you scream in agony.

509
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:43,689
Promise me one thing though.

510
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,293
That you will never hurt Seulhae.

511
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,030
- Chawoong.
- This is our window. Drive the sword through me.

512
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,670
What? What are you talking about?

513
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:16,639
Did you make this deal... to trap the evil spirit within you?

514
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:19,776
Hurry. I can't hold on any longer.

515
00:47:19,776 --> 00:47:21,480
I can't.

516
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,380
You will not survive this attack.

517
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,250
This is our last chance.

518
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,250
Enough with the shenanigans.

519
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,289
You are mine.

520
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,000
We don't have much time.

521
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:40,799
If you don't end this,

522
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:45,070
I will never forgive you for the choice you made.

523
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:49,003
- Chawoong...
- Now. Do it!

524
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:18,931
You have finally...

525
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,936
atoned for your sin.

526
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,785
I,

527
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,429
once again,

528
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,059
failed to protect you.

529
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:42,159
I'm sorry.

530
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,039
No, General Choi.

531
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:55,635
You have done enough.

532
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,134
Please lay down your burden...

533
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,960
and rest in peace.

534
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:39,110
My Lord up above.

535
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:42,734
I am the princess of this country.

536
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:47,169
However, if I fail to protect my people...

537
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,989
and the man I love,

538
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:56,097
being a princess... will be pointless.

539
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,525
It is why...

540
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:03,083
I choose to risk my life tomorrow.

541
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:09,794
If my actions can clear Master Poong Baek's name,

542
00:51:11,509 --> 00:51:14,250
you are to gladly take my life.

543
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,076
And in my next life,

544
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,864
allow me to serve the people as one of them...

545
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,918
and let me cherish...

546
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:30,119
the man I love...

547
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:35,094
with all my heart.

548
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:00,220
Seulhae?

549
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,031
You... Are you Master Poong Baek?

550
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:07,069
Princess Chun Hwa?

551
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,612
You must be the reincarnation of Master Poong Baek.

552
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,055
How are you here though?

553
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,754
This sacred mirror...

554
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,904
and the skies...

555
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:04,315
must have sent me here...

556
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,020
to seek forgiveness.

557
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,024
Seek forgiveness?

558
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:13,850
But you have not wronged me in any way.

559
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,506
Tomorrow,

560
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:22,503
I will fail to protect you.

561
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:27,667
I'm sorry.

562
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,526
I'm truly sorry.

563
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:35,719
What about Master Poong Baek?

564
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:38,134
What will happen to you?

565
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:57,546
And in our next life? Do we meet again?

566
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,301
I was able to atone for my sins...

567
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:06,374
and sacrifice my life to save yours...

568
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,560
for which I am glad.

569
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:16,329
Now, since I have fulfilled my destiny,

570
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,960
I am to leave.

571
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,187
Us meeting again...

572
00:54:22,187 --> 00:54:25,916
proves that my prayers were answered.

573
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:28,594
That is why...

574
00:54:28,594 --> 00:54:32,413
you weren't reborn to atone for your sins.

575
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,888
It was to love.

576
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:40,310
You were reborn to love with all your heart.

577
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:44,216
That is what I prayed for.

578
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:49,034
My life as I know it will end tomorrow,

579
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,702
but you have come to me today...

580
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,980
to tell me that my choice is worth it.

581
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,789
Then,

582
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:05,620
even though you were aware of your fate...

583
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,119
Now, go.

584
00:55:10,479 --> 00:55:13,275
Head back to your life...

585
00:55:13,275 --> 00:55:18,111
and hold the one you love... tightly in your arms.

586
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:22,543
For that will also be me.

587
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:39,478
I love you, Master Poong Baek.

588
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,759
Please do not grieve too much.

589
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:40,450
Because one day,

590
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,947
we will cross paths again.

591
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:25,054
No matter... when and how we meet again,

592
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,600
I will love her.

593
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:36,420
That's how partnerships work.

594
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,831
Okay?

595
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:43,828
When she smiles, my heart will skip a beat...

596
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:46,557
without knowing why.

597
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,048
And eventually, I will realize.

598
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,407
Realize... she's my destiny.

599
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,813
The reason for my life.

600
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:35,300
Chawoong?

601
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,738
No!

602
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:55,149
This can't be!

603
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,850
No.

604
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:06,880
[Trustworthy Police, Safe Country]

605
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,610
In the first trial of former police chief Seo Changho,

606
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,450
prosecutors demanded life imprisonment for the accused.

607
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,720
Is that our chief?

608
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,720
- Darn it.
- What will happen now?

609
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,320
Hey, what about your captain?

610
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,296
Gosh, who knows?

611
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,659
Detective Byun, do you have a blind date or something?

612
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:33,964
I hear the new chief... likes smart workers.

613
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,932
What do you think? Do I look good?

614
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:47,749
Furthermore, the former police chief...

615
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:50,889
had a long bond with the head of a gang group.

616
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:53,389
However, when they had fallen out, he murdered the leader...

617
01:00:53,389 --> 01:00:55,989
- by disguising it as a suicide.
- What a scumbag.

618
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,590
Yongryul did an amazing job.

619
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:03,829
He wiped out Korea's worst pieces of trash.

620
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:08,300
- The power of love is unbelievable.
- Right?

621
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,809
With that said, have the last dumpling.

622
01:01:11,809 --> 01:01:13,939
- Here.
- No, you have it.

623
01:01:13,939 --> 01:01:15,880
- No, you have it.
- No, you.

624
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,650
- No, you.
- Stop it.

625
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,010
- Eat it.
- No, I'm fine.

626
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,214
You deserve it.

627
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,497
Senior.

628
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,795
Seulhae.

629
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:38,429
How are you feeling?

630
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:41,070
I'll be discharged next week.

631
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,139
That's great.

632
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:45,639
You should come back to work.

633
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:49,643
But not right away. With what's going on with my dad.

634
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,185
I'm sorry.

635
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,050
I am ashamed to face you.

636
01:01:57,789 --> 01:01:59,789
What happened to him is unfortunate,

637
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:03,089
but everyone knows what a great police officer you are.

638
01:02:04,059 --> 01:02:08,300
Come back as soon as you pull yourself together.

639
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,544
I'll fill in for your empty spot until then.

640
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,440
Thank you.

641
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,410
For working hard on my grandma's case.

642
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:22,585
I'm a police officer.

643
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:25,610
I did what I should.

644
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:28,820
And it has to do with your grandma.

645
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,951
I can't possibly sit still.

646
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:37,789
I don't know how to repay you.

647
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:40,460
Did you eat?

648
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,760
Then can you cook me a meal?

649
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,300
A meal?

650
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,700
Yes.

651
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,694
That should be enough as repayment.

652
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,079
Please sit here and wait a while.

653
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:58,579
I'll whip it up in no time.

654
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:00,779
Okay. Thanks.

655
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:16,000
What? Mom!

656
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,429
What brings you here?

657
01:03:17,429 --> 01:03:19,000
What about you?

658
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,804
Well, I...

659
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:25,940
Ma'am.

660
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,539
Please don't get the wrong idea.

661
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:29,180
I called him over to thank him.

662
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,110
We're not seeing each other again. I swear.

663
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,909
Go ahead.

664
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,119
What?

665
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:37,240
You and Yongryul. Get back together.

666
01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:40,660
Mom, are you serious?

667
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,590
That guy was suffering from a broken heart.

668
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,960
But he threw himself into your grandmother's case.

669
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,984
I realized how serious you two were.

670
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:54,039
I came by multiple times to tell you and today's finally the day I do.

671
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,839
I'm really sorry about that day.

672
01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:58,524
It's okay.

673
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,260
You had it rough, didn't you?

674
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:06,930
You've grown thin.

675
01:04:11,289 --> 01:04:13,989
I brought beef bone soup. Let's dig in, okay?

676
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,589
Go get a spoon and chopsticks for Yeji.

677
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:19,973
Okay.

678
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,643
Sit.

679
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:47,304
It's okay.

680
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:03,689
[Cha Chawoong and Go Seulhae's Wedding]
It's just around the corner now.

681
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:06,809
By the way, who are we going to meet?

682
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:08,440
My life saviors.

683
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,749
They fed me and gave me shelter when I was chased around.

684
01:05:11,749 --> 01:05:13,949
What grateful people.

685
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:15,480
But you don't know their numbers?

686
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,150
I was not in the right mind to ask.

687
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:21,360
But I want them to come to our wedding.

688
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,190
You'll be surprised when you meet them.

689
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:26,389
And happy, too.

690
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:29,699
Excuse me, are you home?

691
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:32,230
I'm here.

692
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:34,338
Mr. Go Kyupil?

693
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,349
Mr. Go Seokyong?

694
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:42,539
Is this the right place? The house looks empty.

695
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:46,750
That's strange. I'm sure this is the place.

696
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,706
Who are you two?

697
01:05:53,789 --> 01:05:56,289
I came to meet the elders living here.

698
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:57,429
Did they move?

699
01:05:57,429 --> 01:05:59,060
I'm the head of this village.

700
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,560
And nobody lives in this house.

701
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,429
What? That can't be.

702
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:08,199
Three siblings live here. Two elderly men and an elderly woman.

703
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:11,010
I had meals together and even slept with them.

704
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,510
That's absurd.

705
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:16,210
The water supply and electricity were cut off ten years ago.

706
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:18,758
Strange.

707
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,822
I'm sure I...

708
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:27,913
I wonder if you were possessed by a ghost.

709
01:06:30,459 --> 01:06:32,820
A ghost?

Are you the sinner who betrayed your master and your friend...

Yes.

01:07:38,329 --> 01:07:40,860
My gosh! And you even caught an evil spirit?

726
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:43,159
I did.

727
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,529
Great job.

Excellent.

01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:10,733
What? Come on. Geez.

735

This is a bit...

736
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:18,870
Is there a problem?

737
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:20,530
I will make a verdict.

738
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,299
Yes, Your Highness.

739
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:26,539
While living in this world for 2,000 years,

740
01:08:26,539 --> 01:08:29,039
you have saved numerous people.

741
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:31,510
The virtue you've accumulated so far...

742
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:35,419
is enough to liquidate all the karma of your previous life.

743
01:08:35,419 --> 01:08:37,150
Yes, Your Highness.

744
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:38,789
However!

745
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:40,289
However?

746
01:08:40,289 --> 01:08:45,829
Sponging off... and exploiting unfair labor to the Cha family...

747
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:50,160
by impersonating the General Spirit after that has gotten you new karma.

748
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,400
Impersonating? Sponging off?

749
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,070
Do you know what I went through?

750

- Emperor!

- Please calm down.
- I can knock you out!

755
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:10,780
- Please calm down.
- I'm going nuts!

756
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,489
He made me lose it.

757
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:17,220
I'm going to make the verdict, okay? Goodness.

758
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,830
Didn't I tell you not to book 100 cases per month?

759
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:23,360
You're dead meat today. He's driving me mad.

All right.

I will make the verdict.

763
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:39,410
You are to go to the human world again...

764
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:44,020
and happily retribute for your deeds to the Cha family.

765
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:48,647
With that, you can enter Nirvana. Understood?

766
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:55,630
Excuse me?

767
01:09:58,499 --> 01:10:01,240
It wasn't for two years.

768
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,640

People went wild.

774
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,960
You're nowhere near where I stand.

775
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,329
Of course.

776
01:10:27,329 --> 01:10:31,400
I'm just honored to stand on the same stage as you.

777
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,900
You've grown a lot.

778
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,469
It only felt like yesterday when you suddenly barged in and asked me...

779
01:10:37,469 --> 01:10:39,939
to teach you starting from the basics.

780
01:10:39,939 --> 01:10:42,779
How many original repertoires have you made already?

781
01:10:42,779 --> 01:10:46,509
It's all thanks to your guidance.

782
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:47,919

783

and then change over to a shadow in ten seconds.

787
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:02,699
So get changed and stand behind the screen in ten.

788
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:05,200
Ten seconds.

- Okay.

01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,100
What time are the kids coming? What should I do?

822
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,199
We still have 30 minutes left.

823
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:46,995
- The balloons and banner. Hurry!
- Got it.

824
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:57,869
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!

825
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:02,080
- Happy birthday dear Cha Maru!
- Happy birthday dear Cha Maru!

826
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:06,543
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!

827
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,730
Thank you for wishing Maru a happy birthday.

828
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:13,759
Dig in, okay?

829
01:13:13,759 --> 01:13:17,399
Do you have any pyeonyuk or ribs?

830
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:19,329
I like meat.

831
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:23,170
Hey, what you're having right now is also meat.

832
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:27,770
It's still a party. Ribs are a must.

833
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,139
I'm sorry. I'll prepare it next time.

834
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,879
By the way, do you have any street food?

835
01:13:32,879 --> 01:13:35,079
I like tteokbokki.

836
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:37,019
Tteokbokki?

837
01:13:37,019 --> 01:13:39,820
I'll make some right away. Can you wait a bit?

838
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:43,289
Mr. Cha, just leave it.

839
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:46,880
Guys, they're giving us snacks...

840
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,400
and providing this space for free.

841
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,829
Let's not cause too much trouble, okay?

842
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:56,170
Just eat whatever you're given.

843
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:59,610
I'm sorry. Is there anything I can help with?

844
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:03,310
No, it's okay. Just dig in.

845
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:07,879
Guys, a magic show is waiting after you eat all this.

846
01:14:07,879 --> 01:14:10,280
You all know I'm a famous magician, right?

847
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,520
Dad, can't we just play by ourselves?

848
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,240
We watch your magic every day.

849
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,629
Okay then.

850
01:14:20,629 --> 01:14:23,299
Guys, let's play detective later.

851
01:14:23,299 --> 01:14:25,069
I'm going to be a violent crimes detective.

852
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:27,229
I'm going to be a crime scene investigator.

853
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:30,669
I'm going to be a motorcycle policeman.

854
01:14:30,669 --> 01:14:33,239
That means I'm the criminal again.

855
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:34,270
You're it!

856
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,950
You're the criminal!

857
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:41,209
Try to catch me! Boo!

858
01:14:41,209 --> 01:14:44,594
- Don't move!
- Stop right there!

859
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:47,689
Wait for me!

860
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:51,259
Up! Fly it up!

861
01:14:51,259 --> 01:14:55,799
You know, just seeing Maru eat and play well makes me happy.

862
01:14:55,799 --> 01:15:00,499
Totally. Even his fetus name was happiness.

863
01:15:00,499 --> 01:15:04,469
You're right. His existence itself is happiness.

864
01:15:04,469 --> 01:15:10,079
But for some strange reason, his friends feel familiar.

865
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:12,316
He reminds me of Chief Nam.

866
01:15:13,249 --> 01:15:15,379
That boy, Director Ma.

867
01:15:15,379 --> 01:15:19,151
And her, Areum.

868
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:24,829
- That means...
- Mom! Dad! I caught the criminal!

869
01:15:24,829 --> 01:15:27,770
Great job, Detective Cha Maru!

870
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:34,910
What?

871
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:39,070
No way. That's impossible.

872
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,709
What is?

873
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:43,279
No, forget it.

874
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:45,350
What is it? Tell me.

875
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:47,910
Seriously. It's nothing.

876
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:50,880
Maru!

877
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,867
- Should I join? Let's go.
- No...

878
01:16:02,629 --> 01:16:08,070
After an eternity, I'm with you now.

879
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:13,070
After crossing life and death, I have come next to you.

880
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:18,379
It's not just a coincidence that we met like this.

881
01:16:18,379 --> 01:16:21,520
To cherish each other more,

882
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,289
the almighty might have given us another chance.

883
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:29,389
My grateful dear who joined me on to the stage called today.

884
01:16:29,389 --> 01:16:31,630
Are you ready...

885
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:35,829
to love as much as you can and be happy with all we've got?
