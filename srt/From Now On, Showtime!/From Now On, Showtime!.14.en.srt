No! Not that.

Yes, that! Can you say that just once more?

89

- "Boyfriend"?
- Yes.

91

Yes, much more than hearing that I'm handsome.

Oh, come on.

93

There have been many setbacks along the way,

but they're meant to be together,

104
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:25,123
so their hearts found their way back to each other.

108
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:41,382

Oh, the evil spirit. Before I leave,

113
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,063
I will bury it in a spot where Poong Baek's energy is strong.

00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:35,563
Right, you said you'd reach Nirvana once that fan was full.

140
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:37,643
You really are almost there.

Oh, you don't need to worry about that.

143
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:48,442
You can all retire together.

144

Retire? What do you mean?

145
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:54,313
Since I'm the Cha family's worshiping spirit,

146
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:58,322
they no longer need to be shamans once I reach Nirvana.

147
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:02,892
So, naturally, Mr. Cha will lose his ability... to see ghosts,

148
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:07,063
which means the three of you will be dismissed.

00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:10,122
What? Why is my heart pounding?

329
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:13,522
Do I really like him?

330
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:15,370
But why?

331
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,693
There's no reason to, but I do.

332
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:21,300
I could stare at him all day. I just like him.

333
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,817
Then...

334
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:28,160
does that mean we're meant to be?

335
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:31,457
What is it?

336
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:33,902
Do I have something on my face?

337
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:37,107
Why do you like me, Yongryul?

338
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:38,983
There must be a reason.

339
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:42,622
More than a reason, I just like everything about you.

340
00:19:42,622 --> 00:19:45,183
I could stare at you all day.

341
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:50,693
You have ten seconds.

342
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:52,736
Get your heart ready.

343
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:55,003
What?

344
00:19:55,003 --> 00:20:01,057
One, three, five, seven, nine, ten.

345
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,697
Wait for me, Yeji!

346
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,000
Here, water.

347
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,090
- Thank...
- Hey, no!
- Stop. Don't do it!

348
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,433
Don't!

349
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,393
- It's just a cup of...
- No! Remember?

350
00:20:24,393 --> 00:20:26,963
You are prohibited from doing anything for Officer Go.

351
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:31,072
Don't do anything that'll make her thank you.

352
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:32,957
Don't do it.

353
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:45,783
Afraid that you'll feel grateful, I can't even walk you to your house. I'm sorry.

354
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:49,206
Don't worry. It's a short bus ride.

355
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:52,341
Are you okay?

356
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:56,363
Don't even think about helping me.

357
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:59,302
Right, I almost forgot.

358
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:01,838
This is driving me nuts.

359
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:08,772
- Officer Go!
- Yongryul and even Yeji.

360
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:12,443
You look better after transferring to the Detective Division.

361
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:15,082
- Hello.
- Hi.

362
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:16,913
Are you two really going out?

363
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:18,723
Yeji did tell me about it.

364
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:20,453
Yes, it just happened.

365
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:23,992
- Are you on a date?
- Yes, we're off to dinner.

366
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,922
If you haven't had dinner yet, how about joining us?

367
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:29,993
My gosh, it looks amazing.

368
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:33,300
Be careful of your hands, Yongryul.

369
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:35,473
- Yeji.
- Yes?

370
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:37,273
Try it.

371
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:45,783
Yongryul, it's so good.

372
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:47,382
- Is it?
- Yes.

373
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:49,383
Dig in.

374
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,752
Why don't I wrap you one, too?

375
00:21:51,752 --> 00:21:53,928
Ssamjang.

376
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,962
- It's delicious.
- What a cutie.

377
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:06,303
Thank you.

378
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:09,433
Yongryul, I want a perilla leaf.

379
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,943
- A perilla leaf? Have some.
- Yes.

380
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:15,143
But they're stuck together. I can't take one off.

381
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:16,770
I'll help you.

382
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,413
Thank you.

383
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:21,949
The perilla leaf you helped take off.

384
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:24,912
Help her.

385
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:27,962
Darn it.

386
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:33,693
Seulhae, isn't it salty?

387
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:36,233
Hurry up and dig in.

388
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:00,683
(What?)

389
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:02,667
Quickly.

390
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:19,317
Forgive me.

391
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:24,312
Yongryul, why am I getting furious?

392
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:27,413
Yeji, let's eat.

393
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:29,261
Dig in.

394
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:39,620
I'm off to the restroom.

395
00:23:40,422 --> 00:23:42,706
Goodness!

396
00:23:44,762 --> 00:23:47,302
What do you think you're doing?

397
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,733
Officer Go is someone I really admire.

398
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,342
Take good care of her if she's your girlfriend.

399
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:55,158
It's not like I don't want to.

400
00:23:57,742 --> 00:24:00,782
We've got our reasons.

401
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:06,582
Seulhae, I don't like being nosy, but let me say this for you.

402
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:08,267
What is it?

403
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:11,693
Cha Chawoong is a goner.

404
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:14,933
He's too at ease. Break up with him.

405
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,032
I don't want to.

406
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:18,063
Are you going to live on his looks?

407
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:21,332
Is money everything? No, it isn't.

408
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:25,472
Raise your standards of men. Please.

409
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:27,712
Listen, we're in this situation...

410
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:33,683
But, Yeji, weren't you all over...

411
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:38,653
Chawoong in the past? You even wanted to get married to him.

412
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:42,622
Back then, I didn't know what love was.

413
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:47,193
It's an old story.

414
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:50,980
You should find yourself a sweet and reliable guy...

415
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,450
like Yongryul.

416
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:56,352
How frustrating.

417
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:06,480
Me! I'll drink in her stead.

418
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:10,077
Really? Then, what's your wish?

419
00:25:23,032 --> 00:25:26,062
Geez. Seriously?

420
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:29,032
Here it goes!

421
00:25:29,032 --> 00:25:31,473
Me! Gosh, it's me.

422
00:25:31,473 --> 00:25:34,143
Bottoms up!

423
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:36,372
- Bottoms up!
- Do it!

424
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:39,220
- You're a good drinker.
- Way to go!

425
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:43,112
- It's me again.
- She lost again.

426
00:25:43,112 --> 00:25:47,422
She's been drinking nonstop.

427
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,792
- Now then.
- He'll probably drink for her.

428
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:52,322
He will.

429
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:55,862
Drink it for her. Come on.

430
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:57,462
Yes, he is.

431
00:25:57,462 --> 00:26:00,202
- It's love.
- It seems so.

432
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:03,702
Forget it. You lost, so drink it. Hurry.

433
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:05,438
Okay.

434
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:08,987
Darn it.

435
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:13,583
Look!

436
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:26,393
More drinks, please! More!

437
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:28,463
More drinks!

438
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,033
- Seulhae?
- Drinks.

439
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,403
Are you okay?

440
00:26:32,403 --> 00:26:35,182
Yes, I am. That hurts.

441
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:43,872
For goodness' sake!

442
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:46,005
I'm terribly sorry.

443
00:26:46,883 --> 00:26:49,612
But can you take her home?

444
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:51,752
- What?
- What?

445
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:53,083
Darn it.

446
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,592
Excuse me! Hey!

447
00:26:55,592 --> 00:26:57,723
He's a wacko, isn't he?

448
00:26:57,723 --> 00:27:00,093
Yes, a total wacko.

449
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:05,213
- Right after my marriage, I had to come clean about this.
- Right.

450
00:27:07,463 --> 00:27:10,027
Welcome back, Mr. Cha.

451
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,221
Oh, my. You must've had grilled meat.

452
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:17,813
And I can tell you've had some drinks, too.

453
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:19,983
Hey. Stop it.

454
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:24,053
And drop that formality. You're 2,000 years older than me.

455
00:27:24,053 --> 00:27:26,753
You're making me look like a really bad guy.

456
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:28,236
Gosh.

457
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:40,569
The workers entering Nirvana must be stressing you out.

458
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:48,687
Send them off quickly and enjoy your dates.

459
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:55,442
Should I move?

460
00:27:55,442 --> 00:27:56,670
Why?

461
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,082
It's just...

462
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:01,530
this house is too big.

463
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:05,933
Once everyone leaves, I'll be alone.

464
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:08,633
It'll feel empty.

465
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:12,957
Yes, you're right.

466
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:17,770
But when they're gone,

467
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,340
what about work?

468
00:28:20,343 --> 00:28:23,198
Can you continue doing magic?

469
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,893
Probably not.

470
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:32,352
More than work right now,

471
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:36,352
the workers entering Nirvana are more important.

472
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:38,121
Right.

473
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:42,733
Get some rest.

474
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,688
Okay.

475
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:55,975
I saved this bottle for a lucky day.

476
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:58,489
And that's today.

477
00:29:02,112 --> 00:29:04,153
Here.

478
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:06,880
Drink.

479
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,340
Okay.

480
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,608
By the way,

481
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:25,072
why did you record my son requesting you...

482
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:27,903
to get rid of Cha Chawoong?

483
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:30,612
- To threaten him?
- What?

484
00:29:30,612 --> 00:29:35,952
You sure came up with a nice plan to stab me in the back.

485
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:39,533
How did you find out?

486
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:55,703
What... have you done to me?

487
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:59,443
Did you think I'd be useless without you?

488
00:29:59,443 --> 00:30:01,973
I treated you like an actual human being.

489
00:30:01,973 --> 00:30:04,672
But how dare you mess with my son?

490
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:07,083
A scumbag like you?

491
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:11,163
Cha Chawoong... Darn it!

492
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:18,222
The voice recording.

493
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:21,690
I reserved an e-mail to be sent out to the press.

494
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:25,221
If you leave me to die,

495
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:29,866
you're all doomed, too.

496
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,681
What a hassle.

497
00:30:34,643 --> 00:30:36,446
Hey, you...

498
00:30:40,312 --> 00:30:43,012
Why? Why would you release him?

499
00:30:43,012 --> 00:30:45,422
It's clear he instigated a crime!

500
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:47,383
Lack of evidence and being mentally unfit to investigate.

501
00:30:47,383 --> 00:30:51,422
But we have more than enough evidence.

502
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:54,027
It's an order from the higher-up. Darn it.

503
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:57,433
We'll question him again in time.

504
00:30:57,433 --> 00:31:01,157
What? Got it.

505
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:05,802
Captain, Badger committed suicide.

506
00:31:05,802 --> 00:31:08,372
What? Suicide?

507
00:31:08,372 --> 00:31:10,042
Captain Seo, we'll be right back.

508
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,112
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

509
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:14,069
What's going on?

510
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:16,367
Go Seulhae, standby.

511
00:31:21,223 --> 00:31:23,552
He committed suicide the moment he got released.

512
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:25,022
Isn't it weird?

513
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:28,106
Maybe he was guilty of something.

514
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:34,342
But who cares... what happens to people like Badger?

515
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:36,802
It's better if he dies quickly.

516
00:31:36,802 --> 00:31:39,323
Our work gets easier, too.

517
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:03,533
Soeun, let's have some tangerines.

518
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,602
Hold on, after I play once more.

519
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:08,802
Next week is the competition, right?

520
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,802
You're finally playing that song.

521
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:13,611
Yes, but it's really hard.

522
00:32:18,443 --> 00:32:20,491
I can't believe myself!

523
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:37,886
Soon, I won't be able to see this anymore.

524
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:41,311
I don't want to enter Nirvana.

525
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:58,992
Thinking of your resignation wish, Assistant Manager?

526
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:04,493
Just call me by my name. It's not business hours anyway.

527
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:06,622
Don't think too hard.

528
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:08,792
Isn't there anything you wanted?

529
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:13,376
What's the point when I'm leaving this world? It's useless.

530
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:19,772
How about something... you wanted to do when you were alive?

531
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:22,697
Like a dream you couldn't achieve.

532
00:33:22,697 --> 00:33:24,583
A dream?

533
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:34,630
When I was young, I suffered from polio. My legs became weak.

534
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:39,326
The light is green. Please cross.

535
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:50,338
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm okay.

536
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:58,213
So I received lots of help from people.

537
00:33:58,213 --> 00:34:03,682
To become someone... who can help others too, I studied hard.

538
00:34:03,682 --> 00:34:06,287
That was my dream.

539
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:22,803
Excuse me!

540
00:34:22,803 --> 00:34:25,119
Help, I'm in here!

541
00:34:30,312 --> 00:34:32,949
Mom!

542
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,682
Help me, Mom.

543
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:36,938
Mom.

544
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:39,683
In the end, my dream was only a dream.

545
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:43,410
I couldn't even save myself and died.

546
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:48,562
So after I died, I became more obsessed with games and animations.

547
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:54,116
Because in those moments, I felt like a strong hero, just like Lulu.

548
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:57,880
Lulu? Who's that?

549
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,303
You don't know Supergirl Lulu?

550
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:02,872
The series started in 1998 and lasted for 20 years.

551
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:04,573
It was remade and rebooted five times.

552
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:06,082
A total of 127 media mixers, including comics, animations,

553
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:08,113
movies, games, songs, musicals, and more,

554
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:10,582
were produced in 18 countries.

555
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:13,452
She always ranked among the top three...

556
00:35:13,452 --> 00:35:15,892
in the monthly selection, "Who's the greatest hero?"

557
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:19,772
How in the world do you not know her?

558
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:23,726
You've got a lot to learn, New Recruit.

559
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:27,662
In short, you like Lulu. Right?

560
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:30,772
So do it. Supergirl Lulu.

561
00:35:30,772 --> 00:35:34,512
What? How?

562
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:44,452
Come on, that's an impossible favor.

563
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:46,582
How can I make a hero?

564
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:48,892
Why not? The orphanage charity performance.

565
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:52,122
We can have Supergirl Lulu as the concept.

566
00:35:52,122 --> 00:35:53,562
Assistant Manager Kang can be Lulu,

567
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:56,392
and the others can either be bad guys or citizens.

568
00:35:56,392 --> 00:35:59,180
- How about it?
- A play?

569
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:03,960
But it's a waste to use that as my resignation wish.

570
00:36:05,642 --> 00:36:09,102
Well, I haven't thought of any yet. Maybe that's a good idea.

571
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:14,844
- What are you doing?
- We should go all out.

572
00:36:14,844 --> 00:36:18,736
Lulu's costume has been ordered.

573
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:20,923
I'll write the scenario.

574
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:23,153
The episode with Black the Thief sounds the best.

575
00:36:23,153 --> 00:36:26,136
Which one should I choose?

576
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:30,033
That's right! Can you ask Officer Go to do the voice-over?

577
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:32,932
Her voice is almost identical to Lulu's.

578
00:36:32,932 --> 00:36:35,732
And tell her to come to practice later, okay?

579
00:36:38,202 --> 00:36:40,630
Someone's excited.

580
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:54,851
It's been a while.

581
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:01,223
Right. I hear you were promoted.

582
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:04,163
My girlfriend, Seulhae, informed me.

583
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:06,163
Congratulations.

584
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:14,164
Know your place.

585
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:25,982
(What?)

586
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:35,341
Couldn't you have waited? Always so impatient, aren't you?

587
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:39,303
Look who it is. It's been a while.

588
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:40,763
He's Officer Go's first love.

589
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:43,590
- Seriously?
- What?

590
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:46,973
You should ask him to the show on Saturday.

591
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,473
He can be our extra set of hands.

592
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:50,672
It seems he can do some heavy lifting.

593
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:53,776
That's your job, New Recruit.

594
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:59,973
Sorry? Did you say something?

595
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:04,355
Of course not. I was only mumbling to myself.

596
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,533
By the way, I can't make it that day.

597
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:13,613
Madam Shaman Na and I will be burying the sealed urn.

598
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:15,713
During Saturday's show,

599
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:18,652
Choi Geom won't be by Cha Chawoong's side.

600
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:33,452
That jerk always gets on my nerves.

601
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:37,517
His overall vibe seems to have changed.

602
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,702
Voice acting?

603
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:49,005
Gosh, it's not something I have confidence in.

604
00:38:51,403 --> 00:38:53,942
I can't say no though considering who's asking.

605
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:55,442
Thanks.

606
00:38:55,442 --> 00:38:57,613
Did you come all this way to tell me that?

607
00:38:57,613 --> 00:39:02,553
Well, I wanted to know if you got home safely yesterday.

608
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:05,244
I'm really sorry.

609
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:07,025
Here.

610
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:09,194
No!

611
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:11,922
Get a grip on yourselves.

612
00:39:11,922 --> 00:39:14,742
You can't let your guard down like this.

613
00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:18,093
Gosh, that was close.

614
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:19,033
Chawoong, you should go.

615
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:20,963
- Just get going.
- Shoo!

616
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:24,734
- Okay, fine.
- Get going.

617
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:28,168
Then, I'll see you later.

618
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:31,284
What...

619
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:36,522
That was close.

620
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:43,503
Hard, isn't it?

621
00:39:43,503 --> 00:39:45,053
It'll only be a few more days.

622
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:47,723
Everyone will enter Nirvana by then.

623
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:49,571
Right.

624
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:53,363
I'm not all that happy about it though.

625
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:57,594
To think that you and the other employees will be gone...

626
00:39:58,173 --> 00:40:00,688
I'll miss you all.

627
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:04,573
Goodbyes are hard, but that's the natural order.

628
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:07,783
I'm actually more concerned about Chawoong.

629
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:08,783
Why?

630
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:12,383
He won't be able to see ghosts anymore...

631
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:15,622
which will end his career as a magician.

632
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,692
It won't be easy for him to make it on his own.

633
00:40:18,692 --> 00:40:21,257
You're right.

634
00:40:21,257 --> 00:40:25,593
He may be prickly, but magic always has him beaming.

635
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:27,985
That's what saddens me.

636
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:32,002
I hope you'll take good care of him.

637
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:33,403
Can I count on you to do so?

638
00:40:33,403 --> 00:40:35,740
Yes, of course.

639
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,770
You can count on me.

640
00:40:39,783 --> 00:40:44,539
I see you're just as kind and full of life, Princess.

641
00:40:46,323 --> 00:40:47,923
Seulhae.

642
00:40:50,892 --> 00:40:54,823
Are you perhaps free this Saturday?

643
00:40:54,823 --> 00:40:56,033
Am I free?

644
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:58,332
I thought the team could eat out.

645
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,432
We never threw you a welcome party.

646
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:02,852
With Detective Byun and Detective An.

647
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:08,343
I'm afraid I'll be helping out at an orphanage charity event.

648
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:12,113
A charity event?

649
00:41:12,113 --> 00:41:14,296
Just you?

650
00:41:14,296 --> 00:41:17,860
Does this involve Cha Chawoong?

651
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:21,088
Yes.

652
00:41:26,022 --> 00:41:29,863
That's nice of you guys. No can do, then.

653
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:31,907
We'll grab dinner some other time.

654
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:38,645
What if...

655
00:41:40,702 --> 00:41:42,843
- I lent a hand.
- Sorry?

656
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:46,447
The charity event, I mean. I'll be there.

657
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:48,843

Well...

Black the Thief.

660
00:41:59,292 --> 00:42:03,233
You will witness the power of Supergirl Lulu.

661
00:42:05,863 --> 00:42:09,311
A girl like you challenging the likes of me?

662
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:11,632
What a laugh.

663

- Lulu lala pong!
- Stop!

665
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:22,753

- Why?

666

You got it wrong once again.

667
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:28,753
It's Lulu lali Lulu pong, not Lulu lala pong.

- Focus, will you?

669

Sorry about that.

670
00:42:33,622 --> 00:42:36,432
Can't you let it slide though? I doubt the kids will notice.

671
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:39,193
It's Lulu's signature catchphrase.

672
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:43,903
It's the spell... that gives Lulu the strength she never had.

673
00:42:43,903 --> 00:42:47,972
So saying whatever you want... is not an option!

Seulhae, why don't you work on that on your own.

679

Meanwhile, we'll practice the air drop.

Get practicing.

Gosh.

- Sure.

692

- Like this?
- Gosh.

696

- Reach up high.
- Got it.

697
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:44,332
Your gaze is most important.

698
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:46,633
Look down and then suddenly look up.

699
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:48,463
- Right ahead of you.
- Look up.

700
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:50,711
There you go.

Why don't we try it again?

Why don't we try that again?

You have already perfected it.

She should try it once more.

Nice. Right?

712
00:44:16,492 --> 00:44:19,133
- Okay, but just once more.
- All right.

713

- Yes, of course.

It was no big deal.

721
00:44:42,753 --> 00:44:46,062
When it comes to the truth, keeping it buried...

722
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:47,792
is easier than exposing it.

723
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:49,693
All you have to do is stay put.

724
00:44:49,693 --> 00:44:53,432
No longer will I protect and serve the people.

Badger committed suicide by consuming poison?

735
00:45:20,993 --> 00:45:23,662
According to the autopsy, at least.

Good riddance.

I can't believe he killed himself though.

739
00:45:28,803 --> 00:45:31,772
But he didn't seem like the type to commit suicide.

740
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:34,972
You should've seen him plead with me in tears.

741
00:45:34,972 --> 00:45:36,113
That must've done a number on his mind.

742
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:38,142
He has always been a wimp, you see.

743

How did he know... that we were out searching for Miyoung's body?

985
01:03:19,432 --> 01:03:21,680
We saw that.

986
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,503
Give us some privacy, will you?

987
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:26,542
You can be a brat who lacks in four ways.

988
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:28,812
Stop messing with me!

989
01:03:28,812 --> 01:03:31,412
Those who are to leave should do so as soon as possible.

990
01:03:31,412 --> 01:03:33,452
Then, we'll be guaranteed our privacy.

991
01:03:33,452 --> 01:03:37,222
We'll be leaving once Dongcheol marries.

992
01:03:37,222 --> 01:03:39,753
Consider it as our parting gift.

993
01:03:39,753 --> 01:03:41,863
It's to remember the employees of Magic Factory.

994
01:03:41,863 --> 01:03:44,794
Officer Go, it's more than enough.

995
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:46,733
Thank you.

996
01:03:46,733 --> 01:03:50,573
Once we leave, this life will be our past life.

997
01:03:50,573 --> 01:03:53,132
I won't remember it,

998
01:03:53,132 --> 01:03:55,142
but it sure was a good one.

999
01:03:55,142 --> 01:03:56,673
Thanks to you,

1000
01:03:56,673 --> 01:04:00,582
my time as the head of Magic Factory was anything but lonely.

1001
01:04:00,582 --> 01:04:03,082
The best employees I could ever ask for.

1002
01:04:03,783 --> 01:04:05,823
I won't forget you.

1003
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:08,361
Thank you.

1004
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,000
