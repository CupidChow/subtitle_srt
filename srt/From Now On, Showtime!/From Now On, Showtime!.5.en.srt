Oh, nothing.

41

You must've seen his face somewhere.

00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,699
That's right. The Full Moon Murderer from ten years ago.

43
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,669
My dad was the police detective who died back then.

44
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:29,033
It was such a famous case,

45
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:32,287
so some people still remember his face.

46
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,747
I see.

47
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:40,013
He was such a competent cop.

48
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:42,848
He was trained in boxing, Judo, and Taekwondo.

49

And he had the highest case clearance rate.

Who knew he'd die because of a shaman?

51

Shaman?

52
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:56,299
The shaman intervened while they were trying to arrest the perp.

53
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,823
That's why they lost the perp and my dad...

54
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:03,883
Right. I do recall reading an article about that.

55
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,753
But wasn't that shaman...

56
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:09,378
eventually released due to lack of evidence?

57
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:11,702
That's what makes me even more furious.

58
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:15,549
My dad's partner, who was with him at the scene, told me what happened.

59

I was so angry.

60
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:19,918
I visited the shaman to take it up with him,

61
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,467
but the house was empty.

62
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:26,793
I heard he fled with his family.

63
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:31,124
What a coward, right?

64
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:37,779
Too bad.

Me? Why?

67
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:45,997
My dad always told me

68
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:49,549
that a detective with a good partner is bound to be successful.

69
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,889
I wanted to tell him that he can put his worries to rest

70

now that I'm working with such a special partner.

71

I'm not your "partner."

72
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,329
We're just using each other for the time being.

73

Come on. You can call it what you want,

74
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:04,039
but how many perps have we caught together so far?

75
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,769
A psychic medium teamed up with a beautiful lady cop... to catch all the bad guys.

76
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:11,393
Like Superman and Lois, don't you think?

77
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:16,349
That reminds me. At the scene of the Full Moon Murderer,

78
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:20,448
they found remnants of some shamanic rituals,

79
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:24,419
so some people thought the killer could be a member of a cult.

80
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:28,665
But perhaps, it had something to do...

81
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:31,663
with ghosts and stuff like that.

82
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:37,398
I feel like we can find some clues if we investigate it together.

83
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:39,738
A hit-and-run, illegal gambling,

84
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:42,026
and a serial murder case now?

85
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:44,378
Enough is enough.

86
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,949
Consider it in a good light. Just this once, please?

87
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,067
Please, Partner.

88

Come on, Partner.

89
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:05,677
Come on. Don't cry.

90
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:10,219

91
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,924
too delicious.

92

What was this called again? "Pyramid"?

93
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,701
Tiramisu.

94
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:29,309
It even has such a beautiful name.

95
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:34,088
Tiramisu.

96
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:37,960
Try it with Americano. They pair so well together.

97

Where have you been? I can't believe you just left like that!

107

If you lock eyes with them or converse,

116

you'll suffer from an illness that could lead to death.

117

Mr. Cha, what happened to your face? It's like you aged overnight.

127

Goodness.

130
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:46,512
You're the face of Magic Factory. You need to take care of yourself.

131
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:49,889
You know, Aris is the model

132

for the Radiant Glow Face Mask. I heard it's really good.

If you order ten boxes, you get Aris' poster for free.

Should I order some for you?

They need a clip for a segment called "Magician's Daily Life."

140

Gosh.

141

Do I have to do it? What a nuisance.

142
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,318
Yes, you have to. Lee Eungyeol is doing it, too.

We don't want to be excluded.

That's it. Yes.

Come on. It's okay.

154
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:15,669
It's something that everyone goes through.

155
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:17,909
Some experience it earlier than others. That's all.

156
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,238
I looked into it for you.

157
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:23,909
For men, beginning in adolescence, their testosterone levels rise to 12 nanograms per milliliter.

158
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,248
Then it begins to decline slowly once they reach age 25.

159

What are you guys talking about?

161
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,018
Come on. You're going through male menopause.

162
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,958
Look. You're showing all the symptoms.

163

"Insomnia, loss of appetite,

164

frequent sighing, lethargy, suddenly becoming irritable."

165
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:41,799
You were always irritable to begin with.

166

Goodness. What's he doing?

184
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:45,112
He must be drunk or something.

Get out! You little... Get out.

197

His most recent drama was an epic fail.

That's why he became dependent on drugs.

Hey, drug cases involving celebrities have been on the rise.

207

I bet there are dealers backed by a drug trafficking ring.

208

Go through Kang Soochan's phone and make a list of people who used drugs with him

or were involved in any other ways.

They say cleaning helps you combat depression.

It's good exercise, and it gives you a sense of accomplishment.

Let's be honest. We assist a magician. We're not housekeepers.

We'll tell him we won't do things that aren't on our task lists.

to say yes to the joint magic show with Aris!

No, there's no need.

00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:09,873
What about your crew members? Don't you practice together?

329
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:13,372
I'm such a perfectionist that I don't trust others.

330
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:16,342
At this rate, people will change the channel right away.

Why would that happen when I'm in the show?

332
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:22,113
Because you're the only one that appears in it.

333
00:23:22,113 --> 00:23:25,782
Staying at home all day is going to look dull... and quiet.

334
00:23:25,782 --> 00:23:27,953
Isn't there anything dynamic?

335
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:31,041
I see, dynamic.

337

Mr. Cha, is walking all there is to it?

338
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:44,102
Yes. I'm just taking a walk.

339
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:45,342
It's a dynamic activity.

340

345
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:01,129
Catch it, Dalgu.

346
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:04,168
Mr. Cha.

347
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:08,293
How about showing that kid some magic...

348
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,362
and getting his surprised look?

349

350

That's simple.

Watch carefully.

353

Now, you have to guess where this coin is.

354
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:39,162
Will you really treat me to a corn dog if I get it right?

355
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:42,362
Yes, only if you get it right.

356
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:44,902
Then let's have Dalgu guess, too.

357

He's super smart.

358

If the dog guesses right, I'll treat you to two corn dogs.

359
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:52,363
Really?

360
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:01,837
The right.

361
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:08,569
What? But I saw it go in that hand.

362
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,497
Is it the left hand?

363
00:25:13,793 --> 00:25:17,397
What? Where did it go?

364

Too bad, but buy your own corn dog.

Here's the 50 cent.

366

Dalgu found it.

367
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,783
He's amazingly smart.

368

Thanks, kid. Order two corn dogs.

Hold it right there. I'm not done yet.

Hey, kid and the dog. How about another round?

No, don't bother. That just now was enough footage.

00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,512
Anyway, that dance doesn't suit my stage.

494
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:41,452
- Don't you have anything elegant?
- What?

495
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:44,417
Hey, have you gone mad?

496
00:35:48,932 --> 00:35:50,392
[Dalgu's]

497
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:54,262
I'm worried my kid is taking too much of your time, Officer.

498
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:55,533
No, he's not.

499
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:59,473
I'm the one feeling sorry for not being able to find Dalgu.

500
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:04,513
Because he has no siblings, his attachment to Dalgu is quite special.

501
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:06,443
Did you have him for long?

502
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:11,813
He came to us after he retired when he was seven, so it's been about two years.

503
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:14,082
Retired?

504
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:16,723
He was a drug-sniffing dog.

505
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:18,457
I see.

506
00:36:22,863 --> 00:36:24,992
Do you want some coffee, Chawoong?

507
00:36:24,992 --> 00:36:27,303
It's the one I advertised.

508
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:29,783
Drink a cup, and it'll make you happy.

509
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:37,159
No, thanks. I'm more comfortable being cranky.

510
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:42,852
Then drink it later.

511
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:45,013
It's really good.

512
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:52,762
A narcotics case?

513
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,662
You're so cool.

514
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:56,033
No, I'm not.

515
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:58,263
We did some digging. Celebrities and politicians are both involved.

516
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:00,803
It won't be an easy case.

517
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:04,647
Nevertheless, you'll do a fine job.

518
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:10,742
Isn't the civil police unit giving you a hard time? You're already busy as is.

519
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:13,743
- I'll ask if you can be pulled...
- Don't. It's okay.

520
00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:16,613
I'm enjoying it. Why do you ask?

521
00:37:16,613 --> 00:37:18,113
Well...

522
00:37:19,682 --> 00:37:22,343
I was just wondering.

523
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:25,264
It's a lot of fun.

524
00:37:30,093 --> 00:37:31,941
Mr. Cha!

525
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:40,603
We meet again.

526
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,242
Is this your house?

527
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:45,283
My practice room.

528
00:37:46,412 --> 00:37:49,782
Aren't you the officer that solved the case with Chawoong?

529
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:51,466
Yes, I am.

530
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,323
By chance, are you Aris?

531
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:58,493
You're so pretty!

532
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:00,662
You are too.

533
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:02,532
Even your boyfriend is good-looking.

534
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:04,453
Boyfriend?

535
00:38:06,263 --> 00:38:09,832
He's not my boyfriend, but he sure is handsome.

536
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:11,602
Thank you.

537
00:38:11,602 --> 00:38:13,803
Handsome, my foot.

538
00:38:13,803 --> 00:38:16,772
I became Chawoong's magic partner

539
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:21,712
but was he always... so indifferent and a workaholic, even when working with you, Officer?

540
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:24,053
Indifferent? Me?

541
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:26,037
That's ridiculous.

542
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:31,323
- Even when I have this?
- That's my limited edition CD!

543
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:33,992
I don't even have one. How did you get it?

544
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:39,032
Well, I'm extremely interested in my partner.

545
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:43,316
We should leave. Allow me to drive you home safely.

546

Mr. Cha!

547
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:52,642
Well, this! It's a missing dog flyer.

548
00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:55,412
Call me when you come across him.

549

- Have you seen him?

552
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:07,863
It's not my business. And as you can tell, I'm busy.

553
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:10,262
I can't take part in the civil police unit for a while.

Pretending like you didn't know my song earlier, were you playing games with me?

But I'm not into that.

Whatever, it was a total failure.

I don't care anymore.

593
00:42:25,352 --> 00:42:28,478
So in the chat, asking to get meat

594
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:30,609
meant actually getting the real meat?

595
00:42:30,693 --> 00:42:33,141
And getting high...

596
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:37,151
was used to express how good the meat was?

597

Plus, that hair is for style.

Don't I look cool?

- You too?
- I did it for hygienic reasons.

600
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:50,129
I'm quite a clean freak.

601
00:42:51,483 --> 00:42:54,538
What do we do? The hair drug test is the most accurate.

602

Kang Soochan belonged to that agency until last year,

00:44:23,242 --> 00:44:25,288
and the other performed together

627
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,799
with Aris from that agency, until recently.

628
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:30,868
And Assemblyman Jang's son used to go out with Aris.

629
00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:32,428
Once Kang Soochan gives his statement,

Why isn't she here when we're about to film?

634
00:44:46,778 --> 00:44:49,211
She hasn't been picking up.

635
00:44:49,403 --> 00:44:51,765
Where the heck is she?

636
00:44:53,073 --> 00:44:54,859
I'm just as annoyed, you know.

637
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,185
This is exactly why I was skeptical.

638
00:44:57,673 --> 00:44:59,353
I'm holding you accountable.

639

641
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:09,495
As if that would ever be the case.

642
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:13,548
My gosh!

He's not here.

Where...? Oh, right. Do you have him tied up outside?

648

Officer Go?

649
00:45:30,713 --> 00:45:34,758
You're the officer who was on the news with Mr. Cha.

650
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:35,990
That's right.

651
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:39,513
I couldn't be more delighted to see you.

652
00:45:40,653 --> 00:45:44,569
I know this is sudden, but could you perhaps...

653
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:47,239
be Mr. Cha's partner in his magic show?

654
00:45:47,323 --> 00:45:51,379
If not, his show will have to be canceled.

655
00:45:51,463 --> 00:45:52,748
Hold on a second.

656
00:45:52,832 --> 00:45:55,118
I thought I was doing magic tricks with a celebrity.

657
00:45:55,202 --> 00:45:58,748
She's not a celebrity, but a police officer.

658
00:45:58,832 --> 00:46:01,759
She's been on the news and all over social media.

659
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,728
Officer Go is, by definition, a celebrity.

660
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:07,859
Enough with the gibberish and find me her replacement.

661
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:10,305
But... Wait.

662
00:46:11,383 --> 00:46:13,711
Officer Go, please consider it!

663
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:20,078
Dalgu is dead?

664
00:46:20,162 --> 00:46:21,434
That's right.

665
00:46:21,923 --> 00:46:23,685
This...

666
00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:27,885
Are you sure you saw this red necklace?

667
00:46:28,803 --> 00:46:30,788
I don't think I did.

668
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,972
But there's a chance it wasn't him.

669
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:34,919
Just leave if you don't believe me.

670
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:36,489
I have a show to film.

671
00:46:36,573 --> 00:46:39,029
How do you expect to do that without a partner?

672
00:46:39,113 --> 00:46:41,328
Mr. Cha, ask her.

673
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:43,453
You're out of options.

674
00:46:43,753 --> 00:46:47,268
He's right. She's the only one who knows your secret.

675
00:46:47,352 --> 00:46:49,768
It'll be easier since you can tell her everything.

676
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:53,879
If you can't ask her, your other option will be to give up.

677
00:46:53,963 --> 00:46:56,149
Lee Eungyeol will end up winning,

678
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:59,305
and it'll take longer to achieve your goal.

679
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:02,862
Without a partner, your show will be canceled.

680
00:47:04,173 --> 00:47:07,388
If I can be of any help, count me in.

681
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:10,652
The show's director was practically begging just now.

682
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:15,658
In return, you'll look for the dead dog... once we're done.

683
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:18,498
Didn't you say it might not be Dalgu?

684
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:20,550
If it is though,

685
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:23,138
he should at least be found for a proper burial.

686
00:47:23,222 --> 00:47:24,698
Dalgu...

687
00:47:25,023 --> 00:47:28,279
went through brutal training as a drug-sniffing dog.

688
00:47:28,363 --> 00:47:30,965
He served the people well,

689
00:47:31,193 --> 00:47:33,719
so a proper send-off is in order.

690
00:47:33,803 --> 00:47:36,388
[Green Room: Aris]

691
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:40,089
Goodness. My Aris.

692
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:44,577
I wonder if Aris is ready to take the stage.

693
00:47:48,642 --> 00:47:51,222
Why did it have to be this type of concept?

694
00:47:51,713 --> 00:47:54,555
Oh, no!

695
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:00,857
I can't take it back since I offered first.

696
00:48:01,093 --> 00:48:03,248
Darn it! From now on,

697
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:06,572
you are to think before you act.

698
00:48:07,003 --> 00:48:09,719
What on earth? Why did Officer Go come out of this room?

699
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,527
What about Aris? Where's Aris?

700
00:48:13,372 --> 00:48:16,388
Hold on. Why is she in a nightgown?

701
00:48:16,472 --> 00:48:17,996
Whatever!

702
00:48:19,242 --> 00:48:22,842
All right. It'll only be a brief moment of embarrassment.

703
00:48:23,452 --> 00:48:26,897
I can do it. Just do it!

704
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:28,632
Whatever. I'll just do it!

705
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:53,558
All you have to do is be still.

706
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:55,328
We'll be changing your clothes for you.

707
00:48:55,412 --> 00:48:57,629
- My clothes?
- Just the outer layer.

708
00:48:57,713 --> 00:48:59,529
And it'll be done by Areum, my female employee.

709
00:48:59,613 --> 00:49:02,268
I get the clothes, but what about the dancing?

710
00:49:02,352 --> 00:49:04,596
I saw it on the cue sheet.

711
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:07,709
Put your faith in my employees.

712
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:13,149
From start to finish, you'll stay still... while loosened up.

713
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:15,519
You might suddenly become a good dancer...

714
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,548
or get lifted into the air, but don't let that faze you.

715
00:49:18,548 --> 00:49:20,057
Just keep smiling.

716
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,988
That's all I ask of you. Got it?

717
00:49:22,988 --> 00:49:24,220
Sure.

718
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:27,098
I'm nervous though.

719
00:49:27,182 --> 00:49:30,782
Gosh. I can't have you nervous on stage.

720
00:49:31,613 --> 00:49:33,839
Hold on. How about some coffee?

721
00:49:33,923 --> 00:49:36,768
Do you have any? Something sweet will do.

722
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:39,937
Oh, wait. Aris gave me some.

723
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:42,049
Here it is.

724
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:45,279
Are you ready?

725
00:49:45,363 --> 00:49:47,419
The show will go on in five, so please join us outside.

726
00:49:47,503 --> 00:49:49,541
Right. Sure thing.

727
00:49:52,003 --> 00:49:53,645
Gosh.

728
00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:19,246
- Look.
- My gosh.

729
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:22,462
It's a flying rose.

730
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:25,153
- Can you believe it?
- No way.

731
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:53,509
No, wait. Officer Go, please stay still.

732
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:55,638
Stay still. Officer Go, no.

733
00:51:55,722 --> 00:51:57,967
Oh, no. Mr. Cha!

734
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,690
♫ You're not here with me ♫

735
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:25,640
♫ Am I late? ♫

736
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,610
♫ Have I wondered too long? ♫

737
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:40,940
♫ In the calm wind, it gets darker ♫

738
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:48,660
♫ The light shines on you, us ♫

739
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,750
♫ I'll be there even if you don't come ♫

740
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:54,939
I'm sorry for almost ruining the show at the end.

741
00:52:55,023 --> 00:52:57,538
My shoes were about to fall off.

742
00:52:57,622 --> 00:52:59,669
Right. It's fine.

743
00:52:59,753 --> 00:53:01,839
Anyway...

744
00:53:03,122 --> 00:53:05,127
Were you injured?

745
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:07,171
No. I'm fine.

746
00:53:07,262 --> 00:53:08,511
Right.

747
00:53:08,903 --> 00:53:10,307
Oh, the ring.

748
00:53:11,702 --> 00:53:12,987
It won't come off.

749
00:53:13,642 --> 00:53:16,079
- Just a second.
- Is it stuck?

750
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:18,893
Let me see.

751
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,870
♫ You're not here with me ♫

752
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:27,770
♫ Am I late? ♫

753
00:53:29,352 --> 00:53:30,732
What's wrong with this?

754
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:39,049
What the... Gosh, the ring. It came off.

755
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,118
The ring came off.

756
00:53:41,202 --> 00:53:42,715
It came off.

757
00:53:44,803 --> 00:53:48,518
Oh, wait. Shouldn't you get changed?

758
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:51,254
Right, I should.

759
00:53:54,543 --> 00:53:57,069
Is Officer Go all right? She gave me quite a scare.

760
00:53:57,153 --> 00:53:59,098
It would've been a disaster had you not rescued her.

761
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:00,799
I thought it was cool.

762
00:54:00,883 --> 00:54:03,569
Gather your things and let's get going.

763
00:54:03,653 --> 00:54:06,638
Hold on. Where's Choi Geom?

764
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:09,078
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him in a while.

765
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,000
He was excited to see Aris in real life.

766
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,700
Maybe he's off crying somewhere.

767
00:54:13,702 --> 00:54:15,023
Darn it.

768
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,569
I can do it. Just do it!

769
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,431
Whatever. I'll just do it!

770
00:54:33,431 --> 00:54:35,903
She has the same face...

771
00:54:35,903 --> 00:54:39,490
and moles that resemble the Big Dipper.

772
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:41,733
Could it be...

773
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:43,755
I doubt it. No way.

774
00:54:43,755 --> 00:54:47,993
Over 2,000 years, I've seen women who have similar faces.

775
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,589
Dalgu!

776
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:56,019
- Got it.
- Was he found?

777
00:54:56,019 --> 00:55:00,255
No, he isn't in the lobby or on the rooftop.

778
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,859
- Where could he have gone?
- Dalgu?

779
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:05,629
- Dalgu.
- Dalgu.

780
00:55:05,629 --> 00:55:07,399
Wait. He's over there.

781
00:55:07,399 --> 00:55:09,407
Dalgu!

782
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,939
Gosh, what on earth? What is it?

783
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:16,029
What is this about?

784
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,010
What?

785
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:25,148
He sniffed the coffee and then sat down.

786
00:55:25,148 --> 00:55:26,689
Maybe he wants a sip.

787
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:28,897
Coffee?

788
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:30,388
Sitting after sniffing.

789
00:55:30,388 --> 00:55:33,820
Drug-sniffing dogs do that after sniffing drugs.

790
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:44,431
This. You said Aris gave it to you?

791
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,225
That coffee packet.

792
00:55:55,225 --> 00:55:57,049
That dog was trained to sniff drugs.

793
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:59,953
He barked, knowing that it contained drugs.

794
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,218
The driver killed him since it wouldn't back off.

795
00:56:04,218 --> 00:56:06,963
- Drugs, you say?
- Yes.

796
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,855
This.

797
00:56:08,855 --> 00:56:12,368
Aris gave it to Mr. Cha, and I'm suspicious of the content.

798
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,868
Detective Na, have NFS test what's in the packet.

799
00:56:14,868 --> 00:56:17,190
Yes, Sir.

800
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,709
So, Mr. Cha was also in possession of drugs.

801
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:23,448
Come on. He's not like that. You know it as well as I do.

802
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:26,529
No, I don't know him at all.

803
00:56:26,529 --> 00:56:28,149
That's not what I meant.

804
00:56:28,149 --> 00:56:31,919
You shouldn't trust people easily especially as a cop.

805
00:56:31,919 --> 00:56:36,203
You're mistaken if you think he lets you see who he truly is.

806
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,707
Darn it. Are you kidding me?

807
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,008
They already took everything and made a run for it.

808
00:56:56,008 --> 00:56:58,413
We must have a leak.

809
00:56:58,413 --> 00:57:00,769
Who's the darn rat?

810
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:08,943
Even when I have this? I'm extremely interested in my partner.

811
00:57:08,943 --> 00:57:13,115
We should leave. Allow me to drive you home safely.

812
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:18,428
Check all the CCTV footage from around the area and along the estimated escape routes.

813
00:57:18,428 --> 00:57:20,416
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

814
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,508
Why are you asking me where Aris is?

815
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:28,733
You seemed close that day. Am I wrong?

816
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:31,690
We had only just met that day.

817
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:34,313
Anyway, this doesn't involve me.

818
00:57:34,313 --> 00:57:37,618
She brought a packet of coffee and kept offering it to me...

819
00:57:37,618 --> 00:57:39,218
saying it would make me feel good.

820
00:57:39,218 --> 00:57:42,711
It bothered me which is why I informed Officer Go.

821
00:57:42,711 --> 00:57:44,342
All right.

822
00:57:44,342 --> 00:57:47,223
I'll have you summoned if I have more questions.

823
00:57:47,223 --> 00:57:50,028
Is this what I get for tipping the police?

824
00:57:50,028 --> 00:57:52,792
No wonder Koreans don't report crimes.

825
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,673
I'm suspicious because it's you of all people.

826
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,709
What do you mean by that?

827
00:58:04,709 --> 00:58:07,330
The shaman Cha Sageum.

828
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:09,252
He's your grandfather.

829
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,372
So?

830
00:58:14,372 --> 00:58:16,828
Being in the civil police unit improved your public image...

831
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:19,472
and many ad campaigns came your way.

832
00:58:19,472 --> 00:58:21,552
Don't you think you've had enough?

833

Why should I even be hearing this from you?

834
00:58:24,589 --> 00:58:26,633
Officer Go.

835
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:29,867
Her father died because of your grandfather.

836
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,853
I thought you should know that.

837
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,622
Or maybe you already did.

838
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,162
Stop taking advantage of Seulhae...

839
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,675
and stay out of her life.

840

Whether I take advantage of her or vanish from her life...

841
00:58:55,229 --> 00:58:57,575
is up to me to decide.

842
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,123
I shouldn't have to take this from you,

843
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,561

Goodness. Are you that thrilled?

846

Mr. Cha, Dalgu must be at ease now.

847
00:59:33,399 --> 00:59:35,868
It's only a matter of time before the criminals are caught.

848
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:37,669
Of course. They will soon be arrested.

849
00:59:37,669 --> 00:59:41,305
Officer Go handed in the evidence they needed.

850
00:59:41,305 --> 00:59:44,948
Has Officer Go called you since then?

851
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:48,592
I won't take her calls and will avoid her however I can.

852
00:59:48,592 --> 00:59:53,470
I'm done doing anything that is related to or is requested by Go Seulhae.

853
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:56,392
I'm sick and tired of the dog, too. Take him outside.

854
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,217
Dalgu, come on. Come on.

855
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:06,079
Did you get into an argument with Officer Go by any chance?

[Virtue Power]

857

You still need to fully stack my virtue power though.

- Helping Officer Go...
- So what?

859
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:17,448
So what if I benefited from an improved public image?

860

How is that bad?

861
01:00:18,778 --> 01:00:22,248
She took advantage of my shaman powers and had me at her beck and call.

862
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:25,567
I don't even like how she calls me her partner.

It's male menopause.

Hey, it's Officer Go.

Wait. That man...

So would you like to take the bus or the subway?

Or maybe you'd like to take the company van that has been impounded.

Be patient, will you? Calm down.

And here I thought your connections actually had power.

Crossing paths and getting on each other's nerves bring us enough pain as is.

Did Mr. Cha really say that?

I thought you shouldn't keep crossing paths.

- It's on the market?
