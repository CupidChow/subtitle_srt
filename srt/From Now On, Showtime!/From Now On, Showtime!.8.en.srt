Before I met you, the children and I were always moving around.

31

We'd get pushed out because of some redevelopment projects...

32

or get kicked out because no one wanted an orphanage in the area.

I didn't want them to have to go through something like that again,

so I worked day and night to buy that plot of land.

36

So how could I sell it?

I have to leave before Yoon Minsook dies.

164
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,570
Okay, I heard you.

165
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,040
What are all these ghosts doing here?

166
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,379
How dare you barge into...

167
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,750
Geom? Aren't you Choi Geom?

168
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,590
- Hyeonjoon? Is it you?
- You're Geom, right?

169
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,559
- Hey, how long has it been?
- My gosh!

170
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,289
- My goodness.
- I can't believe this!

171
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,799
- It's been ages.
- Hey, hold on.

172
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,370
Has it been about 2,000 years?

173
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,039
This is my first time running into you after I died.

174
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,539
- Yes!
- It's so good to see you!

175
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,470
Do you two know each other?

176
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,309
Yes, we grew up together.

177
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:21,680
- It's so good to see you. My gosh.
- Hey, get up.

178
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,380
He and I studied under the same teacher.

179
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,049
This is Shin Hyeonjoon, my childhood friend.

180
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:29,590
- I see. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

181
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,220
My gosh. Come on in. It's been so long.

182
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,259
- Hey, this is amazing.
- How long has it been?

183
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:37,959
Who knew we'd meet again like this? This is just amazing!

184
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,029
- Oh, my.
- Hold on. You must be exhausted.

185
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,600
I see that your nose has gotten even longer.

186
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,110
Hey, yours has gotten wider.

187
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,040
You look like a goat.

188
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,679
- Anyway, it's so good to see you.
- Take a seat.

189
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,680
- Okay.
- Go on.

190
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,030
Seriously, it's so good to see you.

191
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,619
How did that beaky fool become the Grim Reaper?

192
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,460
- (Spare me a moment.)
- (Okay.)

193
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,459
Would you like something to drink?

194
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,259
Just a cup of instant coffee.

195
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,799
Oh, instant coffee? Make him a cup of instant coffee.

196
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,969
We have brewed coffee, too.

197
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:23,540
I said, instant coffee.

198
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,649
So, you want me to help you buy some time?

199
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,419
Three days would be the maximum, including the funeral.

200
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,789
If it takes longer, things will get out of hand.

201
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,190
Can you catch him before that?

202
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,190
If Head Yoon passes away like this,

203
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,659
the murderer will inherit the land on which the orphanage is built on.

204
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:47,100
Please help us.

205
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,829
I know how to handle that beaky fool.

206
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,809
You see, I'd never do this for other ghosts.

207
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:02,649
But since this concerns my dear friend Mr. Goat's employees,

208
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,379
I'll graciously turn a blind eye to this matter.

209
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:09,090
However, you must ascend as soon as your contract is up. Understood?

210
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,650
Yes, of course.

211
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,430
Thank you, my friend.

212
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,359
Thank goodness the Grim Reaper is my friend.

213
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:21,300
- I'm happy to help.
- Thanks.

214
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,099
You said people used to prepare a meal for you.

215
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:26,369
I see that it consists of rice, water, pollack, soy sauce, soybean paste...

216
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:30,009
Hey, come on! Who eats stuff like that these days?

217
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:33,879
Can you order some rose tteokbokki?

218
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,909
What? Rose tteokbokki?

219
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,679
The Grim Reaper eats rose tteokbokki?

220
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,619
Add some cheese, ham, and glass noodles.

221
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,320
Nice. I see that you're a foodie.

222
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,860
For the tteok, we'll get half rice, half wheat.

223
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,460
We'll also get some seaweed rice balls and plum juice. Nice!

224
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:53,029
- This guy knows.
- Yes.

225
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,700
- I like how flexible he is.
- I know.

226
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,039
I ordered it. It'll be delivered soon.

227
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,900
Have some fruit.

228
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,979
Are you crazy?

229
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:08,309
Would you want to eat this if you were me?

230
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:12,820
I'm sick of apples and pears.

231
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,880
Why is it peeled halfway?

232
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,050
Don't you have something sweeter? Shine Muscat, for example.

233
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,060
Yes, we do!

234
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,230
- We have everything.
- Hey, take this.

235
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,829
You sure have expensive taste!

236
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,429
- This guy is very likable.
- I know.

237
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,210
Hey, what's your name?

238
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,970
I'm Ma Dongcheol. Thank you.

239
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,309
We bonded while playing jegi.

240
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,940
We played it all the time.

241
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,479
- Our sandals were always worn out.
- That's right.

242
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:45,379
- Do you remember?
- I sure do.

243
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:48,919
- In our neighborhood...
- Yes.

244
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,750
Have some of this, too.

245
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,559
Hey, are you crazy?

246
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:01,799
Do apples and pears become something different when they're peeled?

247
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,399
There are some kiwis and oranges, too.

248
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,340
Take it away. You can eat it all.

249
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,909
You'd better not come back here again. Stay away!

250
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:14,140
Anyway, where were we? Right. When we played jegi,

251
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,610
all the elders in the neighborhood gathered around to watch us.

252
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,750
That's right. They'd bring snacks.

253
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,449
And the winner ate them all.

254
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,489
I believe I ate them all, most of the time.

255
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,259
That was because I was never greedy for food back then.

256
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,470
I let you eat them all because I was never a greedy eater.

257
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,440
Right, Kkotbun. This is making me think of Kkotbun.

258
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,240
Kkotbun? Isn't that a woman's name?

259
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,340
We both had a crush on her.

260
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,479
We played jegi again to decide who'd tell her.

261
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,350
And I lost.

262
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,880
Hey, did you tell her back then?

263
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,430
- I did tell her, but...
- But what?

264
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,929
I took Kkotbun to the little hill behind her house and...

265
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:07,400
My gosh, where did the time go? I have to go.

266
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,070
I'm late!

267
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,899
You're leaving already? Stay a little longer.

268
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:15,140
Yes, stay. Come on.

269
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,240
You're late anyway, so just play hooky.

270
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,210
You just need to collect her soul within three days, right?

271
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,209
If she dies today, you have to wait.

272
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,779
If she dies in two days, you can take her right away. Isn't it the same thing?

273
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,580
No, it's not. She must die when she's supposed to die.

274
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,520
Otherwise, I'll be reprimanded again.

275
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,890
Anyway, it was so good to see you. I'm off.

276
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,889
- Hey.
- Bye.

277
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,530
- Bye.
- Wait, Hyeonjoon.

278
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,030
I just called Domisol Pizza and placed an order.

279
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,700
The Quattro combo.

280
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,500
With cheese?

281
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,270
The cheese crust with double sweet potato mousse.

What will they do if I die?

288
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,369
For the children's sake,

289
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:25,710
we must find solid evidence that Lee Jonggu is the culprit.

290
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,650
One of my employees is tailing him at the moment.

291
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,110
He's already planning a night out with a friend, offering to treat him.

292
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,419
That scumbag.

293
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,219
He's a piece of trash.

You just watch. I will drag that jerk... to the afterlife with me.

Gosh, calm down.

296
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,800
You're still tied to your body.

297
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
If you leave and lose the connection, you'll really die.

298
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,969
Gosh, I can't believe this.

299
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,879
The problem is that...

300
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:03,349
the security footage doesn't show him leaving with the bag.

301
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,490
He left empty-handed. And they never found the bag at the store.

302
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,119
Maybe you were mistaken.

303
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,219
No, I saw it.

304
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,929
It was a huge bag.

305
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:16,830
What happened?

306
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,699
The baseball bat somehow disappeared from the store...

307
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:24,330
and was magically moved to the thugs' office?

308
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,480
It makes no sense. It's not like it was teleported there.

309
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:31,409
That's it, teleportation.

310

A magic trick where an object is secretly moved...

314
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:46,459
while the audience is distracted is called "misdirection."

315
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:55,400
If Lee Jonggu used such a trick...

316
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,530
there's only one method.

317
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,469
He has an accomplice.

318
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,730
I was going to just take what I could and leave,

319
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,140
but what can I do? She said she couldn't sell it before she died.

320
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,269
So I had to kill her.

00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:46,380
You see, this is why you should've listened to me...

322
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,489
when I asked you nicely.

323
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,390
That means...

324
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,430
he somehow sneaked the bag out from here.

325
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,709
There's a window here.

326
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,380
If he passes the bag through it...

327
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,820
...the accomplice waiting will take it with him.

328
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,059
As expected, they used a blind spot from the surveillance cameras.

329
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,900
Old lady, you're dead meat today.

330

331

Lee Jonggu made sure he got caught on camera.

332
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:52,279
To show he left empty-handed.

333
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,920
And that's when the thugs barged in.

334
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,870
The perfect timing to be accused as the suspects.

335
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,829
And so, the accomplice hid the weapon...

336
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:07,179
in the empty thugs' office.

337
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,900
Isn't that friend he's meeting up with today his accomplice? To celebrate.

338
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,810
Then, how did he manage to get into the thugs' office?

339
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,410
And how did he know it'd be empty at that hour?

340
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,479

Understood.

483
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:25,000
Let's wrap this case up quickly and go on our date this weekend.

484
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,670
- Date?
- Yes.

485
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,170
Didn't we promise to go bowling?

486
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,780
I see. So that's a date.

487
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,010
Oh, you.

488
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,020
What was that?

489
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,419
The garbage bin is over there. It hit him, you know?

490
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,660
Sorry. I was aiming for the bin, but my hand slipped.

491
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:58,670
Ms. Cheon! Over here!

492
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,669
What? Why are you alone?

493
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:03,740
Two people are on patrol today.

494
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,510
You and me.

495
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,580
What?

496
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,879
- So Chawoong is not coming?
- No.

497
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:12,719
For real?

498
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,690
I should go home today.

499
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,759
See you next time.

500
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,060
Where are you going? You've got to make the rounds.

501
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,159
This is a duty of the civil police unit.

502
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,959
Who came up with the patrol teams?

503
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,569
Officer Go.

504
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:35,469
There's not a single thing I like about that wench officer.

505
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:39,440
She does everything as she pleases. Darn it!

506
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,190
I have a question, Ms. Cheon.

507
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,389
What is it?

508
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm a better guy than you think.

509
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,870
Kind, sincere, righteous, and quite cute.

510
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,440
So what else should I do to appeal more?

511
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,510
That one punch.

512
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:18,009
"One punch?" Then it'd be money.

513
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,180
Are you rich?

514
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,420
I'm still on probation.

515
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,290
- But I'm a civil servant, so my future is stable and...
- No.

516
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,889
Why don't you become a singer instead?

517
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:30,589
You were good at singing trot back then.

518
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:33,259
Try out for an audition show.

519
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,270
You'll make it into the top seven.

520
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,420
Can you see things like that?

521
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,410
You've got that trot-vibe in your soul. I can feel it.

522
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,579
Choose that path and you'll earn buckets.

523
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:54,679
Do you think she will like it, too?

524
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,150
Who?

525
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,219
You mean that sly wench?

526
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:02,930
What's so good about her?

527
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,089
There's no reason to not like her.

528
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,629
She's cute, pretty, competent,

529
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:15,370
smart, and overflowing with charm.

530
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,039
Hold it.

531
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:21,239
Do you like me?

532
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,249
- How did you know?
- It's obviously me, isn't it?

533
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:28,420
I'm the only one who fits all that criteria.

534
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,750
To be frank, I fell in love with you at first sight.

535
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,859
- How about we get to know...
- No, thanks.

536
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:39,659
How can you... Me? Unbelievable.

537
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:52,340
Hey, I'm working my ass off here to clear your false charges.

538
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,080
And here you are, falling asleep.

539
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,579
Goodness, look at this face.

540
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,959
You jerk!

541
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,490
You slapped me just now, didn't you?

542
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,629
No way. I'm innocent.

543
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:16,699
You always make the wrong guess and look how we ended up.

544
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,939
Have you gone nuts, punk?

545
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:22,139
This wouldn't have happened if only you hadn't gotten blood...

546
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:23,570
on the baseball bat.

547
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,909
It's not mine!

548
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:29,209
And you're the one who told me to take the bat to the supermarket.

549
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:32,750
Well, Big Foot... only ordered me to threaten her...

550
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,750
Big Foot or Dog Foot, whatever his name is,

551
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,320
made things even more complicated. Darn it.

552
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,960
Big Foot? Does he mean that Big Foot?

553
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:49,330
Captain, aren't you going home?

554
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,080
Detective An, a minute, please?

555
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,639
Any thoughts about him?

556
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,010
He's just a delivery man.

557
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,879
Right? Nothing special, right?

558
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:03,209
Are you looking for something? Should I help?

559
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,410
No, it's okay. Go home first.

560
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,850
Gosh, give yourself a break, Captain Seo.

561
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,290
You won't get much from working so hard.

562
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,120
- Bye.
- Let's go.

563
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,070
A delivery man no one would suspect.

564
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,440
It's a safe choice.

565
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,839
Big Foot? Do you know him?

566
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,610
Yes, he was in the group Badger.

567
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,449
He was with us for a year or two...

568
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,290
until Sooma Construction scouted him.

569
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,790
I bet he was the cleaner taking care of the dirty businesses even there.

570
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,190
That's some information from you, Director Ma.

571
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,989
The fact that you were a thug does help at times.

572
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:57,630
I didn't make a name nationwide, but I made a name in Kangguk.

573
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:02,069
Sooma Construction needed land, and Lee Jonggu wanted money.

574
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:05,409
So Minsook was an obstacle to both sides.

575
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:08,080
Judging by the time and the tool set up,

576
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,049
Big Foot is surely the accomplice.

577
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:12,580
But the problem is that we don't have any evidence.

578
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,219
The Criminal Procedure Act...

579
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:16,190
does not allow the defendant's confession...

580
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,589
as proof of guilt when it is the only evidence...

581
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:20,259
to prevent the investigative agency...

582
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:23,290
from gaining false confessions in a coercive way.

583
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,630
So corroborating evidence is necessary.

584
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,429
But if both accomplices confess,

585
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:31,469
it becomes corroborating evidence for each party,

586
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:34,239
so no other evidence is needed.

587
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,869
How about we make use of this?

588
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:39,409
Amazing. What does that mean?

589
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:41,679
It just means they have to own up at the same time.

590
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,880
Isn't that also easier said than done?

591
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,080
How is that hard? Make them fight each other.

592
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,589
Those thugs came clean like that earlier.

593
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:52,360
But how do we get them to meet up?

594
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,259
We can only make them fight or whatnot when they do.

595
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:56,830
You're right.

596
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,860
Lee Jonggu will make a move only after Minsook passes away.

It's three in the morning! Three!

It's for our eternal friendship.

613
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:51,179
For our friendship. Of course, we should hang it.

- Let's go.

- We are?

00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,969
- How?
- Misdirection.

646
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:32,169
Don't we have the zombie tools we used at our Halloween concert?

647
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:40,679
We'll use colored contacts for pupil response...

648
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,260
and silicone flesh for the carotid pulse.

649
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,290
Doctor, what's going on?

650
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,630
And my invisible hands can jam his stethoscope.

651
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:10,050
But I'm sure she had no vital signs.

652
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,979
It's zombie time.

653
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,210
Wait. What the... Oh, no.

654
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,360
Where do you think you're going?

655
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,440
- I must go.
- At least stay for breakfast.

656
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,699
- I really must go.
- Hang on.

657
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,410
I must collect her soul.

658
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,880
It only has to be done by the end of today.

659
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,349
It's not like it'll take you half a day... to eat your breakfast.

660
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:49,950
Impatience has always been your downfall.

661
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:52,589
What?

662
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,360
I wasn't going to say this,

663
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,460
but that time with Kkotbun...

664
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,469
You had never held a girl's hand before... even though you were 15...

665
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,500
which is why I let you win our wager out of pity.

666
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,670
If it were me, I would've washed up and changed my clothes first.

667
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,570
You were too excited to care and declared your love for her...

668
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,310
looking like a dumpster diver.

669
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,110
How could anything come out of it?

670
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,110
I washed up, you know.

671
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,479
I washed my face!

672
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:29,560
Also, what's this about you letting me win?

673
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,030
Back in the day, Kkotbun wasn't the only one...

674
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,760
who gave me googly eyes.

675
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,469
- Unbelievable.
- So my heart wasn't fully in it.

676
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:41,240
I wasn't as desperate as a certain someone.

677
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,039
What the... What a joke.

678
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,510
I remember it like it was yesterday.

679
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,580
You were just as desperate.

680
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,780
It was as if your life depended on it.

681
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,380
Sure. Think that way if it puts you at ease.

682
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,150
Whatever satisfies you.

683
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:01,820
You obnoxious jerk.

684
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,730
Do you consider me beneath you just because...

685
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,430
you were popular with the girls?

686
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,860
I dare you to accept a rematch.

687
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,219
Fine.

688
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,159
I'm in.

689
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,099
Those letters are too small for me to read.

690
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:45,900
You should've consumed lutein supplements... while you had the chance.

691
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,300
Right here.

692
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,409
Room 809. The registration is under Lee Jonggu's name.

693
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:52,940
Is Room 810 available?

694
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,409
That's the one I'd like.

695
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:57,449
It is, but it's our suite.

696
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:00,580
- How much a night?
- It's 3,000 dollars.

697
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,989
- I'll take it.
- Sure.

698
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,360
Are you sure? She said 3,000 dollars.

699
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,530
Appeasing Ms. Yoon's soul is worth more than that.

700
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:13,299
- Here you go.
- Do they offer any discounts?

701
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,330
Thank you.

702
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:23,969
Set up the cameras first... and wait for further instruction.

703
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:24,970
Okay.

704
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,280
It's nervous to operate just by ourselves though.

705
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,179
We'll be watching, so don't worry.

706
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:33,680
- Shall we?
- Sure.

707
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,820
We have footage.

708
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,820
Mr. Cha, are you receiving?

709
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,090
I can see you,

710
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,529
but the audio is spotty.

711
00:43:45,529 --> 00:43:47,260
What?

712
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,159
I can't hear you properly.

713
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:53,869
Mr. Cha, why don't you... move around a little?

714
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:57,170
Sure. Just a second.

715
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,920
Are you getting this?

716
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,879
Do you hear me, Mr. Nam?

717
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,120
Mr. Ma?

718
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:12,820
Do you hear me?

719
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,560
Mr. Nam?

720
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,630
Are you getting this?

721
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,230
Wait.

722
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:26,000
What... Yes, we're getting you!

723
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,139
We're still getting static, so change the position you're in.

724
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:33,979
Just a second.

725
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,780
Darn it.

726
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,180
Is this good enough?

727
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:42,949
Are you still getting static?

728
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:45,920
No, this is perfect. We hear you loud and clear.

729
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,389
We can hear you clearly.

730
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:48,860
- Don't move from that spot.
- Sure.

731
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,660
We can't afford to lose sound in here.

732
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,099
What are you doing?

733
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,830
Isn't it obvious?

734
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:00,469
Move.

735
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:03,739
I should join you.

736
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:06,780
Guys, can you hear me?

737
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,810
Yes, Officer Go. We hear you.

738
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,610
Mr. Nam, Mr. Ma, good luck.

739
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:17,750
That doesn't mean you can... I mean... You know...

740
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,789
What are you getting at?

741
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:22,460
I didn't lie down next to you because I wanted to.

742
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,489
Hold on a second. Are you in bed together?

743
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,699
You're supposed to be working!

744
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:32,030
No, I meant that the phone was on its side.

745
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:35,270
Don't drop it like that. Bring it up.

746
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,809
- Mr. Cha.
- What?

747
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:45,080
What is it?

748
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,579
They're coming in.

749
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,449
Right. Everyone, calm down.

750
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:53,960
Mr. Nam with Lee Jonggu and Mr. Ma with Big Foot.

751
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:56,980
Cheers!

752
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:59,229
You did good work.

753
00:45:59,229 --> 00:46:02,630
I didn't know you'd be this proactive.

754
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,469
A man should know when to strike.

755
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:09,099
You're not wrong, since it only took one attempt.

756
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:13,110
Gosh, that's good.

757
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,740
Take your time with this.

758
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,709
The drink is sweet on my lips.

759
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:19,580
Let me see.

760
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,450
One, two, three, four, five digits.

761
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:28,420
You have the right amount.

762
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,460
Is this where I sign?

763
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,560
That's right. The money will be wired to you right away.

764
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,559
Got it.

765
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,599
Mr. Nam, let's ruin the deal for them.

766
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,169
Have his pen make circles.

767
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,740
What the...

768
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:45,769
What is this?

769
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,540
Is this your way of complaining about the amount?

770
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,949
I don't know what's happening.

771
00:46:49,949 --> 00:46:52,349
Provoke him in a way that'll infuriate him.

772
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:54,880
Infuriate him? Got it.

773
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,750
- What...
- What's going on?

774
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:02,519
No, I'm not the one drawing on your face.

775
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,659
- It isn't me.
- Are you nuts?

776
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,259
Is it more money you want?

777
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:12,330
Mr. Ma, scare him some more.

778
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,940
- Mr. Nam, shall we?
- Sure.

779
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,210
All right.

780
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,069
- What the...
- What's wrong with me?

781
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:19,369
Seriously?

782
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,139
My arms are moving on their own.

783
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,579
What is this?

784
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:24,349
Are you into men?

785
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:25,750
Well, I'm not!

786
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,980
I'm not either. What on earth is wrong with me?

787
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,320
- Did you put something in my drink?
- What?

788
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,960
You spiked my drink to up the price.

789
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,589
Are you insane?

790
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:38,059
You spiked the drink to cut me out of this deal!

791
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,000
You twerp.

792
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,300
I should've known that only a nutjob would kill his own wife.

793
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,469
I have you on recording, you know.

794
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:49,569
Play me in any way, and I'll feed you to the cops.

795
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:51,310
You're one to talk.

796
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:55,039
Weren't you the one... who suggested the thugs as fall guys?

797
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,009
I have a recording of my own, too!

798
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:01,119
- Nice. We got them.
- Yes!

799
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,679
You can leave them be now.

800
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,489
Just don't forget to bring the phone with you.

801
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:07,019
- What?
- What the...

802
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:09,960
I'd be a fool to come unarmed...

803
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,330
when meeting a thug.

804
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,960
I should never have done business with a con man.

805
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,499
- Why you...
- Get over here.

806
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,300
Drop your weapons!

807
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:26,610
Lee Jonggu, Big Foot, surrender.

808
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,509
The place is swarming with cops.

809
00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:31,650
Wait, it's Senior. What?

810
00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:38,549
Stop right there!

811
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:45,729
Darn it.

812
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:52,069
Darn!

813
00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:08,699
- Stop following me!
- Darn these stairs.

814
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,410
That's 10,030, 10,031...

815
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:41,280
And 10,033, 10,034, 10,035...

816
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:47,219
And 10,035, 10,036...

817
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,689
Stop right there!

818
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:54,000
Come any closer...

819
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,699
and I'll jump.

820
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:59,329
Go ahead. It'll make our job easier.

821
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:04,369
Mr. Lee, this won't solve anything, so please come this way.

822
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:07,539
Big Foot... He orchestrated everything.

823
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:09,310
I only did as I was told.

824
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:12,049
You call that an excuse? Enough with the nonsense.

825
00:50:12,049 --> 00:50:14,780
You clobbered your wife with a baseball bat!

826
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:18,550
Mr. Lee, ignore this guy...

827
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,320
and talk to me instead.

828
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,759
I'm sure you had your reasons.

829
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:29,659
I'll consider your situation and be understanding of your story,

830
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:34,040
so please come this way and talk to me.

831
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,440
She brought it on herself.

832
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,639
This wouldn't have happened had she listened to me.

833
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:41,339
What did she do?

834
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:45,110
The cow wouldn't listen, so, of course, I lost it!

835
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:01,699
You killed her.

836
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:04,170
She died because of you.

837
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:37,059
Life was tough, wasn't it?

838
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,699
But you still managed to always do your best,

839
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:44,769
so there aren't any regrets.

840
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,339
Good.

841
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:53,680
That's more than enough, Minsook.

842
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,690
Thank you.

843
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:07,999
I wouldn't have been able to move on without your help.

844
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:12,630
You too, Mr. Grim Reaper. Thank you.

845
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,839
Are you finally ready to leave?

846
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:21,109
- Shall we?
- Hold on.

847
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:35,089
Ms. Yoon,

848
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,490
I will never forget...

849
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,559
the kindness you showed me.

850
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:52,439
I'll miss you so much.

851
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:01,849
Officer Go,

852
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:06,250
can I make a final request before I go?

853
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,159
Yes, of course. It can be anything.

854
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:13,900
The money I leave behind... will be spent on sponsoring the orphanage.

855
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,929
I'm not worried about that at all.

856
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:19,130
But could you drop in on the kids and see how they're doing...

857
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,869
from time to time?

858
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:24,139
Yes, of course.

859
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:25,639
Don't you worry.

860
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:27,339
Please look after them.

861
00:53:27,339 --> 00:53:32,110
Hyungsik, the eldest, will be of help being the smart boy he is.

862
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,150
Good.

863
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,950
And then there's Sangjun. He never eats his vegetables.

864
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,420
Especially spinach and carrots.

865
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,860
Please make sure he fixes his eating habits.

866
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,230
And Daesung wishes to be a professional soccer player.

867
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,630
Let him play outside if that's what he wants.

868
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,699
He's not one to thrive academically.

869
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:52,830
And then there is my pretty Daeun.

870
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:56,500
She barely eats since her dream is to be a K-pop idol singer.

871
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,539
She's just as skinny as Cha Chawoong.

872
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:02,139
Make sure she eats well.

873
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:04,349
My goodness.

874
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:08,450
How can I leave them behind?

875
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,819
[Mom, get well soon. From Daeun]

876
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:13,389
All right.

877
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:19,230
- Mr. Grim Reaper, let's go... before I change my mind.
- All right.

878
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,230
Look at you getting ahead of yourselves.

879
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:27,639
On whose authority will your money be spent on the orphanage?

880
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,739
Just wait until I wake up.

881
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:33,679
I'll sue you all... and receive my share of her money!

882
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:36,580
According to the doctor, even if you do wake up,

883
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,509
you'll be paralyzed from the neck down.

884
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:39,580
What?

885
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:45,449
Are you saying I'll have to be on my back forever?

886
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,619
You darn fool!

887
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:52,190
Why did you have to be so greedy when life is relatively short?

888
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:56,260
When your time is up, you have to leave everything behind anyway.

889
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,630
You should've listened to me.

890
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,330
It was nonsense! Besides, it's my money...

891
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,170
- As if. When I said...
- It wasn't your call to make!

892
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,699
- That's nonsense!
- This is all your fault!

893
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,710
- And I told you!
- You should've listened!

894
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,509
Enough bickering!

895
00:55:07,509 --> 00:55:11,450
Let me do my job, darn it!

896
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:17,219
Unbelievable.

897
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:19,790
What do you need that for anyway?

898
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:23,259
I must say the name on this list three times...

899
00:55:23,259 --> 00:55:28,330
for the body and soul to sever all ties.

900
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,869
- Can't you be quiet and let me handle this?
- Sure.

901
00:55:46,819 --> 00:55:50,349
Lee Jonggu.

902
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,150
Me?

903
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:56,659
Lee Jonggu.

904
00:55:56,659 --> 00:56:00,959
What on earth? Why are you chanting my name, darn it?

905
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,869
[Lee Jonggu | Death]

906
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:12,139
Lee Jonggu!

907
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:16,610
What on earth?

908
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:20,510
Am I dead?

909
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:24,590
Why?

910
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:27,390
Why me?

911
00:56:29,759 --> 00:56:31,929
Read this yourself.

912
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:34,899
The names have been switched.

913
00:56:34,899 --> 00:56:36,629
Let me see that.

914
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,500
What about me, then?

915
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,269
Mr. Grim Reaper, what about me?

916
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:48,739
You can keep on living in this world.

917
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:52,949
From what I hear, hundreds of petitions reached the Underworld.

918
00:56:52,949 --> 00:56:55,120
Petitions?

919
00:56:56,549 --> 00:57:00,820
From your children whom you never gave birth to.

920
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,560
[I love you, Mama Minsook.]

921
00:57:06,529 --> 00:57:08,629
My puppies.

922
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,340
That looks secure enough.

923
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,880
To be honest, I've only heard rumors about such a thing happening.

924
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,880
I guess this is what you call a miracle.

925
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,750
I won't go with you. I can't!

926
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,589
It's not something you can choose.

927
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:09,159
Your fate has been sealed, so shut it.

928
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:11,589
Anyway, I'll get going now.

929
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,660
Thank you.

930
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,579
Ms. Yoon, can you hear me?

931
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,589
It's me, Seulhae.

932
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:44,789
Do you recognize me?

933
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,539
It really is a miracle.

934
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:01,639
Chawoong...

935
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,710
We did it.

936
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,880
We brought her back to life!

937
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,889
We did it. We brought her back!

938
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:20,410
My gosh. Ms. Yoon is alive.

939
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:26,590
♫ The light shines on you, us ♫

940
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:33,940
♫ I'll be there even if you don't come ♫

941
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,860
♫ Now, I'll wait ♫

942
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,259
- That hurts.
- My apologies, sir.

943
00:59:51,259 --> 00:59:52,290
I'll lower the speed level.

944
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,730
No, not there.

945
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:58,570
Kicking the hacky sack 30,000 times qualifies as overdoing it.

946
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:02,899
Exactly. It'll take four days to fully loosen your muscles.

947
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:06,139
So much for stacking virtue power the easy way.

948
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:09,310
Picking up after Chawoong is more exhausting.

949
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,710
My body aches.

950
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,179
What you did was commendable, sir.

951
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,989
And 29,998, 29,999...

952
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:23,319
Why must he go this far?

953
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:26,289
- That's 30,000.
- Mr. Choi!

954
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,289
We caught the culprit.

955
01:00:28,299 --> 01:00:31,190
Really?

956
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:32,499
I'm glad.

957
01:00:36,869 --> 01:00:38,769
You...

958
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:42,139
Was this all for that lady?

959
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:46,079
Yes, she lived her whole life caring for others.

960
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,320
I wanted her to have closure.

961
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:54,960
So you kicked this 30,000 times to buy her time?

962
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,789
Did he say 30,000?

963
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,730
Gosh. You're something else.

964
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,580
I admit my defeat.

965
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,489
I'll leave now.

966
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,800
Hyeonjoon.

967
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:41,639
It was nice seeing you, my friend.

968
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:43,500
You...

969
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,010
are the best.

970
01:01:53,049 --> 01:01:55,580
Mr. Choi, you're sweating like crazy.

971
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,419
Are you all right?

972
01:01:57,419 --> 01:01:59,320
My gosh. Just kill me.

973
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:04,859
Oh, please. It was nothing.

974
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:10,570
My chosen pupil should be the one seeing this.

975
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:13,769
Where on earth is he at?

976
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,019
- What are you having?
- Gosh.

977
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:40,689
How nice.

978
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:45,400
Millet shell makgeolli?

979
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,869
Where did you get this?

980
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:49,969
Head Yoon gave it to me as a token of her gratitude.

981
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:53,470
And you were hoarding it all for yourself?

982
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,080
Let's drink.

983
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:12,260
I can't believe I spent ten years not drinking this.

984
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,759
What a waste of my life.

985
01:03:13,759 --> 01:03:14,829
Hold on.

986
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:18,569
Why would you stop drinking... these drops of paradise for ten years?

987
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:22,800
It was Sageum's favorite.

988
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:29,379
Whenever we wanted to celebrate, we'd enjoy it together.

989
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:34,320
But then you ran away from home,

990
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,080
and he quit drinking.

991
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,559
Blood sure is thicker than water.

992
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:48,760
Just like your grandfather, you're crazy over makgeolli.

993
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,129
Would he have felt this way, too?

994
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:59,070
There's this odd feeling I get after helping people, you see.

995
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:06,249
It's as if I'm comforting my own soul.

996
01:04:06,249 --> 01:04:08,479
Would he...

997
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:12,389
have felt this way, too?

998
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:19,829
Listening to others and offering them solace...

999
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:25,460
sometimes leads to yourself being comforted.

1000

It's the way of life as a member of society.

1003
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:48,059
That is why we must have a companion...

1004

Here.

1006

Gosh, that's good.

1007
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:16,280
It doesn't taste as good as it did the first time.

1008

1012
