- "I don't trust people

96

and I don't want to help anyone."

97
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:14,928
Didn't you say that to me? Then why did you help this lady?

98

Why must you refuse to accept me as your worshiping spirit?

Gosh, I told you to take your time and enjoy your food.

103
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:40,958
Well, I was going to ask you about it.

104
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:46,828
You see, I've been doing some thinking.

105
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:48,768
Your abilities.

106
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:51,268
Isn't it such a waste to just use them for magic tricks?

107
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,807
You see, the most frustrating thing about homicide investigations...

108
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:56,208
is that the dead can't talk.

109
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,077
However, you can communicate with the dead.

110
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:01,547
And your employees are perfectly suited for undercover operations.

111
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:05,548
So my point is, if we join forces like this,

112
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:09,718
we can catch all the bad guys out there.

113
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:13,517
Well, I know.

114
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,857
I knew you'd get mad at me.

115
00:07:15,857 --> 00:07:19,157
I thought about only asking your employees,

116
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:22,068
but I have no means of communicating with them,

117
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:25,837
so I really need you.

118
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:33,017

00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:51,258

00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:52,657
You know what?

125
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:54,828
They say you can pay off your debt with thoughtful words,

126
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:56,368
but you make me want to curse you...

127
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:58,097
even when you're throwing money around.

128
00:07:58,097 --> 00:08:00,568
That young lady is a good judge of character.

129
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:04,268
Why would you use words instead of money to pay off your debt?

130
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:08,307
Words can't replace money.

131
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:12,978
Fine. I'll be off, then.

132
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:24,587
My words probably don't mean anything to you,

133
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,097
but I have to say this before I go.

134

00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:33,318
Just cover for her.

166
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:35,387
I'm sorry, Yongryul. I owe you one.

167
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:36,488
- Bye.
- Officer Go!

168
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:37,598
- Bye.
- Officer Go!

169
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:39,227
Come on, Yongryul.

170
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:41,998
Try to understand.

171
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:46,998
Her father died in the line of duty... while investigating the Full Moon Murderer, you know.

172
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:50,908
She became a cop to catch the culprit.

173
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:53,878
Didn't the culprit die back then?

174
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:55,648
I heard the killer drowned in the sea.

175
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:57,947
But we never found the culprit's body.

176
00:10:57,947 --> 00:10:59,947
So whenever she hears about a similar case

177
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:02,287
or sees someone who looks like the face in the composite,

178
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,687
she still chases them like that.

179
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:07,017
Even though nothing has come out of it for the past ten years?

180
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:09,988
Have you ever seen her give up on anything?

181
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:12,028
Besides, this is the one case she's been dying to solve.

182
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:16,727
She won't give up until she sees for herself that the culprit is dead.

183
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:28,848
I guess Officer Go was here.

184
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:31,018
Tteokbokki, braised short ribs, and bossam.

185
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:34,018
My, it looks delicious.

186
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:36,548
What's wrong with this? It tastes like dirt.

187
00:11:36,548 --> 00:11:39,018
It tastes like gum someone's been chewing for days.

188
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:42,687
Someone already sucked all the vital energy out of these.

189
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:45,897
Who? The 2,000 year old newbie?

190
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:48,998
Darn, I can't take this anymore! Calm down. You saw what he could do.

191
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:51,998
Come on. He's not the only dead guy here! I really can't take this anymore.

192
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:53,297
Calm down. What can you do?

193
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,508
You know that his powers trump ours.

194
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,437
He's the spirit that Mr. Cha's family used to worship.

195
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:59,837
That's the Cha family's problem!

196
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:03,077
We're Mr. Cha's employees, not the Cha family's slaves!

197
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:05,348
Unbelievable. I can't help but scoff at this ridiculous situation.

198
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:09,647
How insolent! How dare you laugh at me?

199
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:12,488
I never laughed at you.

200
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:13,918
Don't get the wrong idea.

201
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:17,157
It's not this way. He's over there. In the room.

202
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:20,327
Darn it. Come out!

203
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:22,897
Hey, lower your voice.

204
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:24,398
- Tell him to come out.
- What?

205
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:26,098
I really can't take this anymore.

206
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:27,338
You mean, me?

207
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:29,937
No, that 2,000-year-old jerk.

208
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:32,077
Really?

209
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:34,177
Forget it.

210
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:36,378
I told you. Right here.

211
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:39,547
You can go on about it, but I'm really out of it right now.

212
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:43,888
The medicine will kick in soon, so let's talk when my fever breaks.

213
00:12:46,488 --> 00:12:49,387
No medicine can help you.

214
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:50,657
What do you mean?

215
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:53,728
You're sick because I put a curse on you.

216
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:55,868
On purpose.

217
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:01,938
What? You put a curse on me?

218
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:05,437
How could you do this to me just because I wouldn't listen to you? It's what a thug would do, not a spirit!

219
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,608
I can do this because I'm a spirit. I'm not some swindler!

220
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:08,748
Darn you.

221
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:10,407
You.

222
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:14,718
If you don't do as I say, I will never lift this curse.

223
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:17,488
You put this curse on me, so you must know

224
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:22,158
that I'm in no state to listen to your spiel about "virtue power."

225
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:24,628
Goodness.

226
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:28,127
Fine, okay. Hold on a moment.

227
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,847
How do you feel? You feel fine now, right?

228
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:51,688
Oh, yes. Darn you!

229
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:55,858
- Hey, listen.
- Goodness.

230
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:59,657
The moment when that lady cop thanked you,

231
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:03,068
your virtue power level went up like this.

232
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:04,067
[Virtue Power]

233
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:06,598
What is "virtue power" anyway?

234
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:10,138
It's like an index that shows how much of your bad karma

235
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:13,838
you've gotten rid of by doing virtuous deeds.

236
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:16,478
When I perform exorcisms through my Chosen Pupil

237
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:19,777
and help people, my virtue power level goes up.

238
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:25,487
When it fills the entire fan, I will enter Eternal Paradise.

239
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:34,827
I told you. I'd rather die than become a shaman.

240
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:36,897
Have you not been listening at all?

241
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:39,738
You don't have to become a shaman to gain more virtue power.

242
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:42,138
Join the civil police unit she mentioned earlier.

243
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:46,738
All you have to do is make her thank you.

244
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:49,378
Go Seulhae? Why? She's a nobody.

245
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:53,077
Hey, that cop has one heck of a seven-star channel.

246
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:56,787
It goes all the way up to the sky.

247
00:14:56,787 --> 00:15:01,117
I've never seen such a clear seven-star channel before.

248
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:02,457
"Seven-star channel"?

249
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:06,010
Doesn't it mean she's either psychic or is fated to become a shaman?

250
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:10,897
Come on. Up until a few days ago, she kept insisting that... there's no such thing as ghosts.

251
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:16,238
No, it's a channel through which... the sky sends down its wishes to this realm.

252
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:19,577
It doesn't mean she has to become a shaman.

253
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:22,748
She is fated to follow the skies' wishes.

254
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:26,677
So it's basically... like a hotline to reach the skies,

255
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:30,187
and hers is much stronger than what most shamans have.

256
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:33,257
When she's touched, so are the skies.

257
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:37,688
Even if I don't become a shaman, you can accumulate more virtue power.

258
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,797
That's right!

259
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:43,927
Now, we're talking.

260
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:47,907
It's a good thing for you because you don't have to become a shaman.

261
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:51,508
And I don't have to sit inside your body... and do all the work.

262
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:55,977
The universe is helping me out so I can relax

263
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:59,217
and take it easy for a change!

264
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:09,687
So in other words, you're going to make me do all the work.

265
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:12,258
Sorry to disappoint you,

266
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:15,658
but I don't like to help others when there's nothing in it for me.

267
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,980
Hey, wait.

268
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:24,668
That rude brat...

269
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:29,407
This is not good.

270
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:32,317
"Possibility."

271
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:37,858
Like the line from a movie, a blank page in a book is often the one

272
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:40,858
that is filled with endless possibilities.

273
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:29,108
I don't see any ghosts.

274
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,477
How does he do that?

275
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:33,677
He's like a ghost.

276
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,578
My gosh!

277
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:39,177
Oh, sorry.

278
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:42,348
You'd better listen to me and do it while I'm still nice to you.

279
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:44,587
Join the civil police unit.

280
00:17:44,587 --> 00:17:47,488
Don't talk to me. I'm working right now.

281
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:50,387
Me too. Your body is like my office.

282
00:17:50,387 --> 00:17:54,158
I never hired an employee like you.

283
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:56,298
Like I said, your ancestors

284
00:17:56,298 --> 00:18:00,037
signed an eternal employment contract with me.

285
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:05,637
Next up is the hottest magician of the moment.

286
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:08,877
I heard he prepared a special show for today.

287
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:12,647
Please welcome the Fiery Magician, Cha Chawoong.

288
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,817
[God of Magic]

289
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:18,587
Then as your new employer, I shall deal with this accordingly.

290
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,557
You've been let go.

291
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:24,257
You're fired as of today.

292
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:28,967
You... are fired.

293
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:35,367
What? "Fired"?

294
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:39,478
That little brat.

295
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:44,408
I must teach him a real lesson.

296
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:00,277
- My gosh!
- What was that?

297
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,817
It's hot!

298
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,617
Stop.

299
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:28,518
Juggle!

300
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:31,457
This is incredible.

301
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:33,458
- My gosh.
- This is insane.

302
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,728
- Oh, my.
- I can't believe this.

303
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:41,567
What's wrong, Mr. Cha?

304
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:49,560
What do you want us to do?

305
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:51,877
My back.

306
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,117
Your back? Come over here, guys.

307
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:55,418
No, down.

308
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:57,587
- Down!
- Down!

309
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:05,557
No!

310
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,368
- His buttocks is on fire!
- What?

311
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:13,367
- For real?
- The fire extinguisher!

312
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,668
It's hot!

313
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:18,678
My gosh, it's hot! It's hot!

314
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:23,248
Make way!

315
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:35,218
Darn it.

316
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:48,267

00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,128
Doing that could lead to exhaustion and injuries.

650
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:43,228
How inefficient is that?

651
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:46,297
Like I told you, my motto as a member of the civil police unit is this.

652
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:49,498
- Work short and effortlessly but impressively.
- That I know!

653
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:53,937
I'm fully aware that you charge by the second.

654
00:40:53,937 --> 00:40:56,647
It's why I acted efficiently.

655
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:59,597
In a short, effortless, but impressive way.

656
00:41:02,078 --> 00:41:04,387
Wait!

657
00:41:04,387 --> 00:41:05,887
Stop the video.

658
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:08,757
What's the name of the maiden with the blonde hair?

659
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,328
Oh, her. Her name is Aris.

660
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:15,057
Aris. Look how pretty you are.

661
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:18,767
My eyes are now purified.

662
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:23,237
Boss... I mean, Adviser Choi. You sure know how to pick them.

663
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:24,808
Aris is huge at the moment.

664
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:26,837
A while ago, it was Suzy.

665
00:41:26,837 --> 00:41:28,937
Play the video again.

666
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:30,647
Sure thing.

667
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:38,617
You must not know this since all you did was study before dying,

668
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:42,717
but being in a gang is all about knowing who to serve.

669
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:46,887
I'm choosing to serve Geom. You should join me.

670
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:48,658
Mr. Choi,

671
00:41:48,658 --> 00:41:52,307
this must be your first time watching a girl group perform.

672
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:55,567
When would I have had the time to watch TV?

673
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:59,167
To fend off puny spirits, do exorcisms, and return husbands having affairs,

674
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:03,607
I ran up mountains and across fields... to gain virtue power.

675
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:05,377
Absolutely!

676
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:08,847
Adviser Choi.

677
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:10,818
Adviser Choi?

678
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:13,718
I hear something coming from your fan.

679
00:42:13,718 --> 00:42:15,288
Oh.

680
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:20,657
Unbelievable. That's all you gained again?

681
00:42:20,657 --> 00:42:23,868
That little brat. Why hasn't he been able

682
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:26,528
to gain enough virtue power?

683
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,478
[My Final Words]

684
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:42,947
- It's Black Hit.
- Again?

685
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:45,318
What is with people and online gambling?

686
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:48,118
So many have already taken their own lives after losing their life savings.

687
00:42:48,118 --> 00:42:51,157
Was there any word from the Cyber Division?

688
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,757
The administrator running the site seems highly intelligent.

689
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:57,098
Let's start off by tracking his bank account transactions.

690
00:42:57,098 --> 00:42:58,928
This is good.

691
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:01,998
- It's good.
- Please have your fill, Sir.

692
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:04,608
[Ladies and Gentlemen, Enjoy the Food and Be Healthy]

693
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:11,177
Ma'am, what is with the buffet? Isn't it supposed to be a soup kitchen?

694
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:14,378
Mr. Cha Chawoong called a catering service.

695
00:43:14,378 --> 00:43:17,448
The elders are ecstatic, to say the least.

696
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,160
[Magician Cha Chawoong wishes the elders the best!]

697
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,928
- Ouch.
- Sorry.

698
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:36,268
- Aren't you cold?
- Keep fanning.

699
00:43:36,268 --> 00:43:38,107
Mr. Cha.

700
00:43:38,107 --> 00:43:39,868
Leave it there.

701
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:52,548
Why are there so many air vents at a tiny senior citizen center?

702
00:43:57,257 --> 00:44:01,658
No way. As if I'd let you get me again.

703
00:44:06,868 --> 00:44:08,537
Are you for real?

704
00:44:08,537 --> 00:44:10,268
You must be sincerely touched.

705
00:44:10,268 --> 00:44:12,807
We must do the volunteer work ourselves.

706
00:44:12,807 --> 00:44:16,777
I personally called the catering service and signed off on the purchase myself.

707
00:44:16,777 --> 00:44:19,578
You hired a part-timer to wear the mascot costume and ordered a buffet for the elderly.

708
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:22,918
You can't solve everything with money!

709
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:24,848
Serving the elderly the food

710
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:27,257
isn't about just providing them with a meal.

711
00:44:27,257 --> 00:44:31,657
We sit with them as they eat and listen to their problems.

712
00:44:31,657 --> 00:44:34,898
We're supposed to share warmth!

713
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:38,398
Rather than holding their hands and encouraging them by catching clouds,

714
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:43,998
I feel like they'd appreciate a fancy buffet that's too expensive for them to enjoy again.

715
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:49,177
What do you think? I have a point, right?

716
00:44:49,177 --> 00:44:52,777
If you're going to thank me, I'd rather you do it fast.

717
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,777
But I'm not grateful at all.

718
00:44:55,547 --> 00:44:59,487
For some reason, you keep wanting me to thank you.

719
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,557
Who brings a parasol to a place where they are volunteering at?

720
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:09,398
Come down this instant.

721
00:45:09,398 --> 00:45:11,367
I can't.

722
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:13,467
You need to thank me.

723
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:15,568
- No way. You can't.
- Let me.

724
00:45:15,568 --> 00:45:20,308
- Opening it will let out all the cold air.
- It's too hot for me!

725
00:45:20,308 --> 00:45:25,178
- Stop. You can't do this. Move over.
- But it's hot.

726
00:45:25,178 --> 00:45:26,648
It's too hot outside.

727
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:28,918
You'll only catch a cold.

728
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:32,918
Darn it. My son built this building for me, you know.

729
00:45:32,918 --> 00:45:34,958
Who are you to stop me from enjoying a cold breeze?

730
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:36,387
That's exactly why I'm stopping you.

731
00:45:36,387 --> 00:45:39,228
You don't want to waste money on the electricity bill.

732
00:45:39,228 --> 00:45:42,557
It must cost a lot to keep a fridge of this size running.

733
00:45:42,557 --> 00:45:44,468
Whatever. Just shut it!

734
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:46,498
I'm going home.

735
00:45:46,498 --> 00:45:50,868
- Unbelievable.
- Darn.

736
00:45:53,278 --> 00:45:57,408
- Was this building constructed by Mr. Kim's son?
- That's right.

737
00:45:57,408 --> 00:46:00,447
He won't stop bragging about his son.

738
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,418
Why does he live alone though? Where is his son?

739
00:46:03,418 --> 00:46:06,348
Who knows? None of us has ever seen him.

740
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:09,087
What good does getting him a building do

741
00:46:09,087 --> 00:46:12,037
when the son walked out on his father, who has dementia?

742
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:16,058
Mr. Kim?

743
00:46:16,058 --> 00:46:19,027
Mr. Kim!

744
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,797
Are you leaving so soon?

745
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:23,467
Why don't you make up with the lady and stay for some fun?

746
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:25,637
No!

747
00:46:25,637 --> 00:46:27,978
That darn brat.

748
00:46:27,978 --> 00:46:29,777
She has no respect for her elders.

749
00:46:29,777 --> 00:46:32,007
Mr. Kim...

750
00:46:32,007 --> 00:46:36,047
Mr. Cha, it seems like Mr. Kim needs a ride home.

751
00:46:36,047 --> 00:46:38,518
- Did you bring your car?
- Mr. Cha, this way.

752
00:46:38,518 --> 00:46:40,757
We can't take a photo without you.

753
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:44,127
- Ma'am, this way.
- Oh, of course.

754
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:48,398
I'm sorry about this, but Chief Seo needs me over there.

755
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,268
Of course, this is something he'd gladly do.

756
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,998
You can stand in the center.

757
00:46:53,998 --> 00:46:58,307
Mr. Kim, allow me to escort you home.

758
00:46:58,307 --> 00:47:00,708
[Magician Cha Chawoong wishes the elders the best!]

759
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:07,717
We're here, Mr. Kim.

760
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:10,217
Head inside and get some rest.

761
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:13,487
How sweet of you.

762
00:47:16,357 --> 00:47:20,828
Take this... and buy yourself a snack.

763
00:47:20,828 --> 00:47:25,567
Mr. Kim, where on earth did you get this money?

764
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:28,067
I dug it up.

765
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:29,237
You dug up the money?

766
00:47:29,237 --> 00:47:33,208
I harvest money from my yard.

767
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:36,337
Why don't I show you? Huh?

768
00:47:37,078 --> 00:47:38,578
But...

769
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:41,217
Right here?

770
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:46,147
See?

771
00:47:47,058 --> 00:47:51,057
It's like harvesting sweet potatoes.

772
00:47:51,057 --> 00:47:52,628
But...

773
00:48:02,837 --> 00:48:06,637
It's another bumper harvest of money this year.

774
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:10,507
My gosh. What on earth...?

775
00:48:10,507 --> 00:48:13,917
Over here. We have more!

776
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:16,717
Carefully, search every inch of this yard!

777
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:18,667
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

778
00:48:22,518 --> 00:48:25,388
This must be about ten million dollars.

779
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:27,158
Ten million dollars?

780
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,627
Where on earth did he get all this money?

781
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:33,837
Do you know his son's contact information?

782
00:48:33,837 --> 00:48:38,108
Yes, but he has never picked up.

783
00:48:38,108 --> 00:48:40,607
He hardly comes home anymore.

784
00:48:40,607 --> 00:48:43,277
Captain Seo, it kind of stinks.

785
00:48:43,277 --> 00:48:45,648
It's one's stash of illegally obtained money.

786
00:48:45,648 --> 00:48:47,517
Let's search the house.

787
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:52,318
- If you're done here, check over there.
- Yes, Sir.

788
00:48:57,927 --> 00:49:00,228
Hey, Boss.

789
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,168
How come you couldn't top the virtue power gauge?

790
00:49:03,168 --> 00:49:05,467
I assisted in traffic control, helped promote the police,

791
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:06,768
and even volunteered at a welfare facility.

792
00:49:06,768 --> 00:49:08,097
I did lots of work!

793
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:11,268
Nothing will come out of those trivial tasks.

794
00:49:11,268 --> 00:49:13,777
Either help spirits or drive them away.

795
00:49:13,777 --> 00:49:16,107
Or save a human's life.

796
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:20,547
Only good deeds of great magnitude can get virtue power stacking.

797
00:49:20,547 --> 00:49:25,387
I'm not police for spirits, but a civil police officer.

798
00:49:25,387 --> 00:49:26,788
Don't ask for too much.

799
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:31,058
By the way, have you finished cleaning the studio?

800
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:34,757
Is that why you're eating and resting?

801
00:49:36,898 --> 00:49:38,128
We were just about to get cleaning.

802
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:40,838
Guys, let's go.

803
00:49:42,038 --> 00:49:43,938
Only the boss works around here.

804
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:47,238
You call this a functioning company?

805
00:49:47,907 --> 00:49:49,607
Gosh.

806
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:52,648
I'm going to improve my public image,

807
00:49:52,648 --> 00:49:54,698
earn big bucks with my newfound fame,

808
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:59,048
and leave for that place.

809
00:49:59,048 --> 00:50:01,618
Today, ten million dollars in cash was dug up

00:59:00,258 --> 00:59:01,898
That's it!

973
00:59:01,898 --> 00:59:03,998
- Same here.
- Me too.

974
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,527
Darn parasites.

975
00:59:05,527 --> 00:59:07,137
Eternal torture is what they should get.

976
00:59:07,137 --> 00:59:08,467
What now?

977
00:59:08,467 --> 00:59:09,967
Okay, let's do this.

978
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,907
- What the...
- Hey!

979
00:59:11,907 --> 00:59:14,378
- Someone stop her!
- Seriously?

980
00:59:14,378 --> 00:59:16,907
We need a plan first.

981
00:59:16,907 --> 00:59:18,407
This is the plan.

982
00:59:18,407 --> 00:59:20,547
- Come on!
- Stop that!

983
00:59:20,547 --> 00:59:22,547
- Take that!
- Hey!

984
00:59:22,547 --> 00:59:24,987
- Stop it.
- Come on!

985
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:59,418
Identify yourself. You two look new.

986
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,087
Where did you play?

987
01:00:02,087 --> 01:00:05,257
- You have some nerve...
- Come on.

988
01:00:05,257 --> 01:00:08,058
Hey. Sorry about that.

989
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,728
Don't mind her. She's only here to bankroll me.

990
01:00:11,728 --> 01:00:13,367
A financial backer?

991
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:15,467
Raccoon showed us the way.

992
01:00:15,467 --> 01:00:17,168
As for the money...

993
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,568
I have this much.

994
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,907
Two will enter.

995
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,587
- Don't you dare!
- As if!

996
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:36,988
- Keep it coming.
- Deal, darn it!

997
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:40,028
- Seriously?
- I won this pot!

998
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,307
Here. Read it and weep.

999
01:01:00,307 --> 01:01:02,978
- What the...
- Darn it.

1000
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,627
He's got nothing.

1001
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,097
I have a pair over here.

1002
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:25,167
A heart flush.

1003
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:33,078
That's 2,000 dollars. I'll now raise you 10,000.

1004
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:43,458
A ten gives him a straight.

1005
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:46,457
She has quads. Fold.

1006
01:01:46,457 --> 01:01:48,528
I'll fold.

1007
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,097
She has nothing right now.

1008
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:05,347
I'm taking a break.

1009
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:10,848
- You should take five as well.
- Why would I... when I'm on a roll?

1010
01:02:10,848 --> 01:02:14,018
My gosh. Honey, your legs must have cramps.

1011
01:02:14,018 --> 01:02:16,917
Take a break, will you?

1012
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:19,127
Right.

1013
01:02:19,127 --> 01:02:21,597
I'll sit out for one game, then.

1014
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,967
Until when are you going to play? We need to capture Mr. Bald.

1015
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:31,868
Hold your horses. He'll come to us as long as we keep winning.

1016
01:02:31,868 --> 01:02:34,038
But he...

1017
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,817
- Waiter.
- Sir?

1018
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:47,247
The one with the goatee. He looks like a professional.

1019
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,588
- Have one of ours handle him.
- Sure thing.

1020
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:57,457
Goodness.

1021
01:02:57,457 --> 01:03:00,098
The pot here must be entertaining.

1022
01:03:00,098 --> 01:03:01,837
Did you just come?

1023
01:03:01,837 --> 01:03:05,108
Have a seat. I've been wiped clean today.

1024
01:03:05,108 --> 01:03:07,507
Same here. I've been wiped clean, too.

1025
01:03:07,507 --> 01:03:10,477
The new guy must be good.

1026
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,548
Let's see what you can do.

1027
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,037
What a jerk. He has a hidden card.

1028
01:03:37,037 --> 01:03:39,848
It gives him a seven-high straight flush.

1029
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,178
Oh, dear!

1030
01:03:48,178 --> 01:03:49,977
Are you kidding me?

1031
01:03:49,977 --> 01:03:53,187
I'm such a klutz.

1032
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,288
- Are you all right?
- Be careful, will you?

1033
01:03:57,288 --> 01:04:00,088
The woman's in on it. I see an ace of spades.

1034
01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:02,927
- There's no way you can win.
- What's going on?

1035
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:05,668
Mr. Cha needs an ace of spades to win,

1036
01:04:05,668 --> 01:04:07,898
but that woman hid it in her purse.

1037
01:04:07,898 --> 01:04:10,498
- We need to upend this whole game.
- Why?

1038
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:12,967
You said it's in her purse. We just need to grab it.

1039
01:04:12,967 --> 01:04:15,578
And doing so is our specialty.

1040
01:04:15,578 --> 01:04:17,937
Mr. Cha, are you ready?

1041
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,478
Go.

1042
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,798
Areum.

1043
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,727
- Okay.
- Strike.

1044
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,568
Gosh, my back.

1045
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,948
- Be careful, will you?
- Darn it.

1046
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:58,788
All-in.

1047
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,817
- Call.
- All right.

1048
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:05,757
Let's compare hands, then.

1049
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,398
It's too bad.

1050
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:13,067
I have a straight flush.

1051
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:20,307
I doubt you have a royal straight flush, so I'll enjoy the win.

1052
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:24,038
Not so fast.

1053
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,547
That's too bad.

1054
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,477
I'm afraid...

1055
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,587
you were right to doubt.

1056
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,037
A royal straight flush.

1057
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,527
Nicely done.

1058
01:05:42,527 --> 01:05:46,628
What on earth? This isn't possible. How did this happen?

1059
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,008
What the...?

1060
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:57,848
What do you mean it's not possible?

1061
01:05:57,848 --> 01:06:03,418
There's always a 0.0032 percent possibility.

1062
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,317
What?

1063
01:06:05,317 --> 01:06:06,787
Darn it.

1064
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:12,457
That was a close one. Anyway, good job, guys.

1065
01:06:12,457 --> 01:06:17,227
Considering all the tricks we do, this one was basic.

1066
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,597
Why don't I get going, then?

1067
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:35,570
You're quite good. Where do you normally frequent?

1068
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,217
Here and there.

1069
01:06:37,217 --> 01:06:39,767
I know a game that is of higher stakes.

1070
01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:41,387
How high is it?

1071
01:06:41,387 --> 01:06:43,558
Unlimited.

1072
01:06:43,558 --> 01:06:46,187
Wait. Unlimited?

1073
01:06:46,187 --> 01:06:49,728
There is a website that accommodates gamblers from around the world.

1074
01:06:49,728 --> 01:06:51,398
What do you say? Are you interested?

1075
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:53,468
How could I not be?

1076
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:59,067
Leave your phone number here

1077

and you'll receive a text ten minutes before the games begin.

1078

You can make your entrance then.

1079

- That's Boruboru Island. It's my retirement plan.

1095
