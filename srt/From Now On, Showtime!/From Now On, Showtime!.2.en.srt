General.

9
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:03,384
You didn't have to send me off like this.

10
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:09,083
As your Worshipping Spirit, I ought to accompany you to the otherworld.

11
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:12,064
I possessed your body when you were 19 years old.

12
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:14,663
And you spent all of your life serving me.

13
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:17,364
So you earned this.

14
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:22,604
How funny life is.

15
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:25,304
When I was alive, I thought we had such long lives...

16
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:28,173
and they would never end.

17
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,384
But in retrospect,

18
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,963
life is like a fleeting moment.

19
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:40,593
But unlike the others, you were able to clear your karma.

20
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:43,893
And you are headed to a good place now.

21
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,933
Goodness. I am envious of you.

22
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:56,033
I'm sorry to leave without you.

23
00:01:56,033 --> 00:02:00,543
I really hoped to see you enter Nirvana in my lifetime.

24
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:04,514
I have too much karma to settle. What could you do about it?

25
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,884
You did everything you could.

26
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:12,383
My grandson is very stubborn.

27
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:15,454
I'm worried that he might cause you trouble.

28
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:19,464
Don't you know who I am? I'm Choi Geom.

29
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:22,634
I have been a deity for a very long time.

30
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:26,835
Do you think he's the first Chosen pupil to reject me and run away?

31
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:28,933
No matter what he tries, he's still a human.

32
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:32,104
He can't go against a deity.

33

Don't worry.

34
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:39,714

It was you.

39
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:11,044
This.

40
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:14,783
It's a broken piece of a headlight found at the scene of a hit and run.

41
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:18,483
It fits your broken headlight.

42
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:21,793
There was a minor accident last night,

43
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:23,694
but are you saying that proves I'm the culprit?

44
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:26,824
Last night, you hit a man and abandoned his body.

45
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:30,044
While you were doing that, you lost the helmet.

46
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:33,164
Along with the dashcam that recorded the accident.

47
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:37,234
What you're trying to delete is not your business secret, but the scene of the accident.

48
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:38,973
You're jumping too fast to conclusions.

49

Then, how about this?

00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,913
Cornet bread.

51
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:49,253
You asked the bakery clerk about the man who bought cornet bread specifically.

52
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:52,984
Only three people know that Minho bought cornet bread.

53
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:57,524
Minho, who wrote this card, me, who picked up this card, and the culprit.

54
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:59,393
That's because...

55
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:02,734
- Help me.
- Areum.

56
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,764

All right. I'll explain.

65
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:27,623
I can't tell you here. Let's go inside.

66
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:29,424
Don't move!

67
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:32,294
- Not us.
- She can't see us.

68
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:34,263
You can give that lame excuse in court.

69
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:37,963
- You should listen...
- I said, don't move!

70
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,773
Stop her.

71
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:15,634
Darn it.

72
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:18,074
Stop it.

73
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:30,584
What's wrong with this?

74
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:34,254
Why isn't it moving? Why...?

75
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:35,924
What's going on?

76
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,663
Oh, she's strong.

77
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:46,104
That wasn't me.

78
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:50,943
What did you just do?

79
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:54,873
I said I would explain.

80
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:58,284
What just happened? What was that!

81
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:00,584
So,

82
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:03,783
that was...

83
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:09,153
a ghost.

84
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:15,394
So let me get this straight. Ghosts have been doing your magic tricks all this time.

85
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:21,094
And the dashcam caught you talking to these ghosts and working with them?

86
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:23,334
That's the secret of my business

87
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:26,404
and why I must find the helmet.

88
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:30,014
Then, how can you explain the chocolate cornet?

89
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,643
- Did the ghosts tell you that, too?
- Yes.

90
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,883
Last night, I met the man who died in the hit-and-run accident.

91
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:40,283
Right. I had an accident in front of the bakery... because that ghost jumped out of nowhere.

92
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:43,194
You're telling me Minho is a ghost, too?

93
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,923
Gosh. He's unbelievable. Does he think this is funny?

94
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:48,764
Everyone.

95
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,074
Goodness. What's going on?

96
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:59,044
Gosh. What is this? What are you doing?

97
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:03,414
You can't still believe me, even after seeing everything yourself?

98
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:05,513
I did see your magic tricks.

99
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:08,084
I saw them too many times on TV during holiday seasons.

100
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:11,614
I've seen this trick so many times, so I'm not even surprised. Put me down.

101
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:13,653
Do it now!

102
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:16,394
Help!

103
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,124
There's a murderer here!

104
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:21,394
- There's a murderer here!
- Be quiet!

105
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:25,263
- Be quiet.
- Help me! Let me go!

106
00:07:25,263 --> 00:07:27,064
Nice.

107
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,634
That serves you right.

108
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:31,403
She can't be reasoned with.

109
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:41,014
Ms. Go, do you like rollercoasters?

110
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:42,154
What did you say?

111
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:44,554
- You want us to do that?
- Darn it.

112
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:49,223
- What's going on?
- Darn it.

113
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:51,594
Going down.

114
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:53,593
Going up.

115
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:55,034
- Turn left.
- Hey!

116
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:57,434
Turn right!

117
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,604
Turn left!

118
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,334
Turn right!

119
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:07,643
- Hey.
- And a bumpy road.

120
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:10,713
Goodness. Hold on. Hey! Stop it! Oh, my.

121
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:12,484
- What do we do?
- No!

122
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:14,854
Right. I don't think she'll believe you.

123
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:18,154
- Wait. Hey. Stop it!
- Rock the chair more!

124
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:21,024
Dad!

125
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:23,854
Dad!

126
00:08:37,873 --> 00:08:40,923
- Detective Byun.
- Did you find something?

127
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:44,323
Look. It looks like a piece of the headlight lens, right?

128
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,783
- Yes.
- Can you find out the model?

129
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:51,424
- And put a rush on it.
- I'll send it over.

130
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:54,194
Captain Seo, there are no security cameras in the alleys.

131
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:56,924
But we can check the cameras from the roads heading up to the hill.

132
00:08:56,924 --> 00:08:59,024
Check the footage two hours before and after the time of death.

133
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,825
- And bring me a report.
- Yes, Sir.

134
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:12,704
Are you ready to make a deal with me now?

135
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:17,074
A deal?

136
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:20,584
So that's what you're after.

137
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:22,753
What's the price of a man's life for you?

138
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:27,024
You can ask his insurance company.

139
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,123
Judging by the cornet he bought on his wedding anniversary,

140
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:32,023
he probably didn't have money to buy an insurance policy.

141
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:35,334
Anyway, here's what I'm offering.

142
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:37,764
The cornet was for what?

143
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:40,064
His wedding anniversary.

144
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,674
How did you know that?

145
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:43,974
Hey, you caught a lucky break.

146
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:46,343
Is there anything else you remember?

147
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:48,474
A girl. He said his wife was about to give birth to a girl.

148
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:51,184
He said he didn't know what to do as they were expecting a girl soon.

149
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:53,284
He cried so much.

150
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:55,213
I'm talking about that ghost, Minho.

151
00:09:55,213 --> 00:09:57,654
How did you know that?

152
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:02,493
You really don't know who he is?

153
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,763
Did you two meet before the accident?

154
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:08,124
Me and that guy?

155
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:13,763
Do you think I have a lot of common ground with the working class?

156
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:20,374
What? Did he really see Minho after he became a ghost?

157
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:22,013
Hey, I think it's working.

158
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:23,413
What?

159
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:27,284
Do you finally believe me?

160
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:30,824
So here's what I'm offering.

161
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:33,753
If you help me find the helmet,

162
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:38,024
I will help you find the real culprit.

163
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:43,493
You're telling me you can find the real culprit?

164
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:47,263
The helmet wasn't at the scene of the accident... or where the body was found.

165
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,434
Then the culprit must have taken it.

166
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:52,204
I can get the helmet, and you can arrest the culprit.

167
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:55,414
I'm saying this can be a win-win situation for both of us.

168
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:57,144
What do you say?

169
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:01,013
- Gosh. Let's get ready.
- Please.

170
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:02,513
- Please.
- Gosh.

171
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:03,984
- Please.
- Please.

172
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:06,254
- Please say yes.
- She's really stubborn.

173
00:11:06,254 --> 00:11:09,753
- Please.
- Please. I'm so tired.

174
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:12,324
Please.

175
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:18,534
What do you need me to do?

176
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,664
- Yes! She's convinced.
- Yes.

177
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:22,003
I'm glad she's gullible.

178
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:23,903
Seriously. She's the perfect prey for con artists.

179
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:25,344
You're just like me!

180
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:28,643
You sounded pretty close to the victim.

181
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:31,143
That man...

182
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:33,284
No. Tell me where that ghost could be.

183
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:35,654
Let's ask him directly.

184
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:38,754
Fine.

185
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:41,053
I'll accept the deal.

186
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:43,204
But I have some conditions.

187
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,863
This deal is only valid for a day.

188
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:46,924
And I will accompany you throughout the day.

189
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:50,634
And if we fail to find the culprit by the end of the day, I'll arrest you right away.

190
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:55,333
I'll arrest you if I sense a hint of suspicion. Okay?

191
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,533
A day will be enough. But here's my condition.

192
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:01,044
Before you submit the footage as evidence,

193
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:05,114
you must delete all the parts that are relevant to me from the memory chip.

194
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:08,213
- Okay?
- Okay.

195
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:11,613
Come with me.

196
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,753
And one more thing!

197
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:21,973
Don't drop your honorifics.

198
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:28,363
Gosh. She rocks.

199
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:30,033
Seriously? She dropped hers first.

200
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,344
I think you dropped yours around the same time.

201
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:34,003
Be quiet. Let's go.

202
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,883
Everyone, go to the police station and follow a detective.

203
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:42,254
Report to me if you get any information about the culprit.

204
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:44,353
You'll pay us extra for additional work, right?

205
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:47,054
Can you buy more game currencies with my overtime pay?

206
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:48,593
The fate of our company depends on this.

207
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,843
How could you talk about money?

208
00:12:56,934 --> 00:13:01,004
Well, you said you had ghosts working for you.

209
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:03,354
How many employees do you have?

210
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:07,743
Chief Nam. Director Ma. Areum.

211
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:09,514
Three in total.

212
00:13:14,013 --> 00:13:17,013
Right. Pull over at the bus stop.

213
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,554
What? What is it?

214
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:20,123
- Darn it.
- Come on.

215
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:21,893
So my employees can take the bus.

216
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,123
Ghosts ride the bus?

217
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:25,324
I thought they could fly.

218
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:28,763
Ghosts are only invisible. They are just like us, the living.

219
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:31,564
Then, how can you get in touch with them?

220
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:33,763
You told them to report to you.

221
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:35,934
- They have cell phones.
- Ghosts have cell phones?

222
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:39,804
Then, do you think ghosts are naked and have nothing with them?

223
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:41,873
When people die, their bereaved family burns the deceased belongings,

224
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:44,584
so the deceased could use them in the otherworld.

225
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,944
When their cell phones are burned, they go to their owners.

226
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:50,414
That's why I had to go through a lot to find their cell phones.

227
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:53,753
I'm so glad that I bought a brand new phone before I died.

[Choi Minho murder case]

229
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:05,564
Captain Seo, we have the analysis report for the headlight lens.

230
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:06,863
It's a G-Class from Genus.

231
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:09,204
- The driver must be rich.
- Really?

232
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:12,173
- I got the security footage.
- Thanks.

233
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:14,613
Look for a G-Class from Genus with a broken headlight.

234
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:16,374
Got it.

235
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:21,554
What?

236
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,483
This place hasn't changed.

237
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:26,324
Gosh. Hey.

238
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,893
Right here. This used to be my designated seat.

239
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:33,524
Goodness. They used to handcuff me like this.

240
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:36,033
Then I used to put my feet up here.

241
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,064
"I didn't do it."

242
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:40,214
"Whatever. I'm done talking."

243
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,533
Gosh.

244
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,104
I miss the weirdest things now that I'm dead.

245
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:46,503
Stay sharp, Director Ma.

246
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:49,003
It's not the time for a trip down memory lane.

247
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:53,513
Hey, I'll go check out junkyards and auto shops.

248
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:55,584
Chief Nam, I'll follow him.

249
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:58,083
- Okay. Good luck.
- See you.

250
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:01,334
Hey, that must be the board for the case.

251
00:15:02,294 --> 00:15:03,324
[Victim: Choi Minho]

252
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:06,694
I don't think they made any progress yet.

253
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:10,493
In hindsight, we're lucky that Officer Go came to Mr. Cha's house

254
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,604
as soon as she found a piece of the broken headlight lens.

255
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:15,133
Imagine if she came here with that.

256
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,804
They could have found out the car model with that.

257
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:20,643
If they find a G-Class from Genus with a broken headlight...

258
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,913
Then Mr. Cha would have been arrested right away.

259
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:24,844
He was really lucky.

260
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:34,424
Mr. Cha, let me warn you.

261
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:38,594
Minho's wife, Yoojin, is almost due and in deep shock.

262
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:41,463

263
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:44,794
Can you hear this?

264
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:47,003
Hear what?

265
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:50,734
I don't hear anything.

266
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:54,444
Hey!

267
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,643
Hey, get your hands off me.

268
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:03,054
- Where do you think you're going?
- Get your hands off me!

- Where?
- There...

271
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:11,623

You're that guy from last night.

276
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:28,174
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

277
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:30,544
So I had to help you.

278
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:35,114
Oh, her? Ms. Go can't see you. Only I can see you.

279
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:38,324
Don't even start. It was so hard to convince her.

280
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:41,354
She never seems to take my word for it!

281
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:44,194
But I told her we ought to help you after all you had been through.

282
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:46,864
I begged and pleaded with her. That's why we're here.

283
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:48,634
Is he even there?

They were all from friends of mine and my wife.

291
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:16,353
I never got to be a dad to her.

292
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,993
So I feel terrible that I'm already dead.

293
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:26,164

He worked in my company for a few days.

- This is his pay.
- I knew it.

Still, that's pretty generous.

If he can't rest in peace because I went on a power trip,

832

01:14:56,983 --> 01:14:58,914
I told you...

1154
01:15:00,653 --> 01:15:03,853
never to show up again...

1155
01:15:06,054 --> 01:15:07,694
Gosh!

1156
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:26,830
♫ You're not here with me ♫

1157
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:30,810
♫ Am I late? ♫

1158
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:35,800
♫ Have I wondered too long? ♫

♫ In the calm wind, it gets darker ♫

1160
01:15:42,193 --> 01:15:43,693
Oh, possession?

1161
01:15:43,693 --> 01:15:45,033
You better stop.

1162
01:15:45,033 --> 01:15:47,464
No!

1163
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:49,563
- As long as I impress her...
- Thank you!

1164
01:15:49,563 --> 01:15:51,163
you'll gain virtue power automatically...

1165
01:15:51,163 --> 01:15:53,473
even if I don't become a shaman?

1166
01:15:53,473 --> 01:15:54,773
Exactly!

1167
01:15:54,773 --> 01:15:58,514
I can't communicate with him at all.

1168
01:15:58,514 --> 01:16:00,373
Is this all?

1169
01:16:00,373 --> 01:16:02,514
I didn't gain any virtue power.

1170
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:05,653
I need something big to gain a lot of power.

1171
01:16:05,653 --> 01:16:07,754
I have no reason to do this without Go Seulhae.

1172
01:16:07,754 --> 01:16:09,884
It has to be her.

1173
01:16:09,884 --> 01:16:12,953
Are you two having a fling?

1174
01:16:16,623 --> 01:16:19,094
