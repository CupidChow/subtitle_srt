How did you order this? With what money?

Yes. It'll be a group event tomorrow, so it won't be as demanding.

00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:07,034
Isn't there something I can do on my own?

141
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,805
I'm not fond of being around so many people.

142
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:13,805
Without you, we'll be down a person.

143

Can't you make an exception tomorrow?

144
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:20,685
I know, for sure, that I'll genuinely appreciate it.

145
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:23,645
What? She'll genuinely appreciate it?

146
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:26,235
This is huge!

Gosh, Officer Go. It's Adviser Choi.

148
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:33,854
Chawoong will be there, so don't you worry.

149

- What are you talking about...

150
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,364
Make sure he does fine work tomorrow.

151
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:43,405
Sure thing. Thank you, Mr. Choi.

152
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:44,604
Mr. Cha, I'll see you tomorrow.

153
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,004
You touched your feet with that hand!

Don't just sit there. Hold him still.

155
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,744
Of course. Mr. Choi, let me...

156
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:54,545
I don't get what could be the problem.

157
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:56,045
- It stinks.
- The cucumber!

158

- Well...

159
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:01,185
- Be quiet, will you?
- Gosh, that's disgusting.

160
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,309
Shut it.

161
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,624
What's with that suit?

162
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,675
I doubt you'd recognize the brand.

163
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,357
Actually,

164

What's their issue?

Isn't it obvious?

Some rich jerk wants me out of here so that he can erect a building.

Honey, don't you think you should consider it?

339
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:33,054
The amount that was offered is way above the market price.

340
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:36,424
Wouldn't it be better to sell this land, find someplace larger,

341

and spend the money upgrading the facility?

also died together in a car accident.

457
00:25:35,385 --> 00:25:38,415
That's why I'm well aware of how it feels

458

to have your whole world crumble down.

459
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:45,895
I resented the universe, so I took out my grievances

on other people and caused a lot of trouble.

461

The judge ordered me to perform community service,

462
00:25:54,264 --> 00:25:57,885

There, just to keep the kids alive and well,

464
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,645
I fed them, bathed them,

465
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,505
put clothes on them, and ran around with them.

466
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,893
That's when it hit me.

467
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:11,015
That people...

468
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:14,815
can't live their lives unless they are looked at and cared for

469

by others.

470
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:20,395
So you ended up taking over the orphanage.

471
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,213
That's right.

472
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:27,094
It's true.

473
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:30,564
I owe it all to Ms. Yoon, Chief Seo,

474
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:34,034
and the grown-ups in the neighborhood.

475

Thanks to them, I grew up well.

476
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:41,623
That's why I wish to care for others

477
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:46,484
in the way that I was cared for by others.

478
00:26:46,484 --> 00:26:48,420
Seriously?

479
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,424
It's not like he's the only one who's tipsy.

480

I had no idea since you never spoke of it.

So much for her not being the reason.

00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:39,834
Okay, fine. Unbelievable.

Millet shell makgeolli.

494
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:45,965
Did he get drunk before she did?

495
00:27:46,774 --> 00:27:50,044
- Are you all right?
- Officer Go, is that you?

496
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,645
Yes, it's me.

497
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:53,371
I see.

498
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,725
Maybe I shouldn't have strongly offered makgeolli to a newbie.

499
00:27:57,725 --> 00:27:58,895
I apologize.

500
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:03,024
No way. It was a good first experience.

501
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:05,094
It was my first time drinking makgeolli,

502
00:28:05,094 --> 00:28:07,234
and it is my first time being drunk.

503
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:11,191
I also haven't had anyone call me "sweet" before.

504
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,775
All this time,

505
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:21,074
I thought I had to be better and cooler than other

506
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,507
as well as richer.

507
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:28,925
But laughing with others and talking to them

508
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,037
aren't so bad either.

509
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:36,511
Thanks for hanging out with me.

That's it!

512
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,935
Come to think of it,

513
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:46,693
it's my first time seeing you smile.

514
00:28:48,504 --> 00:28:50,505
Head Yoon was right.

515
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:53,344
You may not be the best at giving love,

516
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:55,948
but you have a warm soul.

517
00:29:00,254 --> 00:29:03,459
What am I not good at?

518
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:06,925
What I meant was...

519
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,324
Head Yoon said

520
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:12,264
you look slick and all, but you're capable of nothing.

521
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:14,363
That again?

522
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:28,445
My gosh, he must have lost it.

523
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:33,575
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,294
Welcome back.

533
00:30:17,294 --> 00:30:18,794
Hey.

534
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:23,383
What is it? Did you see a dead body today?

535
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:47,905
Why is my heart pounding so hard?

536
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,603
Stop it.

537
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:53,977
Gosh, what's wrong with it?

538
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:05,249
That was no doubt the sacred mirror.

539
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:12,471
Officer Go was reincarnated bearing the sacred mirror.

540
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:15,294
She's definitely Princess Cheon Hwa.

541
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:20,823
The one who manifested that mirror was you. That means...

542
00:31:20,823 --> 00:31:22,887
you are surely...

543
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:41,835
You killed her. She died because of you.

544
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,429
What's this?

545
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:25,385
Why do you look like the dead in the morning?

546
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:28,324
It's just...

547
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:30,845
I had a nightmare.

548
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:34,701
What kind of nightmare?

549
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:37,211
Well...

550
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:41,375
Apparently, someone died because of me.

551
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:45,091
But the strange part is that the lady was Officer Go.

552
00:32:45,091 --> 00:32:47,075
I see.

553
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:50,714
That reminds me, I saw something similar not too long ago.

554
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:52,284
Stop watching those American dramas.

555
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:54,155
Killing and beating others, breaking things,

556
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:56,685
and other such things are messing with your head.

557
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:58,484
Dig into the dried pollack soup to ease the hangover.

558
00:32:58,484 --> 00:33:02,189
It all has to do with your karma.

559
00:33:03,324 --> 00:33:05,764
The guilt of being mean to Officer Go day in and out

560
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:08,234
is being reflected in your dreams.

561
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:09,834
Be nice to her.

562
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:12,004
Do you know how kind I am to her these days?

563
00:33:12,004 --> 00:33:14,135
I carried 100 sacks of rice

564
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:16,375
and drank bottles of makgeolli not to spoil the mood yesterday.

565
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:17,605
So what?

566
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:20,014
Officer Go had to carry you home in the end.

567
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:21,775
What?

568
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:22,915
She carried me home?

569
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:25,385
Yes. You were dead drunk

570
00:33:25,385 --> 00:33:27,655
and passed out.

571
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:29,725
I thought you were a slime monster.

572
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:31,425
He is one.

573
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:34,824
He drooled all over Officer Go's shoulder.

574
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:37,425
You were a real embarrassment.

575
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:39,794
I drooled all over her?

576
00:33:39,794 --> 00:33:41,165
- Gosh.
- Officer Go sure was strong.

577
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:43,564
Drunks are super heavy, you know.

578
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:46,475
And he's tall to boot, so he would have been a load.

579
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:48,905
Goodness, and the smell.

580
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:50,675
Was I on her back like this?

581
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,945
- Yes.
- Yes. She was wet with your drool.

582
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:55,314
- Goodness.
- Drink up.

583
00:33:55,314 --> 00:33:57,495
Come on, have the soup.

584
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:03,725
They were lovers in their past lives?

585
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:08,524
Their knots are still tangled.

586
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:11,764
And so they met again after being reborn.

587
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:14,349
How do you know that?

588
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:16,364
By chance,

589
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:21,683
did you know them when you were alive?

590
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:28,579
I tied the knot.

591
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:39,258
Solve the problems you create.

592
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:44,905
The one who has tied the knot must untie it.

593
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:49,757
I must connect the two.

594
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:52,884
That is how everything ends.

595
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,975
I thought your duty...

596
00:34:55,975 --> 00:35:01,303
was to seal the evil spirits and protect them.

597
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:04,893
It was.

598
00:35:05,514 --> 00:35:08,455
I thought so, too.

599
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:11,235
But I finally realized.

600
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:16,464
Evil spirits were only a sign.

601
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:19,395
A sign not to forget my sins...

602
00:35:19,395 --> 00:35:22,963
until those two were reincarnated.

603
00:35:25,904 --> 00:35:28,860
If I connect those two,

604
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:32,315
the evil spirits...

605
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:35,407
will naturally vanish as well.

606
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:44,957
Wake up.

607
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:49,665

608
00:35:56,605 --> 00:36:01,074

616
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:41,444
No way. Did I...

Who are you?

618

Why are you doing this to me?

An ordinary human being?

Why?

624
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:33,187

Hold on.

She hasn't said a word even after getting caught red-handed by me.

This is wrong, you know? Or would you rather get scolded?

How about showing the bag only to me?

647

Come on, give me the bag.

How frustrating. Why can't the police settle this?

Whatever. Give me the bag.

Gosh, look at her. Let go of the bag.

00:49:39,554 --> 00:49:41,295
You think you can trick me into buying it?

826
00:49:41,295 --> 00:49:42,494
No way. Not a chance.

827
00:49:42,494 --> 00:49:45,725
How dare you ghosts try to mess with me like this?

828
00:49:45,725 --> 00:49:47,471
Tidy up.

829
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:50,789
Hey, wait!

830
00:49:50,804 --> 00:49:52,205
You haven't heard my idea yet.

831
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:55,074
Goodness. Okay, say it.

832
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:56,304
Make it quick.

833
00:49:56,304 --> 00:49:57,645
You see,

834
00:49:57,645 --> 00:50:02,079
I overheard Detective Seo's conversation with Officer Go.

835
00:50:02,815 --> 00:50:05,344
I panicked for a second.

836
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:06,957
You did?

837
00:50:06,957 --> 00:50:09,824
At times like these, I always get lost

838
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:11,725
on what to do and feel bad.

839
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:14,601
It's only natural to feel that way.

840
00:50:14,601 --> 00:50:15,664
I noticed Detective Seo

841
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:18,795
kept repeating the last word of her sentence.

842
00:50:18,795 --> 00:50:20,134
Is there something wrong with your hearing?

843
00:50:20,134 --> 00:50:23,205
But you see, it sounded very sweet for some reason.

844
00:50:23,205 --> 00:50:26,634
It gave the impression that he was listening attentively.

845
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:28,235
I'm telling you. This will work.

846
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:32,205
Yes. Mr. Cha, you do need to speak with a softer tone.

847
00:50:32,205 --> 00:50:35,244
Why don't you try it? It's nothing hard.

848
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:38,444
Forget it. Why should I try to copy that jerk?

849
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:41,564
You'd better not waste my time like this again.

850
00:50:41,564 --> 00:50:43,619
Darn it.

851
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:46,185
- Oh, boy.
- That brat.

852
00:50:46,185 --> 00:50:49,385
Gosh, this VR game is the way to go.

853
00:50:49,385 --> 00:50:52,375
Plastic surgery is the only foolproof strategy.

854

855

857

Sir.

858
00:51:07,037 --> 00:51:09,315
Sir, you can't sleep here.

859

Where am I?

861
00:51:12,485 --> 00:51:14,485
Are you all right? You should go home.

862
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:17,554
- You should go home.
- Gosh, I thought you were my wife.

863
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:18,585
Thank you.

864
00:51:18,585 --> 00:51:21,075
- Careful!
- My gosh!

865
00:51:21,855 --> 00:51:25,081
He thought I was his wife? His wife must be very pretty.

866
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,494
He's still young. He should get it together.

867
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:31,435
He can barely walk. This reminds me of someone I saw last night.

868
00:51:31,435 --> 00:51:33,304
Chawoong! Goodness.

869
00:51:33,304 --> 00:51:36,875
You would've ended up like that without Officer Go's help.

870
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,674
I bet you don't even remember.

871
00:51:38,674 --> 00:51:41,954
You see, I totally blacked out last night.

872
00:51:41,954 --> 00:51:43,775
I had never drunk so much.

873
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:47,416
You don't remember anything?

874
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:49,585
Nothing at all?

875
00:51:49,585 --> 00:51:52,747
No, I don't remember anything at all.

876
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:53,795
I'm sorry.

877
00:51:53,795 --> 00:51:55,591
It's fine!

878
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:58,125
We all black out when we drink a lot

879
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,835
and do things we wouldn't normally do.

880
00:51:59,835 --> 00:52:01,565
Things we wouldn't normally do?

881
00:52:01,565 --> 00:52:03,605
Oh, did I make some kind of mistake last night?

882
00:52:03,605 --> 00:52:07,634
No! You didn't. You didn't make any mistakes.

883
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:09,519
You did not.

884
00:52:10,244 --> 00:52:13,244
Oh, my stomach is hurting all of a sudden.

885
00:52:13,244 --> 00:52:16,404
I have to go to the restroom. You guys wait for me here.

886
00:52:26,324 --> 00:52:28,955
Do you want to go to the movies this weekend?

887
00:52:28,955 --> 00:52:33,739
I want to make up for yesterday. I hate feeling indebted.

888
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:36,355
I've got plans for this weekend.

889
00:52:37,205 --> 00:52:38,264
I noticed Detective Seo

890
00:52:38,264 --> 00:52:41,864
kept repeating the last word of her sentence.

891
00:52:41,864 --> 00:52:44,355
I'm telling you. This will work.

This weekend?

893
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:58,384
Yes. So I can't go to the movies with you, I don't think.

You don't think?

- You're sorry?

I... I need to use the restroom, too.

899

Well, is she moved to tears or something?

900
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:30,025
Gosh, my back and legs are killing me.

901
00:53:30,025 --> 00:53:32,324
Patrolling is not an easy task.

902
00:53:32,324 --> 00:53:34,455
- Right? You did a good job though.
- Thanks, you two.

903
00:53:34,455 --> 00:53:37,994
Isn't it because you were in the restroom for way too long?

904
00:53:37,994 --> 00:53:39,424
We wasted so much time because of you.

Did it not go well? Why is he doing that so early in the morning?

927
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:51,105
Maybe he's doing that because it went well.

He wants to look better to impress her even more.

00:58:57,247 --> 00:59:00,754
I promise you that I'll catch the person who did this.

988
00:59:02,985 --> 00:59:06,363
Hi, Senior. I've got a major case.

989
00:59:09,725 --> 00:59:13,395
- Stay still, you scumbag!
- I told you it wasn't me!

990
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:16,794
Don't you dare lie to us. We already checked the security footage.

991
00:59:16,794 --> 00:59:20,634
I went there to scare her a little. That's all.

992
00:59:20,634 --> 00:59:22,174
- Let go.
- Shut it, you jerk.

993
00:59:22,174 --> 00:59:24,174
- Ouch, my knees...
- Heo Choongdal.

994
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:27,615
You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Okay?

995
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,844
- Darn it.
- I told you it wasn't me!

996
00:59:30,844 --> 00:59:33,214
- Stay still.
- Let go of me!

997
00:59:33,214 --> 00:59:36,359
- Stay put.
- It wasn't us!

998
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:37,925
- Stay still.
- It hurts.

999
00:59:37,925 --> 00:59:40,185
- Gosh, blood!
- Will you still deny it?

1000
00:59:40,185 --> 00:59:42,575
What... What is this?

1001
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:45,794
- I've never seen it before.
- You little...

1002
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:46,994
You'd better tell us the truth.

1003
00:59:46,994 --> 00:59:51,764
When we got there, she was already dead.

1004
00:59:51,764 --> 00:59:54,053
I swear!

1005
00:59:54,835 --> 00:59:57,375
Hey, get out! Get lost.

1006
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:59,744
No way. What? You're the Grim Reaper?

1007
00:59:59,744 --> 01:00:01,315
You look like a thug. You little...

1008
01:00:01,315 --> 01:00:03,715
- Get out. Get lost at once!
- I...

1009
01:00:03,715 --> 01:00:05,844
I am the Grim Reaper.

1010
01:00:05,844 --> 01:00:08,255
How dare you? I am the Grim Reaper!

1011
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:10,085
- Why you little...
- Stop, hold on.

1012
01:00:10,085 --> 01:00:13,443
Please, calm down.

1013
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,695
- Hey, you're the Grim Reaper?
- Yes, I am.

1014
01:00:16,695 --> 01:00:19,694
Look... She's still breathing. You came too soon.

1015
01:00:19,694 --> 01:00:22,494
Yes, you did! I've still got time!

1016
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:25,205
Look away at once! Those darn eyes. Hey, eyes down!

1017
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,675
- What? "Those darn eyes"?
- Eyes down!

1018
01:00:27,675 --> 01:00:29,705
- I will poke your eyes out!
- What?

1019
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:30,900
Come here. Come here.

1020
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,644
I will make you breathe your last today!

1021
01:00:33,644 --> 01:00:36,375
I'm not scared at all! I am Yoon Minsook.

1022
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:41,344
There are 50 children that I must care for and raise.

1023
01:00:41,344 --> 01:00:42,855
How dare you!

1024
01:00:42,855 --> 01:00:45,054
So I can't go with you now, okay?

1025
01:00:45,054 --> 01:00:47,494
If you have a problem with that, go get your boss.

1026
01:00:47,494 --> 01:00:48,755
- What? My boss?
- That's right!

1027
01:00:48,755 --> 01:00:50,694
You mean, the King of the Underworld?

1028
01:00:50,694 --> 01:00:52,264
Did you just call him my "boss"?

1029
01:00:52,264 --> 01:00:54,364
Did you say he should come here and talk to you?

1030
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:55,464
Yes!

1031
01:00:55,464 --> 01:00:57,734
How dare you!

1032
01:00:57,734 --> 01:00:58,964
You little...

1033
01:00:58,964 --> 01:01:00,875
- I shall pull out your tongue!
- I can't go.

1034
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,935
- Go away!
- Goodness, break it up!

1035
01:01:02,935 --> 01:01:06,444
- You little...
- Seriously! Stop!

1036
01:01:06,444 --> 01:01:08,815
Stop, both of you!

1037
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:11,053
Hi.

1038
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:12,214
What are you doing?

1039
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:14,614
Oh... Where is Ms. Yoon's husband?

1040
01:01:14,614 --> 01:01:16,214
He's getting an IV. He's wiped out.

1041
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,146
You, sit down.

1042
01:01:18,855 --> 01:01:20,924
And you, get out.

1043
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:22,654
- You want me to get out?
- You can wait a little.

1044
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:24,125
Just get out, will you?

1045
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:27,107
- Get out!
- I'll be back later.

1046
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:36,065
Is there a ghost here?

1047
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:38,105
Oh, Head Yoon.

1048
01:01:38,105 --> 01:01:40,415
She's having a showdown with the Grim Reaper.

1049
01:01:40,415 --> 01:01:42,949
What? The Grim Reaper?

1050
01:01:44,714 --> 01:01:46,770
Oh, no!

1051
01:01:48,014 --> 01:01:49,915
Does it mean she's dead?

1052
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,125
No, not yet.

1053
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:55,995
It's normal for your soul to go in and out of your body when you're unconscious.

1054
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:58,827
I see.

1055
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:01,048
Thank goodness.

1056
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:04,171
I feel so bad for her.

1057
01:02:04,171 --> 01:02:08,329
I can't go. Not now!

1058
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:12,687
I won't go anywhere until we catch the scumbag who killed me.

1059
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,237
She's furious.

1060
01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:18,545
She says she can't die until we catch the one who did this to her.

1061
01:02:18,545 --> 01:02:20,344
Oh, those thugs?

1062
01:02:20,344 --> 01:02:23,313
They've been caught. I just got a call.

1063
01:02:26,255 --> 01:02:30,181
The one who killed me is someone else.

1064
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:31,773
What?

1065
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:35,933
The killer is someone else?

1066
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:37,825
That can't be.

1067
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:38,765
What are you talking about?

1068
01:02:38,765 --> 01:02:42,465
We checked the security footage and even found the weapon that was used.

1069
01:02:43,335 --> 01:02:44,983
Well...

1070
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:49,902
Ms. Yoon, then...

1071
01:02:49,902 --> 01:02:52,815
did you see the person's face?

1072
01:02:53,444 --> 01:02:56,996
He's an evil being.

1073
01:02:58,284 --> 01:03:00,528
The real evil being.

1074
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:21,803
"Evil being"?

1075

Who is it?

Who killed you?

1077
01:03:43,634 --> 01:03:48,479
I just got a call from the police.

1078
01:03:51,174 --> 01:03:57,430
They said the blood found on the weapon is my wife's.

1079
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:00,359
They're sure those thugs did it.

1080
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:03,493
Oh, okay.

1081
01:04:04,384 --> 01:04:07,788
I really appreciate your help.

You heard that, right?

1085
01:04:20,871 --> 01:04:26,271
Those scumbags who did this to you have been arrested.

1086
01:04:27,574 --> 01:04:30,855
So you should wake up already.

Please?

1088
01:04:34,685 --> 01:04:38,045
I can't live without you.
