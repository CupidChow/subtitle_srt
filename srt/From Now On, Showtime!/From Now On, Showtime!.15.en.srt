He's been acting so weird ever since Officer Go joined us.

100
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,382
He talks to himself, and he's become very aggressive. My goodness.

101
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:56,481
I'm telling you. Bad energy follows Seul Hae wherever she goes.

102

Yes, I did!

But instead of being grateful,

105

she keeps being all clingy toward Heesoo.

106

She should know her place! How dare she cling on to my son?

107
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:14,572
I'll be honest. It's not like I wanted to take her in.

I felt bad for what happened to Young Sik, and I thought that doing that...

109
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:21,111

110

Straighten your left arm and lift it all the way up.

Bend the right knee a little.

135
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:36,251
Then I'll think that the ball is your face and...

00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:40,144
Good shot!

137

You saw his true colors.

144
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:20,888
You must be upset.

145
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:23,249
I'm really scared.

146
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:25,132
Of what?

147
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,172
I thought I was okay even without a family...

148
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:31,328
because I had people who were always there for me,

149
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:35,291
but I guess I was delusional.

150
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:40,552
What if I have no one to turn to?

151
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:45,377
Then, you can start your own family.

152
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:50,747
A real family.

153
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,029
Why do you keep getting closer?

154
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:10,841
One can always start a family.

155

It'll be as big as we want it to be.

Well, just shake it off.

What? Come on.

162
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:36,521
No, you shouldn't drink anymore.

163
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:39,272
Why not? I need to drink to de-stress.

00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:44,581
- How much are they?
- It isn't the money.

328
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:47,965
To show them how desperate you are,

329
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:53,621
all three talismans... must be written in the client's blood.

330
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,961
Gosh, you scared me for nothing. That's easy.

331
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,762
Here, prick all my fingers and toes.

332
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:01,401
Write the talismans, please.

333
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,002
Are you sure, Mr. Cha?

334
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:06,232
You always cry and scream with even the slightest injury.

335
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:09,401
But it has to do with you entering Nirvana.

336
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,341
How about punching me hard?

337
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:14,542
A nosebleed might produce more blood.

338
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,442
Shall I?

339
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,881
Here I go. Ready?

340
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:25,221
No. On second thought, pricking my fingers sounds better.

341
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:28,391
Do you have a needle? You do, right?

342
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:30,922
- There isn't any here.
- A shrine would surely have one.

343
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,791
Why would it? Come on. This is faster.

344
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,831
Stay still. Seulhae, think again.

345
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:38,471
- Chawoong,
- Stop her, Chief Nam.

346
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:42,002
do you realize how much you've changed?

347
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:44,742
- If Mr. Shaman saw this,
- Face me!

348
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:45,972
No! I live off of my looks.

349
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,442
- he would be in total bliss.
- You can't hit me.

350
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,362
- This is better than a needle.
- No.

351
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:47,340
So Eun, I bought fried chicken. Come on out!

352
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:55,451
Fried chicken?

353
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,792
Dad?

354
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:08,952
Yes, come over here. Let's have some fried chicken.

355
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,061
Is it really you, Dad?

356
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:14,931
Of course, it's me.

357
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:17,691
Did you already forget my face?

358
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:27,309
What took you so long? I was waiting forever.

359
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:30,641
Don't you have a competition tomorrow morning?

360
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:35,225
So I brought your favorite fried chicken to cheer you on!

361
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:40,318
I don't play the piano anymore.

362
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:45,271
I'm never going to play the thing that killed you again.

363
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:49,831
If only I didn't play the piano...

364
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:54,032
So Eun, listen carefully. Okay?

365
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:58,071
What happened to me isn't your fault.

366
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:03,470
The one at fault... is that drunk customer who went wild that day.

367
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:08,621
It's not even your fault, so why are you bearing the guilt?

368
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,697
Stop it.

369
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:16,722
I had a great life because of the piano.

370
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:21,862
To teach you the piano, I jumped out of bed in the morning...

371
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:25,893
and was never tired, even when I worked late.

372
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:32,538
Working for my family... was the best thing I did in my life.

373
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:37,881
I want you to play the piano you love to your heart's content...

374
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:41,105
and live bravely and happily.

375
00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:44,518
That's my dream.

376
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:51,091
You're a fool, Dad.

377
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:54,032
Why am I a fool?

378
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:58,672
I even know the title, "La Campanella."

379
00:24:58,672 --> 00:25:04,472
My ghost friends are astonished... at how smart I am.

380
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:09,712
And didn't you promise to play me... "La Campanella" after you mastered it?

381
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:14,282
You didn't forget, did you? I'm still looking forward to it.

382
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:18,651
If I play it, can you hear it?

383
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:19,952
Can you really come?

384
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:23,922
Of course. I can even buy fried chicken, so that's easy-peasy.

385
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:28,831
I will be there, so promise me.

386
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:31,251
Promise me you'll take part in the competition.

387
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:33,907
I promise.

388
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:41,711
- Why don't we eat now?
- Sure.

389
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:43,875
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

390
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:50,436
- It's good.
- It's superb.

391
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:53,852
Thanks, Dad.

392
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,562
For what?

393
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:59,831
I'm really grateful that you're my dad.

394
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:01,492
I love you, Dad.

395
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:04,340
I love you too, So Eun.

396
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:21,399
- Mom.
- Yes?

397
00:26:26,822 --> 00:26:28,292
I want to compete.

398
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:31,661
What? Really?

399
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:35,202
Dad told me to play the piano as much as I wanted.

400
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:37,041
Dad did?

401
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,432
- In your dreams?
- Yes.

402
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,801
He came home with fried chicken.

403
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:44,001
Goodness, so Dad still remembers...

404
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:46,841
the secret method for cheering you up.

405
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,662
I know, right?

406
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:52,611
Wait a second. What time is it right now?

407
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:57,551
- Hurry, Mom!
- Quick! Run!

408
00:26:57,551 --> 00:26:59,235
So Eun.

409
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:03,121
You're late, right? Hop in.

410
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,422
How did you know?

411
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:07,232
I dropped by the coffee shop and Na Eun told me.

412
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:11,461
She wants me to escort the future world-class pianist.

413
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,134
- Thank you!
- My gosh.

414
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:23,342
Was there an accident? The cars won't move an inch.

415
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,682
But there are only ten minutes left.

416
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:28,922
Mom, how about I run there?

417
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:31,851
It'll take at least twenty minutes, even if you sprint.

418
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,879
What do I do?

419
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:38,368
That's strange. What's taking him so long?

420
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:45,172
He works for me. I called for him.

421
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:47,131
So Eun, get on that bike.

422
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:50,495
He'll drive you quickly but safely to the hall.

423

Thanks to you, I can keep my promise to my dad.

Yeji!

435
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,955
Hey, Yongryul.

436
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:03,702
You didn't have to prepare something like this.

437
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:05,972
But my mom will love it.

438

It's our first time meeting each other.

439
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:10,884
I can't possibly go empty-handed.

440
00:30:12,512 --> 00:30:15,522
Here, look at me. Did I put on too much makeup?

441
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,851
Does my outfit look neat?

442

This is a first for me.

Gosh, don't worry.

Mom, my girlfriend is here.

448
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:39,672
Welcome. I heard a lot about you from Yongryul.

449
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:43,047
Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ma'am...

450
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:50,982
Hey, what are you doing?

451
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:54,291
She hasn't paid for this yet, right? Then I'll pay 1.5 times the price.

452
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,762
I'll barely get anything from this.

453
00:30:56,762 --> 00:31:00,361
Aren't you that ox bone girl?

454
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:03,032
What? Ox bone?

455
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:04,831
Do you two know each other?

456
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:07,571
Yes, and very well at that.

457
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:10,702
So you're my son's girlfriend?

458
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,645
- She's your mother?
- Yes, my mom.

459
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:19,364
I see. What a surprise to meet you again!

460
00:31:20,452 --> 00:31:22,381
How many times is this?

461
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,066
Unbelievable.

462
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,321
We know each other's personalities, so let's skip that.

463
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,762
So what do your parents do?

464
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:35,831
Well, they passed away when I was little.

465
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:37,561
I currently live with my grandmother.

466
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:41,331
Oh, my. You must've had a rough time when you were young.

467
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:43,742
Come to your senses, me.

468
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:45,897
No, this isn't right.

469
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:49,281
Then, what do you do?

470
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:53,982
- You do have a job, right?
- Of course. I'm a shaman.

471
00:31:56,252 --> 00:31:58,922
What? I don't think I heard her correctly. What "man"?

472
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:00,958
A shaman.

473
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:04,061
Yeji's grandmother is also a famous madam shaman.

474
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:09,532
So, do you mean... shamans as in those who hold bells and practice exorcism?

475
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:13,602
Yes, that's right.

476
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:18,541
I wonder how a shaman couldn't recognize her boyfriend's mother... and act all rude.

477
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:23,242
I apologize for that.

478
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:28,449
I'm still an apprentice who needs more training.

479
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:33,922
Can I use the bathroom?

480
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:36,162
It's over there, Yeji.

481
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,998
Thanks.

482
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:42,502
Where do you think you're going?

483
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,473
- Have you gone mad?
- What is it?

484
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:48,001
Don't you love getting your fortune told?

485
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:50,472
Imagine your daughter-in-law doing it for free.

486
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:53,341
- Goodness, you fool!
- It hurts.

487
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:54,472

00:56:58,821 --> 00:57:02,517
Why did she have to be born with the fate I was dealt?

813
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,654
All that is ahead of her is a bumpy road.

814
00:57:56,111 --> 00:57:57,896
Identify yourself.

815
00:57:58,682 --> 00:58:01,642
How dare you! I told you to identify yourself.

816
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:15,493
My goodness. It's Madam Shaman Na's granddaughter.

817
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:17,287
How?

818
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:24,406
This evil energy...

819
00:58:36,852 --> 00:58:40,722
Are you sure it's the same evil spirit?

820
00:58:40,722 --> 00:58:43,051
I'm sure.

821
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:47,162
We attached a talisman and sealed the cave.

822
00:58:47,162 --> 00:58:49,131
How could it have escaped?

823
00:58:49,131 --> 00:58:51,072
Let us confirm that.

824
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:59,820
The talisman remains intact.

825
00:59:00,472 --> 00:59:06,111
General Choi, there's now only one way... to see if it's in there.

826
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,211
Are you sure about this?

827
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,481
The cave is protected by a force field,

828
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,905
so it won't be able to escape.

829
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:34,174
Mr. Choi.

830
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:38,972
What just happened?

831
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:42,842
Did you vanquish the evil spirit?

832
01:00:42,842 --> 01:00:45,112
Chawoong.

833
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:47,396
The spirit you sealed...

834
01:00:48,251 --> 01:00:50,564
wasn't Haechunmoo's.

835
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:59,821
Haechunmoo has been hiding among us?

836
01:00:59,821 --> 01:01:01,961
Why has he been inactive all this time then?

837
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:05,731
He was able to keep his spirit concealed somehow.

838
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:08,501
But now that his spiritual power has been reduced,

839
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:10,332
he couldn't ignore his hunger anymore...

840
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:12,671
which is why he's hunting again.

841
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:15,771
Then people like Yeji and Officer Go...

842
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:21,151
who possess the seven-star channel will face death at his hands again.

843
01:01:21,151 --> 01:01:23,682
What can we do?

844
01:01:23,682 --> 01:01:25,751
You're also in danger as well.

845
01:01:25,751 --> 01:01:28,821
That's not all. On the day we sealed his spirit,

846
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:31,392
he was able to witness the power of the sacred mirror.

847
01:01:31,392 --> 01:01:32,892
The evil spirit must also know...

848
01:01:32,892 --> 01:01:35,762
that Seulhae is the reincarnation of Princess Chun Hwa.

849
01:01:35,762 --> 01:01:38,162
Getting revenge on Chawoong is a given,

850
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:40,731
but it could also go after Seulhae as well.

851
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:44,242
General Choi, you consumed... almost all of your spiritual energy...

852
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,361
when you placed a force field around this cave.

853
01:01:48,512 --> 01:01:52,672
Once he is able to consume a seven-star channel,

854
01:01:52,672 --> 01:01:55,366
he will be unstoppable.

855
01:01:56,711 --> 01:01:59,243
The timing is terrible.

856
01:02:00,452 --> 01:02:02,920
I have enough spiritual power.

857
01:02:03,722 --> 01:02:06,562
Now that I don't have to share with my employees,

858
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:09,411
I have more than enough to spare.

859
01:02:10,332 --> 01:02:15,025
You said that possessing a Chosen Pupil... will multiply your power.

860
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:19,050
I...

861
01:02:20,271 --> 01:02:22,140
will allow you...

862
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:25,957
to possess me.
