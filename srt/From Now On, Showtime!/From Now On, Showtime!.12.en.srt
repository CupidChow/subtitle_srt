00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,249
I ask you once again, to be honest.

9
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,110
Are you still going to claim you do not love me?

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,820
I have tried not to love you,

11
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:05,520
but I failed.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,629
So you decided to hide your feelings instead?

13
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,429
I thought I would be able to,

but I failed.

15

Constantly failing at something

means you do not have the gift.

17

The Prince of Hwangryeo is here.

31
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,459
Please excuse the boy.

32
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,709
I will apologize on behalf...

33
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,700
My apologies for not recognizing you.

34
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,569
I am Haechunmoo.

35
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:39,610
Now that the princess is here, we should share the news with her.

36
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,309
What news?

37
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:44,050
Seora and Hwangryeo...

38
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,820
have agreed to sign a peace treaty.

39
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,589
Excellent. That is fantastic news.

40
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:54,459
To show the world our ironclad alliance,

41
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,659
you are... to marry Haechunmoo, the Prince of Hwangryeo.

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,009
Father, I do not understand.

43
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,349
- Father.
- Consider yourself informed.

44
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:17,849
Princess, you may leave now.

45
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:20,620
You said I could marry Poong Baek.

46
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,789
What are you waiting for? Escort the princess out at once!

47
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,639
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

48
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,190
Please, Your Royal Highness. Hurry and escort her out!

49
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,330
Father, you gave me your word. Father!

50
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,870
Let go of me! Father!

51
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:00,659
- I said, let go!
- Let go of her.

52
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:08,170
I will take her to her chambers.

53
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,980
My apologies. I did not intend for this to happen.

54
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:28,020
Then join me in defying this arranged marriage.

55
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:33,219
I can not, for my father is very adamant about it.

56
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:36,190
If this marriage alliance falls through,

57
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,340
he will go ahead and establish an alliance with Yeohae.

58
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,830
Yeohae?

59
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,770
Then Seora will share borders with Hwangryeo to the north...

60
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,050
and Yeohae to the south, two states in an alliance.

61
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,979
Is that okay with you?

62
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:53,539
Is this a threat?

63
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,080
No, of course not.

64
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,919
I was simply hoping to let you know... that fate brought us together.

65
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,190
Fate?

66
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,060
As a prince myself, I hated that I had to obey an arranged marriage.

67
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,110
So to rebel, I left the palace and went on an excursion.

68
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,529
And during that trip,

69
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,670
I fell in love with a woman at first sight.

70
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:23,069
Correct.

71
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:27,979
The woman I fell in love with is the one I will wed.

72
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,889
If this is not fate, what is?

73
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,390
I suppose "fate" has different meanings in our worlds.

74
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,390
As you heard,

75
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,559
I wish to wed someone else.

76
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:49,200
I apologize.

77
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:58,939
Let us see who wins.

78
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,109
Declining this proposal will lead to war.

79
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:08,919
I am aware of your powers,

80
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:12,060
but they are not enough to fight off... Hwangryeo's 100,000 soldiers.

81
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,430
Allow me to meet the King of Hwangryeo as an envoy.

82
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,329
That is pointless.

83
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:21,529
I know what they are truly after.

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,669
They wish to conquer us without a war.

85
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:30,240
You will marry the princess off, knowing that?

86
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,990
As the king of a small country, I have no choice.

87
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,720
What kind of life would you want your people to live?

88
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,890
Living as slaves on war-torn soil... versus having a violent brother.

89
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,590
Joining the brotherhood...

90
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,230
would be better than becoming slaves.

91
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:56,729
Poong Baek, as a father, I chose you for my daughter.

92
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,099
However, I must betray you

93
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,649
because of my responsibilities as a king.

94
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,439
Forgive me.

95
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,949
If you care for the people,

96
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,180
you must persuade Cheon Hwa.

97
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,249
- Your Majesty.
- This is an order.

98
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:53,569
Let's just go to war with them.

99
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,530
I will behead every one of Hwangryeo's soldiers.

100
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,230
Besides, we have the sacred mirror.

101
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,499
What is there to be afraid of?

102
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:06,699
The sacred mirror's powers... should never be used to harm people.

103
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:08,999
What if we just go ahead and use it?

104
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,010
Will it cost us our lives?

105
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,009
I will have to pay for breaking my pledge.

106
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,810
Not only will it cost me my life,

107
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,149
but all the miracles that have occurred through me...

108
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,199
will also turn into curses that harm the world.

109
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,789
It is all my fault.

110
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:33,760
I should have been grateful... for what I had been given as the chief priest.

111
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:37,170
I was being greedy.

112
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,919
If only I had hidden my feelings,

113
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:45,309
then I could have saved the princess all this heartache.

114
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:41,060
You look weary.

115
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:46,200
You must set out on a long journey soon. If you feel weak...

116
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,540
I will not leave.

117
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,480
And I will not marry him.

118
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,309
You must go.

119
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,419
Think of His Majesty.

120
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:01,990
If you still cannot leave,

121
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,389
think of the people.

122
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,860
I know that you will keep your brave heart... wherever you go.

123
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,399
Be strong.

124
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,220
But what about you, Poong Baek?

125
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,770
Will you be okay without me?

126
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,839
Will you go to the cave every day and talk to the void?

127
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:30,849
Someday,

128
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,680
hopefully I can let it all out.

129
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:43,190
Let us elope.

130
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:48,700
I wish to stay with you, Poong Baek.

131
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,810
My duties as the chief priest matter to me more.

132
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,679
You must also do your duty... as a princess.

133
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,830
Receive this royal command.

134
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,929
- Poong Baek, you must hand over the sacred mirror.
- What is the matter?

135
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,640
Tie him up at once!

136
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,190
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

137
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,789
Poong Baek, I expect you to tell us the truth.

138
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:24,690
Is it true that you are in league with Yeohae?

139
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,870
Have you been telling them our military secrets...

140
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,199
to help them devise a plan to invade us?

141
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:35,809
Your Majesty, how could you say such a thing?

142
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,010
That is preposterous.

143
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,140
You lowborn rat.

144
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,149
How dare you lie?

145
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:44,310
I would never dare lie to Your Majesty.

146
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,549
I swear, it is not true.

147
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:49,320
I swear on my life.

148
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,120
Your Majesty, someone has brought forth...

149
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,770
secret letters to and from Yeohae found in Poong Baek's chambers.

150
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,979
What are you doing?

151
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:18,079
Open this.

152
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,350
Open the door!

153
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,990
Master Choi, Poong Baek committed treason?

154
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,730
That cannot be.

155
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,960
I am sorry, Your Royal Highness.

156
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,130
Something is wrong.

157
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,170
I...

158
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,830
I must speak with Father.

159
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,530
- You can not leave.
- Let go.

160
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:41,970
No!

161
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,569
- Step aside!
- You can not leave!

162
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:45,980
Let go!

163
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,179
- No!
- Step aside!

164
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,049
Please let me go.

165
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,199
Your king has a faint heart.

166
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,750
He graciously chose to send a traitor into exile.

167
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,779
Did you deliberately seduce the princess?

168
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:23,949
Because of you, she is shedding bloody tears now.

169
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,479
Please...

170
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,589
allow me to see her just once.

171
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,260
Please.

172
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,659
That will not happen.

173
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,270
The princess...

174
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,139
hates your guts.

175
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,380
You cannot barge into my room at this late hour.

176
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,819
We will sleep in the same bed soon.

177
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:33,419
No need to be so difficult.

178
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:36,820
This is highly inappropriate.

179
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,790
Please leave.

180
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,940
Allow me to give you this before I leave.

181
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,240
Hwangryeo is filled with gems and jewels even rarer than these,

182
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
so do not be disappointed.

183
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,850
I also have something for you.

184
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,819
It is beautiful.

185
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,160
It is hardly as grand as the one you gave to the people,

186
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,660
but I did not wish for your hand to feel bare.

187
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,960
I picked this up while passing by the marketplace earlier.

188
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,099
There is nothing I wouldn't do for you.

189
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:33,980
You would do anything?

190
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,819
From jewels to power, you can have anything you want.

191
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:41,080
I do not need such things. All I want is...

192
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,849
for Poong Baek to clear his name.

193
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,359
If you help him clear his name,

194
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,959
then I will give you what you want.

195
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,370
How dare you

196
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,410
think of him in front of me?

197
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:13,150
Do you know who I am?

198
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:19,860
He is a nobody.

199
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,729
Without the sacred mirror, he is just a mere peasant.

200
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,529
Because of a mere peasant,

201
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:32,070
you are rejecting me, the Prince of Hwangryeo?

202
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,190
Just to have you, I sent my 100,000 soldiers back to Hwangryeo.

203
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:41,580
We could have easily torn your puny country to pieces.

204
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,609
And what?

205
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,220
This is why he ended up like that.

206
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,959
Had you obeyed the order to marry me,

207
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,609
such an ordeal would not have been necessary.

208
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,230
So it was your doing.

209
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:08,640
I must tell my father at once.

210
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,549
Do you think your father does not know?

211
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:24,949
Do you still not understand the situation?

212
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,359
Smile.

213
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,460
We will spend the rest of our lives together.

214
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,460
If you always look at me like that, I will be heartbroken.

215
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,469
Do not forget...

216
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,070
that you are mine.

217
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:31,520
Get rid of Poong Baek before he arrives in his place of exile.

218
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,289
He has already grown frail, so it will be seen as a death by natural causes.

219
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:36,739
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

220
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,309
Your Royal Highness.

221
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:02,319
The sacred mirror must be one of the items they seized.

222
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,089
Find it.

223
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:06,619
That is my last hope.

224
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:58,269
I need help over here!

225
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,940
- It hurts!
- What is it?

226
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,549
- I stepped on it.
- Are you all right?

227
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:04,910
- My hands slipped.
- Are you bleeding?

228
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,180
- Oh, goodness.
- How did this happen?

229
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,430
- It hurts.
- Let me have a look.

230
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:28,809
Where is the princess?

231
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:30,610
Answer me!

232
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,679
I don't know.

233
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,520
Stop right there!

234
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,400
- Your Royal Highness.
- Step aside.

235
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,970
We're carrying out the royal command.

236
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,470
Did you not hear me?

237
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,180
Choose.

238
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,620
Will you fight me or step aside?

239
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,720
Do as ordered.

240
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:26,500
Are you all right, Master Poong Baek?

241
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,200
Why did you come here, Your Royal Highness?

242
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,370
Haechunmoo was behind all of it.

243
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,650
Here.

244
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,220
Seora has already cast me away.

245
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,549
- Even with the sacred mirror...
- Cast you away?

246
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:54,160
You're the only hope for the people and me.

247
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,759
Hide yourself first, then find a chance to strike.

248
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:12,340
Your Royal Highness, run! We'll take care of them.

249
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:03,590
Don't move an inch from here.

250
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,779
Shoot him!

251
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,159
What do you want?

Don't.

Don't do this.

You did.

you'll be begging for mercy.

Please do not grieve too much.

279

will love her.

285

When she smiles, my heart will skip a beat...

00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:15,090
What a relief.

336
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,789
How were you all?

337
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:18,530
Absolutely fine.

338
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,859
Officer Go took great care of us.

339
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:23,600
What?

340
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,599
So it's true she can see ghosts now.

341
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,939
Thanks for going that far for them.

342
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:35,340
Director Ma decided to work for her instead—

343
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,150
Hey, I never said that.

344
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,849
Don't worry. You're my one and only boss.

345
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:44,650
Thank you for holding on.

346
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,360
I know how anxious you must've been.

347
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,189
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

348
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:56,070
Chief Nam, did I hear him right?

349
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,570
He just apologized to us.

350
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,639
My gosh, is he still sick?

351
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,869
You better get more rest.

352
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:07,679
The bills aren't settled yet, right? Maybe he missed an exam.

353
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,480
Strangely enough, everything is fine with him.

354
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,849
So be at ease and wait at home.

355
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:16,849
We're going to stop by Okhwa House.

356
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:19,659
Adviser Choi is also there waiting for you.

357
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:23,259
I see.

358
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,770
You finally broke off that long, ill-fated relationship.

359
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,640
Great job.

360
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,039
Mr. Shaman and Detective Go...

361
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:43,710
can relax in the other world now.

362
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:48,950
Honestly, I don't remember much... about how I sealed the evil spirit.

363
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:55,730
When that guy grabbed me, memories of my past life came back.

364
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,030
Could that be why?

365
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,530
Memories of your past life?

366
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,869
Apparently, I was a princess.

367
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:11,170
But people praised how elegant

368
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,679
and graceful I was ever since I was little.

369
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:17,150
My gosh, a princess?

370
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,650
Chawoong, you must take great care of her.

371
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:27,960
If you were a princess, then I must have been a queen of a country.

372
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,389
My nobility is on a whole different level.

373
00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:33,360
Quiet. You're being noisy.

374
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,099
Did you see...

375
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:37,500
everything that happened in your past life?

376
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,369
Not all.

377
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:44,709
Probably only the most important ones.

378
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:48,610
Right. I see.

379
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,150
That must be it.

380
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,780
How does it feel to know about your past life?

381
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,389
Doesn't it break your heart?

382
00:39:58,389 --> 00:39:59,689
It does.

383
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,789
But I now understand why I was reincarnated

384
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,700
and how I am supposed to live my life.

385
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,350
That hurts!

386
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,949
Stop it. What are you even doing?

387
00:40:31,949 --> 00:40:35,360
I'm preparing a gift, but embroidery is not easy at all.

388
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,230
So my question is, why are you doing that?

389
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,560
What is up with you? You're being weird. It's scaring me.

390
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,630
Just be your old self.

391
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,539
Maybe he's still dreaming.

392
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:50,170
Wake up!

393
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,509
I'm not.

394
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:55,949
Gosh! That's not how you do it. Here, give it to me.

395
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,079
Do you know how to do it?

396
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:04,090
I used to sew buttons back on...

397
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,719
and name tags on my daughter's P.E. uniform.

398
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,159
You see how it went in?

399
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:12,829
Push it in here, it pops out, then pull it out.

400
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:15,429
And don't forget to stretch it out, so it doesn't wrinkle.

401
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:16,929
Try it from here.

402
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:19,100
- Like this.
- Yes.

403
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:29,139
I embroidered this myself.

404
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:31,849
Me, Cha Chawoong.

405
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,119
What is this? Two mountains?

406
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,650
No, those are smiling eyes.

407
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,259
It's your trademark.

408
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:46,900
My bad.

409
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,060
Do you not like it?

410
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,499
No, I do.

411
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,740
But this is out of the blue.

412
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,840
You made me one before.

413
00:41:58,509 --> 00:41:59,880
I did? When?

414
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,340
In our past life.

415
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,150
When I was a princess?

416
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,150
She must've been dexterous to make such things.

417
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:12,420
I don't know about that, but she had a generous heart.

418
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,030
I'm back.

419
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,969
- Look at that!
- Officer Go!

420
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:30,710
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

421
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,009
Is it a proposal?

422
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:34,180
Say yes! Marry him!

423
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:43,050
"Just the thought of you is enough...

424
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,349
to fill my heart with warmth and flowers.

425
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,190
Not being able to convey my feelings saddened me in our past life,

426
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,230
but not anymore.

427
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,829
Please accept the flowers."

428
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:03,809
Are you off work now?

429
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:05,709
Mr. Cha!

430
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,580
I bought some oriental medicine for your health.

431
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,009
What?

432
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,989
So this is where you live.

433
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:21,389
I have always wondered.

434
00:43:21,389 --> 00:43:24,590
- Please have a seat.
- Right.

435
00:43:28,659 --> 00:43:32,230
This reminds me of the time I first walked into your chambers.

436
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,570
You were extremely ill. Do you remember that?

437
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,469
How could I possibly remember it?

438
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:39,509
Right, of course.

439
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:43,480
Anyway, to find a herbal cure for you, I climbed up a steep hill

440
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,280
and even rolled down a cliff.

441
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,780
I almost died first.

442
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,090
How touching.

443
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,759
Serving in the police force has built tolerance

444
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:57,360
against men talking about the military, soccer,

445
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,830
and playing soccer in the military.

446
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:04,500
But this past life business is hard to wrap my head around.

447
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,800
Why is that? Aren't you curious?

448
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
It's your story too, you know.

449
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,539
Yes, I know that it is,

450
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,840
but this is me in my past life.

451
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,050
What good does having been a princess do... when I'm not one anymore?

452
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:21,719
From now on, I'll serve you as one.

453
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,320
Mr. Cha,

454
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,750
I'm me.

455
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,759
I am Go Seulhae, not Princess Cheon Hwa.

456
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:30,989
It seems like you're being attentive

457
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:34,360
because you only see me as her.

458
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,600
It's annoying.

459
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,929
It's true, isn't it?

460
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:40,739
The flowers and the handkerchief.

461
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:42,699
You're only reenacting past memories.

462
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:45,739
If that is the case, perhaps a kiss is what's coming next.

463
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:47,340
If you kissed her, you should also kiss me.

464
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,290
Since that didn't happen...

465
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,380
Did you?

466
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,759
- Ina cave.
- A cave?

467
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:02,189
Yes.

468
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:07,659
That's... wild.

469
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:10,769
Well, it was ancient times.

470
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,570
What led to the kiss?

471
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:20,679
Were you hoping to recreate that moment, too?

472
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,080
You see...

473
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:28,079
You're the one who launched yourself at me.

474
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,250
Me?

475
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,719
I launched myself at you?

476
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:34,989
- Gosh, I did.
- Yes.

477
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:36,630
Oh, no.

478
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,689
That is why...

479
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:40,960
I will wait.

480
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,660
You will wait?

481
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:47,940
I'm home.

482
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,539
Hey, you're home.

483
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:54,110
It's Mr. Cha.

484
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,309
What brings you by?

485
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:58,009
He brought me herbal medicine.

486
00:45:58,009 --> 00:46:01,250
Yes, it's for Officer Go to regain her energy.

487
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,789
Regain whose energy? Hers?

488
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:07,719
She is made out of steel, you know.

489
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:10,530
Besides, you're in more need of it after that long hospitalization.

490
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,460
Right, of course.

491
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,659
I only got hers for a buy 1, get 1 free deal.

492
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:17,130
- Anyway, I'll get going.
- Right.

493
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,000
Take care. Good night.

494
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,909
Doesn't our landlord seem odd to you?

495
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,940
In what way?

496
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:33,749
He used to be a feisty cat, but now he's a cuddly puppy.

497
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,650
I wonder why.

498
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,250
I honestly wonder why.

499
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,189
What are you talking about?

500
00:46:44,289 --> 00:46:47,730
This isn't right, darn it.

501
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,700
I can't let myself get swept up in this past life business.

502
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:54,439
It's been a while.

503
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,840
A visit from the star detective is sure surprising.

504
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,610
The people can't get enough of the handsome detective...

505
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,579
who caught the Full Moon Murderer.

506
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,690
If only I had killed him first.

507
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:14,590
Because of you, I'm close to being cut off.

508
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:18,730
If you had, I would've arrested you for murder.

509
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,259
If that were the case,

510
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:24,699
you'd have had to arrest your father for soliciting it.

511
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:26,969
How long have you worked for my father?

512
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,039
Why do you ask?

513
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,369
Shouldn't you ask your father?

514
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:34,840
- What did you come to me for?
- Just answer me.

515
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:38,550
This is your chance to grab a lifeline.

516
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:43,250
How old are you?

517
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:46,860
Do you seriously see me as a pushover?

518
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,389
If you weren't the chief's son...

519
00:47:49,389 --> 00:47:51,929
Rather than hanging on to someone on his way out,

520
00:47:51,929 --> 00:47:54,079
get behind the one on the rise.

521
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:57,470
I won't ask you again.

522
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,170
Are you in or out?

523
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,769
All right, fine.

524
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,240
I'm in.

525
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,250
I should be.

526
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,720
Good.

527
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:17,979
Then we have a few things to talk about.

528
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:21,159
- Sure.
- I'm back.

529
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:23,590
Mr. Cha, did you see the news today?

530
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,960
An odd article was published.

531
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,559
What article?

532
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,829
It says... that you donated money to a children's foundation.

533
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:32,699
And to the Children's Cancer Foundation,

534
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,300
the Single Mothers' Association, and to the Support of the Elderly in Need.

535
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,509
They must've gotten you mixed up with someone.

536
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:41,210
"Cha Chawoong, the Charity Angel." Have they lost their minds?

537
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,909
How can they release an article... without checking the facts first...

538
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:46,679
when someone else deserves the praise?

539
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:48,150
I'll have them corrected.

540
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,690
I already have the contact numbers for all journalists.

541
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,690
I'm the one who made the donations, so leave them be.

542
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,919
Wait! It was really you?

543
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:11,239
Mr. Cha, are you hiding something from us?

544
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,679
Did your test results reveal a serious issue?

545
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:16,239
Are you terminally ill?

546
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:18,980
Are you choosing to live generously now that you're going to die?

547
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,079
How could you ask him that point-blank?

548
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:24,220
We're all dead anyway, so who cares?

549
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,190
I'm not dying.

550
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:32,959
But... a near-death experience straightened my priorities.

551
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:35,059
And there goes my appetite.

552
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:38,430
Being a jerk is what makes you charming.

553
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:40,739
Is that so?

554
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:48,180
Since that's the case, I'll keep being a jerk to you.

555
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,179
The tasty dish should be first enjoyed... by the one who bought it.

556
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:54,550
This is more like yourself. I want to punch you again.

557
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,250
Now, give that back.

558
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,550
Give it here.

559
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,720
Stop asking for it.

560
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,289
How are things between you and Officer Go?

561
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:06,830
It seems like you've been trying to woo her

562
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,759
with gifts similar to those you exchanged in your past life.

563
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:10,659
Has she been responding to them?

564
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:21,980
Goodness. She must not like them.

565
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,710
Oh, dear.

566
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:28,849
It's not like I can sit idly by when you're trying to turn over a new leaf.

567
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,359
It's been a while, but how about the Love TF Team...

568
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,730
regroup and strategize?

569
00:50:45,429 --> 00:50:47,100
Don't.

570
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,370
I'm scared as to what you'll come up with.

571
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,679
Mr. Cha, what has gotten into you?

572
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:55,809
You said you'd only be a jerk to me.

573
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:57,609
That's enough joking around.

574
00:50:57,609 --> 00:50:59,360
There's someone else...

575
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,120
who should quit messing around.

576
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:17,200
Mr. Choi, did something happen between you two?

577
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,770
What's with him?

578
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,890
Poong Baek, you are to answer truthfully.

579
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:33,179
Is it true that you are in league with Yeohae

580
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:36,750
to help them devise a plan to invade us?

581
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,989
Your Majesty, how could you say such a thing?

582
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:42,190
I swear on my life.

583
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,489
Your Majesty, someone has brought forth

584
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:47,839
secret letters to and from Yeohae found in Poong Baek's chambers.

585
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:59,609
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

586
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:02,309
but these are the letters.

587
00:52:13,289 --> 00:52:17,159
I gathered you all here at this hour to...

588
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:18,929
Jjajang ramen or bibim ramen?

589
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:20,500
Wouldn't jjajang ramen be better?

590
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,560
- The young radish kimchi...
- Please.

591
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,429
I didn't have you gather for a late-night snack.

592
00:52:25,429 --> 00:52:28,270
Then I'm out. I have a gaming league to play in.

593
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,909
Come on. What I have to say is important.

594
00:52:30,909 --> 00:52:33,409
Please take your seats.

595
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,350
As of today,

596
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,489
I will resign as the adviser of Magic Factory.

597
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:44,689
- What?
- What?

598
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:47,820
I will also... move out of this house.

599
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,829
- But...
- Is this because... of Mr. Cha flaring up earlier?

600
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:54,860
You know how he is. His mood swings like a pendulum.

601
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,600
It's the same with any new job. The first six months are always the worst.

602
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,770
- Once you get past it...
- No, it's not that.

603
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:06,150
Now that the evil spirit is gone, it only feels right to leave.

604
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,639
It is the conclusion I have come to.

605
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:11,909
But... I wish you all good health...

606
00:53:11,909 --> 00:53:15,649
and enter Nirvana when it seems fitting.

607
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,489
Goodbye.

608
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:20,559
- But...
- Mr. Choi!

609
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,460
- Just a second.
- Hold on!

610
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,929
What about the employee benefits? It's my turn this month.

611
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:29,300
I was all set to purchase... the Supergirl Lulu 20-year Anniversary...

612
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,330
Blu-ray limited edition hologram remastered package.

613
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,900
I'm sorry.

614
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:41,579
Still, you can't rush out like this as if you're running away.

615
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:43,949
You should at least say goodbye to Mr. Cha.

616
00:53:43,949 --> 00:53:45,780
This isn't me running away.

617
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,619
I'm busy, that's all.

618
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:50,590
I'll contact Chawoong when I can.

619
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:53,089
- But...
- Mr. Choi!

620
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,860
Are you sure you're not just running away?

621
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:04,999
Were you actually going to contact me?

622
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:09,539
When exactly?

623
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:13,010
About 2,000 or so years later?

624
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,139
After I'm reincarnated?

625
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:25,390
Did you see all that happened?

626
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,620
I was waiting for you to talk to me first.

627
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,890
It is why I remained patient with you.

628
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:37,399
For how long must I tolerate you though?

629
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,430
For how long...

630
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,870
must I stay disappointed with you?

631
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,169
Now that you are aware of my sins,

632
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:50,309
I figured not seeing me would put you at ease.

633
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:53,719
You should've told me that there's something I don't know

634
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:56,450
or made excuses for yourself.

635
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:04,290
Nothing I say... will wash my sins away.

636
00:55:04,989 --> 00:55:09,500
I wouldn't dare make excuses for myself.

637
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:12,270
Then tell me.

638
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:16,270
Why did you betray me?

639
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:20,139
And why have you been taunting us by pretending to be a general...

640
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:23,779
served by the Cha family?

641
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,850
As the betrothed of Seora's princess,

642
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,920
I was curious about her bodyguard.

643
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,189
It is why I am here.

644
00:56:11,529 --> 00:56:13,630
Let me see what you are made of.

645
00:56:56,469 --> 00:56:58,619
I see you are a gifted swordsman.

646
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:02,761
One that should not rot... as a royal bodyguard of this small country.

647
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,460
Have a seat.

648
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,469
Greet the men who will soon be your comrades.

649
00:57:28,469 --> 00:57:32,109
Whether they will be my comrades remains uncertain.

650
00:57:32,109 --> 00:57:35,040
I wish for us to be on the same side,

651
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,279
but you must think differently.

652
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:42,249
I hear you and Poong Baek are good friends. Is that the reason?

653
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:46,119
Quickly choosing a side will be in your best interest.

654
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:48,269
You do not have much time to spare.

655
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:52,060
Bring him in.

656
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,639
Goodness.

657
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:04,309
Yeom!

658
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:07,779
Why on earth are you here?

659
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,610
What did you do to my younger brother!

660
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:15,850
Nothing, actually. What he did is what you should ask.

661
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:22,819
As a foot soldier, he has been passing military secrets to Yeohae.
