Even before he went into the portrait,

he'd always be playing and lounging around where we couldn't see.

But the moment we start bad-mouthing him, he'd show up out of nowhere.

- Yes, you.

- When did you come out?

168
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:48,269
Are you all right?

169
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,608
You didn't hear what I said, right?

170
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:53,708
Hey, I came out just now. And I feel totally fine now.

171
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,679
And you, I heard everything you said.

172
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,418
- You're dead meat now.
- What?

173
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,289
I'm sorry, Adviser Choi. I'm not sure what I was thinking.

174
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,889
You lunatic.

175
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,898
Officer Go, this is Adviser Choi. You two haven't met.

176
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:09,929
This is your first time meeting him in person. Come on!

Say hello! Introduce yourself properly.

Hello, I'm Go Seulhae.

179
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:17,708
This is my first time meeting you in person.

180
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,708
Mr. Cha told me a lot about you, but you're more handsome than I heard.

181
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,508
Oh... What?

182
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:25,449
You can see me?

183
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:27,808
Yes.

184
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,749
Then these guys, too?

185
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:32,588
- Yes.
- My gosh.

186
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:35,419
What happened?

187
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:37,618
When did it start?

188
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:41,498
- Well...
- My goodness. What is going on?

189
00:15:41,498 --> 00:15:43,858
By the way, where's Chawoong?

190
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:55,908
General, you're here.

191
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,438
Chawoong's eyes...

192
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,108
turned blue?

193
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:27,669
Yes.

194
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:30,508
After that...

195
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:33,178
I know he was never taught how to do it,

196
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:38,049
but he just figured out how to seal the evil spirit in the bottle.

197
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:43,318
My gosh. I don't understand what's going on.

198
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,928
You said... Officer Go...

199
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:50,799
was holding Chawoong in her arms right before that happened.

200
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,999
Yes.

201
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:55,039
Die!

202
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:06,479
What Chawoong displayed was Poong Baek's ability.

203
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:11,849
Meeting those he had lost... must've awoken Poong Baek's powers.

204
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,918
It's the same with Officer Go. The powers have been awakened.

205
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:18,638
That's probably why she can see ghosts now.

206

Adviser Choi.

207
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:29,769
Has Chawoong been bedridden like this the whole time?

208
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:31,689
He's not getting better at all?

209
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:36,579
The doctor said he wasn't brain-dead.

210
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:39,148
When you're brain-dead, your brain waves become a flat line.

211
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:43,119
But his indicate that he's in REM sleep.

212
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,648
- "REM sleep"?
- Yes.

The brain waves of someone who is dreaming.

214

What? That's a photo of Officer Go when she was younger.

217
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:17,248
Oh my! I get that she has a crush on Captain Seo,

218
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:20,189
but why did she send him a photo of her when she was this young?

219
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:23,718
She's practically a stalker. You should report her!

220
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:28,558
When did she start having a crush on me?

221
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:30,128
You're the only guy...

222
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:33,828
she's ever had a crush on since the day she was born. Right?

223
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:37,939
That's right. I mean, she says that her dream is to become a detective,

224
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:40,209
but anyone can tell that her goal is to be with you.

225
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:41,908
You'd better watch out, Captain Seo.

226
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:46,009
If you keep her around and take care of her, she'll put shackles on you.

Hello!

- Hello.
- I need ox bones to make some soup.

Oh, no! This is all I have left.

- Really?
- Hey, what are you doing?

232
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,869
She hasn't paid for this yet, right? Then I'll pay 1.5 times the price.

233
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:12,039
No, I'll pay double!

234
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,908
What's the matter with you? You can buy some elsewhere.

235
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:17,979
No, this place has the best ox bones.

What? Ma'am.

You're that lady from the other day.

Don't you remember me?

You totally ruined my new outfit.

00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:30,388
Oh, I was wondering who you were.

241
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:34,358
That day, I didn't even ask you to take care of my dry-cleaning costs.

How about just half of it?

My boyfriend broke his arm... and is in need of some protein.

245
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,269
The same goes for my son.

246
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,978
Here, I'll pay with this.

247
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:51,848
Then compensate me for my clothes.

248
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:56,049
It's from a designer brand, so getting it dry-cleaned is about 300 dollars.

She's very devoted.

- Of course not.

Your beef bone soup is a killer.

What do you mean?

306
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:20,689
You always wanted to become a detective.

307
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:22,618
And you applied to our division every chance you got.

308

I wanted to become one because of the Full Moon Murderer.

But now that he's caught...

So you've lost your purpose?

That's nothing to worry about.

It's just...

315
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:47,688
my mind is cluttered for various reasons, too.

316
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:50,548
You can't reject the transfer without a special reason.

317
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:53,998
How about taking some time off to cool your head?

318
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:56,319
I can make that happen.

I'll take up on that offer.

00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:04,789
I don't know what amazing dreams you're having...

329
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,799
but you've slept long enough.

330
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:58,668
My gosh. There's not a single cloud in the sky.

331
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:00,868
Is everyone really expecting it to rain?

332
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:05,679
Quietly, put your mind at ease.

333
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,279
Understood.

334
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:35,539
- Clouds! Look!
- What?

335
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:37,009
- Clouds!
- Over there!

336
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:38,909
- The clouds are coming!
- Clouds!

337
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,109
- Look! Dark clouds!
- Dark clouds?

338
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:43,448
- How is this happening?
- It's a miracle.

339
00:27:43,448 --> 00:27:45,749
- Isn't it about to rain?
- Those are dark clouds!

340
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,449
Poong Baek.

341
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,799
- Raindrops!
- Aren't these raindrops?

342
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,159
- It's raining!
- Rain!

343
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,269
- It's raining!
- Your Majesty!

344
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:01,898
It's finally raining!

345
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:05,420
It's pouring down!

346
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,908
It's raining!

347
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:10,638
My gosh, it's rain!

348
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:22,618
- It's raining!
- I can feel it.

349
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,818
It's pouring down!

350
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:27,328
I can't believe it!

351
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:35,198
Princess, why don't we go back in now?

352
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,709
We're all saved!

353
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:45,109
Not here, Princess. You must hold back.

354
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:48,109
- It's raining, Your Majesty!
- I can feel it.

355
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:50,679
Stop! Princess!

356
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,589
- Is this real?
- We've been saved.

357
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:55,618
It's raining!

358

[Poong]

359
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:03,499
Are you ready?

360
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:05,749
- Yes, Princess!
- Yes, Princess!

361
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:07,269
- Rain!
- A downpour!

362
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:09,538
Let's go!

363

[Love Poong Baek]

00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,808
We love you, Poong Baek!

00:29:15,808 --> 00:29:18,408
- We love you, Poong Baek!
- We love you, Poong Baek!

00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:20,808
The angelic smile, Poong Baek!

- The angelic smile, Poong Baek!
- The angelic smile, Poong Baek!

368
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,289
Make some noise!

[Love Poong Baek]

370
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:33,689
Stop, Princess.

371
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,329
His Majesty is watching.

372
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:41,028
- Please calm yourself...
- Join us.

373
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:47,908
We love you, Poong Baek!

374
00:29:47,908 --> 00:29:51,238
- We love you, Poong Baek!
- We love you, Poong Baek!

375
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:53,878
The angelic smile, Poong Baek!

- The angelic smile, Poong Baek!

377
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:02,719
[Love Poong Baek]

378
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:37,918
What brings you here, My Lord?

379
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:41,488
His Majesty is overjoyed that the drought season is over.

380
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:43,499
Great job.

381
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:46,368
I only fulfilled my duty.

382
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:50,939
Is this the sacred mirror?

383
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:55,938
At a glance, it looks like a slightly unique mirror.

384
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,979
So how do you control the rain and wind with it?

385
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:15,759
The sacred mirror conveys human wishes to the above

386
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,199
and works according to the above through the ritual.

387
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:21,369
That power.

388
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:28,468
How about making good use of it for the country?

389
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,909
In war.

390
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:34,848
Things aren't looking good at the border.

391
00:31:34,848 --> 00:31:38,318
Wouldn't you be able to destroy the enemy troops?

392
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:45,658
The sacred mirror is to be used only for the people's benefit.

393
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:49,299
"I will not use it to harm people."

394
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:50,558
That's what I swore to do.

395
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,368
Is that vow more important than your life?

396
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,238
That vow itself...

397
00:31:57,268 --> 00:31:59,268
is my life.

398
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:04,379
Will you be all right, My Lord?

399
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:06,908
To go against His Majesty and plan a war

400
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:09,779
is to put your life on the line.

401
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,378
What?

402
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:15,019
Watch your mouth, you low-born.

403
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,459
You're the chief priest only because of your petty tricks.

404
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:20,028
Don't let that go to your head.

405
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:26,898
Aren't you a useless shaman without that sacred mirror?

406
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:43,679
Call in someone.

407
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,879
I need to send a message.

408
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,928
Hey, Hyoseon.

409
00:32:55,928 --> 00:32:57,858
You were there, right?

410
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,339
He looked magnificent, even when soaking wet.

411
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:12,078
The simple fact that we have Master Poong Baek in Seora

412
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:14,749
gives me a sense of pride.

413
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:18,678
Of course. That wasn't a ritual for rain but, an event.

414
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:22,718
An event to appreciate Master Poong Baek's handsomeness.

415
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:25,729
Really? An event?

416
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:28,759
There are more good-looking men out there.

417
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:35,999
Out where?

418
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:38,908
I've never ever come across one.

419
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,469
And what's more,

420
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:43,539
he has a heart of gold and is the best at what he does.

421
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:47,478
That is why we're making cheer boards.

422
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:49,979
Goodness. My hands are more used to needles

423
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:52,519
than swords now that I'm with you.

424
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:55,088
Stop asking me to cheer for him.

425
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:58,358
I am your bodyguard.

426
00:33:58,358 --> 00:34:00,759
It makes me feel small to stand in front of His Majesty.

427
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,358
I got too excited earlier.

428
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:06,169
I'm sorry.

429
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:12,398
Anyway, the drought broke thanks to Master Poong Baek.

430
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,388
But the people who have been starving until now break my heart.

431
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,779
I should pay a visit outside.

432
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:21,809
Sure, I will make the preparations.

433
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,278
Okay.

434
00:34:29,588 --> 00:34:33,559
By the way, do you think...

435
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:39,499
Master Poong Baek will join us this time as well?

436
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:43,268
So I asked him earlier.

437
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,469
And?

438
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:49,209
- Well, you see...
- Yes?

439
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:52,079
Well...

440
00:34:56,918 --> 00:34:58,549
He's going to tag along.

441
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:00,388
I knew it!

442
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:04,359
Hyoseon, what should I wear?

443
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:06,628
This is not the time for this!

444
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:08,588
Hurry.

445
00:35:08,588 --> 00:35:11,929
What about these, Your Royal Highness?

446
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:17,369
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness!

447
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:24,378
We do not know how to repay your kindness, Your Royal Highness.

448
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:28,548
No, please stand up.

449
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:31,549
I know it must've been tough.

450
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:36,219
But thank you for believing in us and holding out.

451
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:41,459
We're very fortunate to have you two.

452
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:52,299
Please distribute the grains equally to every single household here.

453
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:53,809
Understood.

454
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,338
- Gosh, Your Royal Highness.
- Thank you very much.

455
00:35:56,338 --> 00:36:00,279
- Your Royal Highness.
- Thank you.

456
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:06,349
- Aren't those grains?
- Please stop pushing.

457
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:09,659
- Do you see those?
- It's our turn soon.

458
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:12,629
- Hurry.
- I can't believe this.

459
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,688
- Come on.
- Thank you.

460
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,799
Please get medicine for your father with this.

461
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:22,169
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

462
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:41,218
Don't worry about me.

463
00:36:45,118 --> 00:36:46,759
Wait.

464
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:04,009
Here. Take this.

465
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:06,808
Your father went to the countryside to trade, right?

466
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:11,379
This will keep you going until he returns.

467
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:12,649
Thank you.

468
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:17,218
My siblings and I will get by for more than three months.

469
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:37,738
Weren't you fond of that ring?

470
00:37:38,638 --> 00:37:41,209
You always had it on.

471
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,789
It used to be my mother's.

472
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:53,259
But she'll be proud from above that I used it for a better cause

473
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:56,628
than having it on me.

474
00:37:56,628 --> 00:38:01,228
Yes, I'm sure she will.

475
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:02,639
Good job.

476
00:38:04,268 --> 00:38:08,038
I never thought Cheon Hwa would smile again.

477
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:12,038
But Poong Baek helped her step out into the world.

478
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:17,019
After her mother passed away, didn't she shut herself in her room?

479
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:19,848
Yes. It's a big relief.

480
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,888
That's not all.

481
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:27,688
Whenever the country fell into danger, he stopped anything from happening.

482
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:32,759
He makes up... for my shortcomings.

483
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:37,268
With you in mind, Master Poong Baek,

484
00:38:37,268 --> 00:38:41,409
I embroidered this myself.

485
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:46,848
It's pretty.

486
00:38:48,348 --> 00:38:51,018
Is this...

487
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:52,619
a mountain?

488
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,248
No.

489
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:59,830
That right there... is your sleek and sharp nose.

490
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:03,228
My apologies.

491
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:07,429
Isn't it nice?

492
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,668
Yes, very.

493
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,368
Well, good.

494
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:16,338
Thank you.

495
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:22,378
I also have something for you.

496
00:39:26,918 --> 00:39:28,688
It is beautiful.

497
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:32,018
It is hardly as grand as the one you gave to the people,

498
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:34,559
but I did not wish for your hand to feel bare.

499
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,859
I picked this up while passing by the marketplace earlier.

500
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:50,659
What is taking you so long?

501
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:58,718
My fingers are getting cramps.

502
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:00,218
Oh, right.

503
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,338
My answer is yes.

504
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:23,779
I would love to marry you.

505
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:25,238
Sorry?

506
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:31,418
A ring given to a woman by a man.

507
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:34,519
It can only mean a proposal.

508
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:38,018
That is not what I had in mind.

509
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,088
No?

510
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:42,088
Then, why did you give me this?

511
00:40:43,429 --> 00:40:46,099
Is this your way of mocking me?

512
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:49,238
Answer me this instant. Is it a proposal or not?

513
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,068
Mock you?

514
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:53,439
I would not dare.

515
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:59,409
Then, I will accept it as a proposal.

516
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:03,078
Well... You see...

517
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:05,218
Thank you, Poong Baek.

518
00:41:05,218 --> 00:41:08,249
Among all the jewelry I have,

519
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:12,888
this ring from you is the one I cherish the most.

520
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:34,578
[The State of Hwangryeo]

521
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:40,288
So tell me. How is my brother doing?

522
00:41:40,288 --> 00:41:44,188
He has been consuming the concoction you sent him for ten days.

523
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:47,329
I doubt he will make it through the night.

524
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,628
Is that so?

525
00:41:49,628 --> 00:41:52,129
You did well.

526
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:57,199
He succumbs to his demons a month before his coronation.

527
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,869
He should have known better than to covet the throne.

528
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:04,779
You will be crowned as king. I congratulate you.

529
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:06,649
Right.

530
00:42:07,508 --> 00:42:11,018
About the concoction being swapped,

531
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:15,488
only you know the truth.

532
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:18,418
I am the only one who knows.

533
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,059
That is good to hear.

534
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:36,608
It finally begins.

535
00:42:36,608 --> 00:42:40,778
Once I become king, I will conquer the State of Seora.

536
00:42:40,778 --> 00:42:46,218
Those who looked down on me for being an illegitimate son... will fall silent.

537
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:50,088
Your Highness, a letter has been sent from Seora.

538
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:07,909
Poong Baek?

539
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,609
[The State of Seora]

540
00:43:19,648 --> 00:43:21,148
You rotate it like so.

541
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:23,759
Your Royal Highness, this is fun.

542
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:25,658
Look at it fly high.

543
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:35,629
What a pretty sight.

544
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:51,779
Let's make it soar higher. Here.

545
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:54,249
Oh, no.

546
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:55,978
That hurts.

547
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:01,718
You must have tripped.

548
00:45:02,548 --> 00:45:04,388
Are you all right?

549
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:18,999
Goodness. Are you hurt?

550
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:21,608
I am all right, but...

551
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:31,848
Please excuse the boy. I will apologize on his behalf.

552
00:45:34,748 --> 00:45:36,148
You are bleeding.

553
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:38,488
Goodness.

554
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:40,659
- I...
- Hold on.

555
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:42,729
Just a second.

556
00:45:56,739 --> 00:45:58,838
There.

557
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:01,679
The bleeding has stopped. But to prevent infections,

558
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,719
you must clean the wound in clear water. Do you understand?

559
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:07,449
I do.

560
00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:09,199
I will leave you to it, then.

561
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:11,690
Shall we?

562
00:46:12,388 --> 00:46:13,729
Watch your step.

563
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,688
Come on.

564
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:18,398
- Your name...
- Princess Cheon Hwa.

565
00:46:18,398 --> 00:46:20,299
Goodness, are you all right?

566
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:21,869
I am fine.

567
00:46:26,038 --> 00:46:27,888
Are you all right, Your Highness?

568
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:30,638
Cheon Hwa.

569
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:37,979
Who knew such a flower had blossomed in Seora?

570
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:49,858
Can I stay for a few moments?

571
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:53,129
No, Your Royal Highness. People will see us.

572
00:46:58,199 --> 00:46:59,899
Let them.

573
00:47:00,509 --> 00:47:02,369
We are a betrothed couple.

574
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:04,639
There is nothing wrong with us spending time together.

575
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,079
Many frown upon us being seen together.

576
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:12,749
Such a jest should not be made.

577
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:19,789
It is not a jest.

578
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:22,628
My feelings for you are genuine.

579
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:24,458
Have you forgotten...

580
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:27,128
about my lowly origin?

581
00:47:27,128 --> 00:47:30,198
Or maybe you wish to constantly...

582
00:47:30,198 --> 00:47:33,199
put me in my place.

583
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,769
How could you say that?

584
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:39,539
Are you saying...

585
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:44,019
that you feel nothing for me?

586
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:53,988
Please answer truthfully.

587
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:04,279
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

588
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:08,819
I will not be able to escort you to the villages anymore.

589
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:37,028
Master Poong Baek.

590
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:42,838
Did anything happen to the princess today?

591
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:45,109
She has been silent ever since she returned

592
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:47,559
from her trip to the village.

593
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:52,119
Entertaining the children... must have drained her energy.

594
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:53,918
I see.

595
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:59,318
May I ask... where are you headed?

596
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:03,099
I am off to pray to clear my head.

597
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:06,929
I see. I wish for your safe return, then.

598
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:08,469
Excuse me.

599
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,239
Something must have happened today.

600
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:21,278
Why else would he need to clear his head?

601
00:49:24,049 --> 00:49:27,818
Poong Baek's great powers have been witnessed.

602
00:49:27,818 --> 00:49:30,788
We must eliminate him by any means possible.

603
00:49:30,788 --> 00:49:35,088
Even his great powers... are not a match for our 100,000 men.

604
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:36,998
Their land will easily be conquered.

605
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:39,358
But to take control over the people,

606
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:41,799
we must eliminate who they believe in.

607
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:44,299
Poong Baek and Princess Cheon Hwa

608
00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:47,739
are the ones who the people mentally depend on.

609
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:50,709
If you give us the order,

610
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:52,809
we will not hesitate to...

611
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:55,379
I have come to a decision.

612
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:58,619
I will propose it to the emperor himself,

613
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,319
so we are to return home.

614
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,888
What would this proposal be?

615
00:50:02,888 --> 00:50:05,119
The land, the people,

616
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:09,959
and their flowers.

617
00:50:09,959 --> 00:50:12,298
I will possess them all.

618
00:50:45,728 --> 00:50:47,799
A typhoid fever, you say?

619
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:51,138
Is there no cure?

620
00:50:51,138 --> 00:50:54,438
I believe the cheonsu herb will bring her fever down.

621
00:50:54,438 --> 00:50:56,168
The cheonsu herb?

622
00:50:56,168 --> 00:51:01,529
It is rare, which is why it might be difficult to find.

623
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:04,579
I hear it can be found in Heuknoji.

624
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:08,719
It is known to have the roughest terrain along its border.

625
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:11,858
You either die from an enemy or are thrown off a cliff.

626
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:15,588
Deploying soldiers could lead to a dispute.

627
00:51:15,588 --> 00:51:17,499
I volunteer.

628
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,829
Your Majesty, I will seek out the herb.

629
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:30,569
Are you lashing out at me to punish me for my dishonesty?

630
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:33,179
What am I supposed to do

631
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:36,048
if you remain ill?

632
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:50,759
I will not return...

633
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:54,468
without the cheonsu herb.

634
00:51:59,438 --> 00:52:03,269
Be careful out there.

635
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:07,609
Please look after her while I am away.

636
00:54:20,009 --> 00:54:22,809
How is the princess?

637
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:26,479
Her breath is only getting shallower.

638
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:28,388
At this rate...

639
00:54:29,088 --> 00:54:32,359
I hear you. Please get some rest.

640
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,329
I will stay by her side.

641
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:38,959
Have you not heard from Poong Baek?

642
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:40,568
It has already been four days.

643
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:44,999
His Majesty will deploy more men in the morning.

644
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,209
One can only hope he remains unharmed.

645
00:54:53,278 --> 00:54:55,409
Master Poong Baek!

646
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,028
Your Royal Highness, can you hear me?

647
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:22,528
Do you recognize me?

648
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:25,538
- Hyoseon...
- My goodness.

649
00:56:25,538 --> 00:56:28,068
Her pulse is steadying.

650
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:30,109
Your Royal Highness!

651
00:56:54,168 --> 00:56:57,768
Goodness. Bearing the pain will not make it hurt less.

652
00:56:57,768 --> 00:57:00,498
You may groan.

653
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:05,279
I am all right.

654
00:57:09,748 --> 00:57:12,548
As if you are.

655
00:57:12,548 --> 00:57:15,818
Bottled-up emotions only eat you from the inside.

656
00:57:15,818 --> 00:57:19,018
Say that it hurts, say you are exhausted,

657
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,028
and say how much you love someone.

658
00:57:21,028 --> 00:57:24,389
Why not just say what it is you feel?

659
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:29,269
Have you known all along?

660
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:35,168
You have been trying to hide what all the people know.

661
00:57:41,008 --> 00:57:45,349
I have asked myself time and time again.

662
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:49,349
Is being by her side the right way to protect her?

663
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:54,018
You are aware of those who wish to remove me.

664
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:02,168
If by any chance she is hurt in the process,

665
00:58:03,298 --> 00:58:05,699
I will never be able to forgive myself.

666
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:11,038
I, Choi Geom, her bodyguard, will protect her with my life.

667
00:58:11,038 --> 00:58:14,208
What you two should do is fall in love.

668
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:17,629
Cherish one another as you have been...

669
00:58:17,629 --> 00:58:20,418
and look after the people.

670
00:58:21,219 --> 00:58:24,119
What else do you need in life?

671
00:58:47,048 --> 00:58:52,008
To just see you eat while seated brings me joy.

672
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:54,418
You are the one who deserves praise.

673
00:58:54,418 --> 00:58:56,319
Hardly.

674
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:03,359
The one who should be praised is Master Poong Baek.

675
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:07,898
He went to Heuknoji to bring back the cheonsu herb.

676
00:59:09,068 --> 00:59:11,468
What do you mean?

677
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:14,868
Why did he go to a place so dangerous?

678
00:59:14,868 --> 00:59:18,879
He left before we could even stop him.

679
00:59:18,879 --> 00:59:24,208
He returned four days later, covered in cuts and bruises.

680
00:59:24,918 --> 00:59:29,719
It was Master Poong Baek who saved your life.

681
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:51,938
My body was gifted to me by my parents, and I truly apologize for falling ill.

682
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:57,479
Thankfully, I am able to see you again which I am grateful for.

683
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:05,048
Fighting death has brought me to a realization.

684
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:11,559
I wish to spend the rest of my life with Master Poong Baek.

685
01:00:14,429 --> 01:00:17,028
What if I do not approve?

686
01:00:18,169 --> 01:00:21,168
You are well aware that you must marry a man of royal descent.

687
01:00:21,168 --> 01:00:22,638
I am.

688
01:00:22,638 --> 01:00:27,938
If the tradition must be followed, I will renounce my royal status.

689
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:31,708
You will abandon your father to be with a man?

690
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:34,648
Master Poong Baek risked his own life to save me.

691
01:00:34,648 --> 01:00:38,218
If it weren't for him, I would not be here right now.

692
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,958
My title?

693
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:44,409
That is something I can easily give up for him.

694
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:46,829
It was his decision to save me.

695
01:00:46,829 --> 01:00:48,929
Is his love truly not enough?

696
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:50,738
What could possibly matter more?

697
01:00:50,738 --> 01:00:52,898
The law...

698
01:01:07,148 --> 01:01:12,959
You seem to know Poong Baek well, but not your own father.

699
01:01:12,959 --> 01:01:13,989
Pardon?

700
01:01:13,989 --> 01:01:16,389
Bring Poong Baek to me.

701
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:17,798
Do you mean...

702
01:01:17,798 --> 01:01:22,048
I have thought of enough reasons to persuade the officials.

703
01:01:22,048 --> 01:01:24,468
He who has the gift of Hwanoong.

704
01:01:24,468 --> 01:01:27,718
A cherished soul of the skies for a son-in-law?

705
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:31,009
It is a blessing for Seora as well.

706
01:01:32,378 --> 01:01:35,579
Father, you are the best!

707
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:39,519
I love you so much.

708
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,819
This is no way for a princess to behave.

709
01:01:43,819 --> 01:01:45,758
This is not what I should be doing.

710
01:01:45,758 --> 01:01:48,108
Father, I will excuse myself.

711
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:52,200
Slo-Slowly... Your step!

712
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:57,329
Please watch your step.

713
01:01:59,398 --> 01:02:04,108
Your Majesty, the Prince of Hwangryeo has arrived with his envoys.

714
01:02:10,419 --> 01:02:16,488
Prince of Hwangryeo, the people of Seora welcome you.

715
01:02:16,488 --> 01:02:18,789
One hopes that the king is well.

716
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:22,488
Yes, and one can only appreciate your concern.

717
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:27,740
I stand before you to propose a peace treaty...

718
01:02:30,769 --> 01:02:34,138
that will bring us both harmony and prosperity.

719
01:02:34,138 --> 01:02:36,409
A peace treaty?

720
01:02:37,108 --> 01:02:38,608
I am fond of the idea.

721
01:02:38,608 --> 01:02:42,480
However, the details of it will matter the most.

722
01:02:48,088 --> 01:02:51,319
Gosh, where on earth did he go?

723
01:02:51,319 --> 01:02:53,018
Your Royal Highness,

724
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:57,040
I may know where Master Poong Baek is.

725
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:02,668
After spending the day with you,

726
01:03:02,668 --> 01:03:06,769
he hiked up the mountain alone.

727
01:03:06,769 --> 01:03:11,138
Out of concern, I followed him one day.

728
01:03:11,138 --> 01:03:14,539
That was when I realized the truth.

729
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:18,348
About his feelings for you.

730
01:03:18,348 --> 01:03:20,349
Really?

731
01:03:21,318 --> 01:03:24,918
How does he think of me?

732
01:03:24,918 --> 01:03:29,228
It is hard to explain in words.

733
01:03:29,228 --> 01:03:33,929
You will have to see it for yourself.

734
01:03:38,498 --> 01:03:41,668
[Love Poong Baek]

735
01:03:48,109 --> 01:03:53,078
The love I have for you is enough for my mind...

736
01:03:53,078 --> 01:03:55,118
to guide me into spring...

737
01:03:56,718 --> 01:03:58,918
and blossom flowers.

738
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:03,029
However,

739
01:04:03,029 --> 01:04:06,628
I am not able to show you just how much I care.

740
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:12,668
The more beautiful this place is, the sadder I become.

741
01:04:14,668 --> 01:04:17,338
And that is inevitable.

742
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:13,999
I ask you once again, to be honest.

743
01:05:15,468 --> 01:05:18,668
Are you still going to claim you do not love me?

744
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:25,109
I have tried not to love you, but I failed.

745
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:28,479
So you decided to hide your feelings instead?

746
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:32,349
I thought I would be able to,

747
01:05:33,549 --> 01:05:35,649
but I failed.

748
01:05:35,649 --> 01:05:41,188
Constantly failing at something means you do not have the gift.

749
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:44,208
It is not the path you are meant to take.

750
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:50,128
Maybe it is time for you to alter your course.

751

I would if it were just me,

752

but I can not risk your well-being...

753

Do you still not understand?

754

Any path I take with you

755
01:06:29,408 --> 01:06:32,909
