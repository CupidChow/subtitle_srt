Is it something...

333
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:20,365
you can't say in front of me?

334
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:23,434
No, I can't.

335
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:26,004
I'm going to confess to her.

336
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:28,445
I already know how she feels about me.

337
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:31,215
It's time I stop making her wait.

338
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,430
Sorry. The bathroom was packed with people.

339

340

Wait for me!

00:23:01,544 --> 00:23:06,145
Gosh, are you going to give up on Officer Go like this?

342
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:08,155
There was nothing, to begin with.

343
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:11,015
Really? Then I'm going to pay them a visit.

344
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,184
Imagine what a cool confession he'll make.

345
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,084
It's my chance to learn.

346

Go clean up. It was a mess in the morning.

347
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:23,564
That is if you want more blind dates.

348

Fine, I will.

Does this belong to you?

351
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:32,645
I picked it up earlier at the bowling center.

352
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,304
What is it?

353
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:40,245
Is this for Officer Go?

354
00:23:43,454 --> 00:23:45,784
No, it's not mine.

355
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:49,425
I see. Then I'll just dump it.

356

Stop. Why would you do that?

357
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:54,565
You should look for the owner.

358

Why don't you all go ahead?

359
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,935
I'll find the owner of this.

360
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:03,134
Isn't the bowling center that way?

361
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:06,104
Didn't Officer Go head that way?

362
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:08,004
Mr. Cha, that's the wrong direction!

363
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:10,115
Hey now, leave him be.

364
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,085
He's going to look for the owner.

Okay.

One, two, three.

368
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,134
Let's talk over some drinks.

00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:34,104
Why don't we order together?

370

00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,134
Hey, look.

To be honest, I've had feelings for you for a long time.

375
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:11,675
But we're childhood friends.

376
00:25:11,675 --> 00:25:16,804
So I was worried it would burden you or that we might become distant.

377

But...

378
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:23,155
I've hit my limit.

379
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:26,225
Here's my confession.

will you go steady with me?

382
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,264
Rather than just as a friend,

383
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:40,150
I'd like to be your boyfriend.

Is the answer "Underworld Scroll"?

Mr. Cha, what is all this?

Weren't we going to discuss the magic for our final round today?

Yes, and this is it.

Fire, snakes, and knives!

After all kinds of heartbreak, the man disappears into the meadow painting.

At that moment, the meadow turns into flowers...

404

and spreads out in front of his eyes.

405

The man lies down and takes a rest.

I must overwhelm everyone if I want to win.

Have you seen such philosophical magic?

Can it even air on TV? It's grim and cruel.

[Police]

668
00:44:26,294 --> 00:44:28,125
Seulhae, what's wrong?

669
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:31,264
Seulhae?

670
00:44:33,764 --> 00:44:35,235
Are you not feeling well?

671
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:36,735
Senior.

672
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:39,405
I think...

673
00:44:41,644 --> 00:44:43,244
he's back.

674
00:44:43,244 --> 00:44:46,344
Back? Who's back?

675
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:55,085
What nonsense are you spewing? The Full Moon Murderer?

676
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:57,825
It didn't come from me, sir.

677
00:44:57,825 --> 00:45:00,624
Captain Seo and Officer Go declared it on the scene.

678
00:45:00,624 --> 00:45:03,695
How the victims were strangled, and the candles left at the scene...

679
00:45:03,695 --> 00:45:06,735
Strangulation is the cause of death for nine out of ten murder cases.

680
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,700
And how can you determine that it was the killer who lit up those candles?

681
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:12,505
Candles at a crime scene don't point to the Full Moon Murderer.

682
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:15,744
- I agree with you, sir.
- Him?

683
00:45:15,744 --> 00:45:17,214
I ended him myself.

684
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,814
I personally... put a bullet through his head!

685
00:45:20,814 --> 00:45:22,715
That is why...

686
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,825
he can't be alive.

687
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,234
A copycat maybe?

688
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:42,164
Yes, it's probably a copycat.

689
00:45:42,164 --> 00:45:44,405
Who is this nutjob replicating these crimes?

690
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:45,934
Find him!

691
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:48,005
Yes, Sir.

692
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:49,474
[Chief Seo Changho]

693
00:45:49,474 --> 00:45:50,914
Yes, Sir!

694
00:46:07,794 --> 00:46:10,664
Where are you? We need to meet up.

695
00:46:26,345 --> 00:46:28,285
So?

696
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,115
All I have to do is find this guy?

697
00:46:30,115 --> 00:46:31,555
No.

698
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,385
End him once you do.

699
00:46:33,385 --> 00:46:35,185
Look at that.

700
00:46:36,624 --> 00:46:38,894
You're coming out swinging this time.

701
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:40,925
Who is it anyway?

702
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:49,664
That's none of your business.

703
00:46:49,664 --> 00:46:53,075
Just get it done. No loose ends.

704
00:46:57,544 --> 00:47:01,084
Have you ever seen the Badger do a lousy job?

705
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:06,854
I hear a police raid has been scheduled.

706
00:47:06,854 --> 00:47:09,325
Just give me a heads-up.

707
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:11,595
Although I'd rather prefer there not to be one.

708
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:14,194
Fine.

709

- Who knows.

Don't worry though.

713

[Find this man.]

- We have a message.
- A message?

717
00:47:48,394 --> 00:47:50,565
Hey, we have a message.

718
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:03,775
Look. See how he's limping?

719
00:48:03,775 --> 00:48:06,644
The Full Moon Murderer was shot in the right leg.

720
00:48:06,644 --> 00:48:09,814
His limping doesn't make him the Full Moon Murderer.

721
00:48:09,814 --> 00:48:15,084
I asked around the neighborhood and a few of them saw him.

722
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:20,095
They noticed the resemblance to this photo.

723
00:48:20,095 --> 00:48:22,464
Where's proof that he's the killer?

724
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:24,735
Check out the timestamp.

725
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,665
It's around the time the married couple stopped contacting their daughter.

726
00:48:28,665 --> 00:48:31,474
The Full Moon Murder case.

727
00:48:31,474 --> 00:48:32,934
Will it finally be reopened?

728
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:36,474
It's not enough to prove that he's the killer... or the Full Moon Murderer for that matter.

729
00:48:36,474 --> 00:48:40,814
- The date of the crime, his MO, and his appearance...
- Go Seulhae.

730
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:43,155
Aren't you aware of the chaos it'll cause...

731
00:48:43,155 --> 00:48:45,755
if we announce the reopening of this case?

732
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:49,655
If we're proven wrong, the aftermath will be catastrophic.

733
00:48:50,255 --> 00:48:55,325
It's why we must make level-headed decisions.

734
00:48:55,325 --> 00:48:56,934
I...

735
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,604
have been after him for ten years.

736
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:04,075
And you still call yourself a police officer?

737
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:05,575
How dare you.

738
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,104
The Full Moon Murderer?

739
00:49:07,104 --> 00:49:11,044
He was killed by none other... than our own chief!

740
00:49:11,044 --> 00:49:13,584
You're trying to say otherwise.

741
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,814
- That's not it.
- Get lost, will you?

742
00:49:15,814 --> 00:49:21,225
Instead of chasing ghosts, try saving more innocent lives.

743
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:27,255
A ghost?

744
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:30,565
- A ghost...
- What the...

745
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:32,865
You!

746
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:36,805
Did she just treat me like I'm invisible?

747
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:44,745
What you're saying is that Officer Go and Mr. Cha...

748
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:47,244
were in love in their past lives.

749
00:49:47,244 --> 00:49:52,045
Officer Go. What a tough life she has had.

750
00:49:52,045 --> 00:49:54,954
- What?
- I don't have to see...

751
00:49:54,954 --> 00:49:59,055
to know that you were temperamental and annoying.

752
00:49:59,055 --> 00:50:02,294
You never know. He said that Seulhae was a princess.

753
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:06,435
Mr. Cha might not have had any issues with his personality.

754
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:07,934
Are you saying...

755
00:50:08,934 --> 00:50:10,974
that I have issues now?

756
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:16,005
Isn't it obvious?

757
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:20,314
Mr. Choi, how can you be sure that it was their past lives?

758
00:50:20,314 --> 00:50:22,684
Were you there to witness it?

759
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:25,184
What? Oh, that.

760
00:50:25,184 --> 00:50:29,624
It's an educated guess, that's all.

761
00:50:30,354 --> 00:50:32,394
That's right.

762
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:33,994
Can we stop talking about this?

763
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:36,195
Seeing her in my dreams is annoying enough.

764
00:50:36,195 --> 00:50:39,834
I keep hearing that I'm to blame for her death.

765
00:50:39,834 --> 00:50:42,905
There's no way I would've been that evil.

766
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:45,004
Why not?

767
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:48,275
Why do you think that way?

768
00:50:50,974 --> 00:50:56,115
Anyway, don't mention Officer Go or that princess ever again.

769
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:58,455
I'm sick and tired of it.

770
00:50:59,584 --> 00:51:03,124
I see her when my eyes are closed and when they are open.

771
00:51:03,124 --> 00:51:04,755
Darn it.

772
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,094
Mr. Cha!

773
00:51:07,094 --> 00:51:09,934
See? I'm now hearing her voice, too.

774
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:11,690
Go Seulhae...

775
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,660
- Mr. Cha.
- My gosh.

776
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:16,934
It's really you.

777
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:21,344
What brings you by?

778
00:51:22,104 --> 00:51:23,974
The Full Moon Murderer.

779
00:51:26,914 --> 00:51:28,915
His evil spirit is back.

780
00:51:33,055 --> 00:51:34,754
It's absurd.

781
00:51:34,754 --> 00:51:40,195
His spirit was sealed ten years ago and sank to the bottom of the ocean.

782
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:42,794
What if the spirit broke free?

783
00:51:43,635 --> 00:51:45,995
It happened once before.

784
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:49,405
The sea.

785
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:55,305
Not long ago, a fisherman went missing at sea.

786
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:59,014
One of them resembles the Full Moon Murderer.

787
00:51:59,014 --> 00:52:02,915
They say he wandered into the town suffering from amnesia.

788
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:05,255
What if...

789
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:08,724
the evil spirit has possessed the Full Moon Murderer again?

790
00:52:11,425 --> 00:52:15,164
I must see for myself.

791
00:53:27,135 --> 00:53:29,505
You are right.

792
00:53:30,334 --> 00:53:32,304
It's him.

793
00:53:42,814 --> 00:53:46,755
I will handle this myself, so don't worry.

794
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:50,425
How could you take him on without your Chosen Pupil?

795
00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:54,254
The night of the full moon is when he can absorb the seven-star channel.

796
00:53:54,254 --> 00:53:57,564
I calculated the days from when his spirit broke free.

797
00:53:57,564 --> 00:54:00,094
He is still weak.

798
00:54:00,094 --> 00:54:02,265
It gives me a good enough chance.

799
00:54:02,265 --> 00:54:05,775
Evil spirits grow stronger... as they absorb the seven-star channel.

800
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,044
Why must it be done on the night of the full moon?

801
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,144
Why not absorb it every day?

802
00:54:09,144 --> 00:54:11,615
The seven-star channel is sacred...

803
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,945
and can't be touched by evil on regular days and nights.

804
00:54:13,945 --> 00:54:18,755
However, when yin energy is ample like on the night of the full moon,

805
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:23,384
evil spirits gain enough power to absorb the gift.

806
00:54:23,384 --> 00:54:26,425
When yin energy is ample?

807
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,394
That's how he became the Full Moon Murderer.

808
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:34,905
What exactly is... the seven-star channel?

809
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:38,575
A gateway for the skies to convey their thoughts...

810
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:42,505
and for living wishes to reach the skies.

811
00:54:42,505 --> 00:54:44,674
Not everyone possesses the gift.

812
00:54:44,674 --> 00:54:48,285
About 1 in 10,000 people are born with it.

813
00:54:49,615 --> 00:54:52,584
You have the energy of the seven stars, too.

814
00:54:56,325 --> 00:55:01,725
I don't think I've ever seen one so powerful before.

815
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:07,034
Well, what you're saying... is that I have what he seeks.

816
00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:08,664
That's great.

817
00:55:08,664 --> 00:55:11,604
I'll be the one to lure him.

818
00:55:11,604 --> 00:55:14,675
Are you insane? Know your place, Officer Go.

819
00:55:14,675 --> 00:55:16,374
This is no job for a mortal.

820
00:55:16,374 --> 00:55:17,975
I can't sit around and do nothing.

821
00:55:17,975 --> 00:55:20,015
He murdered my dad...

822
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:27,215
See? They're looking for you at the station.

823
00:55:27,985 --> 00:55:30,924
That's right. Officer Go, please head back.

824
00:55:30,924 --> 00:55:33,865
The police investigation could lead to clues anyway.

825
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:36,265
I'll keep searching on my end, too.

826
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:38,265
All right. Then,

827
00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:43,105
please contact me if you find anything.
