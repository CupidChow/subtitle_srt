Who do you think is the owner of this company?

329

Did I ever ask you to do this?

330
00:21:36,073 --> 00:21:38,913
I told you we're not moving.

331
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:43,012
You shouldn't have gone against the Worshipping Spirit.

332

337
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,594
What brings you here?

338
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:04,766
I stopped by on my way from lunch to see you.

339
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,372
You don't look too good.

340
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:12,013
I couldn't get much sleep last night.

341
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:13,243
Why? Is something troubling you?

342
00:22:13,243 --> 00:22:16,418
No, nothing like that.

343
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,953
Aren't you here to tell me something?

344
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:23,437
I thought long and hard if I should or not.

345

But it's best if you know.

346
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,210
While looking into the Full Moon Murderer,

347
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,714
I came across shaman Cha Sageum's family status.

348
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,277
He only had one family member.

349

Someone you know.

351
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,460
Cha Chawoong. He's Cha Sageum's grandson.

352
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,413
I thought it was a coincidence and Cha Chawoong had no idea about it.

I thought you should know that.

00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:03,633
Stop taking advantage of Seulhae... and stay out of her life.

357

Whether I take advantage of her or vanish from her life...

358
00:23:06,203 --> 00:23:08,523
is up to me to decide.

359
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,943
Did Mr. Cha really say that?

360
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:16,523
Something felt off about him from the beginning.

361
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,483
Cha Chawoong doesn't care about... other people's pain.

362
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:26,248
Knowing that, I thought you shouldn't keep crossing paths with him.

363

Were you really close to him?

364

Other than working together in the civil police unit,

was there anything else?

No.

367

If you feel uncomfortable, how about quitting being in charge?

368

is Detective Go Youngshik's daughter?

That's why we can't live here any longer.

Crossing paths and getting on each other's nerves...

375

will bring us enough pain as is.

With that said, please start packing.

Aren't moves usually full-service these days?

382
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:33,575
Of course. There's no way we can move all of these.

You're right.

Just when things are getting peaceful,

387
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,273
the above throws hot water at me.

388
00:24:53,273 --> 00:24:57,642
Because I'm a sinner, they're playing the fool with me.

You became a spirit to expiate karma, right?

390

Did something happen in your past life?

391

And it's going down on paper, so I can't be sloppy.

468
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:44,052
I should liven it up to make it feel more realistic.

469

That's what people who don't read books do.

Why don't you just talk to her?

471

I'd love to. But I can't converse with a human being, can I?

Maybe.

474
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:03,504
I can?

- I'm not sure.

00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:28,487
It's a relief the misunderstanding was cleared.

659
00:42:29,276 --> 00:42:32,946
You wouldn't have believed me if it weren't for his phone call.

660
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:36,616
- I'm sorry. But the evidence and testimony...
- You're the police.

661
00:42:36,616 --> 00:42:39,487
Shouldn't the police listen to both sides?

662
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,973
But you only listened to the owner and weren't willing to listen to me.

663
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:48,126
You almost ruined my life.

664
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:49,894
Do you know that?

665
00:42:57,106 --> 00:43:00,976
The chief? You already believe that's the truth,

666
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:03,677
so what use is this conversation?

667
00:43:03,677 --> 00:43:06,060
You're not going to listen anyway.

668
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:18,396
It being at half price was definitely appealing.

669
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:21,997
He offered to purchase it without even taking a look.

670
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:25,380
You can sign right here.

671
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:30,606
It's true I don't know him, but I know his words are sincere.

672
00:43:30,606 --> 00:43:33,347
And I can't turn a blind eye to it

673
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:36,299
so that I can make it out alone.

674
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:45,263
You can call it what you want, but how many perps have we caught together so far?

675
00:43:45,263 --> 00:43:50,943
The one with spiritual power teams up with a pretty cop... to catch bad guys.

676
00:43:51,726 --> 00:43:54,867
We're like Superman and Lois Lane.

677
00:43:57,597 --> 00:44:00,967
Mr. Cha. What's wrong?

678
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:03,675
Are you suddenly having second thoughts?

679
00:44:05,436 --> 00:44:08,205
No, it's not that.

680
00:44:09,307 --> 00:44:12,375
Of course not. I'll stamp my seal.

681
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:19,856
[Cha Chawoong]

682
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:23,943
Maybe we should ask Mr. Cha to reserve a spot next to our ancestral tablets.

683
00:44:23,943 --> 00:44:26,066
Dalgu slept on the floor all night.

684
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:27,296
Poor thing.

685
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:30,066
As if he'd ever do that.

686
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:31,936
He badly wants the dog gone.

687
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:34,507
Why won't this dog enter Nirvana though?

688
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:36,037
I thought he was found and buried.

689
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:37,777
What unresolved business does he have?

690
00:44:37,777 --> 00:44:41,777
Dalgu, do you have more affairs to sort out?

691
00:44:41,777 --> 00:44:43,717
What is it that you wish to do?

692
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:46,446
Is it because you died as a bachelor, too?

693
00:44:46,446 --> 00:44:48,887
Why don't we find him a nice dog to mate with?

694
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,957
You and your ideas.

695
00:44:50,957 --> 00:44:54,126
That's because I know how lonely it can get.

696
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:59,202
Mr. Nam, I bet his heart is as black as coal.

697
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:01,967
Dalgu, where are you going?

698
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,318
- Dalgu!
- What on earth...

699
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:08,336
Dalgu, what's wrong?

700
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:10,421
Is something here?

701
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:15,407
[My little brother Dalgu]

702
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:17,798
Dalgu, is this it?

703
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,516
That darn pig.

704
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:22,717
The collar has Dalgu's name and the owner's phone number,

705
00:45:22,717 --> 00:45:25,057
so he threw it away to keep Dalgu from being found.

706
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:27,557
No wonder Dalgu wasn't able to leave the living.

707
00:45:27,557 --> 00:45:29,726
This must be of importance to him.

708
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:33,166
We should give this to Mr. Cha and have it buried too.

709
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:36,127
Then Dalgu will enter Nirvana.

710
00:45:36,537 --> 00:45:39,967
Dalgu, is this what you've been looking for?

711
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,486
Will you finally be able to move on?

712
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:48,375
This is your little brother, Dalgu.

713
00:45:49,876 --> 00:45:51,980
[My little brother Dalgu]

714
00:46:00,726 --> 00:46:01,926
Here.

715
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,510
Drink.

716
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,967
You want details? Regarding what exactly?

717
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:17,137
On the day my dad died, you said the shaman named Cha Sageum...

718
00:46:17,137 --> 00:46:20,077
interfered with the arrest.

719
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,477
I was hoping to hear what actually happened.

720
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:26,947
Goodness. But it happened over ten years ago.

721
00:46:26,947 --> 00:46:29,887
Didn't the news article cover everything?

722
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,816
Why has it suddenly intrigued you?

723
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:37,273
I was wondering if my dad and the shaman... knew each other before that day.

724
00:46:37,273 --> 00:46:39,900
Who speaks such nonsense?

725
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:43,936
Let me be clear.

726
00:46:43,936 --> 00:46:45,996
That day, right before your dad and I...

727
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:49,577
were about to move in on the perpetrator, that shaman cut in.

728
00:46:49,577 --> 00:46:54,623
Not only did he invade our scene, but he recited some chants causing quite a scene.

729
00:46:54,623 --> 00:46:59,617
The shaman's life was at risk, which is why we had to intervene.

730
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:02,646
What happened to your father

731
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:04,787
was the result of him saving the shaman.

732
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:09,527
How did the shaman know that the Full Moon Murderer was there?

733
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:14,867
That's exactly why we suspected that the two were in cahoots.

734
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:19,197
A partnership gone wrong is what we thought.

735
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:22,737
I guess that's a reasonable deduction,

736
00:47:22,737 --> 00:47:24,737
but he was released based on a lack of evidence...

737
00:47:24,737 --> 00:47:28,407
Seulhae, that's enough.

738
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:31,177
Youngshik wouldn't want his daughter to be hung up on him

739
00:47:31,177 --> 00:47:34,387
when she has a bright future ahead of her.

740
00:47:34,387 --> 00:47:37,217
Isn't it about time you quit the force

741
00:47:37,217 --> 00:47:40,527
and find a nice man to marry?

742
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:44,956
You can count on me to walk you down the aisle instead.

743
00:47:44,956 --> 00:47:49,084
Better yet, why don't I set you up with someone?

744
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:52,662
Go ahead. Have your tea.

745
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:15,754
Naeun, is that you?

746
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:32,091
But I didn't buy anything online.

747
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,746
Officer Go!

748
00:48:41,746 --> 00:48:43,356
She must be able to hear us.

749
00:48:43,356 --> 00:48:44,887
Did this startle you?

750
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:48,470
Areum, you can't surprise her like that.

751
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:52,157
Are you Mr. Cha's employees?

752
00:48:52,157 --> 00:48:54,566
Yes, Officer Go. It's us.

753
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:56,336
Gosh, hello.

754
00:48:56,336 --> 00:48:58,766
I see you're here together this time.

755
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:00,367
That's right.

756
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:04,259
We're in front of you right now.

757
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:12,646
Mr. Cha has had it rough these days,

758
00:49:12,646 --> 00:49:15,686
but it must've been the same for you, too.

759
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:21,027
It's why we... I mean, that's why Areum made this device.

760
00:49:21,027 --> 00:49:23,827
The one who was there ten years ago...

761
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:26,930
wanted to clear up all misunderstandings.

762
00:49:28,027 --> 00:49:30,094
Who may that be?

763
00:49:30,737 --> 00:49:33,066
It's me.

764
00:49:33,066 --> 00:49:35,506
As Cha Sageum's Worshipping Spirit,

765
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:38,976
I was present at the scene along with Detective Go.

766
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,897
Is it true that my dad went to see the shaman?

767
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:46,616
I mean, Mr. Cha's grandfather?

768
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:49,546
Before I tell you anything,

769
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:53,733
I request that you believe my words just like you believe in our existence.

770
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:57,796
I'm a spirit of 2,000 years who will soon enter Nirvana.

771
00:49:57,796 --> 00:50:00,612
What would I gain from lying?

772
00:50:01,396 --> 00:50:05,937
For the past 2,000 years, I have stayed in the Cha family

773
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:09,037
making sure that evil spirits were sealed.

774
00:50:09,037 --> 00:50:15,112
But one day, an evil spirit escaped and possessed a random human.

775
00:50:16,876 --> 00:50:19,547
A human possessed by the evil spirit.

776
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:21,287
It was none other

777
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:25,907
than the Full Moon Murderer.

778
00:50:26,887 --> 00:50:28,691
An evil spirit?

779
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:32,556
Detective Go was after the serial killer

780
00:50:32,556 --> 00:50:35,367
while Cha Sageum was after the evil spirit

781
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:39,766
both hoping to prevent more of its evil deeds.

782
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:41,837
The two joined forces.

783
00:50:41,837 --> 00:50:44,206
Ten years ago, on that day,

784
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:47,077
they almost found success.

785
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,677
He must be around here.

786
00:50:49,677 --> 00:50:52,005
I can sense his energy.

787
00:50:53,787 --> 00:50:55,717
We should hurry.

788
00:50:55,717 --> 00:50:58,257
The full moon will soon be shining.

789
00:50:58,257 --> 00:51:02,427
I will set up a force field so that it can't escape.

790
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:03,812
That's your window of opportunity.

791
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:05,689
Yes, Mr. Cha.

792
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:11,909
Gosh.

793
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:19,637
You want the promotion all to yourself, is that it?

794
00:51:19,637 --> 00:51:22,244
As if I'd ever let that happen.

795
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:54,931
Pass it on to me.

796
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:57,636
Your energy.

797
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:50,216
Changho?

798
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:21,913
Worthless humans.

799
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:24,738
Don't move.

800
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:04,660
You... It's you that death will find today.

801
00:55:47,706 --> 00:55:49,934
Release me.

802
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:53,987
I order you as your master.

803
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:56,426
Release me.

804
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:06,410
Hurry.

805
00:56:07,226 --> 00:56:10,795
Please place it on the urn.

806
00:56:11,697 --> 00:56:15,008
Only that way will the evil spirit remain sealed.

807
00:56:19,606 --> 00:56:21,191
Hurry.

808
00:57:12,456 --> 00:57:13,841
No.

809
00:57:59,907 --> 00:58:01,710
Youngshik.

810
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,411
Youngshik...

811
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:21,512
I...

812
00:59:01,737 --> 00:59:03,456
That...

813
00:59:04,137 --> 00:59:06,600
is what happened.

814
00:59:13,277 --> 00:59:14,924
Dad...

815
00:59:17,316 --> 00:59:19,084
Dad...

816
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:22,607
I didn't know.

817
00:59:24,057 --> 00:59:26,077
I had no idea.

818
00:59:28,597 --> 00:59:31,237
I only believed Chief Seo's story.

819
00:59:31,237 --> 00:59:33,367
Of course.

820
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:37,037
In the eyes of a mortal who has no knowledge of our world,

821
00:59:37,037 --> 00:59:40,447
it would've seemed as though Sageum was pulling tricks.

822
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:44,117
Detective Go and Sageum's teaming up

823
00:59:44,117 --> 00:59:46,947
was hidden from his coworkers.

824
00:59:46,947 --> 00:59:49,034
I'm sure you understand...

825
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:52,301
why it had to be a secret.

826

[To my good partner, from Youngshik]

827

Not aware of the situation, I told Mr. Cha...

828
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:05,210
I'm sorry.

829
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:08,037
This all happened...

830
01:01:08,996 --> 01:01:12,146
because I let the spirit escape and failed to capture it on time.

831
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,393
It's my fault.

832
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:17,677
What?

833
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:20,697
The evil spirit broke free from our family?

834
01:01:22,507 --> 01:01:24,516
Yes.

835
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:29,446
And you're just telling me now, after a whole ten years?

836
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:32,186
You were never home.

837
01:01:32,186 --> 01:01:35,057
I couldn't speak to someone who wasn't present.

838
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:37,357
Unbelievable.

839
01:01:37,357 --> 01:01:41,157
I said too many things that I shouldn't have to Go Seulhae.

840
01:01:41,157 --> 01:01:44,137
Oh, that. I managed to solve that issue, too.

841
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:47,650
Areum helped me tell her the truth,

842
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,637

843
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:53,237
You told her everything?

844
01:01:53,237 --> 01:01:54,577
How?

845
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:58,216
Areum made this device that looks like a radio.

846
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:02,416
She called it a G... What was it again?

847
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:05,520
Well, ask her when you can.

848
01:02:06,317 --> 01:02:11,996
Anyway, aren't you grateful that I saved the day?

849

As asked,

868
01:03:46,486 --> 01:03:48,226
I brought Officer Go with me.

869

Kid, when did I tell you to bring her?

870
01:03:52,527 --> 01:03:59,037
I told you to say that... she should come if she had the time.

871
01:03:59,037 --> 01:04:02,557
I can't believe you had a kid run errands for you.

872

You could've come to me if you had something to say.

Being a gifted magician... lets me talk to Dalgu's spirit.

887

Really?

888

01:05:21,987 --> 01:05:27,756
he was happiest... when he was with you.

[Dalgu, my dear brother, goodbye.]

He enjoyed playing Frisbee...

892

and walking around the neighborhood with you.

893

He's grateful for all the times you nursed him back to health.

894

898

I'll always be his brother.

and... that I miss him so much.

901
01:06:31,657 --> 01:06:35,640
Of course, but I'm sure he has already heard it all.

902
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:15,512
Did Dalgu really say all those things?

903
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:19,166
You didn't make that up, did you?

904
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:25,107
I added some details, but Dalgu confirmed the rest.

905

Even if you don't believe me, there's nothing I can do about it.

I'm sorry.

01:07:46,597 --> 01:07:49,996
Why? I'm the one who should apologize.

910
01:07:49,996 --> 01:07:52,166
I resented you based on false facts.

911
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:55,407
Still, I didn't have to be that confrontational.

912
01:07:55,407 --> 01:07:57,307
I guess.

913
01:07:57,307 --> 01:08:00,446
I was deeply wounded that day, you know.

914
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:04,717
Your words have a way of making people bleed.

915

In a way, I guess that's a gift, too.

Well, that...

917
01:08:16,957 --> 01:08:21,336
Come to think of it though, you were right to be offended.

918
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:26,047
People condemned your grandfather, calling him a liar.

919
01:08:26,596 --> 01:08:29,367
You must've felt wronged.

920
01:08:29,367 --> 01:08:33,211
For ten years, it must've only made you angrier.

921
01:08:35,547 --> 01:08:40,764
You must've hated people... as much as I missed my dad.

922
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:50,286
But I know that ghosts exist, so don't be intimidated by me.

923

That's right.

925
01:08:55,867 --> 01:09:00,186
Don't be confrontational as a defense mechanism.

926
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:04,877
Even though everyone else calls you a liar,

927
