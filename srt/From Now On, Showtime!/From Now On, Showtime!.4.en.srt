00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,433
Look who's talking.

166
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,203
You've only made puny gains in your virtue power.

167
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:23,402
I earned 100,000 dollars today!

168
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:25,042
You don't even know what you're talking about.

169
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:28,512
Look at you whining about some chump change.

170
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:31,343
In the afterlife, money means nothing.

171
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:33,413
Over there, virtue is the currency.

172
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:36,282
- Look, these bubbles!
- My gosh.

173
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:37,982
- This is all my money!
- Goodness.

174
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:39,382
Look at you wasting my money!

175
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,522
- Are you out of your mind?
- Darn you!

176
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:44,152
My goodness. Hey.

177
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:46,492
What a lunatic.

178
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:55,233
For drawing gamblers to the website, you racked up commissions...

179
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:58,473
My, this is a lot of money.

180
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,073
Where is Kim Yongjoo?

181
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:02,142
I gave you the website address.

182
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:05,783
I gave you that info, which means I told you everything I know.

183
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:08,283
I'm not talking about the website!

184
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,652
Where is Kim Yongjoo?

185
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:13,052
I told you. I really don't know.

186
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:20,723
I met him when we agreed to the deal, but I've never seen him since.

187
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:23,662
We only talk using a foreign encrypted messaging app.

188
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:26,362
And he keeps changing his username.

189
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:30,473
Do you expect me to believe that, knowing how much money was involved?

190
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:32,843
As long as I get the money into my account.

191
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:35,213
And if I don't, I can just cut him off.

192
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:37,842
Why should I meet him in person?

193
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:43,012
You see, people in this business aren't so humane.

194
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:48,282
Sir, I just got a call from the Cyber Division.

195
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:52,263
Its web security is too complicated. They can't get through.

196
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,870
[Total Chips Stack: ₩364,532,193]

197
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,330
[Total Chips Stack: ₩373,993,229]

198
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:11,512
I even lost my building.

199
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:14,313
When that happened, I just wanted to take my own life.

200
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:17,052
But I can't leave like this. It's so unfair, you know?

201
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:21,082
That bald jerk. I must take him with me!

202
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:24,092
Take him where?

203
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:27,762
A ghost that harms a human becomes an evil spirit.

204
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:30,162
You'll never be reincarnated or enter Nirvana.

205
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:32,302
Do you want to wander around aimlessly for eternity?

206
00:11:32,302 --> 00:11:35,303
Okay, I hear you.

207
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:40,742
Mr. Kim, you're our only hope now.

208
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,073
Please try to remember.

209
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:46,412
Did your son leave any clues behind?

210
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:51,683
This way.

211
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:54,322
Clues, my foot.

212
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:58,993
I didn't even know that he hid money underground... in the yard.

213
00:11:58,993 --> 00:12:03,493
Can't you think of another spot where he could've hidden some money?

214
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:06,863
Maybe about 100,000 dollars as an emergency fund.

215
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:08,272
How would I know?

216
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:12,703
He always had a knack for hiding money, even when he was little.

217
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:13,943
When he was little?

218
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:16,442
I was addicted to gambling.

219
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:19,713
Whenever I found money in the house, I went and gambled.

220
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:23,383
So this brat hid our emergency fund under my insoles.

221
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:25,482
It was right under my feet,

222
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:30,122
but I had no idea. I searched the entire house to find the money.

223
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,600
- What's he saying?
- When he was young, he hid the money under his father's insoles,

224
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:37,532
so his father wouldn't take it.

225
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:41,132
My gosh. It really is easy to miss what's right in front of you.

226
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:45,082
What's right in front of you...

227
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:50,042
Could he be...

228
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,842
Get up. We have to go.

229
00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:59,282
Kim Yongjoo likes to hide things right under your nose.

230
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:02,682
It's right in front of you, so it's actually easy to miss.

231
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,022
And...

232
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:07,892
Why are there so many air vents at a tiny senior citizen center?

233
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:10,063
It makes sense if there's a server room inside.

234
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:12,703
He'd need air vents to remove the hot air.

235
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:17,732
He built it, so it's possible that he designed it with some kind of secret room.

236
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:20,943
Check every wall, floor, and ceiling in the building.

237
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:24,143
Comb through every nook and cranny and look for hidden spaces.

238
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:36,493
Mr. Cha! There's a basement here!

239
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,392
Need a hand?

240
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:47,932
- One, two...
- Three!

241
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:13,422
- I'll go.
- By yourself? What will you do?

242
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:17,392
No, not by myself. Didn't you see the other day?

243
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:20,864
Showtime!

244
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:23,473
Oh, I see. With your employees?

245
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:24,643
Yes.

246
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:28,643
Okay. Then I'll wait here... and catch him when he runs out.

247
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:32,170
Yes. Now, we're talking.

248
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:44,123
Be careful.

249
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:25,733
This is nuts.

250
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:41,142
Mr. Kim Yongjoo.

251
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:43,952
I know you're here.

252
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:55,392
Don't worry. I'm not here to arrest you.

253
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:58,660
Look. I'm...

254
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:02,132
I'm not armed.

255
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:03,433
Who are you?

256
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:08,243
Well, I am a member of Kangguk's civil police unit.

257
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:11,882
It has "police" in its name, but it's more like a volunteer group.

258
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:17,043
Like traffic management volunteers.

259
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:22,223
My point is, I have no interest in arresting you.

260
00:16:24,023 --> 00:16:25,322
Then, why are you here?

261
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:28,323
I'm here to make an offer.

262
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:31,302
When you catch a criminal in the act,

263
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:34,932
you don't have to be a prosecutor or cop to arrest them.

264
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:37,403
Even civilians have the legal right to do so.

265
00:16:37,403 --> 00:16:41,073
I want to sell my rights to you.

266
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:47,682
In other words, you'll let me go if I pay you?

267
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:50,103
I knew you'd get it right away.

268
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:52,783
Fine.

269
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,182
How much do you want?

270
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:58,053
For just... one hundred thousand dollars.

271
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:00,322
How come it's so quiet?

272
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:04,092
I wonder if he's okay.

273
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:11,223
Why am I suddenly getting chills?

274
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:13,443
So, 100,000?

275
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:15,970
It's cheaper than I thought.

276
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:23,843
Is that all I'm worth?

277
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:34,443
I blew the same amount of money while trying to track you down.

278
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:39,163
And I'm an honest person, you see.

279
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:42,372
This deal.

280
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:48,643
It makes sense only if you can catch me.

281
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:51,212
Of course, I can.

282
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:53,112
Should I show you?

283
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,782
Guys.

284
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:03,852
Hey, hurry!

285
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:05,223
- Let's go!
- Where is he?

286
00:18:05,223 --> 00:18:06,822
- I will kill that scumbag!
- Goodness.

287
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:08,493
- I will kill him!
- Calm down!

288
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:11,103
You're a ghost. Killing a human will get you in deep trouble!

289
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:12,133
What are you doing?

290
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,380
- I must kill that scumbag!
- Calm down!

291
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:23,373
Guys?

292
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:25,983
Hey, close the door!

293
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:27,882
Come on!

294
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:30,252
Darn, you scared me for a second.

295
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:31,982
- Gosh.
- Are you playing with me now?

296
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:34,410
No, I'm not.

297
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:41,423
You lunatic.

298
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:50,373
I said we could talk this out!

299
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,343
No!

300
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:14,093
Mr. Kim Yongjoo.

301
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:19,620
You're under arrest for running an illegal gambling site and for fraud.

302
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,180
You can exercise your right to remain silent and hire an attorney.

303
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:27,373
Stay put.

304
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:32,342
[Police]

305
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:34,283
Hey, calm down!

306
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,913
- Get in the car.
- Darn it.

307
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:39,753
Watch your head.

308
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:47,312
Was it Cha Chawoong again?

309
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:51,110
Yes. Mr. Cha... came here with me to clean...

310
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,930
Just to clean?

311
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:55,173
This late? Just you two?

312
00:19:55,173 --> 00:20:00,642
Well... He volunteered as a member of the civil police unit.

313
00:20:00,642 --> 00:20:02,843
Wrap things up here and return to the office.

314
00:20:02,843 --> 00:20:04,144
Yes, Sir.

315
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:06,412
[Police]

316
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:23,893
You could live here for a couple of years.

317
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:25,463
Totally.

318
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:28,263
There's everything you'd need except for cash.

319
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:30,933
Why? Are you jealous?

320
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:33,373
This is like your dream.

321
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:36,373
Living all alone with nobody around.

322
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:40,383
So? Does this...

323
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:42,763
Does this look nice to you?

324
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:46,522
Do you think you'd be happy here?

325
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,883
This is how you'll end up if you chase money and neglect everyone.

326
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,813
I just hope that you don't let go of the people in your life.

327
00:20:57,993 --> 00:20:59,262
I didn't let anyone go.

328
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:01,063
I caught Kim Yongjoo.

329
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:03,733
No, you didn't. I caught him.

330
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,902
What did you say?

331
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:08,042
Nothing.

332
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,543
Well... Without your help,

333
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:13,612
I wouldn't even have guessed that I'd find him here,

334
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:15,712
so I caught him thanks to you.

335
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:18,482
Thank you.

336
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:19,783
Yes, of course.

337
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:23,200
You should thank me. I should at least get a thank you.

338
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:32,162
I should at least get a thank you.

♫ Lucid dream ♫

♫ The secrets between you and me is blushing ♫

♫ A bit more, more, more, more ♫

00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:57,153
Nice, more virtue power.

350
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:01,622
My, it looks like he took care of it.

351
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:04,893
At this rate, I'll enter Nirvana very soon.

352
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:07,403
I don't have time.

353
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:13,742
I don't have enough time to loosen my 2,000-year-old knots.

354
00:22:13,742 --> 00:22:15,692
Let's pick up the pace.

355
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:21,612
Yes, that's it. Good.

356
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:25,582
More. A little more.

357
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,492
Oh, yes.

358
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:30,823
Article 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act states that...

359
00:22:30,823 --> 00:22:34,962
any person may arrest a flagrant offender without a warrant.

360
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:40,492
But not all the assaults and property damage that occur during an arrest are lawful.

361
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,372
So if you witness...

362
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:48,503
any criminal acts taking place, please call the police rather than getting involved in it.

363
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:50,573
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

364
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:56,212
Understood, Mr. Cha?

365
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,122
Yes.

366
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:04,123
That concludes today's training.

367
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:06,293
Let's get going.

368
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:10,362
- Good work.
- Thank you.

369
00:23:10,362 --> 00:23:12,033
Seulhae!

370
00:23:14,802 --> 00:23:18,073
Eat before you go. I'll treat you to your favorite spaghetti.

371
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:20,772
I'd love to.

372
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:22,873
But I have to go right now.

373
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:26,783
Treat me some other time. No matter what, okay?

374

[Trustworthy Police, Safe Country]

375
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:33,022
Goodness, Mr. Cha!

376
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:38,192
The reporters are curious about the incident.

377
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,800
Okay.

378
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:44,963
The illegal online gambler incident put you on the top of the search engine

379
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:48,203
and made you a national hero. How do you feel about it?

380
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:49,372
National hero? No way.

381
00:23:49,372 --> 00:23:53,342
I only did my duty as a citizen.

382
00:23:53,342 --> 00:23:57,872
I'm the type who can't turn a blind eye to any injustice.

383
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:01,552
Can you tell us specifically what you did during the arrest?

384
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:07,382
Mr. Cha here... had a one-on-one negotiation with the culprit...

385
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:11,322
as a civil police officer of Kangguk Police Department.

386
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:15,593
It reminded me of what a great idea it was for me,

387
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:20,133
Seo Changho, to pay attention to and support the civil police.

388
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:24,602
What was the one-on-one negotiation about?

389
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:25,903
Well...

390
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:29,243
In other words, you'll let me go if I pay you?

391
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:32,642
For just... one hundred thousand dollars.

392
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:34,892
One hundred thousand dollars.

393
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:38,782
Nothing serious.

394
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:42,252
I just stalled him and...

395
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:46,763
She's the one who arrested him.

396
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:51,792
She arrested him. Please ask her for the details.

397
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:55,733
Aren't you the officer that caught the culprit... of Choi Minho's hit-and-run case?

398
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:57,673
Your Officer Go Seulhae, right?

399
00:24:57,673 --> 00:25:00,143
Officer Go...

400
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:04,912
is an outstanding officer who I think of dearly.

401
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:10,113
Yes. Gratefully, I'm always getting help and guidance from the chief.

00:25:12,152 --> 00:25:14,553
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

403
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:19,093
Don't tell me that jerk Kim Yongjoo will bring me up during the investigation?

404
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:20,822
Mr. Cha.

405
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:28,763
I missed my chance to say this, but great work.

406
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:30,073
It wasn't a big deal.

407
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:32,573
But don't overwork yourself.

408
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,572
Civil police officers aren't actual police.

409
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:36,543
Are you telling me not to step out of line?

410
00:25:36,543 --> 00:25:40,212
I'm just worried you might get hurt or sued.

411
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:43,083
By the way,

412
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,952
how did you get that injury?

413
00:25:46,952 --> 00:25:48,923
This?

414
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,422
During practice.

415
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:53,893
Magic is a lot more physical work than it looks.

416
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:55,733
And you get hurt quite frequently.

417
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:59,203
I'm a busy man, so excuse me.

418
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:03,103
Mr. Cha! Wait for me!

419
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:08,643
Why did you do that? It was embarrassing.

420
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:22,052
You already put me behind bars, so what now?

421
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:25,362
We were next to your father as he passed away.

422
00:26:25,362 --> 00:26:26,763
And?

423
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:30,733
How about applying for a suspension of confinement?

424
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:33,102
You should see your father off.

425
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:38,333
That old man won't be happy to see his son, who took advantage of him.

426
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:41,072
Even so, he's your father.

427
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:43,343
Father?

428
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:49,653
Who do you think made me into who I am?

429
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:52,760
Obsessed with gambling,

430
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,490
he cast both my mom and me aside.

431
00:26:57,493 --> 00:27:00,122
So I wanted to show him.

432
00:27:00,122 --> 00:27:04,193
Show him what a great life I'm living...

433
00:27:04,193 --> 00:27:07,763
with the money I extorted from people like him.

434
00:27:07,763 --> 00:27:10,033
That was my way of taking revenge.

435
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:12,702
Can you even call that revenge?

436
00:27:13,503 --> 00:27:17,312
- What?
- Putting aside those gamblers,

437
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:20,112
what did their family do to you?

438
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:23,983
That wasn't revenge.

439
00:27:23,983 --> 00:27:26,923
You only vented out your anger on innocent random people.

440
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:29,823
Don't run your mouth! You know nothing!

441
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:37,093
This is the bankbook with donations... your father made to a gambling addiction treatment facility.

442
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:42,803
He donated every month for the last 20 years.

443
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:46,772
He should've spent that money on me.

444
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:50,073
He did spend it on you.

445
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,642
He donated under your name.

446
00:27:57,313 --> 00:27:58,952
Take a look.

447
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:03,092
Worried his runaway son would go astray...

448
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:07,993
and his sin would do harm to his son, he donated as a way of atoning.

449
00:28:07,993 --> 00:28:10,533
So this bankbook...

450
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:17,833
is an apology letter your father wrote to you... for 20 years.

453
00:28:28,912 --> 00:28:31,813
He atoned for 20 years...

454
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:35,293
but couldn't apologize to his son when he visited...

because of his poor mental health.

He regretted it until his last breath.

I guess not.

Lived longer and have me hate you?

It's all my fault.

stay healthy.

I'm jealous you can see ghosts.

It's a hassle when you actually can.

You have to see all sorts of them.

483

When did you start seeing them?

484
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:49,883
Since I was little.

485

Can you see anyone around me?

486

Nope, no one.

00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:10,502
Goodness.

491
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,483
This again?

492
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:25,353
What is it?

493
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:29,722
Did you see something? Who? A guy?

494
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:33,663
No, I didn't. There's nothing.

495
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:39,503
What is it? Is there something I should see?

496
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:42,233
Well, it's just...

497
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:46,473
I thought maybe my dad would drop by at least once.

498
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:50,073
Do you mind tagging along to a charnel house?

499
00:32:50,073 --> 00:32:51,442
The day after tomorrow is my dad's death anniversary.

500
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:54,843
Don't ghosts visit their family on such days?

501
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:57,452
See here.

502
00:32:57,452 --> 00:32:59,222
Aren't we...

503
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:02,953
in a strict business relationship?

504
00:33:02,953 --> 00:33:05,522
Yes, a business relationship.

505
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:09,463
So we're only business partners, nothing less and nothing more.

506
00:33:09,463 --> 00:33:15,233
We will only see each other... as a civilian and a civil servant, yes?

507
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:19,643
- Yes.
- If a civil servant... asks a civilian for illegal...

508
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:23,112
or personal favors under the guise of public service,

509
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:27,082
isn't the civil servant breaking the law?

510
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:30,582
This is how job solicitation corruption starts.

511
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:32,083
Right.

512
00:33:33,353 --> 00:33:36,122
That favor was too personal.

513
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:39,292
I'm sorry. Please forget about it.

514
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:29,132
Grandma!

515
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:31,303
You're not in bed yet?

516
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,843
So you were praying.

517
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,972
How was your trip to Seoul?

518
00:35:36,972 --> 00:35:40,643
It wasn't bad.

519
00:35:41,483 --> 00:35:44,952
But persuading Mr. Cha won't be easy.

520
00:35:44,952 --> 00:35:47,153
Persuade what?

521
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:53,823
Madam Shaman Na Geumok, let's move to Seoul.

522
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:57,233
Performing one exorcism in Seoul is way better...

523
00:35:57,233 --> 00:36:00,033
than praying all day long in this countryside.

524
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:05,503
Come on, let's make some money.

525
00:36:05,503 --> 00:36:08,102
Okay, let's do that.

526
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:11,842
- Let's move to Seoul.
- What?

527
00:36:11,842 --> 00:36:13,443
Really?

528
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:16,812
I keep having these bad feelings.

529
00:36:17,452 --> 00:36:20,883
I better stay close to Chawoong,

530
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:23,792
look into him now and then,

531
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:26,693
and take care of the General Spirit.

532
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,062
Heesoo.

533
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:36,172
Come sit here.

534
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:37,572
I'm still on duty.

535
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,272
I'm only here to get changed.

536
00:36:39,272 --> 00:36:43,312
I'm the chief. Stop talking about work in front of me.

537
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:54,452
Do you know I'm preparing to take office

538
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:55,722
in the National Assembly or not?

539
00:36:55,722 --> 00:36:57,053
I do.

540
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:58,992
That's why you formed the civil police unit.

541
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:00,193
Correct.

542
00:37:00,193 --> 00:37:05,432
Then you must also know why you're in charge of their training.

543
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,432
Before my election,

544
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:10,973
make yourself known to the residents, get to know them,

545
00:37:10,973 --> 00:37:14,503
and casually show your face around.

546
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:16,073
Understood?

547
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:21,212
I set up a blind date with Assemblyman Cho Gapgoo's daughter.

548
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:24,052
Do your best. It's an important event.

549
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:26,153
- Dad, I...
- Stop.

550
00:37:26,153 --> 00:37:29,792
I took in Seulhae and have done enough for her.

551
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:33,192
You don't need to look and clean up after her.

552
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:36,863
Stop wasting your time. You only live once.

553
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:41,363
You must become more successful than I am.

554
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:43,132
Heesoo.

555
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:11,293
Can I come in, Heesoo?

556
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:12,933
Sure.

557
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:21,453
Congratulations on getting into the police academy!

558
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:25,312
Here's an acceptance gift.

559
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:26,343
What is this?

560
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:28,242
I made it.

561
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:32,383
In hopes that you don't get hurt whenever and wherever you are.

562
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:34,923
Think of it as a lucky charm.

563
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:38,222
Thanks. I'm sure it'll keep me from danger.

564
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:39,963
Don't worry.

565
00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:42,062
Even if you are in danger,

566
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:44,963
I'll protect you.

567
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:47,633
- You will?
- I'll become a police officer, too.

568
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:52,943
I'm going to stick by your side... and not let anyone harm you.

569
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:57,243
That lucky charm is my stand-in until then.

570
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:09,352
He's right. We only live once.

571
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:17,263
- Here.
- It smells amazing.

572
00:39:18,363 --> 00:39:23,872
So, Heesoo finally asked you out on a date?

573
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:27,072
Not really. He only asked to stay behind for food.

574
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:29,922
But that never happened at work before.

575
00:39:31,943 --> 00:39:33,843
Great. That's great.

576
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:34,844
What is?

577
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:36,912
You've ignited his inner fire.

578
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:41,083
Acting being buddy-buddy with Cha Chawoong... is bringing in results.

579
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,653
It must have motivated him.

580
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:45,892
Acting buddy-buddy with him? That's absurd.

581
00:39:45,892 --> 00:39:50,032
Either way, a big shot is joined by the hip with you.

582
00:39:50,032 --> 00:39:52,063
And he's some looker.

583
00:39:52,063 --> 00:39:54,563
Even Heesoo would start worrying.

584
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:57,102
"At this rate, Seulhae might end up with another guy."

585
00:39:57,102 --> 00:40:01,303
In other words, you became his love interest.

586
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,873
Great work today.

587
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:08,413
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

588
00:40:11,182 --> 00:40:13,082
Don't leave me behind.

589
00:40:13,923 --> 00:40:15,852
I'm beat.

590
00:40:17,552 --> 00:40:19,793
- Right?
- Yes.

591
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,422
Go Seulhae!

592
00:40:35,242 --> 00:40:37,973
Be honest with me.

593
00:40:37,973 --> 00:40:40,583
What's your relationship with Cha Chawoong?

594
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,470
Well, we're...

595
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,980
Forget it.

596
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:47,653
Is it me or him?

597
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,382
Choose.

598
00:41:00,932 --> 00:41:03,173
It's obviously you.

599
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:08,342
I've only had eyes for you until now.

600
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:35,762
That's impossible.

601
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:38,203
Or not?

602
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:41,073
- Oh, my gosh.
- It hurts.

603
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:42,673
You're crazy!

604
00:41:42,673 --> 00:41:44,273
Look how happy you are.

605
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:47,582
- It's possible, right?
- Of course.

606
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:55,082
You scared me!

607
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:59,393
I'm jealous you can see ghosts.

608
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:05,262
Well, it's just, I thought my dad... would drop by at least once.

609
00:42:08,463 --> 00:42:11,532
Why is she there?

610
00:42:23,952 --> 00:42:25,812
Do I have a fever?

611
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:29,322
Gosh.

612
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:39,162
Do you mind tagging along to a charnel house?

613
00:42:39,162 --> 00:42:41,912
The day after tomorrow is my dad's death anniversary.

614
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,873
I need some rest.

615
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:57,283
That favor was too personal. I'm sorry.

616
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,982
Please forget about it, Chawoong.

617
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:04,323
Why? What did I do?

618
00:43:04,323 --> 00:43:07,763
Why do you keep popping out?

619
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:20,542
No.

620
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:23,073
Yes!

621
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:25,073
Your turn. Hurry up.

622
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:27,042
There aren't any to take out.

623
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:29,812
Are you sure you've never played this before?

624
00:43:29,812 --> 00:43:31,683
Areum.

625
00:43:32,253 --> 00:43:34,722
Do we have any work the day after tomorrow?

626
00:43:34,722 --> 00:43:37,223
Yes, you've got a commercial shoot for the security company.

627
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:41,262
That's right, I'm an extremely busy man.

628
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:43,633
It slipped my mind.

629
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:47,863
I'm too busy to go anywhere. What can I do about it?

630
00:43:47,863 --> 00:43:49,532
Hey.

631
00:43:49,532 --> 00:43:52,943
So when will the shoot end?

632
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:55,702
Probably late.

633
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:59,013
Right? It'll end late, right?

634
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,182
Right.

635
00:44:02,952 --> 00:44:04,812
Yes.

636
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:06,483
Joining the civil police unit was a good idea.

637
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:08,852
You even got a commercial offer.

638
00:44:08,852 --> 00:44:11,093
The concert booking rate shot up, too.

639
00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:14,792
Mr. Cha, don't we get a bonus from your commercial?

640
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,263
Bonus, my foot.

641
00:44:16,263 --> 00:44:19,892
We barely made up for the money we lost gambling.

642
00:44:21,302 --> 00:44:23,802
How can you ask that after what I've gone through?

643
00:44:27,642 --> 00:44:31,543
Adviser Choi, I've got a question.

644
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,843
Be quick. I'm busy.

645
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:38,452
Those gifted by the seven spirits.

646
00:44:38,452 --> 00:44:42,522
If they have a strong connection, can they brainwash others?

647
00:44:42,522 --> 00:44:44,593
Can their words constantly get to me?

648
00:44:44,593 --> 00:44:48,392
They're like messengers of the above,

649
00:44:48,392 --> 00:44:51,363
so their words are more powerful than others.

650
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:55,203
What about making others see things?

651
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:59,033
Like I would keep seeing them everywhere.

652
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:00,472
I'm not sure.

653
00:45:00,472 --> 00:45:03,312
But since the above adore them,

654
00:45:03,312 --> 00:45:06,883
wouldn't they have a different presence?

655

Yes, hello.

822
00:55:37,642 --> 00:55:40,673
I see you're one to respect your elders.

823
00:55:40,682 --> 00:55:42,443
Yes, Chief.

824
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:44,052
I've dealt with the matter.

825
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:46,853
The homeowner forgot to turn the TV off.

826
00:55:46,853 --> 00:55:49,553
Yes, Sir. I'll return to the station.

827
00:55:53,052 --> 00:55:57,893
Adviser Choi, I'll head out, then.

828
00:55:57,893 --> 00:56:01,103
I'd appreciate it if you kept the volume down.

829
00:56:13,272 --> 00:56:15,813
Woong!

830
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:24,522
- Why are you here again?
- I had business in town, so I stopped by.

831
00:56:24,522 --> 00:56:27,823
Grandma and I are opening... a fortune-teller parlor up the street.

832
00:56:27,823 --> 00:56:30,262
Why in this neighborhood?

833
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,693
Must you ask?

834
00:56:31,693 --> 00:56:35,832
Thread is where the needle is... and rain is where the clouds are.

835
00:56:35,832 --> 00:56:39,632
Please leave and never come back.

836
00:56:39,632 --> 00:56:41,142
Move.

837
00:56:42,642 --> 00:56:45,642
How can I not be back?

838
00:56:45,642 --> 00:56:49,842
We need to settle on a date... as well as book the venue and salon among other things.

839
00:56:49,842 --> 00:56:52,153
The venue? The salon?

840
00:56:52,153 --> 00:56:54,622
Are you right in the head? Have you lost it?

841
00:56:54,622 --> 00:56:57,783
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes, I do.

842
00:56:57,783 --> 00:57:01,492
When will you break up with her?

843
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:04,832
Just when will you break up with her?

844
00:57:11,073 --> 00:57:13,403
Mr. Cha, are you just getting back?

845
00:57:13,403 --> 00:57:14,872
That's right.

846
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:17,972
Is she your girlfriend?

847
00:57:21,343 --> 00:57:23,383
It's a pleasure to meet you.

848
00:57:23,383 --> 00:57:29,782
I am Woong's future wife, Cheon Yeji.

849
00:57:30,923 --> 00:57:34,123
What a relief. I'm way better than her.

850
00:57:34,123 --> 00:57:35,562
Sorry?

851
00:57:35,562 --> 00:57:38,863
Woong, didn't you act like you had high standards?

852
00:57:38,863 --> 00:57:44,333
Your taste in women is quite humble.

853
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:47,742
Woong, I'll be in touch.

854
00:57:47,742 --> 00:57:49,003
Why would you be?

855
00:57:49,003 --> 00:57:52,143
I hope we never meet again.

856
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:57,182
What did I just hear?

857
00:57:58,383 --> 00:58:00,452
Mr. Cha, are you getting married?

858
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,300
Never mind.

859
00:58:03,383 --> 00:58:04,923
Why were you inside my house?

860
00:58:04,923 --> 00:58:07,822
Your neighbor called in a noise complaint.

861
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:10,593
Someone opened the door when I rang the bell.

862
00:58:10,593 --> 00:58:13,363
That darn adviser!

863
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:18,932
What...

864
00:58:20,503 --> 00:58:22,903
Can't you at least guard the house properly?

865
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:25,543
How can you let anyone in?

866
00:58:26,642 --> 00:58:28,812
I'm not your guard dog, you know.

867
00:58:28,812 --> 00:58:32,283
Besides, Officer Go isn't just anyone.

868
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:34,253
This is my house where I live alone.

869
00:58:34,253 --> 00:58:37,593
Everyone else but me is considered an outsider.

870
00:58:37,593 --> 00:58:40,722
Have a party here why don't you?

871
00:58:41,622 --> 00:58:43,122
Wait.

872
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:47,432
What the...

873
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:50,932
Trespassing and vandalism?

874
00:58:50,932 --> 00:58:53,482
The police can't break the law!

875
00:58:53,482 --> 00:58:55,302
- I'm home.
- Me too.

876
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:56,872
Welcome home.

877
00:58:56,872 --> 00:58:59,473
Guys, come quick.

878
00:58:59,473 --> 00:59:01,513
Just look at what Ms. Go did.

879
00:59:01,513 --> 00:59:05,513
She ruined my perfectly good picture.

880
00:59:05,513 --> 00:59:07,753
- Did Officer Go draw this?
- Yes!

881
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,082
- How did she...
- She used our photos as references.

882
00:59:10,082 --> 00:59:12,793
Is this me?

883
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:17,463
This jerk must be... This is Areum and this is Dongcheol.

884
00:59:17,463 --> 00:59:19,993
It's like we're on vacation.

885
00:59:19,993 --> 00:59:23,533
She must've known that a botched blind date... would keep me here.

886
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:25,633
You look cute at least.

887
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:28,443
She made me look so old.

888
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:31,343
That's only because she hasn't seen the real you.

889
00:59:31,343 --> 00:59:34,443
You're truly handsome in person.

890
00:59:34,443 --> 00:59:39,082
- She did such a good job!
- Mr. Nam, this is just like you.

891
00:59:40,783 --> 00:59:43,083
This must be Officer Go.

892
00:59:48,263 --> 00:59:51,992
- Here we go!
- All right.

893
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:56,132
The fish will keep on coming.

894
00:59:56,132 --> 00:59:58,702
Boy, they sure can pull.

895
00:59:58,702 --> 01:00:01,702
We'll have another full load of fish.

896
01:00:08,613 --> 01:00:11,883
What's this? Take a look.

Just a little more.

902
01:01:38,503 --> 01:01:40,202
- Sure thing.
- Got it.

903
01:01:40,202 --> 01:01:42,942
Soondong! Gosh.

904
01:01:42,942 --> 01:01:45,042
My goodness.

905
01:01:45,042 --> 01:01:47,873
- I'll go to him.
- Sure.

906
01:01:49,983 --> 01:01:54,053
- Soondong, what are you up to?
- Goodness.

907
01:01:54,053 --> 01:01:57,782
Soondong, what's wrong?

No, don't!

No...

Soondong, what has gotten into you?

913
01:02:25,253 --> 01:02:27,623
My gosh. Why are you doing this?

914
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:29,882
Come to your senses!

915
01:03:24,213 --> 01:03:26,972
Freeze. You're under arrest.

916
01:03:26,972 --> 01:03:30,543
Are you kidding me? But I saw everyone leave.

917

Are we done?

921
01:03:45,262 --> 01:03:47,202
Your expressions seemed a bit frigid.

922
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:50,303
How about a big smile for when you wink?

923
01:03:50,303 --> 01:03:52,673
You have what you need, so let's call it a day.

924
01:03:52,673 --> 01:03:54,672
Let's give it another shot.

925
01:03:54,672 --> 01:03:56,573
Should we eat first? It's dinnertime.

926
01:03:56,573 --> 01:03:57,912
Shall we have dinner first?

927
01:03:57,912 --> 01:03:59,472
- Sure.
- Sure.

No, let's get it over with.

A, E, I, O, U.

930
01:04:03,482 --> 01:04:08,753
A, E, I... Is this big enough for you?

931
01:04:08,753 --> 01:04:11,483
You're getting there. Yes, I love that big smile.

932
01:04:11,483 --> 01:04:14,292
- This one? Let's do it, then.
- Yes, that.

933
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:16,692
Get ready!

934
01:04:16,692 --> 01:04:18,932
- I'm calling it a day.
- You did well today.

935
01:04:18,932 --> 01:04:22,103
What? Officer Go, hold on a second.

936
01:04:22,103 --> 01:04:24,372
There's an article covering you and Cha Chawoong.

937
01:04:24,372 --> 01:04:27,632
- Is that so?
- Check this.

938
01:04:27,632 --> 01:04:29,503
My gosh.

939
01:04:29,503 --> 01:04:32,713
That's right. You also caught the hit-and-run driver together.

940
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:35,883
The two of you must make good partners.

941
01:04:35,883 --> 01:04:39,883
Maybe it'll lead to being more than just friends.

942
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:41,452
That will never happen.

943
01:04:41,452 --> 01:04:44,652
It's not right to put up a wall like that at your age.

944
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:47,792
Date whomever you can and move on from guy to guy.

945
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:50,733
Then, choose the best one to settle down with.

946
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:52,263
Of course.

947
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:57,663
Your father would be thrilled if you came by... with a guy at your side.

948
01:04:57,663 --> 01:04:58,873
Have a good one, then.

949
01:04:58,873 --> 01:05:01,680
- Sure.
- And even though this isn't much...

950
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,102
I can't accept this.

951
01:05:03,102 --> 01:05:06,613
This is me giving, not you accepting.

952
01:05:06,613 --> 01:05:08,042
- Just get going.
- Thank you, Sir.

953
01:05:08,042 --> 01:05:09,412
- Go on.
- I'll get going, then.

954
01:05:09,412 --> 01:05:11,452
- Sure.
- Have a good day.

955
01:05:11,452 --> 01:05:13,852
I'll wish that there is something between you two.

956
01:05:23,693 --> 01:05:25,193
Hop in.

957
01:05:29,403 --> 01:05:31,902
Aren't you going?

958
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:35,632
It's the anniversary of your father's death.

959
01:05:37,443 --> 01:05:38,912
Why did you pick me up?

960
01:05:38,912 --> 01:05:41,710
I thought this was beyond the scope of your work.

961
01:05:43,213 --> 01:05:46,012
Oh, this? I wrapped up the filming of my ad campaign...

962
01:05:46,012 --> 01:05:48,553
and had some time to kill with nothing better to do.

963
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:52,592
I thought I could go for a drive outside the city.

964
01:05:52,592 --> 01:05:55,622
This isn't illegal solicitation, then.

965
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:59,232
I said I had some time to kill.

966
01:05:59,232 --> 01:06:04,302
Others take all day filming ads, but I was done with it in a flash.

967
01:06:04,302 --> 01:06:10,772
People should lack in some ways... in order to seem approachable,

968
01:06:10,772 --> 01:06:14,372
but I'm on a different level compared to mere mortals.

969
01:06:17,412 --> 01:06:19,383
Are you scoffing?

970
01:06:19,383 --> 01:06:21,083
Of course not.

971
01:06:21,923 --> 01:06:24,573
I'm grateful, that's all.

972
01:06:24,573 --> 01:06:28,963
Someone of such high caliber is giving me a ride.

973
01:06:30,592 --> 01:06:32,662
You're quite generous in some ways.

974
01:06:32,662 --> 01:06:35,732
Don't get me wrong. I had some time to kill!

975
01:06:35,732 --> 01:06:40,273
Why won't you take my words for what they are?

976
01:06:42,702 --> 01:06:45,773
Where did Chawoong go by himself?

977
01:06:45,773 --> 01:06:47,483
He should've given us a drive back.

978
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:50,083
He even wrapped up filming as fast as he could.

979
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:53,083
Wait a second. Could he have urgent business?

980
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:55,083
- Keep walking!
- Keep walking!

981
01:06:55,782 --> 01:06:59,492
We're almost there. It's just past here.

982
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:03,222
Don't get your hopes up though.

983

it's an energy of a being that is neither alive nor dead.

Seriously? Who do you take me for?

1093

Put these on. Being cheeky will only end in regret.

01:15:08,813 --> 01:15:13,152
I have a feeling that it could be back.

How can he... when his spirit was sealed and drowned?

1099

Just like your worshipping spirit, all you do is worry.

1100

I know.

1101
01:15:24,993 --> 01:15:28,333
I'd like nothing more than for it to be pointless.

1102

By the way, General Choi, shouldn't you hurry with the transfer?

1103
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:36,543
Without the body of a chosen pupil,

1104

during the past centuries.

1113
01:16:04,162 --> 01:16:08,972

01:16:22,353 --> 01:16:27,253
that those two are not gifts from up above.

1118

Since I can't see ghosts...

1136

♫ I'll be there even if you don't come ♫

1143
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:24,710
♫ Now, I'll wait ♫

1145
01:18:30,082 --> 01:18:32,783
Stay still. Don't move.

1146
01:18:32,783 --> 01:18:35,222
- We meet again.
- Your boyfriend's handsome.

1147
01:18:35,222 --> 01:18:36,952
Let's go.

1148
01:18:36,952 --> 01:18:38,053
Darn it.

1149
01:18:38,053 --> 01:18:40,422
Did you and Officer Go argue?

1150
01:18:40,422 --> 01:18:42,063
It's like you aged overnight.

1151
01:18:42,063 --> 01:18:43,064
That must be it.

1152
01:18:43,064 --> 01:18:45,993
- I couldn't like you more.
- I couldn't like you more.

1153
01:18:45,993 --> 01:18:48,703
This is my father.

1154
01:18:48,703 --> 01:18:50,502
The Full Moon Murderer from ten years ago.

1155
01:18:50,502 --> 01:18:53,172
The shaman Cha Sageum. He's your grandfather, is he not?

1156
01:18:53,172 --> 01:18:54,943
Mr. Cha isn't like that.

1157
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:57,943
You shouldn't believe people that easily.

1158
01:18:57,943 --> 01:19:01,582
Stop taking advantage of Seulhae... and stay away from her.

1159
01:19:01,582 --> 01:19:03,882
Whether I take advantage of her or stay away from her...

1160
01:19:03,882 --> 01:19:06,053
is up to me, not you.
