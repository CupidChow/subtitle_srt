9
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:56,347
I didn't do anything.

10
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,358
I swear. I'm just a spectator.

11
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:04,527
- Then, why did you run away?
- Because you guys suddenly started chasing me.

12
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:15,867
I see that you've made it this far, Haechunmoo.

Choi Geom.

14

This is where we sever our ill-fated ties for good.

00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:40,727
Shall we do that?

16
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:44,197
How much longer

17
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,858
will you foolishly let yourself be caught in this vicious cycle?

18
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:48,727
That's rich coming from you.

19
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:51,968
How much longer will you be Poong Baek's loyal dog?

20
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,237
He is Cha Chawoong in this lifetime, isn't he?

21
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,337
What?

22
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:00,947
How did you know?

23
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,647
Poong Baek stole my woman

24
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:06,317
and took my life. As if that was not enough,

25
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:08,718
he even locked away my soul.

26
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:13,118
I screamed and wailed in the darkness for 2,000 years!

27
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:17,257
It is now Poong Baek's turn to suffer.

28
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:20,627
So get out of my way!

29
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:49,828
So, evil spirits can't enter my home if I put this up?

30
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,457
That's right.

31
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:56,258
And... take a few more, just in case.

32
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:58,697
If you place it on evil spirits,

33
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,597
it can subdue them

34
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:04,738
for a short while, though not for long.

35
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:22,028
Something must've happened to the general.

36
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,687
We should hurry.

37
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:33,398
Adviser Choi, wake up. Adviser Choi!

38
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:41,947
What's going on? What happened?

39
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:45,817
Let's take him inside.

40
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,457
My gosh, General.

41
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:55,328
What on earth happened?

42
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,927
I had an encounter with an evil spirit.

43
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,368
An evil spirit?

44
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:06,167
He's hurt,

45
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,137
but I lost him.

46
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,068
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:14,048
I told you that you'd struggle without your chosen pupil.

48
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:18,548
He knows about you, Chawoong.

49
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,448
He's after you.

50
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:22,048
Me?

51
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:25,017
He and I...

52
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,687
were enemies in our past life.

53
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:32,727
He wants to get his revenge.

54
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:35,097
And he will show up again to do that.

55
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:39,797
Is it the man I saw in my dream?

56
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,537
The one who accused me of killing a princess.

57
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:44,268
That's right.

58
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,847
He could kill me off...

59
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,378
or go after your body.

60
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:56,147
If you run into that evil spirit,

61
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,787
make sure there's no wound on your body.

62
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:03,728
Blood is the vehicle through which evil spirits enter the human body.

63
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,358
Once possessed,

64
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:10,927
the evil spirit will have complete control over your mind and body.

65
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:16,767
You must heed my advice...

66
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:19,008
Adviser Choi.

67
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:23,308
His body... He's disappearing.

68
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:26,447
He must have exhausted his spiritual power.

69
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:28,187
General.

70
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,218
I'll do everything in my power to keep Chawoong safe,

71
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:35,028
so hurry up and return to the portrait.

72
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,787
Chawoong...

73
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:40,328
Don't forget...

74
00:06:57,247 --> 00:07:00,317
So you and your squad all got beaten up by the same guy?

75
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:02,087
That's right.

76
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:05,018
The scumbag who did this to my face.

77
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,458
Here's how it went down. I was scared, so...

78
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,028
I mean, I stepped back for a moment.

79
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:14,368
But that scumbag whacked the others.

80
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,967
He wiped them out using some kind of superpower.

81
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,598
Superpower?

82
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:22,038
Hey, do you actually think we'd buy that?

83
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,567
I'm telling you the truth.

84
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,438
He'd just do this with his hand and make you fly away and suffocate you...

85
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:29,078
Hey, that's enough.

86
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:30,947
Name the gang you fought with.

87
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:33,517
You'd better tell us!

88
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,117
Hold on.

89
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,017
Was it...

90
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:42,587
this man?

91
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:46,998
Yes, this man... It was him.

92
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,368
Who is this guy?

93
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,067
Tell me everything you know.

94
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,937
I know nothing about him.

95
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:55,238
Just blame my bad luck for running into him.

96
00:07:56,007 --> 00:08:00,808
Oh, actually... he asked me if I knew Cha Chawoong, which was random.

97
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:03,447
You know, that magician who lives in the area.

98
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:22,597
Mr. Cha, open the door! Mr. Cha!

99
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,467
Mr. Cha!

100
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:33,538
Mr. Cha! Chawoong...

101
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,077
What's going on?

102
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:39,747
Are you okay? Are you not hurt?

103
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,718
I'm all right, for now.

104
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:46,358
Thank goodness.

105
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:50,028
Why didn't you pick up if there was nothing wrong with you?

106
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:52,358
I called you several times!

107
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:53,698
What?

108
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:58,967
Oh, my battery died.

109
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:00,937
Darn you...

110
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:05,438
- Why are you being like this?
- Do you know how worried I was?

111
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:08,108
You gave me such a scare!

112
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:15,447
Is Adviser Choi in critical condition?

113
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:17,617
How long does he have to stay in there?

114
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:20,158
His spirit nearly dissipated,

115
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:22,928
so it'll take him days to recover.

116
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,227
Then, what will you do? That scumbag will come back for you.

117
00:09:25,227 --> 00:09:28,197
He ran away knowing that Adviser Choi had lost his power,

118
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:30,868
which means he took a hit, too.

119
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,307
Until he absorbs more energy from the seven-star channel,

120
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,338
he can't use his powers.

121
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:39,837
Then this is our chance.

122
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:43,008
- We should just put out an APB...
- No, we can't do that.

123
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:45,148
If he feels cornered because his face is revealed to the public,

124
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:49,148
he may ditch the body and possess someone else's.

125
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:51,217
We went through all that to find out what he looks like.

126
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:54,158
If that happened, we'd be back to square one.

127
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,528
Right, possession.

128
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:02,168
You're right.

129
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,367
If he takes over a police officer during his arrest...

130
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:08,237
Then he'll become a lot more dangerous.

131
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:15,047
We just have to make sure we catch him before the police do.

132
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,187
I'll return the patrol car and come right back.

133
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,117
Actually, I should stop by my place and pick up some fresh clothes.

134
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:26,518
Sure. Wait! What?

135
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:28,987
You'll come back? And why do you need fresh clothes?

136
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:31,758
What do you think? Starting today, I'll be on a stakeout right here.

137
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:33,727
Who knows when he'll show up again?

138
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,428
I have to guard you.

139
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:37,298
And we must come up with a plan to get him.

140
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:40,668
So? You'll eat and also sleep here?

141
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:42,707
- Yes.
- Come on.

142
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:45,577
You do know that I live alone, right?

143
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:47,908
You live with three employees, not alone.

144
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,117
Also, I'm a police officer, not a woman.

145
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,117
To me, you're an important witness, not a man.

146
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:57,618
This is the witness protection program, okay?

147
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,518
See you in a bit.

148
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,418
Dad,

149
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,788
I have a partner too.

150
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:33,458
I'll catch the Full Moon Murderer with Mr. Cha.

151
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:39,228
You know, I used to resent and hate you a lot.

152
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,668
But now, I understand...

153
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:49,468
why you were there that night... and why you had to go.

154
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,077
I promise you that I'll...

155
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,378
I mean, we will catch the Full Moon Murderer at all costs,

156
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,547
so watch over us.

157
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:07,687
Okay?

158
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,097
Where are you going at this hour? You just got home.

159
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,937
I have to go on a stakeout. I may not come home for a few days.

160
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,807
A stakeout? Come on. You're not a homicide detective.

161
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:25,137
Are you going on a trip with Heesoo now that you two are a couple?

162
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:28,478
What? I haven't even given him my answer yet.

163
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:31,208
Then, where are you going?

164
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,447
I'm not just your roommate.

165
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:36,018
I'm your guardian and your friend for twenty years.

166
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:38,117
Tell me before my feelings are hurt.

167
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:40,057
Well, the thing is...

168
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,087
- I'm going to Mr. Cha's place.
- What?

169
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,528
I swear, it's not what you think.

170
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:49,597
The perp I've been chasing is after him, so I'm going there to protect him as a cop.

171
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:51,237
Yes, as a cop.

172
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,798
You're crazy. Do you seriously expect me to believe that?

173
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:59,138
Is he the reason you're not so interested in Heesoo anymore?

174
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:01,648
I told you it was not like that. What do you take me for?

175
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,178
Let go.

176
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:05,778
Then answer this question.

177
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:10,848
What if... Heesoo and Cha Chawoong were the only two men alive?

178
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,557
Who would you choose?

179
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,697
Why must you ask such a useless question?

180
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,428
My gosh, look at this.

181
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:23,468
In the past, you would've said Heesoo's name in 0.0001 seconds.

182
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,597
You've changed.

183
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:28,967
Whatever. I don't have time to think about stuff like that now.

184
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:31,338
I must catch the killer first.

185
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,517
I swear, I don't have an ulterior motive.

186
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,678
I'm just going on a stakeout.

187
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,988
That sly fox.

188
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:47,117
I see that she has a plan.

189
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,468
What? She really came.

190
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,038
Welcome.

191
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,668
I love how proactive you are, Officer Go.

192
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:03,308
I like that spirit.

193
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:05,778
It'll be so much fun to hang out with you all night.

194
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:10,308
I can play an FPS game with a cop. It'll feel so real!

195
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,787
I didn't come here to play. I'm here for a stakeout.

196
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:19,057
We know that, but it'd be too much if you had to do it on your own.

197
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:22,128
We're going to take turns with you.

198
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,558
What? When did we decide that?

199
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,427
We'll go up to the roof and take a look around.

200
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:33,237
So unpack and get settled in.

201
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,768
Take your time!

202
00:14:36,768 --> 00:14:38,937
Okay, thank you!

203
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,308
Where can I put my bag?

204
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:45,778
Go!

205
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,718
Oh, sorry. You can use my room.

206
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,587
No, that's okay. The guest room would do.

207
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:57,357
There's no guest room.

208
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,528
What? In this big house?

209
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:01,528
There's no guest room in this huge house?

210
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:04,367
Because I never have guests?

211
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:07,238
Oh, I see. Okay.

212
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:10,437
Then I'll leave it in the living room.

213
00:15:10,437 --> 00:15:12,907
Come on, seriously.

214
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,807
Just use my room.

215
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:20,448
If you sleep on the couch, you'll blame me for your back pain later.

216
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:04,958
A woman's ring?

217
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,798
Oh, I forgot something.

218
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,407
Did you open it?

219
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:21,707
No! It was here.

220
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:24,678
Right. It's a prop for my magic show.

221
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:26,678
It's dangerous, so it should be handled with caution.

222
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:28,817
I forgot to put it away.

223
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:30,547
I see.

224
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:35,187
Oh, these are all floor lamps.

225
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:37,727
Right, this one too.

226
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:40,258
There are some tissues here. And I have some pens here.

227
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:43,028
There are different colors. Feel free to use them.

228
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:46,898
Here, you can use my calendar too. And...

229
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:49,007
Here's a full-length mirror and...

230
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,138
- This mirror...
- The bed is here.

231
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:53,077
Right, this is my air purifier.

232
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:56,448
Press this button here to turn it on.

233
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,917
You can use this relaxation chair, too.

234
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,458
Is there anything else you need?

235
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,957
No, nothing.

236
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:16,127
Have you not had dinner yet?

237
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,497
I was busy, so I forgot.

238
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:25,307
Do you have some ramen?

239
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,277
Why are you only cooking one? What about you?

240
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:35,588
I'm on a low-carb, high-fat diet.

241
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,187
I never eat ramen.

242
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:41,358
I only bought some for my employees.

243
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:45,557
Then, can I cook it to my liking?

244
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,997
A little bit of soybean paste.

245
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:51,597
And some soybean sprouts!

246
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,938
My gosh, it smells so good.

247
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:17,328
My dad taught me how to cook this soybean paste ramen.

248
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,998
Every time I eat this, I'm just blown away.

249
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,477
You see,

250
00:18:35,477 --> 00:18:39,048
I never eat anything this late at night.

251
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:40,517
Right, of course.

252
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:43,947
It takes some work to maintain that perfect body. Keep it up.

253
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:46,017
You see, that's the problem.

254
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:48,988
I'm too perfect. That's why some people find me unapproachable.

255
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:50,658
Okay, so?

256
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,467
That said, I want to become more approachable, so...

257
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,138
let me have a bite.

258
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:03,708
Do you have to become more approachable now?

259
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,308
I can't believe this.

260
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:08,847
You're eating my ramen in my house. I can't even have a bite?

261
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,177
You're so petty.

262
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,288
Okay, fine.

263
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:21,217
- Just one bite, then.
- Okay.

264
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,758
Hot!

265
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,338
What did you do to this? It's delicious!

266
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:40,238
It's still hot.

267
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:42,278
Stop right there!

268
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:44,007
You only said one bite! Isn't that two?

269
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,517
Stop! No!

270
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,748
This heartwarming taste!

271
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:53,288
Heartwarming, my foot.

272
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:56,857
What's wrong with you? Put it down.

273
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:59,397
Put it down right now.

274
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:03,028
Hey, stop.

275
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:06,467
Gently put it down in my spot.

276
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,837
Don't make me repeat myself!

277
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:11,808
Stop digging in!

278
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,907
You should've made me cook two bags in the first place!

279
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,217
Let me at least have the rest.

280
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,798
Drink this while you work.

281
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,268
Thanks.

282
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,337
What will you do when the evil spirit turns up?

283
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:50,078
Even if he got weak, he's still no ordinary human.

284
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:53,878
Don't worry. I'm not in this alone.

285
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:58,617
Once the workers pin him down,

286
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,557
I will knock him out with these...

287
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:05,798
and ask Granny Geumok to exorcise the evil spirit out of his body.

288
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,427
But here's the problem.

289
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:10,398
That evil spirit might've changed its host.

290
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:12,767
Being possessed.

291
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:15,738
How can we figure it out?

292
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:18,808
Doing what they would never normally do.

293
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:20,607
Or a change in the way they see you.

294
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:25,948
Only those closest... would recognize the transition.

295
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:30,088
By the way,

296
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,788
does Detective Seo know...

297
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:34,988
that you're staying in my house?

298
00:21:34,988 --> 00:21:38,828
No. Why bother? It'll only make him worry.

299
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:43,227
But still, isn't he your boyfriend?

300
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:46,767
I hate being misunderstood.

301
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:49,738
What? He's not my boyfriend.

302
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:53,077
He's not?

303
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,347
I thought you two were going out but guess not.

304
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:02,818
So you don't like him that much, do you?

305
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:04,517
I do, a lot.

306
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:06,458
What?

307
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,988
Why wouldn't I?

308
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:13,387
Worried I'd feel lonely and alone, he always celebrated my birthday with a cake.

309
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:16,398
He even came to all of my school entrance ceremonies and graduations.

310
00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:18,337
I wouldn't have held out...

311
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,100
if it wasn't for him after Dad passed away.

312
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:31,308
But...

313
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,848
But?

314
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,217
Someone's coming!

315
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,018
Go inside. You're in my way.

316
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,627
Here.

317
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,367
It's a talisman from Granny Geumok.

318
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,067
Carry it with you just in case.

319
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,967
Okay.

320
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,838
But I don't see anyone.

321
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:59,077
No, they're coming. Leave already.

322
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,757
Let's stop thinking for the time being.

323
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:19,027
Let's stop!

324
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:16,317
My...

325
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,518
My apologies. I'm afraid I couldn't dodge it.

326
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:23,227
You must become stronger.

327
00:24:24,427 --> 00:24:26,157
Find the seven-star channel.

328
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:29,097
Understood.

329
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:35,807

00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:43,547
How can you accomplish what the general failed to do?

660
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:46,408
He hasn't fully gained his strength back,

661
00:44:48,148 --> 00:44:51,917
so I must try to the best of my ability.

662
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:53,558
No.

663
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:56,288
I'm forbidding you, so don't you dare.

664
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:59,258
I couldn't possibly live without you.

665
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:03,297
Back when I was young,

666
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:06,797
Shaman Cha saved my life.

667
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:12,138
I was wondering when I'd get to return the favor.

668
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:16,538
This seems to be how.

669
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:18,148
If you must do this, let me assist you.

670
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,318
- It isn't a task for those young.
- You're wrong.

671
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,317
I'm not a kid anymore.

672
00:45:25,018 --> 00:45:27,018
And it's my job to keep you safe.

673
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:33,628
Captain, we have a match... from the prints found at the crime scene.

674
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:36,898
- Really?
- Yes.

675
00:45:36,898 --> 00:45:39,637
His name is Yang Taechoon and has been arrested

676
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:41,268
for burglary and assault.

677
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:43,297
His current address...

678
00:45:43,297 --> 00:45:46,538
It says he's been missing for ten years.

679
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:50,577
Who is this guy anyway?

680
00:45:50,577 --> 00:45:51,977
Let me see.

681
00:45:51,977 --> 00:45:55,348
Wait. Why does he look familiar?

682
00:46:01,588 --> 00:46:05,658
Hold on. It's the same guy.

683
00:46:07,427 --> 00:46:09,458
It's the composite sketch of the Full Moon Murderer...

684
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:13,167
which was based on Chief Seo's description.

685
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:18,338
The dates of the crimes and his MO are identical to those of the Full Moon Murderer.

686
00:46:18,338 --> 00:46:20,237
He went missing on the same day as well.

687
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:22,608
I think you could be right.

688
00:46:22,608 --> 00:46:24,478
Yang Taechoon.

689
00:46:26,547 --> 00:46:29,277
Are you sure that he's the killer?

690
00:46:29,277 --> 00:46:30,888
Yes, I'm sure.

691
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:34,888
His prints were all over the house where the old couple was murdered.

692
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,628
Then you'll immediately begin an investigation.

693
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,628
Of course.

694
00:46:39,628 --> 00:46:42,157
You should assist once the task force is formed.

695
00:46:42,157 --> 00:46:45,897
Right, of course. I should do that.

696
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:52,938
What's this?

697
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:55,507
Are we going into the food truck business?

698
00:46:55,507 --> 00:46:57,677
Are these leftovers? What the...

699
00:46:57,677 --> 00:47:00,677
Don't touch them. They are for someone else.

700
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:03,047
- Who?
- Who else?

701
00:47:03,047 --> 00:47:06,458
The police officers who work hard day and night.

702
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:09,387
Being a member of the civil police unit makes me family,

703
00:47:09,387 --> 00:47:13,197
but I've been indifferent toward those at Kangguk Police Substation.

704
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,498
He's off to see Officer Go.

705
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,027
But she'll be here after her shift.

706
00:47:17,027 --> 00:47:18,867
Is she working late today?

707
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:20,097
Are these late-night snacks?

708
00:47:20,097 --> 00:47:23,438
She doesn't get to eat well during long shifts.

709
00:47:23,438 --> 00:47:27,138
It'll be over soon anyway, so maybe I can pick her up.

710
00:47:27,737 --> 00:47:30,247
I didn't take you for the devoted husband type.

711
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,277
This is over the top. Women will feel burdened, you know.

712
00:47:33,277 --> 00:47:34,718
No, we'll be grateful.

713
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:37,217
This is exactly why you're still single.

714
00:47:37,217 --> 00:47:38,748
Is that so?

715
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:54,437
A seven-star channel.

716
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:57,268
I must find a seven-star channel.

717
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:42,048
Officer Lee.

718
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:44,318
Go that way. We'll rendezvous up ahead.

719
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:45,818
Got it.

720
00:48:45,818 --> 00:48:47,487
[Police]

721
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:22,617
You study the routines of those with the seven-star channel,

722
00:49:22,617 --> 00:49:25,988
kidnap, and kill them on the night of the full moon.

723
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:33,768
I know you, you see.

724
00:49:35,398 --> 00:49:37,438
You're the Full Moon Murderer.

725
00:49:38,137 --> 00:49:39,937
Yang Taechoon.

726
00:49:44,577 --> 00:49:47,378
And who might you be?

727
00:49:47,378 --> 00:49:50,517
The daughter of the detective you killed ten years ago.

728
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:53,958
Maybe that will jog your memory.

729
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,618
A detective?

730
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,298
Oh, him.

731
00:50:03,298 --> 00:50:05,698
The twerp who had his head smashed with a rock.

732
00:50:10,237 --> 00:50:12,408
Goodness.

733
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:15,638
Like father, like daughter.

734
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,248
You sure are alike.

735
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,177
I joined the force in order to hunt you down.

736
00:50:19,177 --> 00:50:21,748
Then a Daughter of the Year award is in order.

737
00:50:21,748 --> 00:50:25,047
Maybe the prize will be a reunion with your dad.

738
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:26,647
Do you really believe...

739
00:50:28,788 --> 00:50:31,187
that bullets can kill me?

740
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:42,368
I knew something was off.

741
00:50:43,268 --> 00:50:45,268
Don't come any closer.

742
00:50:45,268 --> 00:50:47,038
Keep your distance!

743
00:51:50,137 --> 00:51:53,167
Yongryul, are you all right?

744
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:04,518
She's back.

745
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,858
It was her.

746
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,027
You're bleeding.

747
00:52:12,157 --> 00:52:14,098
My goodness.

748
00:52:15,927 --> 00:52:17,797
Just a second.

749
00:52:30,608 --> 00:52:32,308
There you go.

750
00:52:37,847 --> 00:52:41,058
I can do anything for you.

751
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:45,258
Absolutely... anything?

752
00:52:58,768 --> 00:53:01,478
And just like that, we meet again.

753
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:04,978
For sure,

754
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:09,618
we are meant to be.

755
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:22,258
What? His arm broke?

756
00:53:22,258 --> 00:53:24,498
Is he hurt anywhere else?

757
00:53:24,498 --> 00:53:27,168
My gosh. Are the injuries bad?

758
00:53:27,168 --> 00:53:29,697
- What?
- Hello.

759
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:34,308
- I brought some food for you.
- Hello, Mr. Cha.

760
00:53:34,308 --> 00:53:36,438
Kangguk Hospital, right?

761
00:53:36,438 --> 00:53:39,648
Are you at the ER? Yes, stay there.

762
00:53:39,648 --> 00:53:42,978
Excuse me, but is Officer Go out on patrol?

763
00:53:42,978 --> 00:53:46,418
You see, Officer Go is currently at the hospital.

764
00:53:46,418 --> 00:53:48,757
The hospital? Why?

765
00:53:48,757 --> 00:53:50,327
Is she injured? How bad is it?

766
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:56,027
Someone was hurt, but it wasn't... It was Officer Lee.

767
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:01,438
Officer Lee, are you all right?

768
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:04,508
It's just my arm, Captain.

769
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:06,538
Seulhae, what about you? Are you all right?

770
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:08,938
- I'm good.
- Your head.

771
00:54:10,808 --> 00:54:13,818
What kind of beast gets up after being tasered?

772
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,777
- Well...
- It was the Full Moon Murderer.

773
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,918
- What?
- He said it himself.

774
00:54:20,918 --> 00:54:22,657
That he's the Full Moon Murderer.

775
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:23,927
I want details.

776
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,527
It was probably recorded on my body camera.

777
00:54:27,527 --> 00:54:30,897
Yongryul, are you all right?

778
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:34,138
Yes, I need an ambulance.

779
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:40,108
You must've been startled.

780
00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:42,438
But you handled the situation calmly.

781
00:54:43,137 --> 00:54:44,848
It was nothing.

782
00:54:47,547 --> 00:54:50,277
I'll tell my father and have a task force green-lit.

783
00:54:50,277 --> 00:54:51,717
Let's catch this guy.

784
00:54:51,717 --> 00:54:54,687
Well, actually...

785
00:54:55,387 --> 00:54:57,157
Sure.

786
00:54:57,157 --> 00:54:58,657
Good.

787
00:55:02,898 --> 00:55:05,228
Darn it.

788
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:14,578
Officer Go. Go Seulhae!

789
00:55:17,808 --> 00:55:21,147
How badly were you hurt? Let me see.

790
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:22,577
Here?

791
00:55:22,577 --> 00:55:24,847
Where else? Let me take a look.

792
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:27,917
Actually, it wasn't me.

793
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:31,758
Officer Lee was attacked...

794
00:55:31,758 --> 00:55:34,997
by the evil spirit possessing the Full Moon Murderer.

795
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,268
He's alive.

796
00:55:42,268 --> 00:55:45,238
No way. It can't be.

797
00:55:45,238 --> 00:55:47,677
The MO is identical and his face matches the composite sketch.

798
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,608
He even knew how Detective Go died.

799
00:55:49,608 --> 00:55:52,347
He's the Full Moon Murderer. You saw the footage, too.

800
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:54,048
I'll put together a task force.

801
00:55:54,048 --> 00:55:57,310
To keep the public safe, we must inform them of—

802
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:59,710
- No!
- Why not?

803
00:55:59,718 --> 00:56:02,887
Instead of saying that I can't, help me understand why.

804
00:56:02,887 --> 00:56:06,858
Heesoo, we will keep this buried.

805
00:56:06,858 --> 00:56:09,358
We must.

806
00:56:16,137 --> 00:56:18,137
Dad,

807
00:56:18,137 --> 00:56:23,368
what happened ten years ago?

808
00:56:27,248 --> 00:56:29,318
That night,

809
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:32,988
I wasn't the one Youngsik teamed up with.

810
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,557
Sorry?

811
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,418
Youngsik...

812
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:40,158
was conducting his search with some shaman.

813
00:56:40,158 --> 00:56:44,827
I honestly don't know why he kept me in the dark.

814
00:56:44,827 --> 00:56:48,338
Anyway, I discreetly followed them.

815
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:50,608
A shaman?

816
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:53,737
You said that he cut in... when you were about to make an arrest.

817
00:56:53,737 --> 00:56:55,338
It's what led to Detective Go's death.

818
00:56:55,338 --> 00:56:58,248
The one who was out of place wasn't him!

819
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:01,378
It was me.

820
00:57:08,688 --> 00:57:12,158
Just as Youngsik was about to make his move,

821
00:57:12,158 --> 00:57:14,227
I caught the killer's attention.

822
00:57:14,227 --> 00:57:17,530
Youngsik died trying to save me!

823
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:26,138
Then...

824

Detective Go...

It was because of you.

826
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:38,287
This scandal will hinder my chances of running for office.

Cracking the case... led to an award and a promotion.

Taking in Seulhae elevated my public image.

829

After what I did to get here?

830
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:49,628
He can't be caught.

831
00:57:49,628 --> 00:57:54,697
His testimony will contradict my summation of facts, and I'll...

832
00:57:54,697 --> 00:57:58,010
be ruined.

833

That's not all.

834

He's dangerous. He's a monster!

835
00:58:08,878 --> 00:58:13,620
Stand down... while I eliminate him myself.

836
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:26,598
I believed that having authority had changed you.

837

This is who you've always been.

839

- Please don't.
- Any words, sir?

855
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,958
Well, there is still no concrete evidence

856
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:30,398
that points to the Full Moon Murderer

857

His current known address is the one in a small fishing village in Incheon.

I'm always careful. It's nothing new.

Don't worry, Seulhae.

No.

Hey, Mr. Ma.

- Right.
- Sure.

Don't be ridiculous. The full moon is out,

- Officer Go, wait.
- Wait.

907

Have you had dinner on this moonlit night?

908
01:02:43,258 --> 01:02:48,327
Well, you see... Mr. Cha said he had something to give you.

- Well...
- Where did we put it?

01:03:05,347 --> 01:03:08,077
Mr. Cha took it with him to go after the evil spirit.

- Stop!
- No!

919

You weren't supposed to say that!

920
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,858
Mr. Cha went by himself to fight the evil spirit?

921
01:03:19,987 --> 01:03:21,798
Where?

922
01:03:25,267 --> 01:03:27,367
What now? I think she figured it out.

What now?

01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:35,907
- Then...
- I mean...
- We should...
- Why would you...

926
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:39,908
- But Mr. Cha said...
- This is driving me nuts.

927
01:03:39,908 --> 01:03:43,217
No! Why did Mr. Cha leave that behind?

928
01:03:43,217 --> 01:03:44,548
Is this where the evil spirit is?

929
01:03:44,548 --> 01:03:46,017
- No...

How could you have sent him out there alone?

938
01:04:12,677 --> 01:04:14,577
But Mr. Cha said...

939
01:04:14,577 --> 01:04:16,247
You'll go after him?

940
01:04:16,247 --> 01:04:17,688
Then you should tell Officer Go...

Ms. Go won't partake in this operation.

942

- Why not?
- How come?

944
01:04:22,018 --> 01:04:24,588
The full moon is out which means it's dangerous for her.

945
01:04:24,588 --> 01:04:26,927
The evil spirit saw her seven-star channel.

946
01:04:26,927 --> 01:04:30,057
She has probably been chosen as his next victim.

But Officer Go isn't one to sit things out.

It's why I need your help.

Until it's over, you are to keep her here.
