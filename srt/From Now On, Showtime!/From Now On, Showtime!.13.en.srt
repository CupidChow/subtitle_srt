165
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:55,086
He can't even strike up a conversation with a girl.

166
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:57,081
He's timid?

167
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:08,265
He's still such a mama's boy.

168
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:10,365
He's the sweetest son any mother could ask for.

169
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:13,765
- He has someone.
- I know... What?

170
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:18,606
I see a pretty, foxy girl right next to him.

171
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:20,005
I see them together.

172
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:24,393
Of course. Girls wouldn't leave my son alone.

173
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:27,145
Hold on. She's foxy?

174
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:29,656
I was hoping he'd meet a quiet girl who's nice.

175
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:33,156
If you say stuff like that, your son will never get married.

176
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:39,165
Just be grateful that your son has found someone... who cares for him.

177
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:41,947
Keep your mouth shut.

178
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:45,206
But is she really not nice?

179
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,982
No, she's not. And she's got a temper.

180
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:51,505
What's with this feast? Are you throwing a party or something?

181
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:55,545
Officer Go... I mean, Detective Go.

182
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:58,186
Since you're a detective now, I thought we should celebrate.

183
00:10:58,186 --> 00:11:03,490
I reached out to a royal cuisine expert for help.

184
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,909
- Take a seat.
- You didn't have to do this.

185
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:16,496
I told you that I'd treat you like a princess from now on.

186
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:19,387
- A princess?
- Dig in. Eat up.

187
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:24,131
This looks delicious.

188
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:28,946
My stomach has been a little upset all day.

189
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:30,946
Then you should stay away from greasy foods.

190
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:35,070
- I'll eat this.
- Then try this. The soup will help.

191
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,106
Here, have this.

192
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:51,635
What's wrong? Why aren't you eating?

193
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:54,206
Oh, are you not a fan of traditional Korean dishes?

194
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:55,606
Should I have prepared Western dishes?

195
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:59,545
Goodness. How can she eat if you keep staring at her like that?

196
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:02,446
Even eating shows don't have such close-up shots these days.

197
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:06,385
Yes. Just let her eat, will you?

198
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:08,647
I can't even look at her?

199
00:12:10,115 --> 00:12:12,986
Oh, how come Adviser Choi isn't joining us?

200
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:15,138
Did he go somewhere?

201
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:24,726
Even so, how could you kick him out?

202
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:26,765
He left of his own accord.

203
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,336
I just didn't stop him. That's all.

204
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:30,800
You should've stopped him.

205
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,176
He must've been so anxious.

206
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:35,175
He should have some shame after all, shouldn't he?

207
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:39,987
He was the person you and I trusted the most in our past life.

208
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:43,445
But he betrayed us and brought death upon us.

209
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:48,585
Had it not been for him, the two of us...

210
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,525
could have been happy together.

211
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:53,066
Then, what about this? Are we happy now?

212
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:55,096
You told me that learning about your past life

213
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:56,665
helped you understand why you were reincarnated,

214
00:12:56,665 --> 00:13:00,565
and how you should live your life from now on.

215
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:02,477
Is this why you...

216
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:06,056
I mean, is this why you and I were reincarnated?

217
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:10,006
Fighting about our past lives, feeling angry and disappointed?

218
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:15,116
You said Adviser Choi hadn't been able to ascend

219
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:18,625
for 2,000 years because he had to pay for what he did. Then...

220
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,525
Then I'd say he deserves to be forgiven now.

221
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:23,726
To him, it's something that happened 2,000 years ago.

222
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:26,966
But to me, it's still so vivid as if it happened yesterday.

223
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,365
I don't want to face him when I still feel this way.

224
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:35,405
Then, how do you think I feel when I'm facing you like this?

225
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,141
At the hospital,

226
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:43,731
I kept praying that you'd wake up. I bet you have no idea.

227
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:49,562
You have no idea how happy and grateful I was when you woke up.

228
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,215
But these days, I wonder from time to time

229
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:58,415
if you really are the person who I so desperately waited for.

230
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:03,577
I don't even feel like you're looking at me.

231
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:12,550
I think I need some time to gather my thoughts.

232
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:18,871
Okay.

233
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:22,394
I don't want to see you like this,

234
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:27,550
so let's not meet until you have pulled yourself together.

235
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:47,375
There's been another accident on a road near Kangguk Tunnel.

236
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,745
What? Don't tell me it's another black Adagio.

237
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:53,545
Yes, I checked the footage that the Traffic Division had.

238
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:55,815
I swear, there was nothing around.

239
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:57,826
But the driver suddenly turned the steering wheel

240
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:00,956
as if they wanted to avoid something, and crashed into a ditch.

241
00:15:00,956 --> 00:15:03,096
Do accidents happen often in that area?

242
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:05,326
Sure, you could say that.

243
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:07,326
But every time, it's a black Adagio.

244
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:10,135
How's that possible? The same car model every single time?

245
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:13,236
Here's something spookier. The drivers all say

246
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:17,375
they saw a woman dressed in white.

247
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:21,476
Has the ghost on the Jayu Motorway moved to Kangguk or something?

248
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:22,676
Ghost?

249
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:27,136
- What else could it be? The footage shows nothing.
- Go Seulhae.

250
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:30,361
- Let's go on a stakeout.
- What?

251
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:37,356
What?

252
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:42,386
You still have this? You've had this for over ten years.

253
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:47,719
What is it?

254
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:50,085
Well.

255
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:54,515
To tell you the truth, the stakeout was just an excuse.

256
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:56,645
I brought you out so we could be alone.

257
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:58,586
And I have something to tell you.

258
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,945
Oh, sure.

259
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:23,031
Welcome to my team.

260
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:40,926
- What's wrong?
- This...

261
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:44,586
It looks very expensive. I'm uncomfortable accepting it.

262
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:49,066
You're uncomfortable? But this is nothing.

263
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:51,966
I'm going to give you a lot more from now on.

264
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,905
"A lot more"?

265
00:16:53,905 --> 00:16:56,736
Money, fame, power.

266
00:16:56,736 --> 00:16:59,127
Whatever you want.

267
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,605
Because you're mine now.

268
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:16,126
I had a lot going on, so I haven't been able to give you my answer.

269
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:19,166
I thought a lot about what you said the other day,

270
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:26,651
but I wish for us to stay... as colleagues and good friends.

271
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:28,831
What's your reason?

272
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,727
That's...

273
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:34,666
Is it because of Cha Chawoong?

274
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:40,546
If we're not here because of a case, I'll get back to the office.

275
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:52,555
I will not lose you again.

276
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:12,555
Excuse me, Ma'am!

277
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:14,630
Move out of the road!

278
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,067
It's dangerous! Ma'am!

279
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,625
Yes, over here.

280
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:31,366
What's wrong with you? Stop!

281
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:50,916
I'm certain that ghost is related to that car accident-prone spot.

282
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,825
But I'm too scared to go back.

283
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:54,085
Nobody can.

284
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:56,196
She's pretty much an evil spirit.

285
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:57,966
Ghosts like them scare me, too.

286
00:18:57,966 --> 00:18:59,701
Right?

287
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:02,866
But it's not like I can just let her keep causing accidents.

288
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:05,840
- How about talking to Mr. Cha and...
- No way!

289
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,050
Why not?

290
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,476
To be frank, I insisted

291
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:15,476
we shouldn't see each other for a while yesterday.

292
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,575
So asking him today is going to make me lose face.

293
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:20,409
Then, what will you do?

294
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,603
So I was thinking...

295
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:25,255
We've known each other for a while now

296
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:27,825
and have worked together before.

297
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:33,026
So how about... we leave Mr. Cha out and go alone?

298
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,736
Leave me out and do what?

299
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:37,265
I didn't say a word. No, I didn't.

300
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:39,606
What are you planning with my workers?

301
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:42,076
I just have things to talk about with them.

302
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:44,576
It has nothing to do with you, so mind your own business.

303
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:47,745
I'm paying them... for whatever they do,

304
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:50,245
so how can it have nothing to do with me?

305
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:52,431
And right now,

306
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:53,845
it's business hours.

307
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:57,409
They can't go anywhere without my permission.

308
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:02,871
Well,

309
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:04,923
unless you take me with you.

310
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:14,636
It's that ghost over there, right?

311
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:16,006
Yes.

312
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,605
She looks extremely unstable.

313
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:21,275
Will it be all right? She looks dangerous.

314
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,515
You call this dangerous?

315
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,186
Remember who I am?

316
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:28,450
The chief priest who sealed an evil spirit.

317
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:31,485
Just you wait.

318
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:36,179
It's showtime!

319
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,666
Go!

320
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:47,251
- Are you joining us?
- Yes.

321
00:20:49,236 --> 00:20:53,005
Hey, you there! Let's have a chit-chat.

322
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:55,765
What do you think you're doing here?

323
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:58,585
Run!

324

Mr. Cha!

325
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,900
Darn it. Hey!

326
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:10,825
- Run!
- How can you be scared of ghosts?

327
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:11,896
Wasn't it showtime?

328
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,295
Seriously, you traitors!

329
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:17,166
- It can't be helped.
- Run!

330
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,166
- Oh, my gosh!
- Officer Go!

331
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,300
Mr. Cha! Darn it.

332
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:46,131
Miyoung?

333
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,045
Dongcheol?

334
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:11,803
- Hi.
- Welcome!

335
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,450
You're all set.

336
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,444
Oh, my! I'm sorry. Are you okay?

337
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:31,775
It's on the house today.

338
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:33,976
It was just a slight trim.

339
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:37,446
Just take it.

340
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:40,785
By the way, why do you come so often?

341
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:44,456
You even come twice a week at times.

342
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:47,726
No reason. Can't I?

343
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:50,226
No, you can.

344
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:53,490
- Okay, bye.
- Wait a second.

345
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,825
Here. It's for your wound.

346
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:07,582
Excuse me.

347
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:35,841
I'm sorry for saying that I have feelings for you.

348
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:42,696
I was foolish to dream a man like me could become happy.

349
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:47,105
- I should get going.
- I...

350
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:50,799
don't like you getting hurt.

351
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,401
It's not too late.

352
00:23:54,026 --> 00:23:56,566
You can start again with a clean slate.

353
00:23:57,295 --> 00:24:00,065
It'll bring happiness

354

358
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:20,585
Hey, Mingu!

359
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,416
- Hi, Mr. Ma!
- Hey.

360
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,986
When is your wife giving birth again?

361
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:28,085
Gosh, it's already next week.

362
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:29,656
- Really?
- Yes.

363
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:32,295
- What was that? Postnatal care?
- Yes?

364
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:33,765
I heard it's important.

365
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:36,436
Buy her... Darn it.

366
00:24:36,436 --> 00:24:37,866
Buy her lots of delicious food.

367
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:41,005
My gosh, that's too much. It's all right.

368
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:43,289
Just listen to me, punk.

- Right.

Hi.

Boss, I have something to tell you.

372
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:54,686
Okay, go ahead.

00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:57,486
Hey, give us some room.

374

Grab a meal.

375
00:24:59,255 --> 00:25:02,555
My boys. Grow out your hair.

376
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:04,555
Get going.

377
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:07,626
Boss.

378
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:10,829
I would like to quit.

379
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:16,178
Hey.

380
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:19,745
We only just got a client by getting a large company,

381
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:22,745
an assemblyman, and the police involved.

382
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:26,345
What will I tell the higher-ups?

383
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:29,156
"I don't know what our number two, who knows all our connections,

384
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:31,216
will rattle on about after quitting,

385
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:35,196
but I'm leaving him be?"

386
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:37,956
You're planning to go to the Brown Bear Group, aren't you?

387
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:39,866
You're going to make off with my client, right?

388
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,866
No way, Boss.

389
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:46,274
You know I'm not smart enough.

390
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:51,005
I fell in love.

391
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:55,376
I want to become an honorable man in front of her.

392
00:25:55,376 --> 00:25:57,824
- Love?
- Yes.

393
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:04,656
Fine.

394
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:08,234
If you really want to quit, do something for me.

395
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:13,765
The Brown Bear Group's right to run clubs.

396
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:16,731
Bring me that and I'll believe you.

397
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:27,195
Okay, I'll get it for you.

398
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:33,386
Miyoung, I'll drop by the salon tonight.

399
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:35,186
I've got something to tell you.

400
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:37,055
Tell me?

401
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,126
I'll wait until you come.

402
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:41,698
You must come, okay, Dongcheol?

403
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:44,109
Brown Bear is inside, right?

404
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:47,483
Do you have a death wish?

405
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:01,605
Mr. Ma! Are you okay?

406
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:04,245
Why would you come alone?

407
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:07,129
- Give this to the boss.
- What?

[Right of Operation Waiver]

409
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:14,956
Mr. Ma!

410

Hey, wash your hands of this, too.

411
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:21,707
Think about your baby.

Miyoung!

414
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:19,009
Gosh.

415
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:23,295
I was taken to the hospital,

416
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:27,313
but died after being in a coma for a month.

417
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:36,336
When I visited the hair salon as a ghost, it was already closed.

418
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:40,476
Well, it was only natural after what you went through.

419
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:44,015
So I thought you'd be living happily somewhere.

420
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:47,845
But what happened? Why did you become a ghost?

421
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:49,939
That day,

422
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,053
I died as well.

423
00:29:06,436 --> 00:29:09,352
He dragged me to his car...

424
00:29:10,305 --> 00:29:12,505
and killed me.

425
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:15,176
That jerk even took your life?

426
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:16,815
Darn it.

427
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:21,977
I knew the Brown Bear Group was wicked, but how could they?

428
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:24,585
So that's why you were on that road.

429
00:29:24,585 --> 00:29:28,055
Yes, I was waiting.

430
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:31,995
Waiting for that punk who killed us to take revenge.

431
00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:35,966
Even so, innocent people got in accidents because of you.

432
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:39,265
Burning with vengeance makes you visible to humans.

433

And you're even on the verge of turning into an evil spirit.

434

I'm sorry.

435

Why are you scolding her?

436
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:50,275
Imagine how unjust this kindhearted person felt!

437
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:52,385
If only we had caught that jerk earlier,

438
00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:55,743
Miyoung wouldn't have ended up like that.

439
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:58,456
You saw his face, right?

440
00:29:58,456 --> 00:30:01,280
Is there anything you can recall?

There was a long knife scar under his eye.

A knife scar?

Can we catch him, Officer?

Based on her current state, there's not much time left.

She'll soon turn into an evil spirit.

She can't revert back when that happens. What do we do?

463
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:36,515
Isn't it obvious? Catch the culprit and satisfy her grudge.

464
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:38,855
We know his car model and signalment.

465

I'll look into it.

But she hasn't told us about the car model.

472
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:03,576
He never intended to let him go.

473

You were thrown out after being used.

And Miyoung got caught up in it by ill luck.

475
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:11,015
It was because of me.

476

- Gosh.
- If only I didn't like her.

If only I wasn't head over heels for her.

478
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:19,327
- I'm going to kill that Badger jerk this instant.
- Hey, stop.

479
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:20,995
Do you also want to become an evil spirit?

480
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:23,395
It's at times like these you have to be rational.

481

He's right. Think of how Miyoung would feel.

It took you by surprise, right?

486
00:32:45,385 --> 00:32:48,891
Honestly, I was shocked at myself too.

487
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:53,983
I guess I liked you more than I thought.

488
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:56,766
- Senior.
- No.

489

I'm not being clingy, so don't worry.

00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:05,705
Yesterday after that, I thought long and hard about how I'll treat you from now on.

491
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:09,445
And I realized I should follow in your footsteps.

492
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,845
What?

493
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,185
Keep liking you, but don't be forceful.

494
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:16,685
Stay by your side, but don't put pressure.

495
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:19,786
Set aside public and private matters and do my best at work.

496
00:33:19,786 --> 00:33:23,460
And if you end up liking someone else,

497
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,860
don't bother with it.

498
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:30,195
What do you think?

499
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:34,269
Don't you think we'll be able to get along well even from now on?

500
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:37,803
Yes. I appreciate it and I'm sorry.

501
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,317
I feel much better now.

502
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,945
By the way, didn't you have something to tell me?

503
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:49,005
Well...

504
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:53,286
I looked into Kim Miyoung's missing case.

505
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:56,695
Kim Miyoung's boyfriend was in the Badger Group?

506
00:33:56,695 --> 00:34:01,065
And the day she went missing is when her boyfriend was stabbed.

507
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:03,296
Given the circumstances, I think both of them

508
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:07,265
got caught up and ended up as victims of the Badger Group.

509
00:34:07,265 --> 00:34:10,975
But that group wasn't mentioned in any of the investigation records.

510
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:14,205
So? Did you dig deeper?

511
00:34:14,205 --> 00:34:18,475
Not yet. I'm going to interview Badger as a witness first.

512
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:22,455
Good thinking. Proceed with it.

513
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:23,855
Okay.

514
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:47,805
Captain Seo, I got a call today.

515
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:49,316
An investigation?

516
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:52,946
Why are you digging up a case that was covered up five years ago?

517
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:54,815
Covered up?

518
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:58,886
Officer Go Seulhae. She's the newbie on your team, no?

519
00:34:58,886 --> 00:35:01,386
You should've stopped her.

520
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:03,156
How are you educating your underlings?

521
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:05,625
Aren't you the one who needs a lesson first?

522
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,395
What?

523
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:11,096
If you want me to take action, you should do so first.

524
00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:12,866
And stop yapping.

525
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:14,435
That's how you make a deal.

526
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:17,475
Or how about you quietly rot behind bars?

527
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:19,147
Fine.

528
00:35:20,406 --> 00:35:22,534
What do you want?

529
00:35:23,545 --> 00:35:25,815
I need someone gone.

530
00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:28,135
An accident would be preferable.

531
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:31,116
Have you heard of Cha Chawoong?

532
00:35:31,116 --> 00:35:33,355
Cha Chawoong?

533
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:35,525
The magician on TV?

534
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:37,411
Why him?

535
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:43,329
Miyoung, have some water.

536
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:53,776
I apologize for my unstable state.

537
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:59,016
Ms. Kim, do you have physical evidence that directly links Badger to your killer?

538
00:35:59,016 --> 00:36:01,085
Physical evidence?

539
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:03,015
There isn't much time.

540
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:06,656
We must gather the evidence before your condition worsens.

541
00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:11,855
I know it's a painful memory, but I need you to recall the night of your murder.

542
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:19,855
Why you...

543
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:22,655
Darn it.

544
00:36:26,306 --> 00:36:31,116
Before I died, I pulled out his hair.

545
00:36:31,116 --> 00:36:35,346
Compared to other human tissues, hair is slow to decompose.

546
00:36:35,346 --> 00:36:38,556
It has only been five years, so there's a good chance it hasn't been damaged.

547
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:42,996
Finding it could lead to a DNA match.

548
00:36:42,996 --> 00:36:46,255
Where were you buried?

549
00:36:57,576 --> 00:37:00,906
Ms. Kim, are you sure this is the place?

550
00:37:00,906 --> 00:37:02,315
Yes.

551
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:06,545
Yes, I was buried not far from here.

552
00:37:06,545 --> 00:37:08,635
You have no idea...

553
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:12,835
how long I wandered around these woods in tears.

554
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:17,225
I will never forgive him.

555
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:18,696
Die!

556
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:21,165
- Miyoung, no!
- Ms. Kim.

557
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:23,136
Please calm down.

558
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:25,295
- It's okay. It'll be over soon.
- Ms. Kim.

559
00:37:25,295 --> 00:37:26,665
Please don't give up.

560
00:37:26,665 --> 00:37:29,837
Ms. Kim, this isn't the time to give up.

561
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:41,786
- Are you all right?
- Are you?

562
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:43,386
Gosh.

563
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:49,485
What on earth? It's Badger.

564
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:15,116
Move!

565
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:19,086
Why won't you budge?

566
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:30,209
Take the dive, darn it.

567
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:38,191
Mr. Choi?

568
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:09,095
You've held on long enough.

569
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,505
What on earth?

570
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:18,173
Why won't the car move?

571
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:40,599
Badger, you piece of scum!

572
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:52,695
Ma Dongcheol?

573
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:04,025
What the... Were my eyes playing tricks on me?

574
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:05,563
Darn it.

575
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,996
You know me, don't you?

576
00:40:08,996 --> 00:40:10,696
And who might you be?

577
00:40:10,696 --> 00:40:12,966
Don't you remember?

578
00:40:12,966 --> 00:40:15,209
You killed me.

579
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,917
You killed me!

580
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,700
Die.

581
00:40:47,705 --> 00:40:49,476
Miyoung, stop!

582
00:40:49,476 --> 00:40:51,306
No, let go.

583
00:40:51,306 --> 00:40:53,774
Let go of me!

584
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:55,746
Let go.

585
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,915
Miyoung, get a grip on yourself.

586
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,615
Miyoung!

587
00:41:01,516 --> 00:41:04,116
This isn't who you are.

588
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:06,586
You're the one who encouraged me to start over

589
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:10,366
and told me that I could be happy.

590
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:13,965
If you kill him, it will be over for you.

591
00:41:13,965 --> 00:41:16,223
But it's unfair.

592
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:19,320
It's not fair at all.

593
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:23,259
He should die, too.

594
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:26,861
He shouldn't live!

595
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:32,395
All you need is for him to die, right?

596
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:35,653
Will that finally put you at ease?

597
00:41:39,015 --> 00:41:41,063
I'll do it instead.

598
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:46,923
Your hands will remain clean.

599
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,911
Miyoung, head over to Mr. Cha.

600
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:56,806
Killing him will turn me into an evil spirit

601
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,941
and I might attack you afterward.

602
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:04,758
Mr. Cha will protect you from me.

603
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:07,776
Forget about someone like me

604
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:10,190
and enter Nirvana in peace.

605
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:25,948
- Stop.
- Let go!

606
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:29,957
- Stop!
- Dongcheol.

607
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:33,949
No, don't do this.

608
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,275
That's enough.

609
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:44,001
Let go of me!

610
00:42:58,136 --> 00:43:01,735
Don't do this. Please snap out of it.

611
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:03,736
As if you would know how I'm feeling.

612
00:43:03,736 --> 00:43:06,406
Miyoung died because of me.

613
00:43:06,406 --> 00:43:09,145
Who am I to sit back and do nothing?

614
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:12,376
- Dongcheol!
- I...

615
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:19,469
I know how you feel.

616
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:23,255
Avenging the one you love? Of course, it's what we want.

617
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:27,079
But it never ends there. It doesn't.

618
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:30,649
Choosing a dark path

619
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,124
will come back to haunt you.

620
00:43:36,705 --> 00:43:39,151
Not just you

621
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:42,253
but all those who you care about.

622
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:46,255
And when that day comes,

623
00:43:46,255 --> 00:43:48,496
you will regret your choice.

624
00:43:49,116 --> 00:43:51,399
Forever.

625
00:44:23,386 --> 00:44:26,269
I'm sorry, Dongcheol.

626
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:29,907
I'll stop this. So don't do this for my sake.

627
00:44:30,895 --> 00:44:33,509
I'm sorry I hurt you.

628
00:44:35,426 --> 00:44:38,074
No, Miyoung.

629
00:44:38,074 --> 00:44:40,444
I'm the reason you...

630
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:44,202
If only I had been able to put you at ease.

631
00:44:47,846 --> 00:44:49,618
I am...

632
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:53,531
at ease.

633
00:44:53,531 --> 00:44:56,786
Just seeing you again,

634
00:44:56,786 --> 00:44:59,696
knowing that I have someone on my side...

635
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,467
has put me at ease.

636
00:45:32,716 --> 00:45:36,485
Here. Let me carry that for you.

637
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:37,825
Forget it.

638
00:45:37,825 --> 00:45:39,129
Right.

639
00:45:41,096 --> 00:45:44,366
How did you know to come here? You were here when we needed you.

640
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,736
Oh, that.

641
00:45:46,736 --> 00:45:52,293
As a bodyguard, staying undetected has become a talent of mine.

642
00:45:53,245 --> 00:45:58,741
Hold on. Are you saying that you've been following me?

643
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:02,585
- Well...
- So much for privacy.

644
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:04,855
How is that different from stalking?

645
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:06,386
You give me the creeps.

646
00:46:06,386 --> 00:46:08,754
I'm sorry.

647
00:46:08,754 --> 00:46:12,781
Since that's the case, I'll head back down first.

648
00:46:18,296 --> 00:46:20,816
Where do you think you're going?

649
00:46:27,446 --> 00:46:29,305
We must find the body before day breaks.

650
00:46:29,305 --> 00:46:31,745
There's no way Mr. Ma and I can get it done ourselves.

651
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:34,015
We need an extra set of hands.

652
00:46:34,015 --> 00:46:36,319
Stay on my tail.

653
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,927
Yes, of course.

654
00:46:42,355 --> 00:46:44,497
Shall we?

655
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:53,292
Badger, you know her, don't you?

656
00:46:57,775 --> 00:47:01,161
Take a good look at her. Do you know her or not?

657
00:47:04,415 --> 00:47:09,139
No, it can't be.

658
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:13,725
I... Back then... No. No way.

659
00:47:13,725 --> 00:47:16,795
As if. There's proof that you killed her.

660
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:18,826
Don't come near me!

661
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:21,826
I'm sorry, okay?

662
00:47:21,826 --> 00:47:24,265
Just... Please don't kill me.

663
00:47:24,265 --> 00:47:27,165
What has gotten into you?

664
00:47:41,446 --> 00:47:43,670
My daughter.

665
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,923
My Miyoung.

666
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:50,555
She is finally back in my arms.

667
00:47:50,555 --> 00:47:54,466
In that dark, cold place.

668
00:47:54,466 --> 00:47:57,601
She must've been so lonely.

669
00:48:05,906 --> 00:48:08,645
Thank you, Detective.

670
00:48:10,915 --> 00:48:12,687
Mom.

671
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,963
I'm sorry I came back to you in this state.

672
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:22,087
I committed the unthinkable, didn't I?

673
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:27,400
How will you live without me?

674
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,689
My Miyoung...

675
00:48:30,266 --> 00:48:33,306
was always so lonely.

676
00:48:34,335 --> 00:48:38,635
How am I supposed to let her go all by herself?

677
00:48:38,635 --> 00:48:41,815
Don't worry about me, Mom.

678
00:48:41,815 --> 00:48:45,198
I have Dongcheol now.

679
00:48:45,198 --> 00:48:48,316
I'm not alone anymore, and I will be all right.

680
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:49,516
Yes, Mother.

681
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:53,784
I'll take good care of Miyoung.

682
00:48:54,955 --> 00:48:58,041
For Miyoung's sake and yours,

683
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:00,650
please eat your meals...

684
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:03,495
and get plenty of sleep.

685
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:05,637
I should.

686
00:49:06,935 --> 00:49:09,817
Getting my act together...

687
00:49:09,817 --> 00:49:11,603
is how...

688
00:49:12,276 --> 00:49:15,980
my daughter can move on as well.

689
00:49:19,616 --> 00:49:21,599
Mom...

690
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,873
[Trustworthy Police, Safe Country]

691
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,835
[Trustworthy Police, Safe Country]

692
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,366
Thank you, all.

693
00:50:15,366 --> 00:50:18,836
I was finally able to leave that part of the road.

694
00:50:18,836 --> 00:50:21,605
We're the ones who are grateful. I'm happy for you.

695
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:24,645
Now that nothing's holding you back, will you be entering Nirvana?

696
00:50:24,645 --> 00:50:28,355
No, we agreed to stay a little longer.

697
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,886
We'll be having a ghost marriage.

698
00:50:32,886 --> 00:50:36,786
Besides, we should make up for all the dates we didn't get to go on.

699
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:39,355
We'll enter Nirvana together after the wedding.

700
00:50:39,355 --> 00:50:41,389
Goodness.

701
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:43,736
Can you put off entering Nirvana of free will?

702
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:49,366
Well, I talked to Hyeonjoon about it, and he allowed it.

703
00:50:49,366 --> 00:50:52,536
He'll be handing in a petition for us.

704
00:50:52,536 --> 00:50:55,205
Gosh, this is great news. Congratulations.

705
00:50:55,205 --> 00:50:59,116
No wonder all your blind dates never worked out.

706
00:50:59,116 --> 00:51:02,771
We all have someone we're meant to be with.

707
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,995
- Blind dates?
- Of course not.

708
00:51:10,596 --> 00:51:17,366
It's just that the lady ghosts all wanted a chance to date him.

709
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:22,805
How could any of them live up to someone as kind and beautiful as you, though?

710
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:26,158
He wouldn't let any woman win him over.

711
00:51:27,446 --> 00:51:31,276
Exactly. I didn't even bat an eye.

712
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:33,716
Are you lying to her just to get married?

713
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:34,746
Congratulations.

714
00:51:34,746 --> 00:51:38,386
- Watch what you say.
- Sorry, my bad.

715
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,546
Congratulations, Miyoung.

716
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,355
Please sit back down.

717
00:51:42,355 --> 00:51:45,955
It would've been nice for Mr. Choi to join us.

718
00:51:45,955 --> 00:51:49,765
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for him.

719
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:56,466
Since you're all here, I have an announcement to make.

720
00:51:56,466 --> 00:51:57,905
Now that Mr. Choi has left us

721
00:51:57,905 --> 00:51:59,975
and Mr. Ma will soon be entering Nirvana,

722
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:01,676
I have decided to hire additional staff.

723
00:52:01,676 --> 00:52:04,415
- I see.
- Right.

724
00:52:04,415 --> 00:52:06,787
Get in here already.

725
00:52:13,055 --> 00:52:16,011
- Hurry on over!
- What on earth?

726
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:21,665
- What?
- Adviser Choi!

727
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:24,395
Hi, it's me.

728
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,066
Good thinking, Mr. Cha.

729
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:32,205
- Adviser Choi, how...
- Hold on. Stop.

730
00:52:32,205 --> 00:52:34,406
He is no longer an adviser.

731
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:39,116
Due to how he deceived me, an advisory position wasn't an option.

732
00:52:39,116 --> 00:52:43,555
Instead, he is back as an entry-level employee.

733
00:52:43,555 --> 00:52:46,055
- What?
- Please greet your colleagues.

734
00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:49,455
Greetings, I am Choi Geom, the new recruit.

735
00:52:49,455 --> 00:52:50,895
I hope we get along.

736
00:52:50,895 --> 00:52:53,966
What on earth?

737
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:56,225
Hold on. Does this mean I'm his senior?

738
00:52:56,225 --> 00:52:57,765
Is he a junior staff member?

739
00:52:57,765 --> 00:53:01,035
Don't tell me his experience grants him a higher paycheck.

740
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:03,435
What does this mean in terms of hierarchy?

741
00:53:03,435 --> 00:53:05,676
Don't you worry. Simply put...

742
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:08,305
As of today, you have been promoted to assistant manager.

743
00:53:08,305 --> 00:53:09,746
Congratulations, Assistant Manager Kang.

744
00:53:09,746 --> 00:53:11,921
Yes!

745
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,245
Let's have fun, new recruit!

746
00:53:15,245 --> 00:53:17,559
Right, of course.

747
00:53:18,386 --> 00:53:20,369
I mean, yes, Ma'am.

748
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:21,941
Ms. Kang.

749
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:25,923
I hope you think fondly of me!

750
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:31,466
- Right.
- It's a pleasure, 2,000 Years.

751
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,530
Mr. Nam,

752
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:48,245
have Geom do that and take a break.

753
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:50,915
Geom? Who's Geom?

754
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:55,555
Gosh. You can't shout out Adviser Choi's name like that.

755
00:53:55,555 --> 00:53:58,215
He's a new recruit, not an adviser.

756
00:53:58,215 --> 00:54:02,566
Right. Please address me as you see fit, Mr. Nam.

757
00:54:02,566 --> 00:54:04,985
But still...

758
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,107
New Recruit.

759
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:09,505
Sorry?

760
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:12,821
Mop up the floor and let me have that instead.

761
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,646
Yes, sir.

762
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:22,486
Mop from here to way over there.

763
00:54:22,486 --> 00:54:24,855
Gosh, my back is killing me.

764
00:54:24,855 --> 00:54:26,855
My back aches.

765
00:54:26,855 --> 00:54:29,185
- I've got this.
- Goodness.

766
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:31,455
I guess I have no choice.

767
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:34,895
I'm Choi Geom and I can do this.

768
00:54:34,895 --> 00:54:37,865
- It's dirty over here as well.
- Right.

769
00:54:37,865 --> 00:54:40,605
I'll suck it up.

770
00:54:40,605 --> 00:54:42,536
There's something I've been wanting to ask.

771
00:54:42,536 --> 00:54:44,576
The sword you have on your person.

772
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:47,675
Where did you get it? It seems like a rare item.

773
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:51,346
Ms. Kang, you seem to have a keen eye for things.

774
00:54:51,346 --> 00:54:54,616
I went to... the capital's most famous blacksmith 2,000 years ago...

775
00:54:54,616 --> 00:54:56,545
and waited three months to purchase it.

776
00:54:56,545 --> 00:54:58,955
Gosh. No wonder.

777
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:00,785
Can I wield it sometime?

778
00:55:00,785 --> 00:55:02,455
I bet it's well-balanced.

779
00:55:02,455 --> 00:55:07,426
I'm afraid not anyone can brandish that kind of weapon.

780
00:55:07,426 --> 00:55:09,310
Anyone?

781
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:12,065
New Recruit, you upset me.

782
00:55:12,065 --> 00:55:15,906
I'm your superior, Assistant Manager Kang.

783
00:55:15,906 --> 00:55:17,236
How am I just "anyone"?

784
00:55:17,236 --> 00:55:20,935
- Is a hostile work environment what you want?
- No, of course not.

785
00:55:20,935 --> 00:55:25,738
Please let me know when you're free, and I'll set it up for you.

786
00:55:25,738 --> 00:55:27,986
How generous of our junior.

787
00:55:27,986 --> 00:55:29,946
Set it up for me once you finish cleaning up.

788
00:55:29,946 --> 00:55:31,857
Yes, Ms. Kang.

789
00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:41,804
- Keep mopping.
- Sure thing.

790
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:44,296
Yes, of course.

791
00:55:44,296 --> 00:55:46,483
I deserve this.

792
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,835
Mr. Cha, are you kidding me?

793
00:55:49,835 --> 00:55:52,736
Aren't you too old to play with a toy like this?

794
00:55:52,736 --> 00:55:57,459
They must make fancy marbles these days.

795
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:03,173
All right. Let's see if I still have it.

796
00:56:06,926 --> 00:56:10,096
What are you doing with a cosmetic product?

797
00:56:10,096 --> 00:56:12,125
Wait. Is this a cosmetic product?

798
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,763
Gosh.

799
00:56:14,596 --> 00:56:16,579
No way.

800
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,501
Ta-da. It will straighten out those wrinkles.

801
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:24,676
Right, my wrinkles. Nice.

802
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:27,832
Can you apply some right here?

803
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,946
Have you been hoarding this all to yourself?

804
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:35,645
No wonder you have good skin.

805
00:56:35,645 --> 00:56:37,486
Why did you need flawless skin when you're a ghost?

806
00:56:37,486 --> 00:56:40,386
I only put some on you since you're going out on a date.

807
00:56:40,386 --> 00:56:42,134
Just a second.

808
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,596
This is nice.

809
00:56:44,596 --> 00:56:46,395
- Let me see you.
- Right.

810
00:56:46,395 --> 00:56:49,119
Here.

811
00:56:49,725 --> 00:56:52,291
This one looks better.

812
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,036
Dongcheol.

813
00:57:04,515 --> 00:57:08,846
These flowers are long overdue, aren't they?

814
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:11,616
Thank you, Dongcheol. They're beautiful.

815
00:57:11,616 --> 00:57:14,456
Don't mention it. Besides, they're not even as pretty as you.

816
00:57:14,456 --> 00:57:17,555
I actually have one more gift for you.

817
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:19,895
As you know, I work for a magician.

818
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,966
- What?
- A surprise gift.

819
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:24,165
Goodness.

820
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,200
Watch closely.

821
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,916
I bet it's in that hand.

822
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:41,846
Miyoung, please accept my love.

823
00:57:41,846 --> 00:57:45,147
- Sure.
- Oh, no!

824
00:57:45,147 --> 00:57:46,656
- No!
- Goodness.

825
00:57:46,656 --> 00:57:48,526
Are you kidding me?

826
00:57:48,526 --> 00:57:50,025
- Dongcheol!
- I'm going in.

827
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:53,165
- Where are you going. You can't.
- No!

828
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:54,665
I can't believe he botched that magic trick.

829
00:57:54,665 --> 00:57:56,426
I spent the whole day teaching him that.

830
00:57:56,426 --> 00:57:59,635
How can one learn that in one day? It looks complicated.

831
00:57:59,635 --> 00:58:01,406
That's one of the easiest tricks in the book.

832
00:58:01,406 --> 00:58:04,136
I can perform tricks that are more complicated.

833
00:58:04,136 --> 00:58:05,736
Show me.

834
00:58:10,246 --> 00:58:12,846
Do you know that rings have different meanings depending on the finger they're on?

835
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:14,329
Beats me.

836
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,360
One on the index finger stands for friendship.

837
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,325
The thumb stands for beliefs.

838
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,345
The middle finger stands for success.

839
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,696
The pinkie stands for luck.

840
00:58:32,696 --> 00:58:35,136
How on earth did you do that?

841
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,295
A ring?

842
00:58:59,295 --> 00:59:01,209
This.

843
00:59:01,209 --> 00:59:03,616
Isn't it the one from your room?

844
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,170
And one on the ring finger stands for love.

845
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:26,316
I have had feelings for you for a long time.

846
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:28,916
Even before I knew about our past lives.

847
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,407
The one I like...

848
00:59:32,407 --> 00:59:35,754
is Go Seulhae, the woman right in front of me.

849
00:59:36,466 --> 00:59:40,605
The cool, confident, honest, and quirky Go Seulhae...

850
00:59:40,605 --> 00:59:44,563
who never turns a blind eye to injustice.

851
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:51,990
I'm done mimicking my past life.

852
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,523
I'll now do things my own way.

853
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:56,901
As in how?

854
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:00,855
Poong Baek held back and waited.

855
01:00:00,855 --> 01:00:03,015
But Cha Chawoong will be different.

856
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,651
Different how?

Sorry, that must've sounded awkward.

867
01:01:16,091 --> 01:01:19,803
I'm not good at keeping my feelings hidden.

868
01:01:19,803 --> 01:01:23,935
Your exceptional beauty had me drawing a blank.

869
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:25,005
Seriously?

870
01:01:25,005 --> 01:01:27,805
- Is there anything you want to eat?
- He's adorable.

871
01:01:27,805 --> 01:01:31,750
Tell me and I will make it for you.
