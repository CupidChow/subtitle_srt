What you should do is spend time
focusing on your studies,

6
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:24,560
so your mom will be accepting
of you following your dream.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,737
TTM's New Wave Project is coming up soon.

8
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,671
You and I must reach the finish line.

9
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:30,960
We must win this time.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,420
If I pass the audition,
you must be honest with your heart.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,288
It's okay that we're not a couple yet,

12
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:43,919
but can you please hold off on dating anyone else?

13
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:47,392
Of course.

14
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:56,921
Your kai palo with rice is still as tasty as ever.

15
00:00:56,921 --> 00:01:01,800
This time, I have something different
to give you in return.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,077
Are you going to pay me?

17
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:04,545
No.

18
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:07,045
I'm going to teach you to dance.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,040
- You want me to dance?
- Yes.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,072
I can't dance.

21
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,131
It's okay. I'm going to teach you. Let's go.

22
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,180
No.

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,011
Come on.

24
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,469
- Come on.
- I can't do it.

25
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:19,786
I'm going to teach you.

26
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:22,049
It's very easy. I know you can do it.

27
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,942
But I've never danced before.

28
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:27,668
I can teach you how to dance in a few minutes.

29
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:28,824
Here.

30
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,836

34
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,497
Yes.

35
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:46,961
- That's it?
- That's it.

36
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:48,111
See? You can do it.

37
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:50,793
- Let me start filming now.
- Okay.

38
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:53,083
Why don't you smile, Kang? Smile.

39
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,152
Smile like this.

40
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,068
- Do I have to smile?
- Yes.

41
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,405
Very good. Keep it up.

42
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,120

00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:30,352
Middle.

48
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:31,606
Lift.

49
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:33,192
Yes. Heart shape.

50
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:34,520
That's funny.

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,491
I look like I'm trying too hard.

52
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:38,882
No, you look natural.

53
00:03:56,113 --> 00:04:01,025
I think you've designed lovely choreography.

54
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,509
The question is, do you love me?

55
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,556
You're too much.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,401
What's your username? I'll tag you.

57
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,242
You don't have to tag me.

58
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,568
I quit social media a long time ago.

59
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,596
I forgot my password.

60
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:19,279
No.

61
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,280
You have to have an account,
so you can follow me when I'm famous.

62
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,320
I'll follow you when you're famous.

63
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,094
No, you have to follow me now.

64
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:31,520
Give me your phone.
I'll set up a new password for you.

65
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,625
Come on.

66
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,064
Fine.

67
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:39,885
Here.

68
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:44,265
What password should we use?

69
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,357
I have an idea.

70
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:56,855
Okay.

71
00:04:56,855 --> 00:05:00,000
I already logged in and followed my account.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,828
You're definitely going to remember
your password. It's very easy.

73
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:06,161
What's the password?

74
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:07,724
Do you have a paper to note it down?

75
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:10,923
I have some over there. Go get it yourself.

76
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:11,987
Okay.

77
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,520
Here.

78
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,472
Moo!

79
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:26,003
What's this crazy password?

80
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:27,803
It's like something out of the Da Vinci Code.

81
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:30,520
How is it easy?

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,071
It's easy. I'm sure you'll remember it.

83
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,813
Your kai palo was so delicious today.

84
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:42,391
Do you have more I can eat tomorrow?

85
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:44,138
Do you want to eat it? I can make it for you.

86
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:45,242
Yes.

87
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,068
Hello, Mom.

88
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:55,353
What are you doing?
Why is it so loud over there?

89
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,296
I'm on a motorbike on the way back to my dorm.

90
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:59,274
Who's riding? Your friend?

91
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:02,682
No, it's the person I'm pursuing.
Do you want me to show his face?

92
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:04,341
No need, Moo. No need.

93
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:06,167
- Hey, Moo!
- Kang!

94
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,922
What are you doing? It's dangerous.

95
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:10,422
Call me when you get to your dorm.

96
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:11,242
Talk later.

97
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:13,216
Okay. Bye.

98
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,224
What's the matter with you?

99
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:18,497
Don't tell me you're shy with my mom.

100
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:20,485
I'm not shy. It's dangerous.

101
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:22,748
You're becoming her son-in-law. Don't be shy.

102
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,609
Just sit still.

103
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:26,576
What do I get by doing that?

104
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,576
Do whatever you want.

105
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:44,282
Can I get something else too?

106
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:45,213
Like what?

107
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:47,787
Like a kiss.

108
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:49,377
Don't get too comfortable.

109
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:50,440
Can I?

110
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,959
At least let me kiss your helmet.

111
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,710
Whatever.

112
00:06:55,576 --> 00:06:58,317
Hey, Moo! Sit properly.

113
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,890
I already kissed you.

114
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,120
What else do you want?

115
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,000
Give me something in return. Anything.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,645
I'm riding. It's dangerous.

117
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,456
One hand will do.

118
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,659
More.

119
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:15,072
Ouch!

120
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:16,866
Stay still.

121
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,603
It's dangerous.

122
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:30,757
Thank you, big bro.

123
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:33,280
That's what you should've introduced me
to your mom as.

124
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,650
How could I introduce the person
I'm pursuing as my big bro?

125
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,367
You dare talk to your mom about this?

126
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,656
Yes. My mom and I always talk like that.

127
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:45,000
She taught me we should be honest
and open with each other.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,360
I was thinking that if I passed the audition,

129
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,481
I'd take you to see her
and tell her you're my boyfriend.

130
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,481
Stop being delusional.

131
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:56,507
- Go to bed.
- Come on.

132
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:58,718
Tomorrow morning,
you can continue chasing your dream.

133
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:01,100
Okay. Bye-bye.

134
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:04,458
Oh, I forgot to return the helmet.

135
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,200
Love you.

136
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,927
What's wrong with you?

137
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:14,070
What's up, buddy?

138
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,480
I thought you said
your Moo was gone from your life.

139
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,097
How did he come back?

140
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,436
Why are you here?

141
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:22,414
I'm Neth. I own this dorm.

142
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,632
Wow. Your Moo is sassy.

143
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,156
He's brave enough to tell his mom
he's hitting on you.

144
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:32,360
How was meeting your future mother-in-law
for the first time?

145
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,097
Did she accept your "wai"?
(a gesture of respect by putting hands together)

146
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,460
I didn't "wai" her.

147
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,215
I had to keep my hands
on both handles of my motorbike.

148
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,772
If I had "wai" her, I'd be in a hospital now.

149
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,016
Fine.

150
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,765
But Moo was so determined to do as you said.

151
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:52,525
You should do as you said too. Right?

152
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,811
Yeah.

153
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:58,380
I think I like him.

154
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:01,197
I like him so much.

155
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:02,770
Stop it.

156
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,543
The other day when I asked
what's holding you back,

157
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:09,705
it's mainly your mom, right?

158
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:12,437
The other things were just excuses.

159
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:13,981
You're the worst.

160
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:17,248
Fine. You know me so well.

161
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:19,720
Of course. I'm your friend.

162
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,457
If you want to be serious
about this relationship and keep it going,

163
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:29,597
your next step is to talk to your mom.

164
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:34,680
I believe she'll understand you, Kang.

165
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:45,000
You know how I always barely
passed my social studies exam, right?

166
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,577
This time, I only got seven questions wrong.

167
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:50,276
Do you want to clean your nose first?

168
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,554
Where were we?

169
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,858
Oh, social studies.

170
00:09:56,858 --> 00:10:01,108
After social studies, I took the English exam
which I thought I wouldn't know what to do,

171
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:04,921
but as it turns out, I found it very easy.

172
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,631
Why did you stuff the tissue in your nose?

173
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:09,638
You're done using it. Now throw it away.

174
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:11,740
Why would I throw it away and waste it?

175
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:16,440
And what have you been sewing?

176
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,280
This? It's a bag.

177
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,000
Wow.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,338
You know the value of money now.

179
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,984
I made the right decision to send you there.

180
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:27,655
I'll visit you this Saturday.
Let's go out for a meal.

183
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,469
I've already seen the grades report you sent me.

184

Let's talk about your love life.

185
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:39,159
What's going on, son?

186
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,985
Huh? Only a few months there
and you're dating someone already?

187
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:44,724
Not yet, Mom. Calm down.

188
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:46,888
I'm trying to win a senior over,
but I haven't succeeded yet.

189
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:48,884
Wow. He's older?

190
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:50,273
Only by two years.

191
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:52,374
I just asked him out today.

192
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:53,850
We're not boyfriends yet.

193
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,400
He said I should focus on improving myself first
before thinking about our relationship.

194
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,273
That's why I've been studying hard,
as you can see.

195
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:01,900
Yeah. You did it.

196

Yes, but there's still one thing
I haven't achieved.

197

198
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:09,938

199
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:21,870
I told him that if I passed the audition,
he must agree to date me.

Hey Kang. Why are you back so late today?

206
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:53,682
I had to take care of many things.

207
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:56,761
Go take a shower so you can rest.

208
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,141
- Mom.
- Hmm?

209
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:14,020
How did Dad woo you?

210
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:21,076
Which specific period do you want to know?

211
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:23,698
How about this period?

212
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:27,156
When I was young, I sold rice and curry
near Phra Pathom Chedi

213
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:30,275
and your dad was a minibus driver nearby.

214
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:33,731
He stopped by 4-5 times a day.

215
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:36,600
I was like, "Did I give him too little food?",

216
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,554
so the next time he came,
I gave him a heaping plate of food.

217
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:45,788
His friends in the area later told me
he was so full but too scared to tell me.

218
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:48,345
Your dad put up a big front.

219
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:52,411
He wouldn't say things directly.
He's exactly like you.

220
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:03,572
Why do you ask? Who are you going to woo?

221
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,078
But seeing how you are, I think someone
is wooing you, not the other way around.

222
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,539
What are you talking about?

223
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:16,940
It's Moo, isn't it?

224
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:20,890
Yes.

225
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,493
Did I disappoint you?

226
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,592
Disappoint me about what?

227
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:35,407
That it's Moo.

228
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:39,142
That's it's him who's hitting on me.

229
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,608
He's the one hitting on you. I can see that.

230
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:51,051
What I mean is Moo is a guy...

231
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,250
and I'm also a guy.

232
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,430
That doesn't matter.

What matters is here.

234

00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:24,998
Come on. I can run this while you're away.

358
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:29,023
I'll ask Neth to come and help.

359
00:22:29,953 --> 00:22:31,445
Fine.

360
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,814
What's up?

361
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:40,694
Can you come help my mom out at the restaurant?

362
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:45,965
It's Saturday. Why are you busy?

363
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,588
Where are you going?

364
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:49,309
I have something to do.

365
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:52,658
Just come and help her
in exchange for your free food.

366
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:54,784
Sure, I'm available to help,

367
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:58,659
but you have to tell me where you're going,
who you're going with, and what you're going to do.

368
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:02,359
Are you going on a date with Moo?

369
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:06,238
- Hi, Auntie.
- Oh, hi.

370
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:08,403
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

371
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:10,610
How are you doing? I hope you're well.

372
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,765
Who's that?

373
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,732
Talk later. I got to go.
Don't forget to come and help my mom.

374
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:15,930
Wait, Kang.

375
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:20,499
Can I borrow Kang to be my tour guide for a day?

376
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,977
Of course. You're welcome to.

377
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:24,535
- Hi, Shone.
- Hi.

378
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:27,760
I'm leaving then.

379
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,397
Go. Don't worry about me.

380
00:23:29,397 --> 00:23:30,626
Enjoy your trip.

381
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:31,834
- Have a good day.
- You too.

382
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:33,377
Neth is coming to help.

383
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:34,592
- Alright. Don't worry.
- Take care.

384
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:36,662
Don't worry. Just go.

385
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,622
I knew it.

386
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:43,004
Moo.

387
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,035
Yes?

388
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:48,278
You're all dressed up. Are you waiting for someone?

389
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:51,077
How do you know?

390
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:52,774
I'm waiting for my mom.

391
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:57,005
- Your mom?
- Yes. She'll be here soon.

392
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:00,024
Then who is going with Kang?

393
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:01,229
Kang?

394
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:03,490
No. It's nothing.

395
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:07,561
- I got to go. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

396
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,087
Kang!

397
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,500
Is that Shone's car?

398
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:19,395
Moo.

399
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:21,570
Oh, hi, Mom.

400
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,168
You're here. You're early.

401
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:26,132
You came down to wait for me?

402
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,180
Yes. I was waiting for you.

403
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:32,752
Is something wrong?

404
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:33,807
No, nothing.

405
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,933
Let me help you with your stuff.

406
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,319
How are you, Mom?
Did you come from the studio or home?

407
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,398
Home.

408
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:43,240
Don't be shocked once you enter the room.

409
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,086
Why? What's in there?

410
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:48,711
Nothing. I just want you to prepare yourself.

411
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:54,621
Guys.

412
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:56,038
This is my mom.

413
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:02,277
Hi, Mom.

414
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:04,755
Hi. Hi guys.

415
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,199
Sorry.

416
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,859
I'm Potae.

417
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:13,550
I'm Payos.

418
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,077
We're Moo's best friends.

419
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:17,444
That's right.

420
00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:24,665
Our exam is coming up,
so I invited them over and study together.

421
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:27,926
We help one another with any questions
we can't solve.

422
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:39,958
Then I'll come back another day.

423
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:42,614
You guys should continue studying.
I don't want to interrupt.

424
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:44,098
Hold on, Mom.

425
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,460
Please don't go, Mom.

426
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,178
We had no idea you were coming today.

427
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:52,789
Otherwise, we wouldn't have
come here to study today.

428
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:54,659
We'd have come tomorrow instead.

429
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:59,282
We're sorry, Mom.

430
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:00,618
Please accept our apologies, Mom.

431
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:02,425
Yes.

432
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:05,837
That's enough. You don't need to apologize to me.

433
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:08,450
I just wanted to visit Moo.

434
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,686
I wanted to see how he's doing
and what kind of friends he's hanging out with.

435
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:19,998
But after seeing this, I...

436
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:24,334
You feel relieved, right?

437
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:28,838
I think it's a bit weird.

438
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:32,990
How is it weird, Mom?

439
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:36,558
I've never seen my son like this.

440
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,672
I've changed.

441
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:47,171
People change to become a better
and more responsible person.

442
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:49,184
- Right, friends?
- Yes.

443
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:51,429
Time changes, people change.

444
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:52,915
That's right.

445
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:55,597
Sure.

446
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:59,257
I won't take any more of your study time.

447
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,594
Let me go and buy some food
for you to eat while you study.

448
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:06,221
- I'll be right back, Moo.
- Please don't be long.

449
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:10,228
Safe trip, Mom.

450
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,937
Thank you so much, Mom.

451
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,897
Shall we revise chemistry next?

452
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:22,758
Let's do 30 practice questions.

453
00:27:26,488 --> 00:27:28,010
She's gone.

454
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,294
This place is a space for artsy kids.

455
00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:33,836
They regularly hold workshops here.

456
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:36,769
Different kinds each week.

457
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:40,284
Today, they're having a ceramic workshop.

458
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,449
I think you'll get some content.

459
00:27:42,449 --> 00:27:43,733
Thank you so much.

460
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,776
Press your hands down like this.

461
00:27:54,776 --> 00:27:57,062
- How are you doing?
- The clay is so hard.

462
00:27:59,254 --> 00:28:01,255
I'm shaping a dish.

463
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:03,900
Wow. That's beautiful.

464
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:12,373
Do I pull it or step on it?

465
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:13,943
You can step on it.

466
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,879
Ah.

467
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:17,467
Yes. There you go.

468
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:30,433
I don't know what you guys like to eat,
so I bought a lot of things.

469
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:39,731
Guys, before we eat,
shall we recite the periodic table?

470
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:40,625
Yes.

471
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:43,349
That's a very good idea, friend.

472
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:44,581
- Li?
- Lithium.

473
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:45,732
- Na?
- Sodium.

474
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:46,732
- K?
- Potassium.

475
00:28:46,732 --> 00:28:47,760
Rb? Rubidium.

476
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,295
- Cs?
- What is that? I can't remember.

477
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,194
It's easy to memorize. Only two syllables.

478
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:54,243
Remember, it starts with C and ends with -sium.

479
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:56,050
- Oh. Cesium.
- Uh-huh.

480
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,360
What's Fr?

481
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,378
- F is for Fran.
- Fanmeet?

482
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:00,648
- Franchise.
- Francium.

483
00:29:00,648 --> 00:29:02,558
Oh!

484
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,569
Studying together is worth it.

485
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:08,921
Potae.

486
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,391
Yes?

487
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:12,840
What faculty do you want to get into?

488
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,671
I want to go to a med school.

489
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,136
So does Payos.

490
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:25,155
"Dream Camp For Young Aspiring Doctors".

491
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:33,296
There's a preparation camp coming up soon
and Moo is interested.

492
00:29:33,296 --> 00:29:34,293
Yes, I am.

493
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:36,833
I heard there'll be famous tutors there.

494
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:42,055
If a child says they want to study medicine,
no parents will say no.

495
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:43,367
Oh.

496
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,742
Go for it. That's good.

497
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:51,920
Just put this paper in front
and write whatever to fill it up.

498
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,715
The last page is the letter
you want your mom to sign.

499
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:56,715
Right here.

500
00:29:57,824 --> 00:30:00,408
- Your idea is really good, Tae.
- Yeah.

501
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,066
It's amazing.

502
00:30:04,764 --> 00:30:07,183
Could you please sign a document for me?

503
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:10,891
Where is it?

504
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:12,212
- Potae, buddy.
- Oh, yes.

505
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:14,887
- Could you pass this to her?
- Sure.

506
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:17,015
Here it is, Mom.

507
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,601
But what if she reads the document?

508
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,494
Come on, Moo.

509
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:24,537
Don't you ever watch TV dramas?
All executives do is sign.

510
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:25,815
I'll act as one.

511
00:30:25,815 --> 00:30:28,049
Mr. Executive, I need you to sign this document.

512
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,036
Which page?

513
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,764
- You can just sign it here.
- Okay.

514
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:35,096
- Let me read through it first.
- Shit. He said she wouldn't read it.

515
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:36,379
Excuse me, Mom.

516
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:40,615
Overall, it just gives you
the background of the camp. That's it.

517
00:30:40,615 --> 00:30:44,065
But I guarantee that
participants will benefit from it.

518
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:46,267
We can confirm the benefits.

519
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:48,291
These two have joined the camp before.

520
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:51,796
Which page do I need to sign?

521
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:52,899
The pen.

522
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:56,776
Here you are.

523
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,484
Right here.

524
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:16,325
Thank you.

525
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:18,167
Thank you.

526
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:22,655
The camp is going to be so much fun, Mom.

527
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:25,196
Yay.

528
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:26,295
Alright.

529
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:31,811
Now that I've already signed it,
it's time for you to tell the truth.

530
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:33,393
All three of you.

531
00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:40,237
What truth?

532
00:31:41,828 --> 00:31:43,344
It's nothing.

533
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:45,213
It's nothing, Mom.

534
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:48,797
Did you really think I'd believe
your med school camp story?

535
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:51,567
Hmm?

536
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,651
Tell me.

537
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:05,866
Thank you so much, Kang. I got a lot of footage.

538
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:06,869
You're welcome.

539
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:08,327
Do you come here often?

540
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:13,577
I used to come here a lot, but not anymore.

541
00:32:13,577 --> 00:32:14,659
Why not?

542
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:20,123
Well, I used to come here
to get tutored for art school.

543
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:23,127
Then I quit and didn't take the exam.

544
00:32:26,518 --> 00:32:30,623
It's a pity you couldn't continue in this area.

545
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:33,555
You looked happy doing artwork.

546
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:38,712
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

547
00:32:41,788 --> 00:32:45,511
Did you think you could fool me
by just wearing glasses and reading books?

548
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:47,609
I've raised you for years, Moo.

549
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:50,273
Of course, I could tell you were lying.

550
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:53,415
You were faking it so badly.

551
00:32:53,415 --> 00:32:59,064
I could tell from the first glance,
but I wanted to know how far you'd go.

552
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,952
Sorry.

553
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:06,499
Mom, our clip passed the audition.

554
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:09,943
I don't want to lose this opportunity.

555
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:14,847
I gave you an ultimatum,
but you didn't care at all?

556
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:16,381
I did.

557
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:20,213
I studied hard to improve my grades.

558
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:22,643
I showed you I could do it.

559
00:33:23,698 --> 00:33:26,295
I don't want to see you hurt again.

560
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,019
You've tried so many times.

561
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,943
Every time you fail the auditions,
you don't know why.

562
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,826
But I do. I know how the industry is.

563
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:39,389
I see you get hurt over and over again.

564
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:41,390
Do you think that makes me feel good?

565
00:33:42,177 --> 00:33:43,435
Mom.

566
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:45,055
I really want to do this.

567
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:47,665
I want to accomplish it with my own talent.

568
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:53,823
If I end up failing or losing, I'll accept it.

569
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,846
This time, please let me do it.

570
00:33:56,846 --> 00:33:58,048
Please give me a chance.

571
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:03,379
Moo, I already gave you permission
when I signed the letter

572
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:06,762
because I saw that you really
worked harder in school.

573
00:34:09,055 --> 00:34:15,428
But this will be your last chance.

574
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:18,697
If you fail this time,

575
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:24,177
I'll send you to live with your dad in
New Zealand after you finish high school.

576
00:34:37,082 --> 00:34:39,082
Today was so much fun.

577
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:40,299
See you.

578
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:50,484
Hey, Kang. You're back.

579
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:52,308
- Yes.
- How was it? Did you have fun?

580
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:53,755
I had so much fun.

581
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:56,180
I got to shape clay for the first time.

582
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,952
At first, I thought it was going to be hard,
but it wasn't at all.

583
00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:02,395
I can't wait to see how it turns out after firing.

584
00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:04,364
I'll get it in a few days.

585
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:09,085
Do you want to get back to studying art?

586
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:19,021
I know that you feel guilty about your Dad and me,
so you made that decision.

587
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:20,977
But you know what?

588
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:25,759
I feel guilty about you too
for ignoring your dream.

589
00:35:29,614 --> 00:35:33,717
No, Mom. I made that decision on my own.

590
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:40,561
It's been over two years
that you've been helping me.

591
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:44,926
I want you to decide again.

592
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:51,494
I want you to follow your dream
and your happiness.

593
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:55,350
I want to see you happy.

594
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:59,054
Okay?

595
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:02,623
Okay.

596
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:25,422
Hello?

597
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:26,552
It's me.

598
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,146
Oh, what's up, Moo?

599
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:33,455
Hey, I got the signature.

600
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:34,883
Mom signed it for me.

601
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:38,108
See? There was no need for me
to act as your parent.

602
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:39,274
You're right.

603
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:42,942
But where did you go today and with whom?

604
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,616
How did you know?

605
00:36:50,616 --> 00:36:52,175
I saw Neth this morning.

606
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:54,455
She thought I was going on a date with you.

607
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:56,521
So where did you go and with whom?

608
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,403
I... went to do some errands.

609
00:36:58,403 --> 00:37:00,023
What errands? With whom?

610
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:03,125
- Someone asked me to be a tour guide.
- Where?

611
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,457
- The art center.
- What did you do there?

612
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:05,892
- Ceramic pottery.
- Why are you angry?

613
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:09,682
I'm not. Why are you making a big fuss about this?
You nag me more than my mom.

614
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:11,042
Why haven't you taken me there?

615
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:14,233
You've been to many places with me, haven't you?

616
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,764
It's not the same. We've never dated.

617
00:37:16,764 --> 00:37:19,706
Take me on a date.
Take me on a date and be like a couple.

618
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:22,024
We can't be like a couple,

619
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:25,890
but we can go on a date.

620
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,259
Really?

621
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,759
Can we really do that?

622
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:32,915
Just leave. Please stop already.

623
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:35,706
Let me see your nails.

624
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:39,482
Why are they so long?

625
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:41,325
- I'll take care of them.
- No need.

626
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,892
Kang.

627
00:37:42,892 --> 00:37:44,253
Don't be stubborn.

628
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:52,040
Why don't you sit in front of me?

629
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,163
I'm more comfortable like this.
This is like cutting my own nails.

630
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:02,199
Don't cut my skin.

631
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,670
I won't.

632
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:12,374
By the way, there's something I haven't told you.

633
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:17,705
My mom gave me one condition.

634
00:38:17,705 --> 00:38:21,954
If I fail the audition this time,
when I finish high school,

635
00:38:22,915 --> 00:38:25,479
I'll have to go live with my dad in New Zealand.

636
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:32,297
I'm scared I'll fail.

637
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:42,494
You can do it for sure.

638
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,851
I'm always rooting for you here.

[New Wave Project Participation Confirmation Letter]

641
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:25,054
Hey, bro. Did you call to borrow money?

642
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:27,162
No, Mom already gave me money.

643
00:39:27,162 --> 00:39:29,577
I wanted to ask if you know
the insides of the New Wave Project.

644
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:34,967
What do they want to see in the audition?
How many people are they looking for?

645
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:36,938
No idea.

646
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:40,424
So, you're going?

647
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:41,595
Did your mom come around?

648
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:44,962
She did, but she gave me a harsh condition.

649
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:49,209
She said if I don't win this, she'll send me
to live with Dad in New Zealand.

650
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:51,667
That's good. You'll get to
improve your language skills.

651
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,925
I don't want to improve my language skills.

652
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,457
I want to debut here.

653

Besides, the person I'm pursuing
just started giving me a chance.

Love is such a big drive in your life, huh?

655
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:05,108
Come on. Let me see his face.

656
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:08,118
No. We're not together yet.

657
00:40:08,118 --> 00:40:10,686
Don't steal him from me.
I know what you're trying to do.

658
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,240
I'm not going to steal him from you.

659
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,626
I already have eyes on someone else.

660
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:16,818
Oh? Who is it?

661
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:18,505
I'm not sure how things will go yet.

662
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:21,152
Once I am, I'll introduce him to you.

663
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,851
Come on.

664
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:24,592
I got to go. I need to edit my video.

Do you want to go or not?

711
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,414
Of course. Let's go.

712
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:54,175
Wow. This place is amazing.
It's nice and cool.

713
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:58,442
I used to come here a lot.
I loved coming here to draw.

714
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,785
Yes, I remember you're good at drawing.

715
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:02,205
I wonder...

716
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:05,518
Why I don't go to university?

717
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:08,691
Yeah.

718
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:14,774
Actually, I planned to try
for painting school two years ago.

719
00:43:14,774 --> 00:43:20,668
My dad was supportive, even though
my mom didn't agree with that choice.

720
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:22,122
- Dad.
- Hmm?

721
00:43:22,122 --> 00:43:23,522
I want a tablet.

722
00:43:23,522 --> 00:43:28,426
Are you serious about getting into art school?

723
00:43:28,426 --> 00:43:32,733
But later, I didn't continue my studies because...

724
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:40,122
my dad had an accident.

725
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:46,147
I never picked up the tablet he gave me again.

726
00:43:47,798 --> 00:43:52,435
No wonder you wouldn't accept my tablet.

727
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:55,426
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:59,178
Hey, it's not your fault.

729
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,840
You know what?

730
00:44:01,827 --> 00:44:07,978
Your determination gives me a lot to think about.

731
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:12,971
I think I'll get my dad's tablet fixed.

732
00:44:13,872 --> 00:44:19,212
And I've researched what universities
in Bangkok offer painting courses.

733
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,245
I think I still have time to submit my portfolio.

734
00:44:24,285 --> 00:44:27,372
You're going to study in Bangkok?

735
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:32,091
You have to pass your audition.
New Zealand is far.

736
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:34,586
Bangkok is as far as I can follow you.

737
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:38,572
Okay.

738
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:42,122
Hearing this makes me want to win even more.

739
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:43,373
Let's make a promise.

740
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:46,277
I promise.

741
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,078
Tae.

742
00:45:00,516 --> 00:45:02,329
I'm lonely.

743
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:03,958
Tae, what's wrong?

744
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:32,162
Am I crying?

745
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,457
Yes.

746
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:35,847
Bad dream?

747
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:44,129
I dreamed that I got to debut,

748
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:46,027
but no one came to watch me.

749
00:45:47,785 --> 00:45:49,880
No one cared about me.

750
00:45:56,656 --> 00:45:58,527
It's okay.

751
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:02,808
If you tell your family,
they'll come to support you.

752
00:46:03,548 --> 00:46:06,022
I'm not sure about that.

753
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:08,046
They never care about me.

754
00:46:09,328 --> 00:46:10,951
Please don't leave me.

755
00:46:12,443 --> 00:46:14,739
I'll go with you to the finish line.

756
00:46:28,463 --> 00:46:31,627
I got so much encouragement from you today.

757
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:34,140
I'm definitely going to pass the audition tomorrow.

758
00:46:34,915 --> 00:46:36,017
Yeah.

759
00:46:36,017 --> 00:46:38,027
I have something for you.

760
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:39,652
What is it?

761
00:46:39,652 --> 00:46:41,907
- What?
- Here.

762
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:44,588
This is your lucky charm from me.

763
00:46:44,588 --> 00:46:47,435
You made this for me?

764
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:49,637
Give me your hand.

765
00:46:57,502 --> 00:47:00,320
I just wanted to do something for you too.

766
00:47:03,802 --> 00:47:05,913
This is so cute.

767
00:47:05,913 --> 00:47:10,165
I think you have to bless it.
Otherwise, it won't be powerful.

768
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:11,824
Come on. Bless it for me.

769
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,128
A pat ti yae, a pat ti tae tae na.

770
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,286
Abracadabra!

771
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:22,569
You're all set.

772
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:23,991
Seriously?

773
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:29,252
I think in addition to the blessing,
you have to place your magic too.

774
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:31,759
- What?
- Place your magic.

775
00:47:31,759 --> 00:47:33,162
What are you doing?

776
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:38,248
This is how you can place your magic on my face.

777
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:41,950
Come on.

778
00:47:47,807 --> 00:47:52,469
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

779
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:57,486
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

780
00:47:57,486 --> 00:48:00,355
Done. Go get 'em.

781
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:01,344
I will.

782
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:02,817
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

783
00:48:02,817 --> 00:48:09,022
♫ I want to call you boo,
but only your name now should do ♫

784
00:48:20,682 --> 00:48:23,315
Here comes the day I go after my dream.

785
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:25,307
Go get 'em. I'm rooting for you.

786
00:48:25,307 --> 00:48:27,290
I got here because of you, Kang.

787
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,910
I think we'll definitely pass.

788
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,162
Trust me.

789
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:31,740
How long have you been crushing on him?

790
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,690
Nonsense.

791
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,582
You're going to get it from me.

792
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:36,860
I'm here for you.

793
00:48:37,803 --> 00:48:39,450
Which Moo is cuter?

794
00:48:40,304 --> 00:48:42,274
Can I hit on you?

795
00:48:42,274 --> 00:48:44,967
Kang, do you love me?

796
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:47,600
Will you be my boyfriend?

797
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,684
Just you wait, I'm getting a boyfriend!
