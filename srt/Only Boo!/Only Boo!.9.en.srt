I want your team to audition again.

6
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:22,493
I saw something in the three of you.

7
00:00:22,493 --> 00:00:24,120
Are you serious?

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,528
Your Everest is right in front of you, Moo.

9
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:27,923
Reach the summit.

10
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:31,341
I just finished writing this song last night.
I want you to be the first to hear it.

11
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:33,609
Thank you for writing this song for me.

12
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:35,627
I passed, Kang.

13
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,160
Well done.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,235
I don't know what to write.

15
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:40,203
Something you haven't told me.

16
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:42,450
[I love you more than a friend.]

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,752
Can I get a graduation gift?

18
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:47,158
Even if you didn't ask, I'd give it anyway.

19
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:56,121
Are you okay?

20
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,743
Yes, I am. I'm very okay.

21
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:01,200
Are you okay?

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,419
I'm okay.

23
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:06,549
So, what are you going to do next?

24
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:12,020
Work and save money to marry you.
Marriage equality looks promising.

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,600
I mean your plan right after graduation.
You're thinking too far.

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,568
Your question wasn't clear.

27
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,906
Honestly, I don't have any plans.

28
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:23,105
I'm just going to go to university
and train at the company.

29
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:26,930
When do they want you to train?

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,920
- I don't know.
- When do you enroll for classes?

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,462
- I don't know.
- When do you report to the university?

32
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:31,892
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Have you bought the textbooks?

33
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,054
- I didn't read the details.
- I'm leaving.

34
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:34,111
Hey.

35
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,330
I don't know anything.

36
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,271
I don't want to say wrong information
and embarrass myself.

37
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,985
I asked because I'm concerned.

38
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:41,892
You already graduated high school,
but you don't know anything.

39
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,228
Don't be harsh on me.

40
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,040
If you're going to be, why don't you
become my personal manager?

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,847
So you can manage everything about me.

42
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:51,592
Do you have money?
I charge an expensive fee.

43
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:54,340
Despite how I look, I'm rich.

44
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,409
Stop it.

45
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,690
I knew since I became your boyfriend...

46
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:06,034
that I'd have to take care of you.

47
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,452
Thank you.

48
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:20,963
I'm happy to have you as my boyfriend.

49
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:22,130
Yeah

50
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:39,992
[EP 9: Blank Letter]

51
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:52,323
[I love you more than a friend.]

52
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,571
What?

53
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:57,517
What prank are you pulling, Yos?

54
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,389
Did you get the bad influence from me?

55
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:03,051
You shocked me.

56
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:04,630
I'm not joking.

57
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:07,763
I'm serious.

58
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:09,995
Since when?

59
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:16,334
I don't know. Since a long time ago.

60
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,613
I'm not sure if it started
in junior high or high school.

61
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:25,896
Before I knew it, I'd fallen for you.

62
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:37,998
Hey, Tae. Are you upset?

63
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:51,383
I don't know if I'm okay or not,
but I'm shocked.

64
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:59,129
You're my friend, but you see me
as more than a friend.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,032
I admit I don't know what to do.

66
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,395
Tae, calm down.

67
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:09,252
Listen to me.

68
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:10,855
I just wanted to tell you.

69
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:15,115
You don't have to feel the same way about me.

70
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,724
No matter what, I want you with me
for the rest of my life.

71
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:24,326
Can we still be friends?

72
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,326
Tae.

73
00:05:28,326 --> 00:05:30,470
Tae, hear me out!

74
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,038
Or just forget that I ever confessed.

75
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:41,772
I'm not disgusted by you.

76
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:48,923
I just don't know how to deal with these feelings.

77
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,610
Damn it! I shouldn't have done it!

78
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,344
Should I apologize to him?

79
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:11,438
Tae, are you busy?

80
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:24,523
Message from TTM: Finalists,
please prepare for a 1-month trainee camp.

81
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:27,684
About earlier,

82
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:32,079
Message from TTM: Finalists,
please prepare for a 1-month trainee camp.

83
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:38,380
- Neth.
- Hmm?

84
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,651
My room key.

85
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:45,200
Moo, I don't think you had this much stuff
when you came.

86
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,371
You can leave some here
and just take the important stuff.

87
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:49,829
What a great idea.

88
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:50,830
- Kang.
- Hmm?

89
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,840
- Am I important to you?
- Yes.

90
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,849
Can you pack me in the box then?

91
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,663
Neth, can you move?

92
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:01,583
Sure. I want to be carried by someone too.

93
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,395
You guys are so sweet.

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,402
Kang, you're quite bold

95
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:11,461
for taking the chance to elope with him
while your mom is on a merit trip.

96
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:16,026
Moo, when is your mom picking us up?

97
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:18,920
Oh, didn't I tell you
she's not picking us up today?

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,216
Oh, then who is?

99
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:25,321
He is. That's my cousin Shone.

100
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:33,713
Bro, this is Kang. He's my boyfriend.

101
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,632
I know.

102
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,427
Is this your stuff?

103
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:38,552
It's a lot.

104
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:41,289
- Let me help.
- Let's go.

105
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:46,502
Kang, don't worry.
Bro and I have sorted things out about you.

106
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:48,036
But, bro, you had quite the nerve.

107
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:51,960
You used work as an excuse when
you were actually trying to get close to Kang.

108
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,001
What are you talking about?

109
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:56,119
Back then, he didn't know I was hitting on you.

110
00:07:56,119 --> 00:08:00,500
But when he found out, he understood
and supported me to pursue you.

111
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,680
Brothers don't fight about these things, right?

112
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,160
Yeah.

113
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,430
Do you want to go or not? You talk too much.

114
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,892
Yes, I'm going.

115
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:10,770
Kang.

116
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,246
Don't worry.

117
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:15,448
What you're worried about right now
will never happen.

118
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:17,526
Moo and I have talked things out.

119
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:19,580
Let's go, boy. Let's go.

120
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,776
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

121
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,607
You brought the piano too?

122
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:34,168
You're the best mom.

123
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,217
Now you're being affectionate
because you got your way.

124
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,929
Thank you so much, Shone, for picking him up.

125
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,387
No worries.

126
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:46,390
Hello.

127
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,620
Kang, isn't it?

128
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,001
Yes.

129
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:50,663
Kang has three roles:

130
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:55,600
my manager, my private chef,
and my boyfriend.

131
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,882
You sure don't hold back
on that introduction, huh?

132
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:01,459
I've seen him before.
You don't have to show him off.

133
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,022
Where did you see him?

134
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,320
Did you do it like this?

135
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,177
You stalked me?

136
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:14,744
Just because I disappeared
doesn't mean I didn't care about you.

137
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:17,103
Now that you've moved here,
don't be irresponsible.

138
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:20,626
You have to keep up your good grades in university.

139
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,904
You can't just be an artist
and ignore your studies.

140
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:28,100
If you break your legs and can no longer dance,
you need something else to make a living.

141
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,203
Why do you say that, Mom?

142
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,108
Don't worry.

143
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:34,333
I have Kang to manage everything.

144
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,754
Everything is going to be perfect.

145
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,106
Right.

146
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:41,240
It better be as you say.

147
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,857
Alright. I have to go.

148
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:45,183
I have a meeting.

149
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,469
I'll drive you, Auntie Dao.

150
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:49,382
See you.

151
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:51,414
Bye, Mom.

152
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,258
Shone.

153
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,273
Yes?

154
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,648
You know about Moo and Kang, right?

155
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:11,430
Yes.

156
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,833
But I just found out today
that they're boyfriends now.

157
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:24,488
Moo told me about falling in love
and he improved himself as a person.

158
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:25,934
But there's one thing.

159
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:32,134
I want you to talk to Moo.

160
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:35,782
He doesn't really listen to me.
He's more likely to listen to you.

161
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:41,651
Okay. What is it about?

162
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:46,280
Look. That TV is so much bigger
than the one I had in Nakhon Pathom.

163
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,222
Look at that brand-new kitchen.
It's waiting for Mr. Kang to cook for me.

164
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:53,208
And this piano. I've played it since grade 1 or 2.

165
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,817
I'll play it for you when I have time.

166
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,763
Look at this king-sized bed.

167
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:58,887
It's super soft.

168
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,095
Can I hug you?

169
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:01,000
No.

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,239
Please, Kang.

171
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:07,220
If you hug me to sleep, I'll be so happy.

172
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,380
Please.

173
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,946
Let's stop.

174
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,602
You know, you've been with me
since the day I had no one

175
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:13,584
until now, when I see my Everest.

176
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,574
I'm not climbing it alone.
You're climbing it with me.

177
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:24,888
I'm just so happy to have you by my side.

178
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,383
That happiness was so overwhelming that...

179
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,029
Say no more.

180
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,807
I know.

181
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:42,855
I was just shy.

182
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:47,830
Me too.

183
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:55,637
I think we should take it slow.

184
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:02,483
So, can I at least do this?

185
00:14:03,796 --> 00:14:05,070
Of course.

186
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:18,743
Hey. Did you drop Mom off already?

187
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:21,419
Yeah.

188
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:30,496
Moo, can I talk to you?

189
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:34,219
Please excuse me then.

190
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:42,555
What is it?

191
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:48,121
I think you should remove the clip
you took with Kang.

192
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,448
Why should I delete it?

193
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:52,286
You're becoming an artist.

194
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:54,674
Once you become famous,
people will dig up your past.

195
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:58,216
That clip could become a controversy in the future.

196
00:14:58,216 --> 00:14:59,862
What controversy?

197
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,816
My relationship with Kang is not wrong.

198
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:08,209
That's true, but once you become
very famous and gain a lot of fans,

199
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,475
some of them might not want you to date.

200
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:15,050
What are you talking about?
That's total nonsense.

201
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,720
Did Mom ask you to talk to me?

202
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,314
You know it all, huh? Yeah.

203
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:24,092
She said that you wouldn't listen to her,
so she asked me to warn you.

204
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:26,506
But I actually agree with her.

205
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:29,113
Not everyone is going to understand you.

206
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:31,857
It's better to deal with what you can.

207
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:35,552
Digital footprints are scary these days.

208
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,519
Alright. I'll delete it.

209
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,897
Is that all?

210
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:52,523
Sorry that I didn't invite you guys
to sleep over at my condo.

211
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:55,822
You know I want to be with Kang, right?

212
00:15:57,254 --> 00:16:00,519
I get it. See you tomorrow.

213
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:08,787
Moo, come eat.

214
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:11,009
Okay, coming.

215
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:13,999
I'm done.

216
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:19,036
Here I am.

217
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:23,222
Wow, what did you cook for me today?

218
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:24,852
Fried rice.

219
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:27,770
You have to eat from the simple ingredients
in the fridge for now.

220
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,956
Actually, I'd love anything you cook for me.

221
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,071
This looks so good.

222
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:39,050
Why are you smiling?

223
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,490
I'm so happy.

224
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,171
Living with you feels like
we're practicing for our wedding night.

225
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,461
Nonsense.

226
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,120
After you finish eating,
take a shower and go to bed.

227
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,549
They want you to be there at 9 a.m.

228
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:52,954
You should wake up at 7 a.m.
so you have time to get ready.

229
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:54,576
Noted, Mr. Manager.

230
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:58,856
I'll hurry to take a shower, go to bed,
and lie down next to you.

231
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:01,678
No, you sleep in the bedroom.

232
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:03,887
I'll sleep on the sofa.

233
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,513
Why? This is our first night together.

234
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:09,117
I'm your manager, you must listen to me.

235
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:12,856
If you don't listen to me,
I'll go back to Nakhon Pathom.

236
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:14,968
Hurry up and eat. Stop staring at me.

237
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,412
My door will be unlocked.

238
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:17,669
You talk too much.

239
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:26,569
Kang.

240
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,202
Why aren't you sleeping?

241
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:36,533
I tried, but couldn't fall asleep.

242
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,666
No one hugged me to sleep.

243
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,593
What are you watching?

244
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,670
The Way Home.

245
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,174
Let me watch it with you.

246
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,646
- Moo.
- Yes.

247
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:55,141
Honestly, this is not comfortable.

248
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,211
Can you change your position?

249
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,632
Moo, it's heavy.

250
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,902
Your hair is in the way.

251
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:04,441
Okay. How about this?

252
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:07,679
This will do. I feel comfortable now.

253
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:18,847
Hey.

254
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,416
Wow.

255
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,570
Taken by the movie?

256
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,496
The grandson misses his grandma
and sends her a blank letter.

257
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:31,296
Will they reunite in the end?

258
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:32,960
They will.

259
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,880
He loves his grandma so much.

260
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,170
Eventually, he will visit her.

261
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,427
What if one day you and I don't get to see
each other anymore and you miss me,

262
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:45,479
will you send me a blank letter?

263
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,692
You don't have to write anything.

264
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,813
That way, I'll know you sent it.

265
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:58,243
It's just a movie. Why are you so emotional?

266
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:04,033
It's late. You should go to bed.

267
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,759
I want to sleep here.

268
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:14,567
You're so kind.

269
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:20,392
Will you hug me?

270
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,048
That'd be even more kind.

271
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:24,462

00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:02,220
♫ My heart can't take it alright ♫

355
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,640
I lost.

356
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,215
- Can we play another round?
- No.

357
00:25:05,215 --> 00:25:09,167
♫ Don't fool me that you have no idea ♫

358
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,338
♫ Fall in love already ♫

359
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:12,824
No need to play another round.

360
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,952
What's this? A trick to hold my hand?

361
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,657
No.

362
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:29,113
Hey, I'm sorry.

363
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:31,007
I slept on your shoulder the whole way here.

364
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,167
Is your shoulder sore? Let me give you a massage.

365
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:37,030
It's okay. It's not that sore.

366
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,834
Let's hurry and get inside.

367
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,747
We're friends. We're only friends.

368
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:17,126
What do you want to eat for dinner?

369
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:19,246
I'll buy the ingredients and prepare it for you.

370
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,930
Kai palo.

371
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,789
Again? Don't you get tired of it?

372
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,526
No, if it's you who makes it,
I can eat it every day for the rest of my life.

373
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:29,700
I can't sleep at your place tonight.
I have to go back to my restaurant.

374
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,006
- Can you not go?
- I won't be long.

375
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:34,486
I've closed it for a few days now.
I don't want the customers to complain.

376
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:36,416
- Go in.
- Let's hug first.

377
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,867
- There are so many people here.
- Come on.

378
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,035
Hey.

379
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:47,592
Bye.

380
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,558
Please go in first, Fern. I'll catch up with you.

381
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:57,713
Okay.

382
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:01,653
Guys, you're all here.

383
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,877
Please follow me inside.

384
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:05,139
Okay.

385
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:11,617
Are you a friend of Moo's?

386
00:27:12,686 --> 00:27:15,727
Yes. Is everything alright?

387
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:17,926
What's your name?

388
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:20,400
My name is Kang.

389
00:27:21,498 --> 00:27:23,873
You're very close to Moo, aren't you?

390
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,838
Yes, I am.

391
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:31,886
From now on, please be careful
when you see each other.

392
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:34,846
I'm just afraid people will misunderstand.

393
00:27:34,846 --> 00:27:37,006
I don't want any problems
before the contract signing.

394
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,345
Yos, do you want to take my seat?

395
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:55,531
No, I'll sit here.

396
00:27:57,765 --> 00:27:59,220
He's back.

397
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:05,766
Hi, everyone. Welcome to TTM's New Wave Project.

398
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:07,867
Hi.

399
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:10,691
I was one of the judges who selected you
to be part of this project.

400
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:14,587
Let's give yourselves a big hand
for making it to the training round.

401
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:23,524
Out of the 10 of you here, no one knows
how many of you will get to debut.

402
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:28,731
Do your best.

403
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:31,041
Fern, please tell them about the activities.

404
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,846
Sure.

405
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:37,316
My name is Fern. I'm the producer
of the New Wave Project.

406
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:42,142
Today, we'll have the first test where
your singing and dancing will be graded

407
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:45,806
to find out which areas you need to work on.

408
00:28:45,806 --> 00:28:50,597
There will be a test every week,
and scores will be shown in percentage.

409
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,936
Excuse me.

410
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:56,520
Who will do the grading, the judges or the viewers?

411
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,454
30% of the scores will come from social media
and 70% from the judges.

412
00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:04,395
There won't be any nepotism, right?

413
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,969
We'll show the scores in real time
for everyone to see.

414
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:13,020
Any other questions?

415
00:29:15,446 --> 00:29:18,027
If not, let me explain more about the activities.

416
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:19,698
Moo.

417
00:29:19,698 --> 00:29:22,377
- What?
- Do you know the guy opposite you?

418
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,246
He keeps staring at you.

419
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:28,006
No. I also noticed him looking at me many times.

420
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,695
Did you call me because
you wanted to talk about something?

421
00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:46,633
I've been meaning to ask
what the text on your bag means.

422
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:51,698
Oh, Moo made this for me.

423
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:57,471
I don't know the meaning either.
You have to ask him.

424
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:04,371
Moo is crazy in love, isn't he?
He even made a bag for you.

425
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:08,903
But being crazy in love
is not always a good thing.

426
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:10,852
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

427
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:14,572
What did Moo doo?

428
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:20,508
Auntie Dao asked me to warn him
about posting you on social media.

429
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,024
When he gets more famous,
whatever is on social media might be dug up.

430
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:33,672
No matter how much time passes,
people with bad intentions will target him.

431
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:39,392
I'm afraid that might not be good for all parties.

432
00:30:44,246 --> 00:30:47,987
Yeah. I understand, Shone.

433
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:52,109
Please help me, Kang.

434
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:53,850
You know that Moo is stubborn.

435
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,222
I told him about this yesterday,
but I don't know if he listened.

436
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:02,262
Okay. I'll remind him again.

437
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:04,535
[Vocal class]

438
00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:26,309
[90 Points, A Grade]

439
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:56,400
[60 Points, C Grade]

440
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,482
Now that we've warmed up,
[Acting class]

441
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:00,736
we're going to try the focus walk.
[Acting class]

442
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:03,629
Find your point of focus and walk over there.

443
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:05,367
Go.

444
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:06,594
Eye level.

445
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:08,445
Okay, good. Relax.

446
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,122
And 1, 2,
[Dance class]

447
00:32:13,122 --> 00:32:15,756
3 and 4 and 5 and 6.

448
00:32:15,756 --> 00:32:17,534
Slide, 7, 8.

449
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:20,850
Together everyone. Make it stronger.

450
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,665
5, 6, 7, 8.

451
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,031
Here are everyone's scores.

452
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:46,017
Look. We got the same score.

453
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:47,446
We sure did.

454
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,784
What did you get?

455
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,588
It's alright, Tae.

456
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,552
- Tae.
- Hmm?

457
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:05,878
What's wrong? You don't look
like you're enjoying yourself.

458
00:33:05,878 --> 00:33:07,686
I brought you a drink.

459
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:12,406
Thank you.

460
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:13,933
I got Cs in every area.

461
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:15,725
- What?
- Look.

462
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:17,100
Hey.

463
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:20,806
How come?

464
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:21,985
I don't know.

465
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:23,793
What did you get? Can I see?

466
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:28,641
Wow. Your scores are good.

467
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:32,519
Hey. What's wrong with you?

468
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,246
- What's your problem with my friend?
- Tae.

469
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,269
Calm down. Let me talk to him.

470
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:38,924
What's wrong with you?

471
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:40,893
You also hit me in the acting class.

472
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,403
I didn't hit you.

473
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:45,806
I just wanted to see you up close
if you're the son of Ms. Dao of GP Entertainment.

474
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:48,699
I have bad eyesight.

475
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:50,206
So, it's really you.

476
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:51,524
So what if it is?

477
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:54,452
Nothing. I'm just curious.

478
00:33:54,452 --> 00:33:57,769
Originally, only eight people passed,
but somehow we got two more.

479
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,167
I just wanted to know
what the other two look like.

480
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:03,159
But after seeing them, I get it.

481
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:07,665
Oh, you got an A in singing?

482
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:09,943
- Did your mom tell them to write that for you?
- What the hell is wrong with you?

483
00:34:09,943 --> 00:34:11,718
Hey, stop.

484
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:12,696
Calm down.

485
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:15,582
Think carefully. It's not worth it.

486
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:18,609
I thought you were the real deal.

487
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:20,981
This is the real deal.

488
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:24,480
A, A, and A.

489
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:27,198
What a waste of time.

490
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:32,406
Who does he think he is?
His face gets on my nerves.

491
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:35,539
If he comes at you again, let me know.
I'll fight him for you.

492
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:38,446
Tae, calm down. Don't do it.

493
00:34:38,446 --> 00:34:42,741
And what's wrong with you since this morning?
You've been moody all day.

494
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:48,602
At first, he was the same,
but since classes started, he won't talk to me.

495
00:34:48,602 --> 00:34:50,840
He only talks to Jang.

496
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,047
What are you really mad about?

497
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:54,292
I'm mad that he doesn't talk to me.

498
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,899
I don't think so. I think you're jealous.

499
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,121
Are you crazy?

500
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:04,246
I've been friends with him for so long.
Why would I be jealous?

501
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:07,794
Because you've been friends with him
for so long, you don't realize your feelings.

502
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:09,586
Think carefully.

503
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,435
You feel good when you're with him, don't you?

504
00:35:14,854 --> 00:35:16,384
Yeah.

505
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:19,965
And you feel bad when he talks
to someone else, don't you?

506
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:21,246
Yeah.

507
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:25,102
And you want to be
the only one he's with, don't you?

508
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:29,246
- Don't you?
- Yes.

509
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:32,526
This is clear as day.
Don't you realize your feelings by now?

510
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:34,246
What is clear?

511
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:36,366
I've been friends with him for so long.

512
00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:38,326
I'm just possessive of my friend.

513
00:35:38,326 --> 00:35:40,406
Okay. How about this?

514
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:42,406
If you want to know how you really feel,

515
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,722
try doing with him what friends don't do.

516
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:47,213
Then you'll know.

517
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:51,024
Now stop throwing tantrums already.

518
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:03,768
I'm off.

519
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:10,519
The three of you don't have a house
in Bangkok, right?

520
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,806
No.

521
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:14,441
I asked the team to prepare a room
for you to share,

522
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:18,134
so you don't have to travel back and forth
every day during training.

523
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,476
Oh, I'm staying at my relative's.
It's not that far.

524
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:23,560
Oh, then it's just the two of you.

525
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,829
Great. You're already best friends.

526
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:27,849
It's settled then.

527
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,099
Are you okay with this?

528
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:39,521
Of course.

529
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:42,951
Let's go.

530
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,988
- Hello, Dad.
- Hi, Tae.

531
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:56,955
I won't be home tonight.

532
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,747
The company gave us a room.

533
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:02,244
What company again?

534
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:05,228
I'm an artist trainee, remember?

535
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:08,342
Hey, don't move that box inside.
It's for the supplier.

536
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:11,247
I have to go. I need to oversee the workers.

537
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:17,331
Dad didn't listen to me.

538
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:21,294
He's probably busy.

539
00:37:22,978 --> 00:37:26,744
Yos, you can choose the bed.

540
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:39,246
- I'll take the top bunk.
- Hey.

541
00:37:39,246 --> 00:37:40,695
I don't want you to sleep on the top bunk.

542
00:37:40,695 --> 00:37:44,251
I want you to choose between
the bunk bed and the single bed.

543
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,043
I've never slept on the top bunk.
I want to try.

544
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:48,670
Yos.

545
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,333
Take the bottom bunk so we can talk.

546
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:59,852
♫ What do you want me to do, me to do, baby? ♫

547
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:04,277
♫ What can I do when my heart is falling? ♫

548
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:08,633
Are you really going?

549
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,440
I have to take care of my restaurant too.

550
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:14,885
Can you please stay?

551
00:38:17,314 --> 00:38:19,126
I'll be back in two days.

552
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:21,913
Okay. Bring everything here when you come back.

553
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:27,018
Bring your home and your motorbike,
so you can stay with me for months.

554
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:28,246
Okay.

555
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:29,801
Yay!

556
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:32,030
Let's eat.

557
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:35,620
Kai palo, my favorite.

558
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,726
It's so yummy.

559
00:38:41,726 --> 00:38:43,370
I feel so bad for the others.

560
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,795
We've been tired from dance practice all day,

561
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:49,246
but no one gets to come home and
eat your special kai palo recipe like me.

562
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:53,347
Just one bite and I'm no longer tired.

563
00:38:54,524 --> 00:38:55,687
Stop exaggerating.

564
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:57,425
I'm not.

565
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:59,779
Your kai palo encourages me,

566
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:02,083
keeps me going, and gets me ready
to fight every day.

567
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,564
If you don't believe me, I'll dance for you now.

568
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:06,133
Come on. Let's dance together.

569
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,313
No.

570
00:39:07,313 --> 00:39:08,720
Keep eating.

571
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,167
Come on.

572
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,879
Your dance is so cute.

573
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:14,330
You get a lot of likes. Did you see that?

574
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,802
About that clip, I think you should delete it.

575
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:22,138
Why?

576
00:39:22,138 --> 00:39:23,405
It's cute.

577
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:27,281
Please listen to your mom and Shone.
They mean well.

578
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,539
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

579
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:32,891
People can separate my work from my personal life.

580
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:35,133
But some people can't, Moo.

581
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:36,280
I'm not afraid.

582
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,478
If there's to be drama, I'm ready to face it.

583
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:42,763
As long as you stay by my side
and don't let go of my hand,

584
00:39:42,763 --> 00:39:45,612
I'm ready to fight any drama.

585
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,547
I want you to think again.

586
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:52,382
You should listen to the adults.

587
00:39:52,382 --> 00:39:53,479
I do.

588
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:56,607
But I have my own reasons too.

589
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,429
Trust me. It's just a dance clip.
Nothing will come of it.

590
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:03,857
Stop talking about this.

591
00:40:03,857 --> 00:40:06,949
Let me eat my delicious kai palo in peace.

592
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:08,522
Do you want a drink? I'll get it for you.

593
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:10,461
No, I'll get it myself.

594
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:22,451
Kang, before you go, I want you to do something.

595
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:24,412
Get up.

596
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:25,829
Fine.

597
00:40:27,246 --> 00:40:28,628
Hold your nose.

598
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:30,969
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

599
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,246
Hold your nose and slowly drink this.

600
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:37,597
I'll tell you why I'm doing this later.

601
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:46,123
What are you doing?

602
00:40:46,123 --> 00:40:47,926
Normally, when we drink water,

603
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:50,570
air will replace the water
that comes out of the bottle.

604
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,596
When you held your nose earlier,
you were breathing through your mouth.

605
00:40:53,596 --> 00:40:56,920
It means your breath got in here.

606
00:41:04,278 --> 00:41:05,696
This is so refreshing.

607
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:10,109
Even though you won't be here,
your breath is already in my body.

608
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:12,629
Consider this a tea with breath.

609
00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:16,231
It'll help me miss you a little less.

610
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:27,536
Hey, Moo.

611
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:31,096
This one is good,
but move this one a bit to the left.

612
00:41:31,096 --> 00:41:32,508
Okay.

613
00:41:32,508 --> 00:41:36,208
Bro, stop everything you're doing.

614
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,230
What's going on?

615
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,101
Why did you tell Kang about removing the clip?

616
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:54,810
You made him worry, you know?

617
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:58,431
Listen, Moo.

618
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:02,659
Everyone else is worried. Only you feel nothing.

619
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:07,534
What's there to worry about?
What are you guys so afraid of?

620
00:42:09,464 --> 00:42:14,390
Auntie Dao and I don't want you
to face any problems in the future.

621
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:20,164
What you're doing is going to ruin your dream.
Do you understand?

622
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:22,960
But I think it's all in your and Mom's head.

623
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,052
Think from another perspective.

624
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:29,366
If I lie that I'm not dating anyone
and one day people find out,

625
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:31,119
that'll be even worse.

626
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,882
That's not being honest with other people,
my boyfriend, and everything.

627
00:42:39,618 --> 00:42:41,674
Listen, Moo.

628
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:45,473
No one is asking you to lie. Don't get it wrong.

629
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:48,887
Just don't go around announcing it
like you've been doing.

630
00:42:49,928 --> 00:42:51,903
It's the same thing.

631
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:57,383
Not talking about it and not acknowledging it
is the same as lying.

632
00:42:57,383 --> 00:43:01,889
My posting that clip wasn't even announcing it.

633
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:03,829
I just posted it because I wanted to.

634
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:06,389
It's a cute clip of us.

635
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:09,346
We love each other. That's all.

636
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,940
Okay.

637
00:43:15,353 --> 00:43:18,054
I don't know what to say to you anymore.

638
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:21,268
I'm doing this because I'm worried about you.

639
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,341
Don't get me wrong, okay?

640
00:43:24,341 --> 00:43:28,716
Just don't go around announcing it.

641
00:43:28,716 --> 00:43:30,139
I beg you.

642
00:43:36,477 --> 00:43:40,332
No one is asking you to lie. Don't get it wrong.

643
00:43:40,332 --> 00:43:43,627
Just don't go around announcing it
like you've been doing.

644
00:43:43,627 --> 00:43:45,198
Announce it?

645
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:50,249
[Video uploaded]
This is how to announce it.

646
00:43:55,861 --> 00:43:57,990
You're back.

647
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:02,069
How was your first night? Spill.

648
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:04,490
Nothing you think happened. Go home and sleep.

649
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,808
Off you go.

650
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:10,127
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

651
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:13,114
There's someone I want to introduce.

652
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:16,638
I met him when I went to a rice and curry shop
to buy a toothbrush.

653
00:44:16,638 --> 00:44:19,089
He's the kindest guy in the world.

654
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,662
The cutest guy in my heart.

655
00:44:20,662 --> 00:44:24,805
Ever since I've known him,
he's made me smile and laugh nonstop.

656
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:29,065
He's my special someone. He's my Kang.

657
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:52,321
What's up, Kang?

658
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:53,958
Why did you dismiss my calls?

659
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,619
Calm down.

660
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,886
You called me because you like it, right?

661
00:44:57,886 --> 00:44:59,966
I told you to delete the clip.
Why did you post a new one?

662
00:44:59,966 --> 00:45:04,907
I wanted to proudly present to the world
that you're my boyfriend.

663
00:45:08,127 --> 00:45:11,057
Do you like it? Can you tell me and make me happy?

664
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:15,550
If you're too shy to say it on the call,
come and whisper it in my ear.

665
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,360
I miss you. I want to see you so badly.

666
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,564
Please.

667
00:45:23,245 --> 00:45:24,441
Give me a second.

668
00:45:28,637 --> 00:45:29,980
Listen, Kang.

669
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:33,948
Listen, people of Bangkok.

670
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:36,096
I love Kang!

671
00:45:36,096 --> 00:45:39,223
Do you hear me? I love Kang!

672
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:47,366
Do you hear me? I love Kang!

673
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:50,465
I love Kang!

674
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:07,032
Before I can become an artist,
of course, I have to face an obstacle.

675
00:46:07,032 --> 00:46:11,517
Romantic relationships are strictly prohibited
while you're under this contract.

676
00:46:11,517 --> 00:46:14,366
But I'll get through it because I have Kang.

677
00:46:14,366 --> 00:46:17,639
You're only a few steps away from
reaching the summit of your Everest.

678
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:19,721
Whose boyfriend are you? You're so cute.

679
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:22,597
Your boyfriend. Yours only.

680
00:46:22,597 --> 00:46:24,500
We'll get through this together.

681
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,607
My story is going well,
but my friend's story, not so much.

682
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:28,786
You're already seeing someone?

683
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,012
No.

684
00:46:30,981 --> 00:46:33,933
Will I get to debut? Root for me.
