Here's a friendly warning.

6
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:23,423
If you keep spending your time helping me
instead of getting enough sleep,

7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,943
your academics are going to suffer.

8
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:27,060
Moo!

9
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:30,883
Moo!

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,000
Peekaboo, Kang.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,366
Why didn't you tell me you're sick?

12
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:38,804
Force yourself a bit.

13
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,798
Eat this so can you take your medicine afterward.

14
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:47,276
Then what's wrong with you?

15
00:00:48,218 --> 00:00:53,592
I like you and I know you like me too.

16
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,357
- No.
- Means yes.

17
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:58,134
What are you talking about? What are you on about?

18
00:00:58,134 --> 00:00:59,857
The truth.

19
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,601
[One day earlier]

20
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,931
Hey. I need to ask you something.

21
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:10,066
What?

22
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,318
Is Kang seeing someone?

23
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:13,232
- Really?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,747
- Kang? Seeing someone?
- Yes.

25
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:19,487
Today, my friend came into
the classroom and said to Kang,

26
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:21,409
"I saw your partner waiting at the food stall."

27
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,376
I tried to follow Kang, but he wouldn't let me.

28
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:25,534
Don't follow me.

29
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:26,577
Hey, Mok.

30
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:27,800
Can I go to the restroom first?

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,989
No. The class is about to start.

32
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,901
And the teacher made me stay in class.

33
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:36,810
What's wrong?

34
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,000
- The one who went to see Kang...
- Yeah?

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,426
That was me.

36
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:44,977
So you and Kang are together?

37
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,533
I...

38
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,740
am not.

39
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,165
Kang and I have been close since we were kids.

40
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:00,455
What a way to break your sentence.

41
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,937
We're close friends. We're always together.

42
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:07,320
Many people ship us.

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,754
Why do you ask?

44
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:14,401
Is it because...

45
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,671
Is it because...

46
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:17,433
Yes.

47
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:20,256
- I like Kang.
- I knew it.

48
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:21,839
Huh? How did you know?

49
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,578
I'm not dumb.

50
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,462
I could tell from Mars.

51
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,851
But why do you like him?

52
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:30,953
You're the first one.

53
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:32,461
- The first one?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,574
Why?

55
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:37,709
Kang is nice, kind,

56
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,001
and cute.

57
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:42,906
I thought he'd have a lot of admirers.

58
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:45,297
Sure. Kang is the best.

59
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,929
He's only the best at being sharp-tongued.

60
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,594
He goes around taking a jab at people.

61
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:51,760
Some people don't get him.

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,857
I can see it,

63
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,752
but I still like him anyway.

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,577
What should I do, Neth?

65
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:05,145
I think Kang is a closed-off person.

66
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:08,445
He always does the opposite of what he says.

67
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:12,977
If you can tolerate his sharp tongue,
he'll come around eventually.

68
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,121
Trust me.

69
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:16,301
Okay.

70
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:21,456
Neth told me if you say no, you mean yes.

71
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:24,588
If you tell me to go far away,
you actually want me near.

72
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:26,410
Don't take your own side.

73
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,085
I'm not.

74
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,047
If you think so, can I be by your side instead?

75
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,498
No, I don't have feelings for you.

76
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:35,861
Then I'll flirt with you until you fall for me.

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,340
Kang,

78
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,885
can I hit on you?

79
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:49,280
Moo, listen carefully.
You don't actually have feelings for me.

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,823
You're just lonely because you're here alone.

81
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:54,351
Do you understand now?

82
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,103
I understand my feelings well.

83
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,736
I like you because you're kind to me.

you're good to me.

86
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,682
I like you because you make my heart flutter.

87
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:14,092
I like you so much.

88
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:15,880
How are you going to take responsibility?

89
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,022
I can only take responsibility for your sickness.
I don't care about anything else.

90
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:21,596
Since you're talking this much,
you must feel better already.

91
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:24,285
Go to sleep. You might not feel this way tomorrow.

92
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:25,500
I'm leaving.

Since when is he close to Moo?
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

95
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,934
He's only been close with you and no one else.

96

Well,

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,074
since Moo first moved here.

98

Really?

102

He's only being nice and kind, right?

103
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:28,936
Yes.

104
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:32,800
If you don't believe me, ask Kang yourself.

105
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,243
Alright.

106
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,562
Let me make you fried rice

Let me wash that. What did you make?

110
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,110
I made fried rice for Neth.

111
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,243
She stopped by for food earlier.

112
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:59,880
You should charge her next time.
She's always getting away with free food.

Neth has money.
You don't have to be so kind to her.

114

I'm sick of not feeling right.
I'd rather be your Mr. Right.

But I guess I'm sick. Sick of being without you.

132
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,077
When I'm physically sick, I go to a doctor.

00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,046
She's doing the right thing.

183
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:56,681
She gave you money for the whole month,

184
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,441
but you spent it all in one day.

185
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,055
I spent money on what's necessary.

186
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:02,557
Necessary?

187
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:05,932
You just can't use a bicycle that
costs only one or two thousand baht

188
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,880
because it's not cool.

189
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,960
Unbelievable.

190
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,811
If you're here to scold me, leave. Leave.

191
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,911
Fine. I'm leaving.

192
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:16,905
I was going to take you out on a nice meal.

193
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:18,861
I guess we're not going anymore.

194
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,633
My big brother Shone, I'm sorry.

195
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:25,402
I'm a teenager with mood swings.

196
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:27,202
Please don't hold it against this little kid.

197
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:30,056
You troublemaker!

198
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,491
Let me hug you.

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,561
Hey!

200
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:39,714
Where did they go? They were just here!

201
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:40,696
Really?

202
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:43,171
Yes. Don't you believe me?

203
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:47,915
What does the guy who was
fighting with Moo look like?

204
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,220
He looks very good and classy.

205
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,400
Really?

206
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,049
From the look of it, there was
something between them in Bangkok

207
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,884
and now that Moo moved here,
he came to win him back.

208
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,718
I think you watch too many dramas.

209
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:04,844
What?

210
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,697
Don't you want to know who that guy is?

211
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:11,846
- Do you want me to find out for you?
- No.

212
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:12,970
What?

213
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:14,880
Kang!

214
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,675
Don't you want to know? I want to know!

215
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:25,145
Go ahead. Enjoy it.

216
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:29,000
By the way, Moo,

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,758
you said you only had
100-something baht left last week.

218
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:36,288
How did you survive until now?

219
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:41,877
I almost didn't, but destiny led me to my savior.

220
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,767
Divine.

221
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,429
How?

222
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:48,415
It's the guy who sells food at my school.

223
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:51,422
He feels sorry for me
that I don't have money to buy food,

224
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:54,857
so he gives me free food but he's so strict.

225
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,258
The stricter he is, the cuter he gets though.
So cute.

226
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,978
You've only been here for a while,
but you've fallen in love already.

227
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,542
And with someone older, no less.

228
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:06,059
Do you have his photos?

229
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,380
Photos?

230
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:10,600
Photos, hmm?

231
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,755
I have some, but I won't show you.

232
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,857
You're getting on my nerves,

233
00:13:16,857 --> 00:13:21,280
so I'll keep what I was going to say to myself.

234
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,129
Come on, bro. Tell me,
then I'll show you the photos.

235
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:25,427
Please?

236
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,697
Do you still dance?

237
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:34,020
I do, but I'm not going to audition anymore.

238
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,060
I don't want Mom to scold me,
so I'm going to study for the GAT/PAT exams first.

239
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:39,969
Good.

240
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:41,849
You should focus on your studies first

241
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:45,553
because what I'm going to tell you
might distract you.

242
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,000
TTM is launching a project to find
young talent to debut as T-pop idols.

243
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,077
Really? Why is it happening so early this year?

244
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:56,167
If you're not ready this year,
you don't have to go.

245
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,253
It's better to focus on your studies first.

246
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:01,510
Now that I've told you that,
what does your boyfriend look like?

247
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,875
Show me.

248
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,142
He's not my boyfriend yet.

249
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm flirting with him, but he wouldn't flirt back.

250
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,640
How do you hit on people?

251
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,774
Me?

252
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:15,408
I take care of them.

253
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:19,586
If I come to a restaurant,
I peel prawns for my crush.

254
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,230
It'd definitely work.

255
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:25,665
Trust me.

256
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,941
- Let me.
- That's so heartwarming.

257
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:36,805
Hi.

258
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:37,805
Hi guys.

259
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,513
You can try on your outfits.

260
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,045
- These are XL for you.
- Okay.

261
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,089
- And these are I for you.
- Thank you.

262
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,477
The fitting room is inside.

263
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:49,358
Try on the shirts first
and let me know if they fit.

264
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:50,610
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

265
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,845
Thank you.

266
00:14:57,316 --> 00:15:00,000
You can go in first.
Shout to let me know if they fit.

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,319
No.

268
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:02,849
Let's go in together. Don't waste time.

269
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:03,975
Huh?

270
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:10,933
The room is small.

271
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:13,632
I told you. I'll wait outside.

272
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,888
Let's change together.
When you're done, you can help me.

273
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,554
Go ahead.

274
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:22,157
Okay.

275
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:30,703
- Let me help.
- Hey.

276
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:33,466
- What are you playing?
- Nothing. I'm helping you.

277
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,089
Hurry and put that on.

278
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,781
I'm going to take off my shirt too.

279
00:15:56,682 --> 00:15:59,182
Why did you turn away from me? Huh?

280
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:03,488
Just wear it like this.

281
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,507
This shirt is good.

282
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:13,877
If we get this shirt,
I'm sure we'll pass the audition.

283
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,369
Let me see your shirt.

284
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:26,008
Whoa...

285
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:27,008
Yos.

286
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:29,720
- What?
- Why did you button your shirt like that?

287
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,564
You did it wrong. Come on.

288
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,925
Let me fix it.

289
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:37,366
Wow. I have to redo everything.

290
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:44,331
♫ You show you care, who could bear it? ♫

291
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,281
♫ Don't joke with my heart, can't stand it ♫

292
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:48,506
♫ You make me daydream, you know it? ♫

293
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:51,115
♫ I keep my feelings inside ♫

294
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:55,195
♫ Thinking of saying it but I hide ♫

295
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,391
Stop it, Tae.

296
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,683
I can button my own shirt.

297
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,090
- Hurry up and follow me when you're done.
- Okay.

298
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:14,340
Excuse me, are you Tae's friend?

299
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,502
Yes.

300
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,792
Hi, Oei.

301
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,354
Just in time. What do you think of my outfit?

302
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:23,390
This is Earng Oei.

303
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,238
I asked her to take a look at our outfits.

304
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,642
This is Payos, my best buddy.

305
00:17:28,642 --> 00:17:30,211
Hi.

306
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:33,429
Your outfit looks great.
What are you going to wear it for?

307
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,545
I think I'll wear this for my audition.

308
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:38,402
With this outfit, I'll certainly pass.

309
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:41,296
Just need some alterations.
It should be ready tomorrow.

310
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:43,960
So we can go to the movies today, right?

311
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,104
Yes.

312
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:50,307
I'm going to change back. See you.

313
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:01,245
Thanks for the treat

314
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:03,280
and this 1 kilo trick.

315
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,282
Yeah.

316
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,180
I'm going now. Thank you.

317
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,020
Hold on.

318
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:22,340
Here you go.

319
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,639
Wow. 20?

320
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,014
Just kidding.

321
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,928
Look at that face.

322
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:29,502
Spend it wisely.

323
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:33,926
Thank you.

324
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,120
He gave him money.

325
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,643
Thank you, bro.

326
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:41,220
Stop calling me bro.

327
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:44,549
Call me Master.

328
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:47,532
Of course, Master. Let me open the door for you.

329
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:50,818
Here.

330
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,529
- See you.
- Okay.

331
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:57,279
- Safe trip.
- Thanks.

332
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,898
Moo was buttering him up like this
and he gave him money.

333
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:05,344
Looks like his sugar daddy wants him back.

334
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,900
Forgive me for sticking my nose in,
but you're my friend.

335
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,412
I don't want you to feel hurt by finding out later.

336
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:16,441
Why would I feel hurt?
He and I are nothing to each other.

337
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,414
I know you're just being stubborn.

338
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:20,166
Hey, Kang.

339
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,406
There you are.

340
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:25,892
Ask him where he went and who was with him.
Is that guy his friend with benefits?

341
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:28,679
Neth, your face is twitching.

342
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:29,918
Are you okay?

343
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:34,378
I'm fine. Nothing is wrong with me.

344
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:36,378
Kang wants to ask you something.

345
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:38,000
Ask him what you want to know, Kang.

346
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,126
Ask him.

347
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:42,321
I wanted to ask if you're fully recovered.

348
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:46,573
I saw you walking around.
You must be fully recovered.

349
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:49,027
Kang, do you know you sound a bit angry?

350
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:50,410
It's my normal voice.

351
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,079
Who was that guy who came to see you?
Where did you guys go?

352
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,510
- Kang wants to know.
- Neth!

353
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,336
I don't want to know.

354
00:19:57,336 --> 00:20:00,213
Even though you don't want to know,
I want to tell you.

355
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:01,086
Wait up!

356
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:03,086
Yes! This boy is a fighter!

357
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:06,257
Go, Moo! I'm rooting for you!

358
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:08,874
I got you some prawns.

359
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,165
Let me peel them for you.

360
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:18,524
Don't be sad, single people,
that you don't have anyone to peel prawns for you.

361
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:22,432
Who are you talking to?

362
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:28,281
Nature.

363
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:30,284
I've been crazy lately.

364
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:31,636
Crazy in love with you.

365
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:37,120
Aren't you curious about what Neth asked?
About who I was with?

366
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,211
Where and who you're going with is your business.

367
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:42,445
But I want you to know who I was with.

368
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:45,654
I was with my cousin. I'm very close with him.

369
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:49,477
Mom noticed that I've been quiet,
so she sent him to check on me.

370
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:51,874
When he came, he took me out for a meal.

371
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:53,102
That's it.

372
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:54,108
Really?

373
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,880
When I was eating, the food was good, you know?

374
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,068
So I thought about you.
I wanted you to have yummy food too.

375
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,023
What?

376
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,067
It's this small?

377
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,830
Stop. You're wasting it. Let me do the peeling.

378
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,873
Here you go.

379
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:22,390
Whoa. You peeled it all by yourself.

380
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,420
I didn't get to do it for you at all.

381
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,648
If I let you, I'd only get to eat the shell.

382
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:29,978
Hold on.

383
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:34,050
Let me take care of you for a change.

384
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,587
- I can do it myself.
- Please, Kang?

385
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:39,360
I'll take that as a yes.

386
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,551
Come on.

387
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:45,494
Let me wipe your hands.

388
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:51,800
About what you asked me to think about yesterday,

389
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,556
I already thought it over,
both while asleep and awake.

390
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,338
I still feel the same.

391
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:05,736
That means I really like you.

392
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:12,974
I've been acting goofy because...

393
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:18,402
I really want to win your heart.

394
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:40,606
Your hands smell good now.
They no longer smell of prawns.

395
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:46,452
You don't have to do that much.

396
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:49,209
Are you shy with me?

397
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:50,490
Are you shy with me?

398
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,754
I'm not shy.

399
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,977
You can't be trusted with cleanliness.

400
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:56,782
I better wash my hands.

401
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:17,345
Did that work?

402
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:18,976
I don't think so.

403
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,069
Ugh! It's the head!

404
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:35,499
What's up?

405
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:40,635
Bro, how many months and days do you think
it'll take for someone to agree to date you?

406
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,154
What are you talking about?
Who told you to be crazy in love?

407
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:48,754
Didn't any tricks I gave you work at all?

408
00:23:48,754 --> 00:23:51,847
I don't know. He gave me no reaction.

409
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,278
I'm going to explode.

410
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:54,849
Help me, bro.

411
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,930
Bro, are you there?

412
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:03,375
Listen.

413
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,722
It's only been a day.

414
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:08,744
This kind of thing requires consistency.

415
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:11,497
Keep doing it and showing him every day.

416
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:16,093
If it were me, I love taking photos,
so I'd give him beautiful photos.

417
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:18,016
Send him videos.

418
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:23,311
Whatever you're good at, use that to impress him.

419
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:24,647
Trust me.

420
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:25,878
Ah.

421
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:27,251
Okay, bro. I have an idea now.

422
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:29,862
Thank you so much.
Bye. I won't keep you any longer.

423
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:32,494
Oh?

424
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:41,941
- Peekaboo.
- Shit.

425
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:48,486
I love you. My love is true.

426
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,251
Don't be mad, boo.

427
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:53,772
I love you for real. It's what my heart tells me.

428
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:57,510
My dear Kang, please have mercy.

429
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,711
Damn.

430
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:00,561
Are you a poet now?

431
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,656
Go away. I need to sell food.

432
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:03,995
Come on.

433
00:25:03,995 --> 00:25:05,915
Why the sarcasm, my boo?

434
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:10,187
What did you just call me?

435
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:12,404
- My boo.
- Don't call me boo.

436
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:17,994
My boo.

437
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,252
Stop it!

438
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:20,985
Don't call me that.

439
00:25:20,985 --> 00:25:23,571
I just called you my boo.
Why do you have to be so angry?

440
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:25,097
Everyone can hear you.

441
00:25:25,097 --> 00:25:26,752
Don't give them the wrong idea.

442
00:25:26,752 --> 00:25:29,774
Shut up or I'll pinch your mouth!

443
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:31,935
Okay,

444
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:32,976
my boo.

445
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:34,138
Shit.

446
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:38,598
I won't sell to anyone who laughs.

447
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:47,398
♫ I know if I call you boo ♫

448
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:52,497
♫ You'll probably kick me ♫

449
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:53,539
No.

450
00:25:56,095 --> 00:26:02,398
♫ I know if I call you boo ♫

451
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:03,839
Don't call me that.

452
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,053
♫ I know you don't like... ♫

453
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:09,689
♫ if I call you my boo ♫

454
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:13,019
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

455
00:26:25,863 --> 00:26:27,159
You go first. I'll watch your back.

456
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:29,648
No, you go first. I'll watch your back.

457
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:31,630
That's Tae and Payos.

458
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,271
Where are they going?

459
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:36,661
Hey, the three of you! What are you doing?

460
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,905
Shit. The director is here.

461
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:39,899
Are you watching porn?

462
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:42,453
What are they doing?

463
00:26:42,453 --> 00:26:43,731
- Go.
- You go.

464
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:44,938
I'll watch your back.

465
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,176
You're Tank. Why aren't you in the front?

466
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:53,095
- You go.
- You go first.

467
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:54,760
What are you guys doing? Skipping school?

468
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,815
Mind your own business.

469
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:58,099
I would, but the director is nearby.

470
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:00,477
Come on, Tae. We don't want to be late
for the audition. We need to get the outfits too.

471
00:27:00,477 --> 00:27:02,786
- Fine.
- Are you going to audition?

472
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:03,865
Yes.

473
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:06,980
Someone already saw our talent.
We don't need you.

474
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,980
Go.

475
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:14,249
Shit! It's Somkhuan!

476
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:16,351
You guys go. And pass that audition.

477
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:17,666
Hurry, Tae!

478
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,787
What are you guys doing? Stop!

479
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:21,761
- Hurry and follow me, Tae!
- Okay!

480
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:22,995
I'm coming!

481
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:27,858
- Hi, Director.
- Hi.

482
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:29,416
Stay here, Mok.

483
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,710
Were you going to skip school?

484
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,242
- People skipped school?
- Yes.

485
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:33,313
Let me help you find them.

486
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:35,135
You're so kind to the school.

487
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:37,208
Who were those two?

488
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:40,056
- I didn't see anyone.
- Let's talk in my office.

489
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:48,385
This punishment is probably the only way
you can learn to improve yourself.

490
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:50,577
Solve the math problems.

491
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,058
You must get all answers correct.

492
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:55,180
If you don't finish them or get them right,
you can't go anywhere.

493
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,327
Stay with me all day. I'm free today.

494
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:08,825
One kind of poison comes in the form of
math practice questions for the PAT1 Exam.

495
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:18,403
- Director.
- Hmm?

496
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:20,248
I haven't had lunch.

497
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:22,248
I'm feeling low on energy.

498
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:24,927
I have a headache. My brain is not functioning.

499
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:26,637
May I go get something to eat first?

500
00:28:26,637 --> 00:28:27,965
Goodbye.

501
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:31,463
You may not.

502
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:33,401
Oh.

503
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:37,724
But if you don't allow me to eat
and I get an ulcer,

504
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:42,224
you'll be guilty of unreasonable hurting
and punishment.

505
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:49,389
Aren't you a smart boy?

506
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:52,659
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

507
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:53,822
Okay.

508
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:56,411
How are we doing?

509
00:28:56,411 --> 00:29:00,033
It's been 20 minutes and you still haven't
done anything besides spinning your pencil.

510
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:03,781
Uh... Okay, I'll use the pencil.

511
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:06,857
Please come in.

512
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:10,049
- Your food has arrived.
- Thank you.

513
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,501
Hey, Kang.

514
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,924
Oh, hey. Why are you here?

515
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:16,160
What did you do?

516
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:18,837
What could it be?

517
00:29:18,837 --> 00:29:21,042
He helped his friends skip school

518
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:25,732
and when he got caught, he refused
to give me any useful information.

519
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:28,087
That's why he's getting punished here.

520
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:29,736
Bring the other plate here.

521
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:30,842
Sure.

522
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:33,132
I ordered food for you.

523
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:35,095
Now you can eat and do this at the same time.

524
00:29:35,095 --> 00:29:37,967
If you don't finish it,
we'll stay here for a long time.

525
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:43,610
Help me! Help me, Kang!

526
00:29:45,176 --> 00:29:47,514
- Please excuse me then, Director.
- Okay.

527
00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:49,023
- Put it on my tab as usual.
- Of course.

528
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:51,095
- As usual, right?
- Yeah.

529
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,814
Come help me, Kang!

530
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,518
- Keep working.
- Yes, Director.

531
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,410
- Your food has arrived. Eat it.
- Okay.

532
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,098
Or do I have to feed you?

533
00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:16,585
I can feed myself.

534
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:19,250
- I can eat here, right?
- Yeah.

535
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,460
I'm going to finish this and eat at the same time.

536
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,658
- I'm so happy.
- The happiest in the world.

537
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:24,784
Exactly.

538
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,684
Yeah.

539
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:30,776
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

540
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:31,937
Kang.

541
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:33,706
I'm here.

542
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,429
Did you finish the math practice questions?

543
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:38,095
The director wouldn't have let me leave otherwise.

544
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:39,781
He's so cruel.

545
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:40,953
I almost died.

546
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:43,834
If it wasn't for your kai palo, I would be dead.

547
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:46,377
It's so yummy. I could eat it every day.

548
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,378
You can try other places. I won't be mad.

549
00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:51,035
I don't want to.

550
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:53,728
By the way, I want you to listen to something.

551
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,274
I finished writing it just now.

552
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:58,138
If it's another one of your crazy poems,
I don't want it.

553
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:04,171
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

554
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:09,095
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

555
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:11,944
♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

556
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:14,383
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

557
00:31:14,383 --> 00:31:17,595
♫ I want to call you boo ♫

558
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:25,175
♫ But only your name now should do ♫

559
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:37,790
You're stunned, aren't you?

560
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:43,254
That's the bell. Go to class.

561
00:31:43,254 --> 00:31:44,669
No, I'm vibing right now.

562
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,251
Mok!

563
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:47,888
What are you still doing here?

564
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,138
Eating. I was hungry after...

565
00:31:51,138 --> 00:31:52,791
Time's up. Go to class.

566
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:55,641
If I catch you skipping classes, I'll make you
recite the periodic table until school is over.

567
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:57,536
- Yes, sir.
- You won't get to go home this evening.

568
00:31:57,536 --> 00:31:59,191
Hey, where are you going?

569
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:02,721
Go now or you'll get punished again.

570
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,585
Hey! Why are you so fast?

571
00:32:05,585 --> 00:32:07,413
You don't know what this former Nakhon Pathom
representative is capable of!

572
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:09,813
We shouldn't have let Moo help us.

573
00:32:09,813 --> 00:32:11,491
I'm sure he wants us to owe him.

574
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:12,779
You're too prejudiced.

575
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,674
I think he wants to help us.

576
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,495
Excuse me.

577
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:19,900
Oh, you're here to pick up your outfits.

578
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,670
This is L for you.

579
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,056
Thank you.

580
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:26,446
What about mine?

581
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:30,247
Your girlfriend has already
picked up the XL size for you.

582
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:33,318
- My girlfriend?
- There, in front of the shop.

583
00:32:43,181 --> 00:32:45,426
Hey, please don't.

584
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:47,177
I beg you.

585
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:50,691
Hey!

586
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:53,278
That's my outfit!

587
00:33:03,087 --> 00:33:07,653
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

588
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:12,776
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

589
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:15,454
♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

590
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:17,709
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

591
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,983
♫ I want to call you boo ♫

592
00:33:24,908 --> 00:33:28,513
♫ but only your name now should do ♫

593
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:47,962
Damn it.

594
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,012
Hi, Mom. Do you need anything?
I'm in the middle of something.

595
00:33:58,214 --> 00:33:59,198
What?

596
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:01,571
I'm heading there right now.

597
00:34:13,976 --> 00:34:17,655
Tae, you should wear my outfit to the audition.

598
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,990
No.

599
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,517
It's not your fault.

600
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:25,650
It's my fault for being a jerk to them.

601
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:28,528
I have to accept it.

602
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:30,198
I'm not going.

603
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:33,618
What? But you've dreamt about this all your life.

604
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:36,280
I don't want to become an idol as much as you.

605
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,837
I'm happy with dancing just for fun.

606
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,665
Even if I pass the audition, I don't know
if I'm ready to dedicate my whole life to dancing.

607
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:48,290
What are you talking about?

608
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:52,220
I've always thought...

609
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:56,051
this was your dream too.

610
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:03,212
This is not the time to talk about it. Just go.

611
00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:04,677
Don't miss your opportunity.

612
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:08,102
Take it.

613
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:29,037
- Mom.
- Kang.

614
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:31,027
How are you feeling? Does it hurt a lot?

615
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:34,816
How did you fall? What did the doctor say?
How did you get here?

616
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:37,824
Come on. Leave some time for me to answer.

617
00:35:37,824 --> 00:35:40,356
I'm really fine now. Don't worry.

618
00:35:40,356 --> 00:35:42,725
You carried something heavy again, didn't you?

619
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:45,190
How many times have I told you
not to force yourself?

620
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,992
Who brought you to the hospital?

621
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:08,548
Come. Check out my hot food.

622
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:10,359
It's the two of you for today?

623
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:12,485
The food is almost out.
How many boxes would you like?

624
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:13,653
- Two?
- That's enough.

625
00:36:13,653 --> 00:36:15,615
This is enough? Alright.

626
00:36:15,615 --> 00:36:17,617
Young man, come.

627
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:19,899
What would you like?
A meal box or something else?

628
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:21,363
No, thank you.

629
00:36:21,363 --> 00:36:23,242
What event is this?

630
00:36:23,242 --> 00:36:25,483
Oh, it's a merit-making event and food giveaway.

631
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,849
Take this. You can share it with your mom.

632
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:30,573
No, it's okay. I'm just here
to take photos for my job.

633
00:36:30,573 --> 00:36:33,548
This is delicious. You have to try it.

634
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:35,019
Take it. Do you want some more?

635
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:36,773
No, this is enough. Thank you so much.

636
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:38,217
You're welcome.

637
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:40,615
Ouch!

638
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,136
Auntie, are you alright?

639
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,454
Slowly.

640
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:48,968
- Ouch!
- Slowly.

641
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:50,749
What's wrong with me?

642
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:57,713
There he is.

643
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:06,119
Hi.

644
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,725
These are your painkiller
and muscle relaxant, Auntie.

645
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:11,518
I've put the receipt in here.

646
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:12,560
Okay.

647
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,194
Thank you.

648
00:37:14,194 --> 00:37:16,019
Thank you for helping my mom.

649
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:18,039
No worries. It's my pleasure.

650
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:20,411
Please excuse me.

651
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:21,271
Alright.

652
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:22,996
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

653
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,927
He's so kind.

654
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:31,338
- Mom, wait here. I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

655
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:33,238
- Just a moment. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

656
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:34,473
Hurry back.

657
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:40,313
Excuse me.

658
00:37:40,994 --> 00:37:42,269
Yes?

659
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,056
I really want to return the favor
for helping my mom.

660
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,179
Just saying thank you probably won't be enough.

661
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:53,492
Don't worry about it. It's my pleasure.

662
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:56,453
Please take this.

663
00:37:56,453 --> 00:37:58,299
Oh, it's the wrong side.

664
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:01,133
Thank you.

665
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:05,933
One free meal at Mommy Kai Rice & Curry
near Maneneth Dormitory.

666
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,282
You must come.

667
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:10,011
Mom and I really want to return the favor.

668
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:13,482
Okay. I'll be there.

669
00:38:14,237 --> 00:38:15,911
My name is Kang.

670
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,812
I'm Shone.

671
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:19,508
We know each other now.

672
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:24,188
Please keep your word, Mr. Shone.
You said you'll come to eat at our place.

673
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:28,077
Of course, but can I ask for one thing?

674
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:31,053
You don't have to call me Mr.
Just call me Shone.

675
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:35,845
Alright, Shone. I'll see you then.

676
00:38:35,845 --> 00:38:37,233
Okay. See you.

677
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,773
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

678
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:41,077
I should go.

679
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:42,257
Okay.

680
00:38:42,257 --> 00:38:44,154
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

681
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:03,430
Hey.

682
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:06,586
Aren't you supposed to be outside school?

683
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:08,994
I'm back to get the assignments for Tae.

684
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:10,693
He went to the audition.

685
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:11,566
Huh?

686
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:14,133
Why didn't you both go?

687
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:15,911
There's a little problem

688
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:18,573
and I didn't want to hold him back,
so I made him go alone.

689
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:20,172
What?

690
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:24,066
I helped both of you skip school
and even got punished by the director.

691
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:25,252
Yeah.

692
00:39:25,252 --> 00:39:29,126
I'm confused why you helped us escape from him.

693
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:31,817
If you guys skipped school for something else,
I wouldn't want to help.

694
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:34,919
But you guys were going to audition
and follow your dream.

695
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:36,653
That's why I want to help.

696
00:39:36,653 --> 00:39:38,093
I know how you guys feel.

697
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:40,206
Thank you so much.

698
00:39:40,206 --> 00:39:43,653
The next time you want to film a dance clip,
you can ask us to join.

699
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:45,373
Or I can take it for you.

700
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:47,573
I saw your clip. It's so cool.

701
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:49,758
Sure. Thank you so much.

702
00:39:49,758 --> 00:39:53,112
By the way, did Potae pass the audition?

703
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:54,305
No idea.

704
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:56,213
I'm still waiting for him.

705
00:39:56,213 --> 00:39:58,793
Thank you so much, friend.

706
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:00,952
[Friend]

707
00:40:01,889 --> 00:40:05,927
[I have a friend now!]

708
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:08,742
No worries, friend.

709
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:31,893
Moo.

710
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:33,525
What are you doing?

711
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,468
Kang you're back.

712
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,919
How's your mom?

713
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,163
She's okay now.

714
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:42,395
How did you know?

715
00:40:43,111 --> 00:40:46,801
I came to see you after school,
but I didn't see you.

716
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:49,592
I saw the kai palo tray on the floor,
so I asked the stall next door what happened.

717
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:53,403
They said you were so shocked to
hear your mom was in the hospital

718
00:40:53,403 --> 00:40:55,145
that you just left it and hurried off.

719
00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:56,833
I didn't know how to help you,

720
00:40:56,833 --> 00:41:00,055
so I cleaned up and was going to follow you there.

721
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:01,093
Are you done?

722
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:02,831
It's okay. I'm almost done.

723
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:04,936
I'm already messy. Don't get yourself messy too.

724
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:07,196
I already mopped this area clean.

725
00:41:07,196 --> 00:41:09,997
By the way, I have something to brag about.

726
00:41:09,997 --> 00:41:12,958
Someone accepted me as his friend today.

727
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:17,106
That's good. You did the right thing.

728
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,544
Anyway, I don't get why you always try to
look handsome by wearing your red hoodie.

729
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:22,587
The weather is hot.

730
00:41:22,587 --> 00:41:23,987
All this time, I thought I looked cute.

731
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:25,213
What now?

732
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:28,495
I'm Little Red Riding Hood to your wolf.

733
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:30,842
But it's really hot.

734
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:34,637
Don't throw it down.

735
00:41:34,637 --> 00:41:36,326
It's dirty.

736
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:38,979
It's fine. It already smells.

737
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:40,394
If you don't believe me, smell it.

738
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,647
See? I told you.

739
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:50,248
Put it down.

740
00:41:50,963 --> 00:41:52,915
You don't have to wash it for me.

741
00:41:52,915 --> 00:41:54,071
I'll do it myself.

742
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:56,217
When did I say I'd wash it for you?

743
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:07,472
Here.

744
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:10,345
The assignments are inside. I got them for you.

745
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,168
I don't have the answers though.

746
00:42:13,168 --> 00:42:15,307
I'll spy on the other friends later.

747
00:42:17,474 --> 00:42:21,645
You look like a sad puppy.
You didn't pass, did you?

748
00:42:21,645 --> 00:42:24,120
There, there. It's okay.

749
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,885
There, there.

750
00:42:29,275 --> 00:42:32,227
You're serious these days, huh?

751
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:43,320
Hey. Don't overthink it.

752
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,013
It's only the first audition.

753
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:46,764
Don't worry too much.

754
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,346
Don't be serious.

755
00:42:51,052 --> 00:42:53,676
I'm not worried about that.

756
00:42:53,676 --> 00:42:55,570
I'm bothered by what you did.

757
00:42:57,773 --> 00:43:00,164
Don't you want to reach the finish line with me?

758
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:06,671
Hey. Answer me.

759
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:09,038
Of course, I do.

760
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:15,377
But we had no choice,
so I said that to make you take my outfit.

761
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,896
Fine. Don't do that again.

762
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:26,899
You know I have only you.

763
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:31,064
♫ What should I do, should I do, baby? ♫

764
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:34,305
Fine. I'm sorry.

765
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:37,873
Can I treat you to a drink?

766
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:40,552
What do you want?

767
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,592
A buffet.

768
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,929
A buffet is expensive.

769
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:48,869
I don't care. I want to eat a mala buffet.

770
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:51,467
Today. Right now. Only.

771
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,427
- Okay, I'll treat you to it.
- Okay?

772
00:43:54,427 --> 00:43:56,081
Next time, it'll be your treat.

773
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:01,899
No problem. As long as I get free food today.

774
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:03,773
Shall we go now?

775
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:06,279
- Let's go.
- To a mala buffet.

776
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:08,934
Let's go. I'm hungry.

777
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:10,564
Get up.

778
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,506
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

779
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:39,930
I didn't get to finish singing my song
this afternoon.

780
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,540
Don't forget to listen to the rest of it.

781
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,791
Who would want to listen?

782
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:03,486
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

783
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:08,490
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

784
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,872
♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

785
00:45:10,872 --> 00:45:13,470
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

786
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:19,380
♫ I want to call you boo,
but only your name now should do ♫

787
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,165
♫ I lose myself when I see your face ♫

788
00:45:22,165 --> 00:45:25,259
♫ I can't help but confess ♫

789
00:45:25,259 --> 00:45:29,578
♫ My heart quivers,
I can't keep my legs in place ♫

790
00:45:29,578 --> 00:45:32,697
♫ I must let you hear what's on my mind ♫

791
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:35,211
♫ All the feelings I can no longer hide ♫

792
00:45:35,211 --> 00:45:40,231
♫ Though I know what you're gonna reply ♫

793
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:45,773
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

794
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:51,393
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

795
00:45:51,393 --> 00:45:53,730
♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

796
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,284
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

797
00:45:56,284 --> 00:46:02,211
♫ I want to call you boo,
but only your name now should do ♫

798
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:20,813
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

799
00:46:20,813 --> 00:46:26,035
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

800
00:46:26,035 --> 00:46:28,677
♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

801
00:46:28,677 --> 00:46:31,088
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

802
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:36,754
♫ I want to call you boo,
but only your name now should do ♫

803
00:46:42,054 --> 00:46:45,077
I sent my song to Kang,
but he wouldn't tell me what he thinks of it.

804
00:46:45,077 --> 00:46:46,654
Maybe he hasn't listened yet,

805
00:46:46,654 --> 00:46:49,225
so I continued my mission based on Potae's advice.

806
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:51,108
He'll hear it no matter
which corner of the school he's in.

807
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:55,348
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

808
00:46:55,348 --> 00:46:57,348
You're my Kang.

809
00:46:57,348 --> 00:47:00,706
When I was young, my mom told me
that if I wanted something,

810
00:47:00,706 --> 00:47:05,007
I should write down my wish
and that wish would come true.

811
00:47:05,007 --> 00:47:06,580
I don't want to eat alone.

812
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,806
I want some company.

813
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:09,394
Please don't date anyone yet.

814
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:11,478
Wait for me to win your heart.
