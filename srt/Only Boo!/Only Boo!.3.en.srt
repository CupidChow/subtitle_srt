5
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,438
We're sorry, Master,
for being rude to you this morning.

6
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,621
We just found out who your mom is.

7
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:27,058
Why do you want to dance so much?

8
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:30,857
Have you ever heard of the saying,
"Everyone has their own Everest"?

9
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:32,877
I want to be a world-class artist.

10
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:34,708
Here. You can borrow this.

11
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,956
I said I don't want it.

12
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:37,439
Can you please accept my kindness?

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,028
Hey, I said I don't want it!

14
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:41,824
And don't bring up drawing again.

15
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:43,600
Kang got angry for no reason.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,280
From now on, I'll slap and crush them
like how I'd slap a volleyball.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,384
Why can't I sleep?

18
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:57,234
Why am I so restless that I can't sleep
because I don't want him to be mad at me?

19
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:14,028
Damn. Don't tell me I've fallen for Kang.

20
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:17,063
Seriously?

21
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,764
I wake up at 3 a.m. to buy ingredients
for my mom to cook.

22
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:31,770
My mom sells at the dorm.
I sell at the school.

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,500
After school, I sell here.

24
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:44,918
Is anyone here?

25
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,194
Kang, are you up?

26
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,500
Kang?

27
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:51,980
Kang? Hello?

28
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,644
Go away. Shoo!

29
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,060
Moo?

30
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:25,962
Kang, where did you go?

31
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,851
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

32
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:30,454
Why have you been waiting?

33
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:33,952
I want to apologize to you.

34
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,559
I don't know if I crossed any line

35
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:42,304
but seeing how mad you were at me,
I think you had your reasons.

36
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,999
And I thought over what I did.

37
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:48,179
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

38
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:50,512
It's not your fault.

39
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,341
I shouldn't have taken my feelings out on you.

40
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:00,587
Stop.

41
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:30,001
What did you do?

42
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,414
It was just a mosquito.

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,866
I did what you told me to.
I shooed it away and it left.

44
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,414
But I'm not a mosquito.

45
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:42,125
No matter how much you shoo me away,
I won't leave.

46
00:04:56,242 --> 00:05:00,390
[EP 3: Weak Spot For You]

47
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,101
Anyway, where did you go?

48
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,801
I've been calling for you for a long time.
I thought you were inside.

49
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:05,989
Where did you go?

50
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:13,640
Don't tell me you were so mad at me
that you couldn't sleep either.

51
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,434
Moo, you're getting carried away.

52
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:17,680
Do you want me to scold you again?

53
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,560
Go to bed. I'm going to the market.

54
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,853
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Can I help you shop at the market?

55
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:26,918
What can you possibly help me with?
You can't even clean the dishes thoroughly.

56
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:28,493
I can learn to do that.

57
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,497
Let me help you shop at the market.

58
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,800
- The stuff is going to be heavy.
- You can trust me with labor work.

59
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,004
There's no need. I'd rather go alone.
It's much more convenient.

60
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,771
I'm not leaving!

61
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:42,341
- Hey, why did you get on?
- Let's go!

62
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:46,365
Unbelievable.

63
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,875
- Have we arrived?
- Yes, we have.

64
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:19,320
- Hi, what can I get for you?
- Hi.

65
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,915
I'd like to get things on this list.
The usual, please.

66
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,260
Okay. You got it.

67
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,586
Kang.

68
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,319
What is this?

69
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,400
Sweet basil.

70
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,855
What about me? Sweet babe?

71
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:32,379
Put it down before I mess up your face.

72
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,233
And what is this?

73
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,081
- Hom hua yai.
- Go ahead and kiss it.

74
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:39,989
It's hom hua yai as in onion,
not hom hua lai as in "kiss a shoulder".

75
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:46,829
Kang, I won't ask you what veggie this is
because I know what it is.

76
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:47,800
What is it?

77
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,643
Whether I get the veggie name right or wrong,
I hope it's not wrong to love you.

78
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,221
Oh, so sweet.

79
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:54,760
I can't believe I came up with that genius line.

80
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,249
Right, Kang?

81
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:58,972
Kang?

82
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:00,382
Excuse me.

83
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,942
Where is he? Is he lost?

84
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:26,623
Are you looking for me?

85
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,745
Yes.

86
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:41,345
Where did you go?

87
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:43,004
You're worried about me?

88
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,187
No.

89
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:48,540
I went to buy this for you.

90
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,518
These pa tong go come in twos,
but this Moo is still single.

91
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:56,540
These buns are filled with black bean paste,
but my heart is filled with love.

92
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,820
These soybean milk come with toppings,
but I come with loving care.

93
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,814
You're smiling.

94
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,518
What's wrong with you?

95
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:05,760
I want to see you smile. You're smiling now.

96
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,741
Your expression makes me laugh.

97
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:08,948
Let's go.

98
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:17,355
- Kang.
- Hmm?

99
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:19,401
Kang. Kang.

100
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,163
You eat one half.

101
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:26,133
I eat another half.

102
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,575
So we can make a pair.

103
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,169
What are you talking about?

104
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:51,859
What are you doing? I told you to sit tight.

105
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:54,249
I'm enjoying the breeze. It's so cool.

106
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:56,005
Sit tight.

107
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,071
Hey. Why are you hugging me?

108
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:03,948
You told me to sit tight.

109
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:28,592
You okay? Let me help.

110
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,156
Kang!

111
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,658
Kang, are you back?

112
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,348
Oh, who is this?

113
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:40,397
His name is Moo.

114
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,781
Are you Kang's mom?

115
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,849
Hi.

116
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,243
For a long time,
I couldn't tell if you were his mom.

117
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:48,065
I thought you were his sister.

118
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:51,304
Such a sweet talker.

119
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:54,345
How did you two meet?

120
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,949
I just moved to this dorm.

121
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:59,329
I've been broke lately.

122
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,432
My mom won't send me money
until the end of the month.

123
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:05,647
Kang found out so he's been kind enough
to let me work for food.

124
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,772
Really?

125
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,870
He didn't tell me.

126
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,082
I've been meaning to, but I forgot.

127
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:15,253
Go take a shower, brush your teeth,
and get ready for school.

128
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:16,569
Go.

129
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:17,965
Got it, Kang.

130
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:21,756
Hurry to school. I want to eat.

131
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:22,646
Bye.

132
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:24,367
Bye.

133
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,082
He's a bit odd, isn't he?

134
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:27,600
You too, Kang.

135
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,297
You never wanted anyone to go
to the market with you before.

136
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,044
I tried to send him away before I left,
but he wouldn't leave.

137
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:37,439
I didn't want to be late,
so I just let him tag along.

138
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,877
- I'm going to take these inside.
- Okay.

139
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:54,387
Oh? I got a flat tire.

140
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,719
I better go with Kang.

141
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,159
You live alone now.

142
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,868
You must learn to rely on yourself, you know?

143
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,537
Hey, kid. We've arrived.

144
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,453
Let me do one song.

145
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:58,800
♫ For me to stop loving you,
just stop being lovely first ♫

146
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,941
♫ You're too cute to handle,
not loving you is impossible ♫

147
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,093
♫ I'm already yours ♫

148
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:10,276
♫ You can't pretend to ignore me ♫

149
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:15,021
♫ You tell me not to take it seriously,
but you secretly do ♫

150
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:19,128
♫ A bit cuter than this
and I'll become your slave ♫

151
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:27,638
♫ The more I look at you, the cuter you get ♫

152
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:31,977
♫ I'll love you until my last breath ♫

153
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,780
Wow, Master.

154
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,130
You're talented.

155
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,750
You saw that?

156
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,816
Yes, of course.

157
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:44,006
I've been watching since you picked up the broom.

158
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:44,952
You're so cool.

159
00:12:44,952 --> 00:12:48,311
Our steps the other day couldn't compare to yours.

160
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:51,487
What? You're a great dancer.
Some of your moves that day were so difficult.

161
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:53,809
- You're too kind, Master.
- Hey, Master.

162
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,533
What are you and Payos talking about?

163
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:57,607
Here.

164
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,841
I brought fried chicken with sticky rice for you.

165
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,722
This is from my go-to place.

166
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,378
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

167
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:06,748
Why did you buy me this?

168
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:12,655
So you can eat it while watching our dance clips.

169
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:15,321
You might like them
and want to send them to your mom.

170
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:17,818
That's right, Master.

171
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:19,864
Please send our clips to your mom
for her consideration.

172
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,435
Yes, please.

173
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:26,200
But I don't think I'm going to send her the clips.

174
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,993
Oh?

175
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,381
Why not?

176
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:33,138
Because I actually got transferred here
to correct my behavior.

177
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:36,549
I'm ordered not to dance, sing,
or get involved with any of it.

178
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,657
Do you think I'm going to send my mom
your clips and get told off?

179
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:42,506
But you were dancing just now.

180
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:45,568
Yes, I was, but my mom didn't see that.

181
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:54,001
If you're hoping to benefit from my connections
and talk to my mom,

182
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,336
I don't think it's a good idea.
It's not going to work.

183
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:59,687
If you're not going to help,

184
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,699
why didn't you tell us from the beginning?

185
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,493
I didn't know how to tell you.
You were so serious about your dancing.

186
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:07,926
Don't treat other people's dreams as a joke.

187
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:10,174
Tae, calm down.

188
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:11,717
Come with me.

189
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,523
How am I wrong?

190
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:20,400
I shouldn't have been nice to him.

191
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:24,696
Calm down, Mr. Tae.

192
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:29,823
You don't have to be so mad at him.

193
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:34,821
How can I not be mad?

194
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:36,756
You heard what he said.

195
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:41,116
"If you want to use my mom's connections,
don't bother. It's not going to work."

196
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:44,536
"My mom doesn't even allow me to dance.
I dance behind her back."

197
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:47,102
He's so fake.

198
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,401
You're always complaining.

199
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,870
Blame him, not me.

200
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:54,000
If he didn't do that, I wouldn't be complaining.

201
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,620
I think you're hangry.

202
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,288
I'm not hungry.

203
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:00,500
Eat.

204
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:03,040
Eat it.

205
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,348
While you eat, enjoy watching
the birds and the trees.

206
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:08,871
Let me feed you.

207
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:15,497
I think this is for the best though.

208
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,061
We can prove our talent
without depending on others.

209
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:22,280
You're talented.

210
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,587
Trust me.

211
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,837
You understand everything about me.

212
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:32,577
Shall we film a dance clip this evening?

213
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:33,879
Let's give it our all.

214
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,078
Let's do it.

215
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:40,236
Enjoy your favorite food, Mr. Potae.

216
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:42,137
It's the best.

217
00:15:42,137 --> 00:15:45,343
Come on. Let me feed you too.

218
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:04,601
I didn't sleep all night.

219
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,326
Let me sleep for five minutes.

220
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,119
Shit! It's 12:50!

221
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,978
I don't have time to eat now!

222
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:31,437
Oh, Kang!

223
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:32,726
What are you doing here?

224
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:36,001
I brought you food
because you didn't come down to eat.

225
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:37,460
How cute.

226
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,188
I almost died.

227
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,482
What's wrong? Do you want to go to the infirmary?

228
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,324
The infirmary can't treat me.

229
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,859
I saw your face, so I was checking
if I was dreaming.

230
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:14,592
Seriously?

231
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:16,370
Moo, you're starting to scare me.

232
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,760
You were checking if you were dreaming
by covering your nose with your hand?

233
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,842
They say if you cover your nose with your hand
and you can breathe, you're dreaming.

234
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,063
I'm not dreaming.

235
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:25,683
You brought me food.

236
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:28,401
I'm so happy that you're worried about me.

237
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,806
I'm cute, aren't I?

Your friends just let you sleep?
No one woke you up and told you to go eat?

240
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,052
Do you have friends?

241
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:49,407
No.

242
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,193
Is it because they don't want to get to know you?

243
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:53,910
I don't know.

244
00:17:55,594 --> 00:18:00,960
Come on. You've been here for several days.
Why don't you try to make friends?

245
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,391
I don't want to have friends.

246
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,091
I want to have a boyfriend.

247
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:11,668
Tell me honestly.
Do you feel the same way I do?

248
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,670
- Have you finished eating?
- What's the hurry?

249
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,274
I'm not. I need to get back to my shop.
I have a lot of customers.

250
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:17,674
- Don't go yet.
- You've finished eating.

- I'm leaving. I'm in a hurry.
- Where are you going?

254
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:26,129
Hey, Kang. There you are.

255
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,684
I saw your partner waiting at the food stall.

Hey, Mok.

- I need to talk to you about something.
- Of course.

263
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,618
- Can I go to the restroom first?
- No. The class is about to start.

264

Look at the time. Go to your seat.

265
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:56,436
Where did you go?

266
00:18:56,436 --> 00:19:00,016
Oh, who did you bring food for?

267
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,197
Why are you here? Who did you come here
to gossip about this time?

268
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:09,896
My class was canceled today and I missed you,
so I came here for your food.

269
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,268
- Neth.
- Hmm?

270
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:17,942
Every time you come here without notice,
you have a hidden agenda. I can tell.

271
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:21,685
Okay.

272
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:23,267
I'll get to the point.

273
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:26,511
Did you go to the market with Moo at dawn?

274
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:30,160
Don't ask how I knew.

275
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,121
I don't want to waste time.

276
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:38,277
Last night, you were so mad at him.
When did you clear things up?

277
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,130
Who begged the other for forgiveness? Tell me.

278
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,606
Begged?

279
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:45,591
There was no begging.

280
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:50,349
I just ran into him and he followed me.

281
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:53,838
You ran into him at dawn?

282
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:55,442
That's not a coincidence.

283
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:58,247
That's destiny.

00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,562
But you brought him food.

289
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:13,968
You care for him. Why do you say
you don't have feelings for him?

290
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:15,826
It's really worrying.

291
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:18,913
He didn't come down to eat
because he fell asleep in the classroom.

292
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:22,565
The reason he fell asleep was because
he went to the market with me at 3 a.m.

293
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:26,885
He should be spending time
getting to know his friends, not me.

I did.

I talked and told him off, but he wouldn't budge.

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,682
Your friends can.

352
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:24,769
I'll be with you this weekend.

353
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:29,161
Then I'll make friends on Monday, okay?

354
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:35,252
Kang, is lotus stem soup on the menu today?

355
00:24:35,252 --> 00:24:37,777
No. Do you want to eat it, Auntie Jit?

356
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:41,883
My daughter does. It's her pregnancy craving.

357
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:45,415
I asked my husband to check the food stalls
near the temple, but no one is selling it today.

358
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:48,676
Do you know where we might find it?

359
00:24:48,676 --> 00:24:50,264
I have no idea.

360
00:24:50,264 --> 00:24:52,151
I'll check the lotus pond.

361
00:24:52,151 --> 00:24:54,087
There should be some lotus stems I can get.

362
00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:55,528
Then I'll hurry back and make it for you.

363
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:59,108
I don't want to trouble you,
but I can wait. Thank you.

364
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:00,456
No worries.

365
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,725
I'll be back.

366
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:09,288
Are you going to get lotus stems?

367
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:11,142
It sounds fun. Can I go with you?

368
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,282
Are you seriously going to follow me everywhere?

369
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:15,290
Yes.

370
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:20,042
- Where are you going?
- Don't follow me.

371
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:22,409
Wait for me. I'm coming with you.

372
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,840
You've been watching it so many times.

373
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,380
It won't be like the first time you watched it.

374
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,997
Let me watch someone else's clip.

375
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:38,819
Hey, Yos. Look at Moo.

376
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:42,128
He gets so many views.

377
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:46,727
He's a really good dancer.

378
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:48,129
I saw it with my own eyes.

379
00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:53,422
I don't think so.

380
00:25:53,422 --> 00:25:55,318
I think it's because of his outfit.

381
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:58,290
He's not wearing a student uniform
in the clip but we are,

382
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,062
so we don't look professional.

383
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:02,588
I think we need grooming.

384
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:04,792
Oh, grooming.

385
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:05,965
What is it?

386
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:10,787
Dressing up to look handsome
like the Bangkok kids.

387
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:15,712
Tae.

388
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:20,723
So you stood me up to come here.

389
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:25,122
Hey, Nomtan.

390
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:26,308
I...

391
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,927
Please calm down.

392
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:34,659
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

393
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,321
Tell me honestly.

394
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:40,320
You're always with him
because you two are dating, aren't you?

395
00:26:41,676 --> 00:26:44,587
No, Nomtan.

396
00:26:44,587 --> 00:26:47,806
I saw you feeding each other earlier.

397
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,222
Why did you get involved with me?

398
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,521
Well...

399
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,029
Payos,

400
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:01,526
we don't have to hide it anymore.

401
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:03,063
It's like what you saw.

402
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:07,722
I'm dating Payos.

403
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:15,460
Tae.

404
00:27:26,305 --> 00:27:28,449
That was close.

405
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:29,818
Thank you.

406
00:27:41,585 --> 00:27:42,972
Whoa!

407
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:48,335
You're amazing, Kang.

408
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,904
You know how to row a boat.

409
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:55,246
I wouldn't even know how to hold the paddles.

410
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,590
It's not hard. Everyone in the area can do it.

411
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,061
This place is beautiful.

412
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:06,726
People who don't know we're here
to get lotus stems would think we're on a date.

413
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,777
Damn. It really looks like it.

414
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:12,965
Let's quickly get them and leave.

415
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:17,338
Are you feeling shy?

416
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:20,772
When you're feeling shy,
you always wipe your brow, don't you?

417
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:23,661
Stop talking too much.
Sit properly or you'll fall off the boat.

418
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,590
How do we know which ones to pick?

419
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,077
Don't get the stalks with leaves.
Get the ones with only flowers.

420
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:36,726
Find the ones that are easy to pluck.

421
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:40,628
We need other colors than white.
White lotus is for paying respect to the Buddha.

422
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:42,576
Do you have an example?

423
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:47,111
Sure. This one here.

424
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:49,221
- Is it that easy to pluck it?
- Yes.

425
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:51,038
It's easy.

426
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:53,677
Find the ones that are easy to pluck.

427
00:28:58,054 --> 00:28:59,863
Careful.

428
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,863
Moo.

429
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:03,799
You're going to fall off.

430
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,073
Moo!

431
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:07,663
Don't lean over!

432
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,928
Moo, can you hear me?

433
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:14,853
Moo!

434
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,062
Moo!

435
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:32,226
Peekaboo, Kang.

436
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,398
Hey, I thought something bad happened to you.

437
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,005
Are you worried about me?

438
00:29:39,005 --> 00:29:41,545
I'm okay. I'm right here.

439
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:45,227
Why are you worried about me?
Do you feel something for me?

440
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:49,857
Are you that worried about me?

441
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:51,015
Stop it.

442
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:52,732
You splashed water all over my face!

443
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:05,435
Moo.

444
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,936
Close your eyes.

445
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:09,093
Why?

446
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:24,774
It's clean now.

447
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:28,565
- Have you washed yours?
- Not yet.

448
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:30,477
Let me help.

449
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:31,974
No need.

450
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:34,224
- I can do it myself.
- Don't be stubborn.

451
00:30:34,224 --> 00:30:35,784
Sit down.

452
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,136
Give me the water.

453
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:51,091
Wash it again when you get home
so it's really clean.

454
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:52,285
I know.

455
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:29,824
Are you feeling shy with me?

456
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:31,583
No, I'm not.

457
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,396
Why are you sitting so close to me?

458
00:31:34,522 --> 00:31:38,402
Just checking if you still have anything
on your face.

459
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:39,703
If you're done, let's go.

460
00:31:39,703 --> 00:31:42,137
Hold on. Let's sit here and rest first.

461
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:54,234
Let me enjoy the atmosphere a bit.

462
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:57,550
When I was in Bangkok,
I never got to do anything like this.

463
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:01,606
I never got to see something so beautiful...

464
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,488
and relaxing.

465
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:23,560
I really like this vibe.

466
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:29,022
I like it too.

467
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:46,634
♫ Take responsibility for stealing my heart ♫

468
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:52,282
♫ I tried to ignore
but you got me from the start ♫

469
00:32:52,282 --> 00:32:54,847
♫ You're so cute, that's clear ♫

470
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,048
♫ But you're quick to disappear ♫

471
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:59,690
If we're really together,

472
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:03,126
I would be smiling like you are now.

473
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:05,992
What are you doing, Tae?

474
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:07,520
I just love teasing you.

475
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:15,997
Aren't you going to get something to eat?

476
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,533
Don't be sad.

477
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:27,136
Where is my name?

478
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,040
Here. We're in the same class.
[Pheera Tiensuwan]

479
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:36,626
I'm so happy I'm finally in the same class as you.

480
00:33:39,315 --> 00:33:40,649
What are you doing, Tae?

481
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:44,094
What? I'm just happy I'm in the same class
as my best friend.

482
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:57,878
One day,

483
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:01,325
I'll be brave enough to tell you the truth, Tae.

484
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:38,087
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

485
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:46,647
I like it too.

486
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,161
What are you looking at?

487
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:54,764
I'm looking at what I like.

488
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:57,009
You talk too much.

489
00:34:58,854 --> 00:35:03,465
Someone taught me that if I don't start
a conversation, love won't happen.

490
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:14,005
Hey, Kang.

491
00:35:14,005 --> 00:35:16,631
You already gave lotus stem soup
to Auan's wife, right?

492
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:17,983
Yes.

493
00:35:18,871 --> 00:35:22,066
It's past noon now.
Aren't you hungry? Come eat.

494
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:23,818
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

495
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:25,799
You must be starving. What would you like?

496
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:29,331
Why hasn't Moo come down to eat?

497
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:35,217
Moo.

498
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,624
It's time to eat.

499
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:41,993
Moo.

500
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,561
- Hey.
- What's up?

501
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,944
It's time to eat.

502
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,702
Hey, what's wrong?

503
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:00,365
Damn. Your temperature is very high.

504
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:23,842
Why didn't you tell me you're sick?

505
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:29,345
I thought I'd feel better
after getting some sleep.

506
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,353
Why did you measure my temperature that way?

507
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:40,660
My mom did it like that when I was sick.

508
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,254
Have you taken medicine?

509
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,115
Where is it? I'll get it for you.

510
00:36:51,363 --> 00:36:52,685
It's here.

511
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:57,448
This is the cure for my fever.

512
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:09,458
Moo, you have to take medicine.

513
00:37:10,571 --> 00:37:14,656
I know, but just let me treat my fever
like this for a while.

514
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:07,417
Moo.

515
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:09,406
You have to eat.

516
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:10,540
Hmm?

517
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:13,459
Get up.

518
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:25,532
Force yourself a bit.

519
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:27,991
Eat this so can you take your medicine afterward.

520
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:29,991
Can you eat by yourself?

521
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:32,002
I don't really want to eat.

522
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:42,232
You have to, so you can take your medicine.

523
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:45,270
Come on. Open your mouth.

524
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:55,202
After eating, you should sponge your body.

525
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:57,075
It'll make you feel more comfortable.

526
00:39:00,884 --> 00:39:03,923
I don't want to. I only want to sleep.

527
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:09,485
Drink some water.

528
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:30,221
Hey, is your water heater not working?

529
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:33,409
No. I take a cold shower every day.

530
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,651
- What are you looking for?
- Just stay still. I'll be right back.

531
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,468
Mom, is there anything left for me to eat?

532
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:52,189
Oh, Neth. You're late. Everything is sold out.

533
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,223
But don't worry. I'll make you fried rice.

534
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:56,196
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

535
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,943
Neth, can I ask you something?

536
00:40:05,943 --> 00:40:07,192
Yes?

537
00:40:07,192 --> 00:40:08,572
It's about Kang.

538
00:40:31,945 --> 00:40:33,629
Take off your shirt.

539
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:35,251
Do I have to take off my shirt?

540
00:40:36,482 --> 00:40:37,938
Then wipe yourself.

541
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,124
If you don't feel better after this,
go to the hospital tomorrow.

542
00:41:22,124 --> 00:41:23,290
Okay.

543
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:07,318
Why are you smiling?

544
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:08,629
I'm happy.

545
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:10,791
About going to the hospital?

546
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,428
I'm happy that you're worried about me.

547
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:15,273
You're worried about me, right?

548
00:42:17,193 --> 00:42:19,284
I'm not worried about you.

549
00:42:19,284 --> 00:42:24,129
I just don't want you to die
before paying off your debt.

550
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:34,863
But I'm willing to forgive you all your debt...

551
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:38,493
to compensate for making you sick.

552
00:42:38,493 --> 00:42:44,507
This means we've progressed in our relationship
from creditor and debtor...

553
00:42:44,507 --> 00:42:46,371
to something else.

554
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:47,465
To what?

555
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:53,046
To boyfriend and boyfriend.

556
00:42:56,976 --> 00:43:01,112
I think just a big bro and little bro will do.

557
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:26,262
Hey.

558
00:43:26,262 --> 00:43:27,907
What's wrong?

559
00:43:27,907 --> 00:43:30,026
Something is really wrong with me.

560
00:43:30,026 --> 00:43:31,617
Do you want to go to the hospital?

561
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:33,967
It's not like that.

562
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:35,722
Then what's wrong with you?

563
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:39,922
I like you...

564
00:43:42,716 --> 00:43:45,557
and I know you like me too.

565
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:17,389
After I confessed my feelings to Kang,

566
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:19,626
if he accepted my love so easily,
it wouldn't be fun.

567
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:21,168
I have to come up with various pickup lines.

568
00:44:21,168 --> 00:44:22,540
I've been crazy lately.

569
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,033
Crazy in love with you.

570
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:26,775
I'll flirt with you until you fall for me.

571
00:44:26,775 --> 00:44:28,166
Go, Moo!

572
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,550
You've only been here for a while,
but you've fallen in love already.

573
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,961
- Why did you turn away from me?
- Huh?

574
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:42,959
How will things turn out? Please root for me.
