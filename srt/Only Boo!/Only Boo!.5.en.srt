I don't have feelings for you.

Then I'll flirt with you until you fall for me.

7
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:27,622
I've been acting goofy
because I really want to win your heart.

8
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:29,320
Come on, Tae.
We don't want to be late for the audition.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,069
You guys go. And pass that audition.

10
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:33,240
Hurry, Tae!

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,840
Let's talk in my office.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,120
How many months and days do you think
it'll take for someone to agree to date you?

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,771
Whatever you're good at, use that to impress him.

14
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:44,876
I didn't get to finish singing
my song this afternoon.

15
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,434
Don't forget to listen to the rest of it.

16
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:48,534

I won't turn away anymore. Are you happy now?

47
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:17,333
You're no fun.

48
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,010
Of course, I'm not your Moo.

49
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,773
It's a good song though.
I can sing it after listening for just a bit.

50
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,773
Your Moo is such a genius.

51
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:29,775
Did I make the right decision
to come to you for advice?

52
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:32,754
Of course, you did.
Tell me what you need advice on.

53
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:40,935
What do you think of him writing a song for me?

54
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:43,035
Oh, please.

55
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:47,440
Moo is crazy about you very very much.
He'd register his marriage with you tomorrow.

56
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,719
You're exaggerating.

57
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,880
I'm not exaggerating. I could see it
from the crocodile farm in another district.

58
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,464
It's up to you what you feel
after listening to the song.

59
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:57,722
But you feel something.

60
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:01,291
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have come to me for advice.

61
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,583
Am I right?

62
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,934
Yeah.

63
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,101
But I don't want to feel anything more.

64
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:08,738
What's holding you back?

65
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:11,380
You know I've never dated anyone.

66
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,400
And?

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,096
And he's only here for one semester.
He's going to university next semester.

68
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:18,322
- And?
- We'll be far apart.

69
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:21,957
Haven't you ever seen someone living
in America dating someone in Thailand?

70
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:25,026
They live in completely different time zones,
but they make it work.

71
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:26,550
You're both in Thailand.

72
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,900
Bangkok and Nakhon Pathom
are only two hours apart.

73
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,438
I think he's still a kid.

74
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,928
And? Can't a kid be in love?

75
00:05:32,928 --> 00:05:35,682
You're not even that old.
You guys are only two years apart.

76
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,535
What else is holding you back? Tell me.

77
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,160
Is something going on between you and Moo?

78
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,547
You know you can tell me anything, right?

79
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,667
It's none of your business.

80
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,331
Excuse you?

81
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,046
Kang.

82
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,660
Give it back.

83
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,848
What did I take from you?

84
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:09,797
My heart.

85
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,162
Have you listened to my song?

86
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:15,610
I have.

87
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,610
What's your answer?

88
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,656
I didn't finish it.

89
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:21,417
I listened to the first two verses
then I turned it off.

90
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:26,139
So you don't know what I ask you in the song.

91
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,596
No, I don't.

92
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,477
It's okay. I can sing it to you here.

93
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:36,149
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

94
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:41,229
No! I have food to sell! People are waiting.

95
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,785
♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

96
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:44,688
Stop it, Moo!

97
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,412
Be considerate of others.

98
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,558
Do you want kai palo? I'll give you two eggs.

99
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:53,304
- Can I have three?
- You can have as many as you want.

100
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:56,666
Now go.

101
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,736
What? I sang it to you with my heart.

102
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:03,696
Sorry, Moo. I really am not ready.

103
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:07,320
Seriously, Kang?

104
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,520
I wrote a song for you,
but you wouldn't listen to it.

105
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,416
What can I do to make you listen to it?

106
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,441
Did I steal your spot again?

107
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:30,280
Hey.

108
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,187
It's not that.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,302
Then what?

110
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,753
Tae wants to talk to you.

111
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,178
I...

112
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:46,857
I want to thank you for yesterday.
Thanks for helping us skip school.

113
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,457
Keep eating.

114
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:55,967
Payos told me you were punished by the director.

115
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:58,293
You got punished for us.

116
00:07:58,293 --> 00:07:59,503
Sorry.

117
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:01,014
Sorry.

118
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:04,889
No worries. Forget it.

119
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,039
Sit down.

120
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:14,146
How was the audition? Did you pass?

121
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,848
No?

122
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,298
I think you guys dance too fast.

123
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:24,772
That's why your moves are not clean.
Your moves are also a bit offbeat.

124
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,358
Hey.

125
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:27,879
I said too much.

126
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,047
No, no.

127
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,184
- Ignore it.
- Not at all.

128
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:33,659
Everything you said is true.

129
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,918
I know it too, but I just can't fix it yet.

130
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:38,990
Here's my suggestion.

131
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,582
Don't dance to the song yet.

132
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:43,880
Just count the beats and make sure
you're in sync with each other first.

133
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,007
Once you've mastered that,
you can start dancing to the song.

134
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:47,297
Thanks.

135
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:48,668
What a great technique.

136
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:49,760
Thank you.

137
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,184
By the way, I heard TTM's New Wave Project
is coming up soon.

138
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:55,715
- Really?
- Yes.

139
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:58,603
A friend of mine is an insider.
He told me about it.

140
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,227
I really want to apply,

141
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:04,320
but if my mom finds out, she'll scold me.

142
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,337
Yos, we need to practice harder
for this opportunity.

143
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:11,049
Moo, thank you so much.

144
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,745
If there's anything we can help you with,
you can always tell us.

145
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,808
If you ever need anything in the future,
just let us know.

146
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,320
- Can I ask for your help today?
- Today?

147
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:25,111
My crush wouldn't listen to the song
I wrote for him.

148
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,971
I want him to listen to it. What should I do?

149
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:30,255
Who is he?

150
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:32,050
It's...

151
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:37,600
- Kang?
- Yeah.

152
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,677
Oh, Moo.

153
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:41,041
You're quite something.

154
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,700
Kang is top tier.

155
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,659
Yeah.

156
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:46,475
I sent him my song, but he wouldn't open it.

157
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:49,362
And when I went to sing it to him earlier,
he shooed me away.

158
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:51,356
What can I do to make him listen to my song?

159
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:54,443
Moo, you're asking the right person.

160
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:58,229
I know just what to do.

161
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:06,228
First, we need to get
into the broadcasting club room.

162
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,279
Why?

163
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,699
To perform the song for Kang.

164
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:13,504
I'm telling you, if you perform it from there,
whether he wants to listen or not,

165
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:15,050
he'll hear it no matter
which corner of the school he's in.

166
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,678
What a brilliant idea, Tae.

167
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:18,623
Like he said, you asked the right person.

168
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:21,332
Tae is an expert in this area.

169
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,967
Excuse me. Can I walk you to class?

170
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,285
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I forgot something here.

171
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:52,695
But after Kang hears my song,

172
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,445
how do I know how he feels about me?

173
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,025
You're asking for a lot.

174
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:57,405
I got you.

175
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:01,700
While you're singing, give us a video call.

176
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,602
I'll show it to Kang.
[Calling Potae]

177
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:06,228
Hello, people of Pathom Pittaya.

178
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:09,170
I'm Mok or Moo from Grade 12 Class 4.

179
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,374
Let me be your DJ this bright and shining morning.

180
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:12,889
- Yos!
- Here he comes.

181
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,524
- Answer it.
- What's going on, guys?

182
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:16,997
Moo?

183
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:19,392
There's one song I really want to sing to someone.

184
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:21,387
Please listen to my song, Kang.

185
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:22,600
Stop it, Moo!

186
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,391
You can't run from me anymore.
You have to listen to me.

187
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,948
Hey, listen to him.

188
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:29,524
Please listen to him.

189
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,728
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

190
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:41,477
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

191
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:42,640
What the hell are you doing, Moo?

192
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,298
♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

193
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:46,531
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

194
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,707
Stop it, Moo!

195
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,982
♫ I want to call you boo,
come here and shoo me away ♫

196
00:11:51,982 --> 00:11:53,669
I told you to stop!

197
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:56,188
Kang!

198
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:57,758
He ran away.

199
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:02,984
The broadcasting room.

200
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:07,980
♫ I may seem consumed by love's spell ♫

201
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:13,506
♫ Seeing others together makes it swell ♫

202
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:19,872
♫ Could you love me too, my love? ♫

203
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,583
What the hell are you doing, Moo?

204
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:25,555
Kang.

205
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:27,928
What do you think? Is my song any good?

206
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:30,832
Is it so good that you had to see me?

207
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,591
You're going to get scolded for singing like that.

208
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,803
No.

209
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,834
It's a broadcasting room. Everyone can use it.

210
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,640
Have you come around to accept my love?

211
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
This is not the time to talk about that. Let's go.

212
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,294
- Where are we going?
- The director's going to come here.

213
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,594
Answer me first.

214
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:50,368
The director!

215
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,911
What are you doing in the primary grade building?

216
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:55,289
- Get inside the locker.
- The locker?

217
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:00,927
Hurry and get inside.

218
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,329
Hi.

219
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,593
[Do not run]

220
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,701
It's locked, huh?

221
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:35,057
Do you think you can get away with it
by locking up the room?

222
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,905
These are keys for the whole school.

223
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:40,942
It's not this one.

224
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:44,133
Teacher Joei didn't bother
to label any of these keys!

225
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:55,468
I'm like a janitor carrying this keyring.

226
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,835
Hey, Mok!

227
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:03,543
Where are you hiding? Be a good boy and come out.

228
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,692
Why are you smiling?

229
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,073
I'm shy.

230
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,342
I've never been this close to you.

231
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:38,014
I'm glad you heard my song now.

232
00:14:38,014 --> 00:14:40,689
Keep it down. This is not the time to talk.

233
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,721
Fine, I won't talk,

234
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:47,337
but...

235
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:59,831
♫ I want to call you boo,
but only your name now should do ♫

236
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:05,560
You're my Kang.

237
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,001
Kang,

238
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,505
I really like you.

239
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:17,076
I like you so much.

240
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:23,605
I like you because you're kind.

241
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:27,474
I like you because you're cute.

242
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:30,476
I like you because of who you are.

243
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,231
I really like you.

244
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:41,420
Are you sure you don't like me yet?

245
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:44,866
Kang, are you sure you don't like me back?

246
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:48,049
Kang.

247
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,041
Mr. Mok.

248
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,555
Come out right now.

249
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:00,921
You're surrounded.

250
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:05,277
If you don't come out and I open it and see you,

251
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:07,232
you'll get harsher punishment.

252
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:10,641
It's okay.

253
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:12,754
I'll go out. You stay here.

254
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:13,987
Moo.

255
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,356
I'm sorry, Director.

256
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,899
Alright.

257
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:32,122
At least you own up to your actions.

258
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:39,062
But you can't just keep making mistakes
and getting punished without improving yourself.

259
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:46,070
Looks like I need to call your mother over.

260
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,759
But I just performed a song.
Do you really have to call my parent?

261
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,554
Aren't we normally allowed
to broadcast music from this room?

262
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,901
Yes, but only at certain times.

263
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:59,077
And only the members of
the broadcasting club are allowed.

264
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:02,084
Not anyone can just come in here
and play music as they please.

265
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,635
Strict, isn't it?

266
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:09,083
Please don't go that far.

267
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,418
Can you please just punish me
without telling my mom?

268
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:14,558
If she finds out,
I'll be transferred to another school.

269
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:24,632
I get that as a teenager, you're at the age
where you want to defy conventions.

270
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:26,731
But listen, Mok,

271
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:32,354
in addition to the conventions,
there are social rules.

272
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:36,755
These are agreements that
everyone must abide by for society to function.

273
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,286
You have to learn those too.

274
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:42,354
Got it.

275
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,250
You're in grade 12 now.

276
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,733
In only a few months, you're going to university.

277
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,723
Are you really going to have fun day by day?

278
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:52,354
You should focus on your studies.

279
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:56,521
Soon, no one will push you like this.

280
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:59,801
Learn to prioritize what's important
to your life already.

281
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:02,694
Got it.

282
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,386
Alright. Follow me to my office.

283
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:12,680
Finish physics practice questions
before lunch break.

284
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,558
You can't ask anyone to help.

285
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,223
I'll have Teacher Joei watch you.
Do you understand?

286
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,891
Director.

287
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:25,156
If I give you 200 baht, could you not punish me?

288
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,315
How about 600?

289
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,157
Go get the practice questions.

290
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:36,369
- Carry the keys for me.
- Okay.

291
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:52,864
In only a few months, you'll go to university.

292
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,068
You should focus on your studies.

293
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,792
From the phenomenon of the photoelectric effect,

294
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,944
when obtaining light with an energy
of 2.1 electron volts...

295
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:05,528
What? Why are there so many questions?

296
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:07,462
Will I get to eat lunch?

297
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:19,195
You're so cool for writing a song
to flirt with Kang!

298
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:23,118
You're our idol, buddy!

299
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:24,971
- Did I do okay?
- Totally.

300
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,907
I did okay, right?

301
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:28,839
I'll sing it for you.

302
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,634
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

303
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:35,080
Is this really okay?

304
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,685
It's class time.

305
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:43,110
What are you doing, Mok?
You should focus on your studies.

306
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,172
Attention!

307
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,445
Go to your seat.

308
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,234
Moo's song is so good, isn't it?

309
00:19:58,234 --> 00:19:59,935
It's so catchy from the first listen.

310
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,552
Agreed. His song is so good.

311
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:03,801
How did he write it?

312
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,244
The melody is so catchy.

313
00:20:05,244 --> 00:20:08,551
I think Kang was shy from all the teasing.

314
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:11,479
That's why he closed up and ran home.
[Closed]

315
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:13,994
That's for sure. If it were me,
I would be shy too.

316
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:15,977
- Who wouldn't?
- Right?

317
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:20,203
Where did it go?

318
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,381
Help me find it.

319
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:29,535
- I found it.
- Where is it?

320
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:36,678
Tae!

321
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:38,164
What did you do?

322
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:40,836
I just picked up the nut.

323
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:44,182
You could've used your hand!
Why did you use your mouth?

324
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,334
Should I make it balanced
by doing the other side too?

325
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,360
You're crazy. What the hell are you doing?

326
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,839
I just picked up the nut.
What's wrong with you?

327
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,659
Come on. I'll feed you.

328
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:56,013
Let me peel it.

329
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:58,112
Here. Eat it.

330
00:20:58,112 --> 00:20:59,511
I know this is a shell.

331
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,319
You love pranking me.

332
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,103
You love pranking me.

333
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,631
- I surrender!
- No.

334
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,067
What were you trying to do? Getting back at me?

335
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,388
[Closed]

336
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:15,866
That Teacher Joei wouldn't let me leave
until I got all the questions right.

337
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,484
I left Kang waiting for so long.

338
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:20,562
Where did he go?

339
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,354
Why is it closed?

340
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:23,516
Kang?

341
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,448
Hey! Kang!

342
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:30,135
Hey, Kang. Why are you back so early today?

343
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,355
Leave it, Mom. Let me take care of it.

344
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:35,430
I sold out fast today,
so I hurried back to help you.

345
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,008
- Oh.
- Isn't it good?

346
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:40,463
It is, but it's already past 1 pm.
No more customers are coming.

347
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:42,866
Go take some rest before you need
to prepare stuff to sell in the evening.

348
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,670
- Just go.
- Don't do this, Mom.

349
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,363
Does your back no longer hurt?

350

00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:21,075
Here's your jacket.

527
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:22,586
Kang wanted to return it to you.

528
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,639
Can I have kai palo and sour soup?

529
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,010
Sure.

530
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:39,134
Won't he turn around to look at me at all?

531
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:42,618
The noodles are delicious.

532
00:34:42,618 --> 00:34:45,635
Rich flavor. Good meatball.

533
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:46,848
Good chicken.

534
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,036
The noodles are delicious, huh?

535
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:57,145
But this is good. This is for the best.

536
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,899
What's on the menu today, Kang?

537
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:06,606
Today I have green curry, sour soup,
clear soup, and kai palo.

538
00:35:09,098 --> 00:35:10,219
Hey.

539
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:12,908
Did you hear that? Kai palo is on the menu.

540
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:15,065
Not kai palo again, Kang.

541
00:35:15,065 --> 00:35:17,305
You should change it to something else.
It's boring now.

542
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:19,975
What should I eat?

543
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,691
The first type of radiation is alpha rays,

544
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:27,372
consisting of helium nucleus particles.

545
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:30,168
Alpha particles have
an atomic mass of approximately 4 u.

546
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:36,410
Note that beta particles are high-energy
electrons with low mass and high energy,

547
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,830
resulting in low ionization potential.

548
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:43,944
5, 6, 7, 8.

549
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:46,356
1, 2, 3, 4,

550
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:48,988
5, 6, 7, 8.

551
00:35:52,972 --> 00:35:55,012
Is that enough?
I think we can dance to the song now.

552
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:56,240
- Let's do it.
- Yes, let's go.

553
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,880
You sure? Okay.

554
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,074
- I'm tired already.
- Come on.

555
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:03,047
The jumps are so tiring.

556
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:36,684
Woo!

557
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:38,075
That's amazing.

558
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:43,051
Come on, let's dance one more time.

559
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:49,324
Let's keep practicing until it's second nature.

560
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:50,429
Go!

561
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,652
You sold well today, Kang.

562
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,875
Only kai palo is left.

563
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,258
I made more of it than the other dishes.

564
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:09,183
Oh? Why did you make a lot of it?

565
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:13,178
Someone likes it, so I made extra, just in case.

566
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:15,921
I just made kai palo too.

567
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:17,767
I'll check out other places then.

568
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:19,018
Sure.

569
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:36,235
Can I have kai palo with rice?

570
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:38,182
How come you can come to my food stall now?

571
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,178
You've been gone for a few days.

572
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:48,295
Do you know pretending like I don't care about you
these past few days has been torture?

573
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:53,513
How's your progress from this morning?

574
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:55,982
Your song is the talk of the school now.

575
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,652
Did Kang accept your love?

576
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:02,980
Well...

577
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:09,202
There, there. It's okay.

578
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,176
No wonder you look so down.

579
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:22,361
Don't worry. He said that
because he's worried about you.

580
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:23,864
It's not that he doesn't accept your feelings.

581
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:27,539
He just wants you to do what he said. That's it.

582
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,539
Yeah.

583
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:31,005
I'll do it.

584
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:34,265
That's our friend.

585
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,137
Yeah.

586
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:39,081
And don't worry about your studies. I'll help you.

587
00:38:39,081 --> 00:38:40,332
Yeah, he's smart.

588
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:42,808
Don't ask Potae. He doesn't know anything.

589
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,409
Stop. Don't go over your friend's head.

590
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:48,654
Don't stress.

591
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:49,803
Drink some water. Come on.

592
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:51,966
Drink some water.

593
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:53,597
Drink some water.

594
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,380
Feeling refreshed now, buddy?

595
00:38:58,751 --> 00:38:59,818
Yos!

596
00:38:59,818 --> 00:39:03,242
He enjoyed it so much
that it came out of his mouth.

597
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:06,018
It's okay. You guys made me feel better.

598
00:39:11,937 --> 00:39:13,566
Here's your jacket.

599
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:15,177
Kang wanted to return it to you.

600
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:25,822
Guys, he made it smell so good.

601
00:39:26,954 --> 00:39:28,634
Don't be distracted.

602
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,153
Be strong, Moo.

603
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:36,570
Put it down.

604
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:48,309
The noodles are delicious.

605
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:51,727
Rich flavor. Good meatball. Good chicken.

606
00:39:52,546 --> 00:39:54,758
Let me just walk past.

607
00:39:54,758 --> 00:40:00,259
Today I have green curry, sour soup,
clear soup, and kai palo.

608
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:03,828
Hey. Did you hear that? Kai palo is on the menu.

609
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:06,068
Not kai palo again, Kang.

610
00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:08,308
You should change it to something else.
It's boring now.

611
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:11,659
Hang in there, Moo. Hang in there.

612
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,167
Don't turn around, Moo.

613
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,753
That's amazing.

614
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,321
Hey!

615
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:20,447
Kang!

616
00:40:20,447 --> 00:40:23,513
Moo, you're so talented!

617
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:25,811
Focus.

618
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:31,564
Focus.

619
00:40:31,564 --> 00:40:32,651
Okay.

620
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:33,937
Let's dance one more time.

621
00:40:33,937 --> 00:40:36,144
We're born to dance. So we'll dance.

622
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:37,315
We'll keep dancing.

623
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:38,377
We'll dance all day.

624
00:40:38,377 --> 00:40:40,587
We'll dance some more because we're not tired yet.

625
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:42,018
We'll dance and dance again.

626
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:43,365
That's it.

627
00:40:48,564 --> 00:40:53,082
It's been killing me,
but I think I can see you today.

628
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:55,778
I have something to show you.

629
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:00,692
Look, Kang.

630
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,976
I didn't fail any subject. My scores are good.

631
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:14,298
I studied the entire week for the Physics exam.

632
00:41:14,298 --> 00:41:16,065
It took me only two days to study for Maths.

633
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:19,901
Surprisingly, I'm a math genius.

634
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:21,981
Why are you showing me this?

635
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:24,312
Because of what you told me.

636
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:32,106
You said I need to focus on my studies
and my dream before thinking of you.

637
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:37,095
Before, I've rarely succeeded in anything I did.

638
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:42,269
But now, I want to show you that I can do it.

639
00:41:45,046 --> 00:41:47,026
Good.

640
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:51,603
I'm still working towards my dream,

641
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:55,985
but If I pass the audition,
you must be honest with your heart.

642
00:41:57,917 --> 00:41:59,551
What are you saying, Moo?

643
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:07,370
I know how you feel about me.

644
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,893
Take your school report back.

645
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:16,618
Come on, Kang.

646
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,031
That day,

647
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:23,453
your heart was beating so fast.

648
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:29,127
That heartbeat was definitely
more than just nervousness.

649
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:35,470
Your heartbeat matched mine
when I was close to you.

650
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:40,148
I'm glad you heard my song now.

651
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:50,565
You're exaggerating.

652
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:53,005
But you're smiling.

653
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:56,336
I'm only smiling because you're doing better.

654
00:42:58,226 --> 00:43:01,421
I'm a better person because of you.

655
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:14,110
You did very well, smarty.

656
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:19,344
I'm so happy.

657
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:27,211
I have something to tell you too.

658
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:30,249
What is it?

659
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,258
I've been making kai palo every day,
waiting for you to come and eat it.

660
00:43:36,258 --> 00:43:38,518
Did you hear that? Kai palo is on the menu.

661
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:47,228
That means you've missed me too.

662
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:48,645
Admit it.

663
00:43:49,351 --> 00:43:52,046
You've been making kai palo,
waiting for me to come and eat it.

664
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,376
You're also wearing a cap
with kai palo embroidery today.

665
00:43:55,376 --> 00:43:56,432
Am I right?

666
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:02,753
Am I right?

667
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:04,935
Don't be shy. Say it.

668
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:06,150
Yeah.

669
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:08,594
I've missed you.

670
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:16,767
Kang, can I ask for something?

671
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:19,631
What is it?

672
00:44:20,777 --> 00:44:25,258
It's okay that we're not a couple yet,

673
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:30,000
but can you please hold off on dating anyone else?

674
00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:38,057
Wait for me to win your heart.

675
00:44:43,044 --> 00:44:44,538
Can you?

676
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,781
Of course.

677
00:45:29,112 --> 00:45:30,594
Kang said he'd give me a chance.

678
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,693
Now I'm motivated to follow my dream.

679
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:34,706
We passed the audition, didn't we?

680
00:45:34,706 --> 00:45:35,788
Yes.

681
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:40,805
I'll visit you this Saturday.

682
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:43,461
I know my mom. She won't sign it.

683
00:45:43,461 --> 00:45:46,215
Yos and I will persuade her.

684
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:48,234
Hi, Mom.

685
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:51,792
I have both my dream and my love to fight for.

686
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:54,751
You can do it for sure.
I'm always rooting for you here.

687
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:58,689
Because Kang does this, I'll give it my all!
