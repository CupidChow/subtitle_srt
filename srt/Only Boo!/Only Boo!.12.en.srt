5
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:20,150
Kang really came to watch me earlier.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,249
At least you know where he's studying now.

7
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:25,170
I've been looking for you for a whole year.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,562
Accept the truth, Moo.
You and I are nothing to each other anymore.

9
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:33,000
In my dream, you fought with me and left me.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,663
You won't leave me, right?

11
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:37,155
I'm starting a new show.

12
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:39,164
I can show you the face of the guy
helping me with the logo.

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,689
I can't take it, Tae.

14
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:45,695
Tae, don't go closer.

15
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:49,280
Moo!

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,883
You're awake.

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,652
Kang.

18
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,734
Is it really you?

19
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:08,200
Kang.

20
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:14,673
I won't disappear again.

21
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,052
Stop crying already.

22
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:29,299
Okay.

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,523
Your eyes are all swollen from crying.
Let me take a look.

24
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:47,533
The patient just lost consciousness
from a head injury.

25
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:51,062
I haven't noticed any other worrying symptoms,

26
00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:56,896
but if you start feeling dizzy or nauseous,
please call for the nurses.

27
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,520
Thank you.

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,084
Thank you, doctor.

29
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:05,184
Was I dreaming just now?

30
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,929
Why are you sitting up?

31
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,741
Are you okay?

32
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:10,520
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,954
Don't worry. I'm fine.

34
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:14,475
Are you sure you're okay?

35
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:16,284
Look at your chin.

36
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:18,724
It doesn't hurt. It's far from my heart, really.

37
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,685
This small bruise can't do anything to me.

38
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:23,281
Don't worry about work.

39
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,142
Worry about your health first.

40
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:26,396
Okay.

41
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,221
If there's anything, call the doctor.

42
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:29,796
Don't worry about work.
I'll take care of everything.

43
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:31,887
- Okay. Thank you.
- Take a lot of rest.

44
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:34,013
Don't stress.

45
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,217
How are you feeling?

46
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:43,494
How did you know I'm here?

47
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:47,687
I told him. He called your phone and I picked up.

48
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:53,026
Can everyone please leave us?

49
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:55,558
I need to talk to him alone.

50
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,838
[EP 12: Only Boo]

51
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:19,237
Don't worry too much.

52
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:20,618
Close the door.

53
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:36,375
Bro, have you been secretly
meeting up with Kang all this time?

54
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,912
Why didn't you tell me?

55
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,908
Did I have to tell you?

56
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,977
Why would you say that?

57
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,577
You promised me you wouldn't hit on Kang.

58
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:54,022
That's true.

59
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,662
But that was in the past.

60
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:59,164
You and Kang haven't talked for a year now.

61
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,998
Don't remind me of that.
Why do you have to say it?

62
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,407
I still love Kang.

63
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,245
Please stop, Moo.

64
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,651
It's time you let him go.

65
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:15,412
Of all people to hit on, why Kang?

66
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,141
I can't help my feelings.

67
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,419
There's no reason.

68
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,741
I can't accept this. I just can't.

69
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,764
Why are you hitting on Kang?
We've talked about this.

70
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:33,164
I gave in to you once.

71
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:36,165
I won't back down again.

72
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:38,754
That? What do you want?

73
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,702
What's going on?

74
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:43,717
Hi, Auntie Dao.

75
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:46,520
It's nothing.

76
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,401
Please excuse me.

77
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:02,091
Moo, what's your issue with him?

78
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,379
Nothing.

79
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:20,167
So this is where you've been hiding.

80
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,099
I almost couldn't find you.

81
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,296
I saw Moo's mom, so I walked away.

82
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:28,149
I didn't want her to see me.

83
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:33,495
How's Moo?

84
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,709
It's nothing serious now.
He was able to get up and talk to me.

85
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,874
So, you must be fully recovered now.

86
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,273
That's why you could get up
and pick a fight with him.

87
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,360
How did you get hurt?

88
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,112
Don't touch it, Mom. It hurts.

89
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:08,419
How did you get knocked out by your friend
hitting you in the chin?

90
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,983
He was the reason I lost focus.

91
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:12,962
He posted a video of him and Kang.

92
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:20,237
Moo, your relationship ended a long time ago.

93
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:22,304
Are you still hung up on it?

94
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:30,588
You chose to be here, so you have
to get over it and accept reality.

95
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:35,546
When there's something you need to let go of,

96
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:39,418
I want you to completely let go of it.

97
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:45,341
If you want to be famous,
there are things you need to sacrifice.

98
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:53,356
What if I don't want to be an idol anymore?

99
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:54,884
Will you be against it?

100
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:06,052
Of course not.

101
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:14,087
But you know that it's not just up to you, right?

102
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,495
You have the contract,

103
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,081
your bandmates,

104
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,265
and the company that invested in you.

105
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,717
I know you're upset about Kang,

106
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:32,571
but you have to be professional.

107
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,331
Don't let anyone say otherwise.

108
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,811
My contract will expire in three months.

109
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:56,426
If I do my best as I promised,
I won't owe anyone anymore, right?

110
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,878
I don't feel comfortable at all.

111
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,755
I saw you and Moo fight in the room.

112
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:13,912
I'm sorry for being the cause.

113
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,085
Hey.

114
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,085
It's not your fault.

115
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:30,516
I just want to tell him the truth that
there's nothing between you and me,

116
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,492
but I can't.

117
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,632
I don't want him to know
that I'm worried about him.

118
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:45,845
I'm scared of holding him from moving forward.

119
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,857
I'm scared that what I've been doing all this time
will be for nothing.

120
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:53,863
I don't want to hurt him again.

121
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:06,413
You've never been able to forget Moo, right?

122
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,359
No.

123
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:17,257
I still love him the same.

124
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:21,237
And I probably won't forget him easily.

125
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:46,232
Tae.

126
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,569
Tell me honestly,

127
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,180
do you have a problem with me?

128
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:55,949
Sit down.

129
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:02,852
I'm the band leader.

130
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:05,512
I don't want anything unresolved
between us. Just tell me.

131
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:10,950
I'm just wondering if you're breaking the rules.

132
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,187
Are you secretly dating Payos?

133
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:18,157
I saw you two hug before the run-through.

134
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:30,960
Payos and I are not dating.

135
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,538
Really?

136
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,182
You don't have to answer me,

137
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:38,603
but think carefully if you're mad at me
for breaking the rules

138
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:40,421
or because of your own feelings?

139
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,398
Answer yourself and
learn to separate it from work.

140
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:45,802
Next time, don't act on your emotions.

141
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:47,653
People are always watching us.

142
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,464
♫ What should I do, should I do, baby? ♫

143
00:11:55,478 --> 00:12:00,269
♫ What should I do, should I do, baby? ♫

144
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,002
Oh, hi, Auntie Dao.

145
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:10,477
Hi.

146
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:13,589
Why didn't you call and tell me you were coming?
I would've gone downstairs to pick you up.

147
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:20,768
Talk nicely.

148
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:22,709
I'll wait outside.

149
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,190
Bye.

150
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:27,747
Come in.

151
00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:52,135
I'm sorry for saying those things to you.

152
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:02,808
Well, I'm sorry too for not telling you about Kang.

153
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:07,771
Actually, I have no right
to be mad at you over Kang

154
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:12,507
nor to stop you from hanging out with him.

155
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:17,146
He let go of my hand a long time ago.

156
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:23,134
You know, Kang has never stopped liking you.

157
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:28,761
Then why has he been running from me?
Why won't he come to see me?

158
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:34,600
Why has he made me run after him like a lunatic?

159
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,560
I miss him.

160
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,586
Kang has his reasons.

161
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:41,014
I'm sure you know what they are.

162
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:49,668
Come here.

163
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,856
Is your bruise fully healed now?

164
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,137
Yes.

165
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,675
You're sad like a puppy.

166
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,384
I'm sorry.

167
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:11,690
I know.

168
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:14,935
Yos,

169
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,261
where have you been?

170
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:19,446
I went to look for a new room.

171
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:20,939
I'm moving out.

172
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,688
Wait, why?

173
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:26,662
You've been living with me since the training.

174
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:31,742
Are you afraid Jang will misunderstand us?

175
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,154
What does Jang have to do with this?

176
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:40,306
I see that you're very close with him.
You're always together.

177
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:43,051
I guess it's not wrong to fall for him.

178
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:44,761
He's good to you.

179
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:46,830
I understand.

180
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:51,617
No, you don't understand.

181
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:53,857
You never understand anything.

182
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:56,996
Do you think I have feelings
for everyone I'm close with?

183
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,561
I don't have feelings for him.
He's been giving me advice this whole time.

184
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,437
The person I have feelings for is you.

185
00:15:09,347 --> 00:15:11,006
Are you already seeing someone?

186
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:14,549
No. I'm just curious.

187
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:18,046
Or do you have a crush on someone?

188
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:20,393
Not anymore.

189
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:33,183
Payos, if something is bothering you,
you can tell me.

190
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:36,976
I will.

191
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,069
I don't know why, but seeing you makes me
think of myself when I auditioned.

192
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,025
I care for you like you're my little brother.

193
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:48,082
You can ask me for advice on anything.

194
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:51,535
Since that day, he's always been my mentor.

195
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,314
What are your feelings now?

196
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,185
[Friends]

197
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:02,275
Friends?

198
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,360
I tried to tell you that because
I was afraid of my own feelings.

199
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,235
I tried very hard.

200
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:15,290
I tried to tell myself that
you didn't kiss me on purpose.

201
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,611
I tried to be your friend.

202
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:25,463
I kissed him.

203
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:28,835
I want to tell him that I never stopped liking him,

204
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:31,244
but he pushes me away every time.

205
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:34,301
This situation is killing me.

206
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,649
Why do I have to feel like this?

207
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,156
I shouldn't have confessed to him that day.

208
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:41,744
I understand you.

209
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:44,248
Since that day, things have not been the same.

210
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:47,596
I don't want to be like this anymore.

211
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:03,664
Don't worry. It's best that I move out.

212
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:09,082
You can't change yourself
and I can't change myself either.

213
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,718
If I keep being near you,

214
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,048
we can never be friends.

215
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:23,620
I won't let you go.

216
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:28,097
Don't do this to me, Tae.

217
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:36,374
I get it now.

218
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:45,359
The reason I was mad at you and
didn't want anyone to be close with you...

219
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:51,431
wasn't because you're my only friend.

220
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,170
It's because I like you.

221
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,169
I like you.

222
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:08,309
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:16,378
I'm sorry for not understanding my feelings before,

224
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,884
but I do now.

225
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:23,306
I understand them clearly.

226
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:27,125
I understand that I like you. I like you so much.

227
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:34,325

You don't have to write anything.

Yes, in one of the sorting bins in the kitchen.

00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,239

Wow. This one dressed up as a mascot.

What's your name?

294
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:11,460
- He won't tell us.
- He won't.

295
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,383
If you don't tell us your name,
could you take off the mascot head?

296
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:16,244
So we know who you are.

297
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:18,888

Hi, I'm Moo.

301
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:27,789
What's your name, Mr. Bear?

302
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:31,981
Wow, you have something for me?

303
00:23:31,981 --> 00:23:33,478
He must be your fan.

304
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,484
He only talks to you.

305
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:36,826
That's for sure.

306
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:39,350
Ahem.

307
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:42,201
"How are you?"

308
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,925
I'm good.

309
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:47,604
"I hope you're not sick and
that you're able to eat and sleep well."

310
00:23:47,604 --> 00:23:49,292
I'm very healthy.

311
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,155
Take good care of yourself. Don't get sick.

312
00:23:58,155 --> 00:23:59,686
Don't forget to eat.

00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:00,926

314
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:02,759
Don't forget to love yourself.

00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:29,628
Kang.

00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:47,981
It's really you.

321
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:16,190
Here. I got this ticket.

322
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,602
Go see him.

323
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,822
I don't think that's a good idea.

324
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,799
Moo misses you so much

325
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,818
and I know you miss him so much too.

326
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,117
Don't you want to see him with your own eyes?

327
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:33,595
Actually, I want to.

328
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:36,671
I want to see and hug him,

329
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:40,518
but I'm afraid of the consequences.

330
00:25:41,552 --> 00:25:44,537
I shouldn't let him see me.

331
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,270
What if there's a way to
hide from him that it's you?

332
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:50,535
Will you go?

333
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:57,656
I shouldn't have come.
How did Moo know that it was me?

334
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,304
Kang.

335
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:08,875
Where are you running from me again?

336
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,128
You received so many dolls. They're so cute.

337
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:21,623
Tae.

338
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:22,990
Look who's here.

339
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:26,880
Hi.

340
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,453
Dad.

341
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,304
Mom.

342
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:32,300
How come you're here?

343
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,884
Payos came to give us the tickets.

344
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,726
He said you wanted us to come and watch you.

345
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:40,726
If that's the case, why didn't you give us tickets?

346
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:43,013
I didn't think you'd have time.

347
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:46,926
Your dad has really been busy with work,
but he wanted to come.

348
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:50,326
He didn't know how to act though.

349
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:52,483
You're no different. Stop talking.

350
00:26:52,483 --> 00:26:54,581
She started doing her makeup at 5 a.m.

351
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,772
Come give us a hug.

352
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,229
I'm so proud of you.

353
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:11,466
You have so many people who love you.

354
00:27:12,608 --> 00:27:14,033
Yes.

355
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,306
Oh, I almost forgot.

356
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:19,170
I have a gift for you in the car.
Let me go and get it for you.

357
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,354
Okay.

358
00:27:25,796 --> 00:27:28,647
Aren't your parents here too, Payos?

359
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,600
I only have my grandma.

360
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,483
It's more convenient for her to watch me on TV.

361
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:37,503
Just seeing Potae and his parents hug
makes me happy.

362
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:44,472
Anyway, if you don't have anyone to hug,
you can hug me.

363
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,608
I'm possessive of this one.

364
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,373
You can't do that.

365
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:53,251
What's the hashtag again? JangPayos?

366
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:54,889
No more of that.

367
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:57,636
From now on, it's only TaeYos.

368
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,712
- Wow.
- Give me a hug.

369
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:03,459
I'm going to pick my gifts.

370
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:08,939
What are you doing, Tae?

371
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,588
Showing that you're mine.

372
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:17,675
There's no one here. It's just you and me.

373
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,910
Can I see your face again?

374
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,978
If only for the last time.
Then I won't ask you for anything again.

375
00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:46,577
Kang, I've missed you so much.

376
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:51,626
I've missed you so much that I'm going crazy.

377
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,310
You've missed me too, right?

378
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,146
I saw the blank letters you sent me.

379
00:29:02,497 --> 00:29:03,700
Yes.

380
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:07,021
I've...

381
00:29:09,222 --> 00:29:10,906
missed you so much too.

382
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,564
I'm also mad at you.

383
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:26,634
I'm saying this because I'm disappointed
you let go of my hand that day,

384
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:34,160
but I know how hard that was for you to do.

385
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:38,812
I'm sorry, Moo.

386
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:44,071
It was so hard, but I had to do it.

387
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:52,623
There's not a night that goes by
that I don't think of you.

388
00:29:55,063 --> 00:29:58,379
Every day, I hope you sleep well.

389
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,998
I hope you don't get sick.

390
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:05,768
I hope you get to live your life the way you want.

391
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:13,737
You're the most deserving of smiles
and happiness of anyone I know.

392
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:20,232
But I'm too scared to ask you to come back.

393
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:22,219
I'm too scared to hope for us to be together.

394
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,710
I'm scared people will dig up our past again.

395
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:30,887
I'm scared you will get in trouble.

396
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:33,728
I'm just grateful that,

397
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,538
at least for a period of time,
I had you in my life.

398
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:42,176
I'm really sorry.

399
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,643
Kang, look at my face.

400
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,693
Could you please give me another chance?

401
00:30:55,693 --> 00:31:01,976
Give me a chance to do something for us, will you?

402
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:12,103
After the fan meeting, I plan to talk
to the company about my contract,

403
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:15,449
and the no-dating rule.

404
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:18,443
This is a very serious matter.

405
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,750
This rule is outdated.

406
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,576
I think if I talk to them, they will listen to me.

407
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:27,133
I think they're reasonable enough.

408
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:28,506
Moo.

409
00:31:29,627 --> 00:31:32,117

I got everything I wished for.

411
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,244

412
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:38,071
The fans.

413
00:31:38,071 --> 00:31:40,838
The singles. The income.

414
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:44,085
The sales. I got everything.

415
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:46,359
So many people love and support me.

416
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:52,625
It makes me realize I've reached the summit now.

417
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:56,080
I did it. I succeeded.

418
00:31:56,941 --> 00:31:58,781
There's only one thing left for me to achieve.

419

421
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:10,805
I'll make both my dream
and my relationship successful.

I'm glad to know and love you.

Please let me keep loving you.

424
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:32,724
Do you remember when you asked me
what my Everest was?

425
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,976
Now, I've found a new Everest.

426

Hi, pretty Pong.

438

How many boxes would you like to order today?

439
00:33:45,097 --> 00:33:46,999

I give you the money I get

What a bummer. I'm starving.

Is it because you haven't told your company, Moo?

Or have you, but they're not okay with it?

520

the company gave me a chance,

I promise I'll separate work from my personal life

535

Okay. That's enough, Moo.

538
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:43,302
I agree with Moo.

539
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:48,812
I think banning people from being
in a relationship is not very reasonable.

540
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,473
I'm sorry, I have to be honest.

541
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:56,888
I'm glad you guys talk to me directly.

542
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,828
I asked you to come in today

543
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:04,649
because I wanted to talk
about drafting your new contract.

544
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,034
The company understands us.

545
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:17,409
They were already planning to revise the contract.

546
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:20,821
They just reminded us not to let
our personal lives negatively affect our work.

547
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:27,509
So that means you two can date openly now.

548
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:29,733
What are you waiting for?

549
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:31,739
Nothing.

550
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:34,843
It's just that after the talk,
I've been swamped with work.

551
00:39:34,843 --> 00:39:38,407
Actually, I had to ask them to
fit this reunion into my schedule

552
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:39,825
so I could see Kang.

553
00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:44,102
Neth, no offense, but I'm hungry. Let me eat.

554
00:39:44,102 --> 00:39:45,904
No, stop!

555
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:47,973
Put it away right now, Kang.

556
00:39:47,973 --> 00:39:49,373
- What's going on, Neth?
- Put it away.

557
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:53,280
If you don't ask my friend
to be your boyfriend, you can't eat.

558
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,638
Then I'll ask now.

559
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:56,053
Go ahead.

560
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:57,305
Kang,

561
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:00,184
will you be...

562
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,615
Excuse me. Someone's calling me.

563
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:07,377
- Hello?
- Everyone's looking for you.

564
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:09,999
Come stand by backstage to get your hair
and makeup redone. Hurry!

565
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:11,102
Okay.

566
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:16,807
Teacher Joei wants me to stand by backstage.

567
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:18,574
- I'll be back.
- Wait.

568
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:21,644
What is it?

569
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:25,667
Bring the food with you to eat.
I made it especially for you.

570
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:27,985
Thank you, Kang.

571
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:30,823
You're the cutest. You never change.

572
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,455
Bye. I'll be back.

573
00:40:33,455 --> 00:40:34,870
Be my boyfriend.

574
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,218
Hurry.

575
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:44,362
[School Reunion]

576
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:45,710
Hey.

577
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,489
What are you doing standing here?

578
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,080
I thought you said you weren't
going to wear a uniform today.

579
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,415
I didn't want someone to feel lonely
wearing it alone, so I decided to wear it.

580
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:58,552
It took me a long time to find this uniform.

581
00:40:58,552 --> 00:40:59,822
Is that so?

582
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:07,663
Do you want to say something?

583
00:41:08,824 --> 00:41:09,921
Yes.

584
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,822
Potae and Payos in the flesh. You look
just like you did when I saw you in grade 10.

585
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:20,474
Can we take photos with you?

586
00:41:20,474 --> 00:41:22,065
- Of course.
- Of course.

587
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:23,781
Come.

588
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:25,333
1, 2, 3.

589
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,333
One more.

590
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,873
1, 2, 3.

591
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:29,099
Thank you.

592
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,726
- Bye.
- Thank you.

593
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,998
Oh, Kang. Your photography skill sucks.

594
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,892
Shit!

595
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:01,818
Are you alright?

596
00:42:03,818 --> 00:42:05,912
I'm fine.

597
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,845
Are you asking for my number?

598
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:14,332
I'm returning your phone.

599
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,653
Oh.

600
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:17,540
Thank you.

601
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,321
Wow, Somsong. Look at you.

602
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:47,807
- Come take a photo with me.
- Sure.

603
00:42:47,807 --> 00:42:49,925
Let's do it.

604
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:51,661
You only met him for a few seconds.

605
00:42:51,661 --> 00:42:56,646
Yes, but his idol's aura shone so brightly.

606
00:42:58,248 --> 00:43:03,408
Hi, all my Patompitaya students,
including all the alumni.

607
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:10,123
Today, I'm so delighted
to see your familiar faces and smiles again.

608
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:14,916
That's it. I won't say much because
I know no one wants to hear me talk.

609
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:17,328
Please. You don't need to remind me.

610
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:23,643
I know you're all here
because you want to see GUMP.

611
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:24,912
Am I right?

612
00:43:26,124 --> 00:43:28,244
Keep screaming.

613
00:43:30,376 --> 00:43:33,799
Alright. That's enough.

614
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:38,160
Enough!

615
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,723
Just the mention of GUMP
made you all scream like crazy.

616
00:43:40,723 --> 00:43:43,827
Your director talked for some time,
but you didn't make a sound. That's crazy.

617
00:43:43,827 --> 00:43:49,718
Alright. To not upset you and waste your clock...

618
00:43:49,718 --> 00:43:51,321
Time.

619
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:53,611
Just kidding.

620
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:56,043
Alright. To not waste your time,

621
00:43:56,043 --> 00:44:04,554
I'd like to respectfully invite all of you
to meet GUMP.

622
00:44:12,602 --> 00:44:14,896
♫ With all my heart heart ♫

623
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:18,868
♫ So babe listen up! ♫

624
00:44:19,784 --> 00:44:23,147
♫ I wish you knew ♫

625
00:44:23,147 --> 00:44:27,802
♫ I'm getting hooked on you
'cause you're too cute ♫

626
00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:32,188
♫ The more I resist,
the more I'm hooked, what to do? ♫

627
00:44:32,188 --> 00:44:33,300
♫ Feels like a gump gump ♫

628
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,613
♫ You've bumped into my heart ♫

629
00:44:35,613 --> 00:44:38,094
♫ I wish you knew ♫

630
00:44:38,094 --> 00:44:39,346
♫ Just only you ♫

631
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:43,178
♫ Do you know you're going too far? ♫

632
00:44:43,178 --> 00:44:47,551
♫ The more I resist,
the more I'm hooked, what to do? ♫

633
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:51,725
♫ Can't help getting hooked on anything but you ♫

634
00:44:53,747 --> 00:44:56,614
Alright.

635
00:44:56,614 --> 00:44:58,491
Calm down.

636
00:44:58,491 --> 00:45:00,354
They're my students!

637
00:45:01,487 --> 00:45:02,686
Yes.

638
00:45:03,565 --> 00:45:06,265
They're Patompitaya students.

639
00:45:06,265 --> 00:45:08,408
They're all our kids.

640
00:45:08,408 --> 00:45:10,832
Since you're here, let's talk.

641
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:17,908
The first one I want to hear from is the one
who gave me the most headache last year.

642
00:45:17,908 --> 00:45:19,809
- Mr. Mok.
- Yes.

643
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:21,617
Talk to your seniors, friends, and juniors.

644
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:22,767
Okay.

645
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:25,182
Hi, everyone. I'm Mok.

646
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:35,403
As a Patompitaya student like everyone here,

647
00:45:35,403 --> 00:45:39,007
I'm so grateful you all came to see me today.

648
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:44,311
Even though I studied here for only one semester,
I learned a lot from this place.

649
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:51,363
I have good memories and valuable lessons
that I'll cherish for the rest of my life.

650
00:45:53,250 --> 00:46:01,111
I also want to shout out to the teachers
who helped me become better.

651
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:06,254
They turned me from a slacker who didn't care
about studies into a more responsible person.

652
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:09,621
Lastly,

653
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:14,171
Moo is definitely coming to you.

654
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:19,023
I need to talk about
the most important person to me.

655
00:46:21,693 --> 00:46:23,081
Kang.

656
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:26,966
The one who changed me for the better,

657
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:29,220
who encouraged me,

658
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,983
who gave me confidence is you, Kang.

659
00:46:33,588 --> 00:46:35,311
Thank you, Kang.

660
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:41,631
Today is the right time to ask.

661
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:44,548
Let me help.

662
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:02,661
Will you be my boyfriend again, Kang?

663
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:12,982
You really won't stop being a troublemaker, Mok.

664
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:34,437
Yes.

665
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:42,472
I've never dated anyone in my life besides you.

666
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,613
Mr. Moon Blocks, I haven't
kissed my boyfriend in two months.

667
00:47:52,613 --> 00:47:54,943
I want to kiss my boyfriend so much.

668
00:47:54,943 --> 00:48:00,578
Can you please tell me
if I'll get to kiss him today?

669
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,091
Come on, Kang.

670
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,866
Who said I won't allow you?

671
00:48:17,196 --> 00:48:18,978
I was going to do this.

672
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:24,831
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

673
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:29,947
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

674
00:48:29,947 --> 00:48:32,379
♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

675
00:48:32,379 --> 00:48:35,186
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

676
00:48:35,186 --> 00:48:41,130
♫ I want to call you boo,
but only your name now should do ♫

677
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,993
Kang you.

678
00:48:43,993 --> 00:48:45,596
Kang you the most.

679
00:48:46,345 --> 00:48:47,573
Moo,

680
00:48:49,883 --> 00:48:52,206
can I ask you something?

681
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:57,780
What kind of person replaces
the word "love" with my name?

682
00:49:00,162 --> 00:49:06,348
I think that person is head over heels
in love with you.

683
00:49:08,054 --> 00:49:12,652
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

684
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:15,981
Someone said that
if we love listening to the same song,

685
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:20,255
it's because that song stimulates
the release of endorphins, serotonin, oxytocin,

686
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:23,509
and other happiness-inducing substances.

687
00:49:23,509 --> 00:49:26,680
This could be due to a beautiful memory, love,

688
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,018
or any experience we had
when we first heard the song.

689
00:49:30,018 --> 00:49:32,567
Simply put, we're touched by the song.

690
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:36,922
I hope everyone is so touched by our love song
it becomes a part of the playlist of your heart.

691
00:49:36,922 --> 00:49:39,731
Thank you. See you.

692
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:41,971
Muah. Love you.

693
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:44,829
Love you all. Bye.

694
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:49,856
♫ I know you know but baby could you say ♫

695
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:58,234
How about we see other people's stories?

696
00:50:00,637 --> 00:50:02,400
You said you wanted to tell me something.

697
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,239
What is it? Why haven't you told me already?

698
00:50:08,947 --> 00:50:13,336
It's loud in here. I don't want to shout.

699
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:18,434
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

700
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:21,066
♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

701
00:50:21,066 --> 00:50:23,682
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

702
00:50:23,682 --> 00:50:29,282
♫ I want to call you boo,
but only your name now should do ♫

703
00:50:29,282 --> 00:50:32,209
♫ I lose myself when I see your face ♫

704
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:35,425
♫ I can't help but confess ♫

705
00:50:35,425 --> 00:50:39,261
♫ My heart quivers,
I can't keep my legs in place ♫

706
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:41,554
Will you go out with me?

707
00:50:41,554 --> 00:50:45,498
♫ All the feelings I can no longer hide ♫

708
00:50:45,498 --> 00:50:49,487
♫ Though I know what you're gonna reply ♫

709
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:51,656
