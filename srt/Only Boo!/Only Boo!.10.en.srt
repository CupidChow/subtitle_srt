Announce it?

This is how to announce it.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,921
I told you to delete the clip.
Why did you post a new one?

14
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:48,414
I wanted to proudly present to the world
that you're my boyfriend.

Listen, Kang.

Stop it, Moo, before someone hears you.

No one is going to hear it.

23

But I did.

24
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:27,629
I'm jealous. I'm super jealous and it shows.

25

If someone did this for me, I'd love them so much.

28
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,198
Don't ever let Moo go.

29
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:38,772
If you do, I'll swoop in.

Oh, you didn't use this tone with him in the past.

34
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:53,881
But now you're very sweet with him.
I want to puke.

35
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,670
I better go to bed.

36

Goodnight, Moo.

But please delete the clip, Moo. I beg you.

38
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:06,271
Why? Are you afraid people will criticize you?

to dig up your clip in the future.

to delete it yourself.

There's someone I want to introduce.

47
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:34,532
I met him when I went to a rice and curry shop
to buy a toothbrush.

48
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:37,042
He's the kindest guy in the world.

The cutest guy in my heart.

It's all about feelings.

148
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,282
The company has this rule
because they invest a lot in each artist.

149
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:28,666
They want a guarantee that their investment
will bring the maximum benefit.

and reality at the same time,

Every problem has a solution.

180
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,513
Is this where I choose
whether I want to date you or become an idol?

[Mok Diloksakulkan]

182
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:12,424
Welcome to TTM.

183
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:22,721
I don't want to do this.

184
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:28,073
I understand you, but this is how the world is.

185
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:30,679
You don't get everything you want.

186
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:34,220
Now that you've chosen this path,
go to the finish line.

187
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:39,036
So you signed it?

188
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:40,775
Yes.

189
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,647
Have you signed it?

190
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:43,996
Yes.

191
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:47,542
My relationship hasn't even begun.
It's so much easier to end than yours.

192
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:48,846
Are you okay?

193
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:52,201
Of course. I'm fine.

194
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:55,074
I'm rooting for you though.

195
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:08,950
If you were me, what would you do?

196
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,420
I would date in secret and hide it from everyone.

197
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,847
You're right.

198
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:17,862
But if people find out, you'll be in big trouble.

199
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:19,437
It's going to be okay.

200
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:23,027
We just have to pretend we don't know each other
when we're outside.

201
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:25,506
That's enough to hide it from people.

202
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:27,735
But I think it's too risky.

203
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:31,538
Kang, trust me.

204
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:33,379
Please trust me like you always have.

205
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:36,284
Alright, I'm in.

206
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,934
So, this means we can only
see each other inside the room.

207
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,153
We can still see each other outside.

208
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,631
Not many people know me yet.

209
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,573
People here mind their own business,
but we have to be careful at the company.

210
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:02,681
Keep moving.

211
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:04,440
1, 2.

212
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,448
Give me cool. Give me strong.

213
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:08,207
Good. 1, 2.

214
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:10,406
Give me your brightest smile.

215
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:11,798
Okay. That's good.

216
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:13,018
Next team, please.

217
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:16,357
Why did it take you so little time
to move on from Kang?

218
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:19,856
You're so much stronger than me.

219
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,617
Sorry for keeping it from you, Yos.
I don't want to put you at risk.

220
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,720
So we can only see each other at the condo.

221
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,838
No, we can go to other places too.

222
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,609
One ticket, please.

223
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:33,049
You're smart.

224
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:36,645
Of course. I've watched all the spy movies.

225
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:39,427
No one is going to catch us. Trust me!

226
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:43,148
Really, I'm not that famous.
People won't really care about me.

227
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:45,893
Are you Moo? Can I get a photo with you?

228
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:46,944
Yes, of course.

229
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:50,061
In the unexpected event
that someone recognizes me,

230
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:53,591
we just have to pretend
we didn't come together. That's it.

231
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:57,257
Thank you.

232
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:11,601
Hello. Did you forget your green tea outside?

233
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,371
I brought it for you.

234
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:15,738
I bought it for my partner.

235
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:17,906
Why did you take the liberty of picking it up?

236
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:22,149
What's your partner's name?

237
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:23,301
His name is Moo.

238
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,358
What a coincidence. That's my name too.

239
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,063
I guess we're the same person.

240
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,894
This is the most refreshing.

241
00:17:49,054 --> 00:17:52,671
Mr. Kang, can I hold your hand?

242
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,974
- Kang.
- Hmm?

243
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:19,355
I love you.

244
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,332
I love you too.

245
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:34,847
I'm in front of the cinema now.

246
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,895
Moo, how did the movie end?

247
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:43,114
If you want to know,
why didn't you stay and watch the ending?

248
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:46,718
I had to leave early.
How did the movie end?

249
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:49,039
I won't tell you.

250
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,737
You won't tell me?

251
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:53,042
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Will you tell me now?

252
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:54,042
I won't.

253
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,452
Fine. You won't tell me, huh?

254
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,751
- Will you tell me now?
- I won't.

255
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,624

If you leave, I'll have to live alone.

Me?

322
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:09,608
Someone dug up a clip of you
with your boyfriend and leaked it.

323
00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:19,702
I've seen it. That's an old clip.

324
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:24,453
I already deleted the clip and
sorted myself out as promised.

325
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:27,842
But I have proof that you lied
when you signed the contract.

326
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:37,659
That's probably a long time ago.
I haven't seen him in ages.

327
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,111
Don't lie.

Did you take that photo?

331
00:24:57,525 --> 00:24:59,421
So you admit it?

332
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:01,095
Why did you do that?

333
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,860
You're selfish.

334
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,171
You're not serious about being an idol.

335
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,956
You even lie to the fans who love us so much.

336
00:25:07,956 --> 00:25:11,393
You dare violate the contract
because you're a nepo baby.

337
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:13,658
You think because your mom has power,
you can do anything.

338
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:14,609
- My mom has nothing to do with this.
- Hey.

339
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,724
If your mom really had nothing to do with this,
you wouldn't have become a trainee.

340
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,137
- I said my mom has nothing to do with this!
- Bring it on!

- Moo didn't want to lie.
- Tae!

345
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:35,691
I was the one who suggested he date in secret.

346
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,171
Moo made his own decision to lie.

347
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,491
It doesn't matter who gave him the idea.

348
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:45,565
What matters is that Moo caused this problem.

Is there anything you want to tell me, Tae?

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,971
Why didn't I know about Moo secretly dating Kang?

353
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:19,549
Did I become an outsider?
Why did you keep a secret from me?

I didn't want you to tell Jang.

356
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,848
Are you already seeing someone?

357
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:30,471
No. I'm just curious.

358
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:33,892
Or do you have a crush on someone?

359
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,072
Not anymore.

360
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:42,230
What's wrong with you?

361
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,372
You seem very close to him these days.

362
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,636
Even closer to him than me.

363
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:47,954
Why are you being sarcastic?

364
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:51,478
I'm not.

365
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:53,647
If you didn't spend all your time with him,

366
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:56,835
you would've known everything
without me having to tell you.

367
00:26:58,072 --> 00:27:00,143
Forget it.

368
00:27:00,143 --> 00:27:04,410
It's not a secret anymore. Everyone knows now.

369
00:27:07,331 --> 00:27:11,211
I can remove you from the trainee program,
but it would be a pity.

370
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:16,079
You've made it all the way here
and your popularity is on the rise.

371
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,851

before this thing comes back to hurt you.

372

no one would know I'm dating.

and breaking the company's rules.

we can't keep secrets from each other.

Thank you.

408
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:41,168
The company has found out
about you and Moo dating in secret.

409
00:30:41,168 --> 00:30:47,365
This is about the contract he signed,
so they informed me too.

410
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:56,725
I've seen Moo try so many times
to become an idol like he dreams of.

411
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,895
I've never agreed with him.

412
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,551
But today, he's achieved his dream.

413
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:13,312
I don't want all his effort to go to waste.

414
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:20,391
I don't know what you will decide, Kang,

415
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:28,427
but what I know for sure is
Moo listens to you more than anyone.

416
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:36,413
So I'm asking you to think carefully,
whether you're going to use your heart or reason.

417
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:38,771
It's your call.

418
00:32:03,427 --> 00:32:04,576

419
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:07,813

420
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:13,635

421
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:15,114

422
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:19,737

455
00:34:42,202 --> 00:34:44,141
Let's break up.

456
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:55,257
No, I won't break up with you.

457
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:57,863
I won't.

458
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:02,277

to choose between our dreams and love.

459
00:35:02,277 --> 00:35:04,769
We can have both at the same time, can't we?

460
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,122
The situation has changed, Moo.

461
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,748
Back then, there was only me who loved you.

462
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:16,367
But now, there are people
who love you unconditionally

463
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:19,295
and try to support you as much as they can.

464
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:23,810
If you tell them you have no one,
they'll believe you.

465
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,574
Would you really lie to them?

466
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:38,600

with your feelings that I've ever known.

467
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,557
I don't want to make you lie any longer.

468
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:46,966
Please don't stop being honest
because of me. I beg you.

469
00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:50,420
How can you ask me to not choose you?

470
00:35:51,294 --> 00:35:53,291

471
00:35:55,669 --> 00:35:57,479

00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,747
You're the hardest to wake up.

532
00:40:21,747 --> 00:40:25,992
Come on. You're a very strict manager, you know?

533
00:40:25,992 --> 00:40:30,274
Hey. If you behave like Moo, Jang, and Yos,
I wouldn't be scolding you.

534
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:33,062
Not to mention your trainer told me
you skipped your weight training class,

535
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:34,870
I haven't scolded you for that yet.

536
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,002
The food looks so good. I'll go and eat it.

537
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,361
Not again.

538
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:40,986
Go and eat, guys.

539
00:40:40,986 --> 00:40:42,391
How are you?

540
00:40:43,492 --> 00:40:47,230
Wow. We have hamburgers.

541
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:51,642
Wow. There are desserts too. These look so good.

542
00:40:51,642 --> 00:40:53,472
- Let me smell it.
- Who's that for?

543
00:40:53,472 --> 00:40:55,973
Don't eat too many carbs.

544
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:58,347
Don't forget to film a thank you clip.

545
00:40:58,347 --> 00:41:01,521
Thank you.

546
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:03,150
Wow, Jang.

547
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,691
I can't believe they gave us food support
as a couple.

548
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:07,600
I know, right? I just saw it too.

549
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,232
This is cute.

550
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:10,947
I knew there would be.

551
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:15,529
You two are inseparable.
I knew someday people would ship you together.

552
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:18,497
What's there for me to eat?

553
00:41:18,497 --> 00:41:19,565
Oh.

554
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,788
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

555
00:41:23,788 --> 00:41:25,776
Who gave me this?

556
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:28,840
One of your fans. He left it just now.

557
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,004
- Just now?
- Yes.

558
00:41:37,299 --> 00:41:38,330
Kang.

559
00:41:40,288 --> 00:41:41,803
Is everything okay?

560
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:49,379
Did you give me this?

561
00:41:49,379 --> 00:41:52,630
Yes. I hope you'll like it.

562
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,777
Thank you.

563
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:57,011
This drawing is so cute.
Did you draw it yourself?

564
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:59,033
Oh, I hired someone to do it.

565
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:02,001
I saw him draw at a university festival.

566
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:04,747
A festival? Which university?

567
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:12,456
Where did you run off to?

568
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:15,976
Tae,

569
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:19,085
I know where Kang is.

570
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:21,379
Feel free to check them out.

571
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:23,659
Let me see.

572
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,087
This photo is easy.

573
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:29,082
You can text it to me. I'll take care of it.

574
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:30,766
I'm going to see Kang.

575
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:35,457
- Done.
- Okay.

576
00:42:35,457 --> 00:42:37,428
I think he should be around here.

577
00:42:37,428 --> 00:42:38,758
Let's go and find him.

578
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:45,548
Hey, that's Kang.

579
00:42:52,374 --> 00:42:54,745
♫ Let's finally be in love ♫

580
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,132
I'm so happy to see Kang again.

581
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:12,000
Kang, I've been looking for you for a whole year.

582
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,319
Even though I can't go to him today,
he will see me.

583
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:22,221
♫ I still miss you ♫

584
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:26,050
I dreamed that we fought and you left me.

585
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,078
♫ Ever since you walked away ♫

586
00:43:28,902 --> 00:43:32,487
I missed you. Did you really not miss me?

587
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,431
How could I not miss you?
