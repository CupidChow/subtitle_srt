00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:09,262
10,

183
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,872
9,

184
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:13,126
8,

185
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,373
The two of us should just do it.

186
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,167
But we practiced as a group of three.

187
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,000
7,

188
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,039
I'm Mok.

189
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,320
Wait! You have to sign here!

190
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,693
What's it going to be?

191
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:26,019
Why can't you make a decision
for something this easy?

192
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:26,779
5,

193
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:28,818
He might be on his way.

194
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:30,710
4,

195
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,974
3,

196
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,712
2,

197
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:37,701
We want to audition...

198
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:38,995
I'm here.

199
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm sorry. There was a little accident.
Am I still in time?

200
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,648
In time?

201
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:48,840
You're too late.

202
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,219
You don't know how to be punctual.

203
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:54,000
But it hasn't been 10 seconds yet.

204
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,001
Did you guys not read the rules?

205
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,001
They said you need to stand by before the audition.

206
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:03,144
By doing this, you're breaking the rules.

207
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:05,854
I have the right to disqualify you.

208
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:09,217
I'm sorry. Could you give me a chance?

209
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:10,760
I really didn't mean it.

210
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,869
I'm really sorry.

211
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:15,608
- Please.
- Let's give them a chance.

212
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:23,273
Don't let them say we break our word.

213
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,354
It's Jang!

214
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:30,545
Okay.

215
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:32,024
Thank you.

216
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,056
Hello?

217
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:46,213
Where are you? I want to come over.

218
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:50,243
You're coming to see me? Is everything alright?

219
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:54,320
The ceramic place said
our plates are ready for pickup.

220
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,687
Really?

221
00:14:55,687 --> 00:15:01,590
Yes, I'm going to pick them up and visit you.

222
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,040
If you're free, of course.

223
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,220
It's okay. I don't want to trouble you.

224
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,898
I'll pick mine up myself.

225
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:11,393
Okay. I'll see you there.

226
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:12,912
Alright.

227
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:20,190
After the audition, I have something for you.

228
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,885
You're going to love it.

229
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,947
I shouldn't distract him.
I better wait and surprise him later.

230
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:43,836
♫ Oh oh eh oh o ♫

231
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:46,078

232
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,310

♫ Oh oh eh oh o ♫

254
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:49,307

♫ Oh no nonono ♫

270
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:28,344
♫ If you're not sure, come and check it out ♫

271
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:35,999
Tae, calm down.

272
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,235
Calm down what?

273
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:39,282
All our practice almost went to waste
because of him.

274
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:41,146
If he hadn't been late,
it wouldn't have turned out this way.

275
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,570
Because of me? I arrived in time.

276
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,208
You messed up, but you're blaming me.

277
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,790
If you hadn't been late,
it wouldn't have turned out this way.

278
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,177
I wouldn't have lost focus.

279
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:50,866
Weren't you already distracted?
Don't blame someone else.

280
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:53,022
You're in the wrong and you won't admit it.
Just apologize and settle it.

281
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:56,208
You're in the wrong too. Why don't you admit it?
Don't just blame me.

282
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:03,607
I shouldn't have taken an irresponsible person
like you on my team.

283
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,475
Tae, what do you mean?

284
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:06,633
Hey.

285
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,501
Stop fighting.

286
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:10,251
Tae didn't want to make mistakes while dancing.

287
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:11,865
You didn't want to be late.

288
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:14,225
It's all in the past now. Let's move on.

289
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:16,494
How? This is an important opportunity.

290
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:18,676
But we can't go back and fix anything.

291
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,363
At least, Moo arrived in time.

292
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:22,051
Whose side are you on?

293
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:23,972
Are you his friend or mine?

294
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,897
Tae, that's not what I mean.

295
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,137
Enough.

296
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:29,477
Tae.

297
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,941
Moo, calm down.

298
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:43,064
Hi. I came to pick up some stuff.

299
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:45,822
- For Shone and Kang?
- Yes.

300
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:48,640
They're ready. The designs on your plates
are so cute.

301
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,385
- Thank you.
- Please wait a moment.

302
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,588
Okay.

303
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:56,863
Hi, Shone.

304
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:58,625
Hey, Kang.

305
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,839
You're early.

306
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,244
I was nearby.

307
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:03,767
Did you get the plates?

308
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,286
They're bringing them out.

309
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:09,291
While we're waiting, I have something to show you.

310
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:13,491
I tried and put it together. What do you think?

311
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:17,327
Hold on. You included my face?

312
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,702
Who would want to see it?

313
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:21,507
Someone would.

314
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:24,001
I personally want to see it every day.

315
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:29,906
Hold on. Why would you want to see my face?

316
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,820
Well, you're cute, so I want to see it.

317
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:39,505
Wow. You stunned me.

318
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:43,582
Even though you're joking, I'll take it.

319
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:47,945
I'm not joking.

320
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:49,565
I'm serious.

321
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:52,905
Okay.

322
00:19:54,745 --> 00:20:00,772
Would it be possible for me to hit on you?

323
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:02,386
Would you be okay with that?

324
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:04,380
Oh,

325
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,465
I don't know what to say.

326
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm not joking.

327
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:14,957
I really like you, Kang.

328
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:25,975
Thank you for liking me,
but I have someone I like already.

329
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:30,595
Please don't have feelings for me.

330
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:36,319
Here you go.

331
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,422
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

332
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:39,926
Please excuse me.

333
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,634
Well, thank you for being honest with me.

334
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:53,831
It's totally fine that
you already have someone you like,

335
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:57,233
but please let me continue having feelings for you.

336
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:02,356
I probably can't help how I feel.

337
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,690
Yeah.

338
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,989
Let's go.

339
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,336
♫ Love ♫

340
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:17,745
♫ Maybe a mystery so impossible ♫

341
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:21,986
♫ A puzzle so insolvable ♫

342
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,734
Hey.

343
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,129
I'm sorry for being a bit hot-headed.

344
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:45,709
I got you a drink.

345
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,593
It's okay.

346
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,812
I'm really sorry.

347
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,856
I shouldn't have made excuses for waking up late.

348
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:58,784
Waking up late was really irresponsible of me
like Tae said.

349
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:04,184
It's in the past now. Forget it.

350
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:06,681
Where's Tae though?
I want to talk it out with him.

351
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:13,750
I have no idea, but I don't think
you should talk to him now.

352
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,815
He's even more hot-headed than you.

353
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:17,960
Leave him alone for a while.

354
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,467
You better wait for him to calm down
before you talk to him. Trust me.

355
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,818
I didn't think he'd be that angry.

356
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,299
I understand him.

357
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:32,080
He's as passionate about becoming an idol as you.

358
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,836
He just wants someone to admire him.

359
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,067
Why?

360
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,865
He grew up alone.

361
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:45,850
His parents are always busy with work.
No one really cares about him.

362
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,078
He wants to make his family proud.

363
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:53,826
Despite how he looks, he deserves sympathy.

364
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:55,385
Ah.

365
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:57,105
You must think I'm defending him.

366
00:22:57,105 --> 00:23:00,986
No. I'm just curious how long it has been.

367
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:06,226
A long time. He has been alone since junior high.

368
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:09,060
What I mean is,

369
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,120
how long have you been crushing on him?

370
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,574
Easy, friend.

371
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:15,519
What do you mean crushing on him?
I'm not crushing on him.

372
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,726
I can see it.

373
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:19,985
Just hold your ankles.

374
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:23,424
1, 2, 3.

375
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:25,156
My radar is very good.

376
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:26,982
I think your radar is broken.

377
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:29,120
Can you even see anything?

378
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,343
You're stuttering, you know that?
You're shy, aren't you?

379
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,521
I won't talk to you anymore.

380
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:35,702
I'll go and find Tae.

381
00:23:35,702 --> 00:23:38,240
You can have your drink back.

382
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,639
Oh, someone's being so shy.

383
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:50,960
[What are you doing? I miss you so much.]

384
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,680

387
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:15,239
Are you seriously that mad, Tae?

388
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,840
Hey. What are you still doing here?

389
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,317
Jang.

390
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:31,437
Your name is Payos, right?
If I remember correctly.

391
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,559
Yes, it is.

392
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,837
Your performance was good.

393
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:36,388
Thank you.

394
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:41,426
No matter the results,
don't stop doing what you're doing.

395
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:46,679
Cheers.

396
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:52,592
This is for you.

397
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,966
Thank you.

398
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:57,670
Keep going.

399
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:11,096
Oh.

400
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:13,411
Where did he go?

401
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:16,512
Who are you calling?

402
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:23,002
You, of course. I thought you left.

403
00:25:23,002 --> 00:25:24,977
I went to get some stuff in the neighborhood.

404
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:27,701
How was your audition?

405
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:32,045
I don't know. I probably won't pass.

406
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:38,475
Hey, don't make that face.

407
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,299
If you did your best,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

408
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:44,752
I'm discouraged.

409
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:50,742
I'm here for you.

410
00:25:56,918 --> 00:25:58,222
I'm hungry.

411
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,388
Then let's go eat something delicious.

412
00:26:01,388 --> 00:26:02,759
Okay.

[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

414
00:26:08,764 --> 00:26:10,139
Wait a moment.

415
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:13,170
Okay.

416
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,985
What's up, bro?

417
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:29,121
Are you at your dorm? I'm coming over.

418
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,705
Don't come.

419
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:34,245
You're going to interrupt my moments
with my special someone.

420
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:35,626
I have to go.

421
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:46,413
Here you go.

422
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:50,112
Wow. This is my favorite food support.

423
00:26:50,112 --> 00:26:51,658
Eat it up.

424
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:54,681
I have a surprise for you.

425
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:55,905
Really?

426
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,447
It's so yummy.

427
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,557
How come you're here?

428
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:25,642
You kept your key in the same place.

429
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:29,375
No, I mean, why are you here?

430
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,263
We promised to eat together, didn't we?

431
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:42,524
Um...

432
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:44,638
Don't tell me you've already eaten.

433

Where have you been?

436
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:11,874
I went to reflect on myself
why I scolded you so harshly.

437
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:13,874
Whose side are you on?

438
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:15,328
Are you his friend or mine?

439
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:16,717
Enough.

440
00:28:16,717 --> 00:28:17,879
Tae.

441
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:24,407
I think it was because I was upset with myself
for not doing well enough,

442
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:26,380
so I took it out on you.

443
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,723
I'm the worst.

444
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:30,048
I'm sorry.

445
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:37,554
Yeah. It's okay.

446
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:39,495
I know how you are.

447
00:28:39,495 --> 00:28:41,052
Don't worry.

448
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,585
But why were you being awkward just now?

449
00:28:44,585 --> 00:28:46,699
I thought you'd already eaten.

450
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:48,695
Well...

It smells so good.

How are we going to finish all this now?

457
00:29:15,728 --> 00:29:18,490
Your food is delicious and your plate is cute.

458
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,410
When did you buy it?

459
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,560
I didn't buy it. I made it.

460
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,264
- You made it yourself?
- Yeah.

461
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,061
So cute.

462
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:29,523
Okay. Which Moo is cuter?

463
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,470
This Moo or this Moo?

464
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,819
Give it to me. I'll wash it for you.

465
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:39,094
If you're going to wash it,

466
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:42,189
can you wash this Moo too?

467
00:29:42,189 --> 00:29:43,533
No need.

468
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:55,183
Oh my god.

469
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,241
It's clean now.

Now I need a doctor to give me CPR.

472
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,498
Sure.

So, are we going to eat two pots?

481

Why don't you call Moo to join us?

You're right.

This is too much for us to finish.

It's really a lot.

486
00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:19,654
- Hello?
- Tae.

487
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:21,095
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,936
I was late. I was in the wrong.

489
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:28,250
Not to mention, I foul-mouthed you.

490
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,202
Hey, no worries. I made a mistake too.

491
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:35,543
I was just going to call you.

He said I should invite you too.

Hold on, Moo.

No, no. Nothing at all.

Okay. You're with Kang.

Okay.

Tae, hold on. Don't hang up yet.

505

- What?

507

Hello, Master Moo.

Yes. We both happened to order mala hot pot.

It's really a lot.

511
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:23,789
Actually, you can invite Kang to join us.

512
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:27,202
No, I want to enjoy my sweet moments
and you can enjoy yours too.

You're going to get it from me.

- Fine.

What should I eat?

523
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:53,118
I'll start with the beef.

524
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:55,971
I'll put the vegetables in.

- No, you take it.

You take it.

00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:14,200
Why? Are you secretly crushing on me?

528

540
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,254
Good?

541
00:33:45,254 --> 00:33:46,526
Now feed me back.

542
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:50,817
♫ You are more than a friend ♫

543
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:53,209
♫ Can you be more than a friend? ♫

544
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:57,046
♫ You are more than a friend ♫

545
00:33:57,046 --> 00:34:00,820
♫ 'Cause all I need is you ♫

546
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,363
♫ What do you want me to do, me to do, baby? ♫

547
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:08,631
♫ What can I do when my heart is falling? ♫

548
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:13,895
Hey, bro.

549
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:15,172
You really came.

550
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:17,326
You really want to see
the person I'm hitting on, huh?

551
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:18,559
I saw him.

552
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,552
He sells rice and curry next to your dorm, right?

553
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:23,796
What? You were stalking me?

554
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:26,122
What do you think? He's cute, right?

555
00:34:26,122 --> 00:34:28,015
He's so stubborn but so cute.

556
00:34:28,015 --> 00:34:31,232
Yeah, he's cute.

557
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:34,684
- Kang is cute.
- Yes.

558
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,158
Hold on. Did I tell you his name?

559
00:34:40,229 --> 00:34:44,985
Remember I said I came here to film for my show?

560
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:46,567
Yeah.

561
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:50,007
Kang was my tour guide.

562
00:34:52,505 --> 00:34:54,871
But where did you go today and with whom?

563
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:56,371
Someone asked me to be a tour guide.

564
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,954
Come on. Let me see his face.

565
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:02,010
No. We're not together yet.

566
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,451
Don't steal him from me.
I know what you're trying to do.

567
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:05,951
I'm not going to steal him from you.

568
00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:08,764
I already have eyes on someone else.

569
00:35:08,764 --> 00:35:09,965
Who is it?

570
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:11,688
I'm not sure how things will go yet.

571
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:14,368
Once I am, I'll introduce him to you.

572
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:16,502
I got to go. I need to edit my video.

573
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,800
Don't tell me the guy you're interested in is...

574
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:22,999
Kang.

575
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:32,941
Hey. Don't give me that face.

576
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:34,643
How could that be?

577
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:37,756
You're overthinking.

578
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:39,869
Look at that frown.

579
00:35:41,545 --> 00:35:43,862
You just said Kang is cute.

580
00:35:45,135 --> 00:35:47,299
He's cute, but that's irrelevant.

581
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:51,476
I only met him once.
I'm not going to make a move or anything.

582
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:55,968
Bro, if something is going on with you,
you can tell me.

583
00:35:55,968 --> 00:35:58,752
I don't want this to come between us.

584
00:35:58,752 --> 00:36:00,738
I want to talk it out with you honestly.

585
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:03,347
Let's settle this once and for all. Okay?

586
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:08,499
Love really does make people grow up, huh?

587
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:13,472
Seeing how scary my rival is,
I don't dare hit on him anymore.

588
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:16,012
Don't joke with me. I'm serious.

589
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,594
Me too.

590
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:21,167
I don't have feelings for Kang.
You're overthinking.

591
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:24,811
Aren't you going to give that ice cream to Kang?

592
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:27,940
Yes. I should go. It's melting.

593
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,748
Moo's special someone is Kang?

594
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,572
Are you alright, Moo?

595
00:37:04,662 --> 00:37:07,105
Just lost in my thoughts.

596
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:09,002
Are you stressed about the audition?

597
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:12,597
Yes, I'm scared I'll fail.

598
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:16,503
You did your best.

599
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,444
Don't worry.

600
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:22,008
I believe you'll pass.

601
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,563
Thank you, Kang.

602
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:29,080
By the way, I want to predict our fortune.

603
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,493
Predict what?

604
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:37,318
By using moon blocks.
Those two red wooden blocks found at temples.

605
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:39,109
We make a wish and throw them.

606
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:42,105
If one block lands face down
and the other face up,

607
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:44,366
it means our wish will come true.

608
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:45,596
Have you seen them?

609
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:49,322
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

610
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:53,739
But you don't look like
you'd know those kinds of things.

611
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:57,969
Come on. I used to go to the temples
with my grandma often.

612
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:01,949
Anyway, the other day you already
blessed me with a forehead kiss.

613
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:04,531
Today, can you be my moon blocks?

614
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:11,706
Mr. Moon Blocks, will I pass the audition?

615
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,199
Yes.

616
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:23,025
Let's do it again. It's fun.

617
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:24,815
I'll pass the audition, right?

618
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:30,135
I said you will. Why do you
keep asking the same thing?

619
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:32,793
It's fun. I want to play this in my room.

620
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:33,995
You can't.

621
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:39,210
If I can't play this in my room,
let me ask one more question.

622
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,509
Mr. Moon Blocks,

623
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:46,158
Kang, do you love me?

624
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:03,215
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

625
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,414
♫ Then what word can express
how much I cherish you ♫

626
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:09,905
Mr. Moon Blocks, please answer me.
Do you love me?

627
00:39:09,905 --> 00:39:12,236
Do you love me? Please answer.

628
00:39:12,236 --> 00:39:13,890
Mr. Moon Blocks?

629
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,105
Do you love me? I want some encouragement.

630
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,375
Stop it.

631
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,025
Don't get too comfortable
just because I'm playing along.

632
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,775
So what?

633
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,637
♫ Oh e oh hey baby ♫

634
00:39:25,637 --> 00:39:28,219
♫ Oh Please tell me ♫

635
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:32,784
♫ I know you know but baby would you stay ♫

636
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:35,607
♫ Oh e oh hey baby ♫

637
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,105
♫ Oh Please tell me ♫

638
00:39:38,105 --> 00:39:41,466
♫ I know you know but baby could you say ♫

639
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,966
[A few days later]

640
00:39:56,587 --> 00:39:59,128
Why haven't we received any emails?

641
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,740
You just checked five minutes ago.

642
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:08,476
It's been almost a month,
but we've got no emails or calls.

643
00:40:08,476 --> 00:40:10,141
Not even unfamiliar numbers.

644
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,446
Have you received any calls
from unfamiliar numbers?

645
00:40:12,446 --> 00:40:14,386
Of course. Only in the form of friends.

646
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:16,440
- What friends?
- Scammer friends.

647
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,923
Did we fail the audition?

648
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:29,461
I think we definitely passed. Trust me.

649
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,838
Hey!

650
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:38,288
It's an unfamiliar number.

651
00:40:39,924 --> 00:40:42,557
Answer it for me. Hurry!

652
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:45,154
Damn, it's really an unfamiliar number.
It looks like the number on the page.

653
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:47,040
Answer it.

654
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,888
Damn, they're calling me too.

655
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:50,633
Come on. Let me answer it for you.

656
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:53,278
If it's a scammer, I'll tell them off.

657
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:55,044
- Go for it.
- Come on.

658
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,525
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm calling from the New Wave Project.

659
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,967
Is this Pheera Tiensuwan's number?

660
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:03,979
Yes.

661
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:06,749
You passed the audition, Pheera.

662
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:08,912
Really? Thank you so much.

663
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:12,192
Yos,

664
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:14,969
you passed the audition.

665
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:18,880
Really?

666
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:20,834
What about me?

667
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,254
I passed, right?

668
00:41:43,355 --> 00:41:44,807
Did I fail?

669
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,320
Tae.

670
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:51,254
Say it.

671
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,073
It's okay.

672
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,153
We can try again together next time.

673
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:10,793
- Tae.
- Don't follow me now.

674
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:15,061
I beg you.

675
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:40,481
Kang.

676
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:44,769
Hey, Moo. When did you get here?

677
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:46,956
What do you want to eat today?

678
00:42:46,956 --> 00:42:49,133
Do you want to eat kai yad sai instead of kai palo?

679
00:42:50,123 --> 00:42:51,472
Can I hug you?

680
00:42:55,259 --> 00:42:56,586
What's wrong?

681
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,989
I didn't pass the audition.

682
00:43:01,183 --> 00:43:02,551
I couldn't make it.

683
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:03,825
It's okay.

684
00:43:03,825 --> 00:43:05,643
Now I can't ask you to be my boyfriend.

685
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:08,243
Why did I fail?

686
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:10,668
Take it easy.

687
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:15,223
When I move abroad,

688
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:19,046
I won't see you anymore, right?

689
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:25,363
You will now.

690
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:26,761
Here I am.

691
00:43:29,643 --> 00:43:33,148
I'm still right here in front of you.

692
00:43:36,841 --> 00:43:39,185
We're still here together.

693
00:43:40,812 --> 00:43:44,622
Let's make the most of the time we have now.

694
00:43:45,695 --> 00:43:47,259
Okay.

695
00:43:48,399 --> 00:43:50,053
You like me, right?

696
00:43:52,086 --> 00:43:54,409
I more than like you.

697
00:43:54,409 --> 00:43:57,600
I've never met someone like you.

698
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:06,359
And I've never felt as strongly about anyone
as I do for you.

699
00:44:12,106 --> 00:44:17,248
But I'm not so sure about being boyfriends yet.

700
00:44:18,915 --> 00:44:20,720
Let me predict our fortune.

701
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,743
Will Moo and I...

702
00:44:30,673 --> 00:44:32,466
become boyfriends?

703
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:18,138
Even though you didn't pass the audition
and can't ask me to be your boyfriend,

704
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,283
I can ask you to be mine.

705
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:26,371
Will you be my boyfriend, Moo?

706
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:32,353
Yes, my Kang.

707
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:42,743
♫ It's too overwhelming to keep inside ♫

708
00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:51,673

709

Why didn't you give me a real kiss?

713
00:46:12,373 --> 00:46:14,308
Let's wait until you graduate high school.

714
00:46:22,987 --> 00:46:27,318
♫ I know you don't like if I call you my boo ♫

♫ Maybe I'll just replace it with your name ♫

717
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,519
♫ My boo is you, it's the same ♫

718
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:43,431
♫ I want to call you boo,
but only your name now should do ♫

719
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:45,831
Moo is new to this.
He's never had a boyfriend before.

720
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:47,388
I got everything planned.

721
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,849
I don't think we can do it all in one day.

722
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,420
Who says we'll do it all in one day?

723
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,810
I plan to do this with you
for the rest of my life.

724
00:46:53,465 --> 00:46:54,642
Are you shy?

725
00:46:54,642 --> 00:46:56,198
Besides love, my dream is on the rise.

726
00:46:56,198 --> 00:46:58,633
I want your team to audition again.

727
00:46:58,633 --> 00:47:00,246
Your opportunity has come.

728
00:47:00,246 --> 00:47:02,442
I think it's time to confess your feelings to Tae.

729
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:04,647
I like you.

730
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:08,154
Can I get a graduation gift?

731
00:47:08,154 --> 00:47:11,285
Even if you didn't ask, I'd give it anyway.
