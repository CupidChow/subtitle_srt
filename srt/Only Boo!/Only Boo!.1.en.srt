62

For as long as I can remember, I've loved dancing.

63
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,560
I got my inspiration from being on stage
and seeing the audience clap for me.

I discovered my dream in life.
My dream is to dance.

But I don't want a plan B.
My only goal is to become an idol.

104

It's my fault for being too easy on you
that you got used to it.

I let this go on for too long
that you became so stubborn.

110
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,970
Yes. You will move to a school out of town.

and fail to get into university,

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,080

My dad doesn't pay him a small salary.

171
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,962
You don't have to give him food every day.

172
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:29,855
But he still makes less money than us.

173
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,080
It's fine.

174
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,586
It's no big deal. My family happens to be rich.

175
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:35,280
Okay, rich kid.

176
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,300

That's not a small amount of money.

00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:43,302
It's only 40 baht to make the world a nicer place.
It's worth it.

179
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,894
How noble you are.

180
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:46,853
Of course, I am.

181
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,345
What's wrong with you?

182
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:07,855
Mom, is this really Nakhon Pathom?

183
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:11,767
I haven't seen Phra Pathom Chedi.
We didn't pass Jae Kaek's either.

184
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:18,630
You said we'd arrive in no time,
but you'd been speeding for three hours.

185
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,388
This is the right place.

186
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:24,500
You'll be far away from all the city distractions
and only focus on your studies.

187
00:12:47,638 --> 00:12:49,966
Are you sure there's a school around here?

188
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:53,079
Yes. It's not far. You can walk there.

189
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,328
Just head that way.

190
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:57,337
That way?

191
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:58,891
Yes.

192
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:00,891
Are you sure you're not punishing me too harshly?

193
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:04,559
Harshly? I chose what's best for you.

194
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,069
I went to this school too back in the day.

195
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:10,526
I graduated and became quite successful.

196
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:12,526
I walked to school.

197
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:17,055
While walking, I recited vocabulary
and the periodic table.

198
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:19,064
It was so good.

199
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:23,578
Don't make that face.
Nowadays is so much better than back then.

200
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:30,512
When I booked the dorm, the owner said
a convenience store was only a 20-minute walk.

201
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,900
Back in my days, it took me an hour
to go shopping in the city.

202
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,751
You'll be fine, right?

203
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,644
Yes. I'll be totally fine.

204
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,341
No sweat.

205
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:40,938
Definitely no sweat.

206
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:44,308
- I'm leaving then.
- Okay. Bye.

207
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:47,262
- See you.
- Bye-bye. Come visit me.

208
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:49,762
I'll have to check my schedule.

209
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,267
I'm leaving now.

210
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:01,399
You're leaving now?

211
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,539
I'm leaving.

212
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:04,547
Okay. Bye.

213
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:06,010
Love you.

214
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,422
When I run out of toothpaste,
I have to travel 20 minutes?

215
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:14,773
These are so damn heavy.

216
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:20,757
Hi.

217
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:23,082
My mom called and booked a room.

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,601
Oh, you're moving in, right?

219
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,739
Yes.

220
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:29,058
Just a moment.

221
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:32,401
The key.

222
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,800
5th floor. Room 501.

223
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,290
Your room will be to your left.

224
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,279
No noise after 10 p.m. That's it.

225
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:40,550
Thank you.

226
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:43,854
Where's the elevator?

227
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,382
There's none.

228
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:48,166
Take the stairs.

229
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,411
- 5th floor?
- Yes. 5th floor. It's only the 5th floor.

230
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:52,632
Oh.

231
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:55,582
Will you be alright, kid?
If not, keep going anyway.

232
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,961
This is easy. It's only five floors.

233
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,523
It's easy!

234
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,093
Only one floor to go. It's easy!

235
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,008
What did I bring?

236
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,233
Shit. This is the Zen way. So minimal.

237
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:47,147
Hey, this is too minimal.

238
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,840
What an absolute crap.

239
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,135
This is the only entertainment left in my life.

240
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,586
People in the past could live
without the internet. I'll survive too.

241
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,137
You can do it, Mok.

242
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,374
Luckily, I was careful
and didn't forget my shower cream.

243
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,284
But I didn't bring my shampoo.

244
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:11,308
Come on. I can do a 20-minute workout.

245
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:20,910
Shit. There's no tissue paper.

246
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,652
There's no water.

247
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:36,158
Three trips are enough. I'm not going there again.

248
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,905
I have no toothbrush. Why am I so forgetful?

249
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:46,586
[Mommy Kai's Rice and Curry Catering Service]

250
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:49,310
These are 50 each for two, with a side of eggs.

251
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,611
It'll be 100 baht as usual. The water is free.

252
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,120
- Here's 100 baht exact.
- Thanks. Please come again.

253
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,744
My mom asked me to
give you an offering envelope.

254
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:59,362
Thanks. I've received many envelopes this month.

255
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:01,700
Please come again.

256
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:05,415
Mom, you can leave it there. I'll do it.

257
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,709
No need.

258
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,709
Keep drawing. I'll clean up myself.

259
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,571
Here.

260
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,190
Can you put this in a drawer? I'll lie down a bit.

261
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,056
Excuse me.

262
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:41,558
Hmm?

263
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:43,643
Do you have a toothbrush for sale?

264
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:52,464
You want to buy a toothbrush
at a rice and curry restaurant?

265
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,346
It's okay if you don't have it.

266
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:58,488
I have it.

267
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,749
Just a moment.

268
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,548
It's surprisingly available.

269
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,288
Here.

270
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,301
Thank you.

271
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:26,216
- How much is this?
- 2 million.

272
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:28,303
Huh? 2 million?

273
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:30,665
If you don't have that much money,
you don't have to pay.

274
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:34,775
A toothbrush shouldn't cost as much as 2 million.

275
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:37,069
Stop. Don't move.

276
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:07,843
It's just a mosquito.

277
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,574
You startled me.

278
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:14,140
You could've told me there was a mosquito.
I would've slapped it.

279
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,170
Why would you slap it? You can just shoo it away.

280
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:21,499
Can I help you with anything else?

281
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:25,727
Is there a bicycle shop around here?

282
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:30,404
What? He looks like he doesn't want to tell me.

283
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,784
Damn! This is so far.

284
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:36,744
I thought he said it was around here.

285
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,898
What's wrong with my internet?

286
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:52,824
Which way do I go next?

287
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:57,878
I don't know.

288
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:00,733
It's hot.

289
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:03,765
Oh, hey.

290
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,957
I thought you said it was around here.
I can't find it.

291
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,632
I knew you would get lost. Get on.

292
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:13,267
- Are you giving me a ride?
- I guess I rode here to say hi.

293
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:14,793
Hurry up. It's hot.

294
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:15,932
Thank you.

295
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,984
Oh, this really is a bicycle shop.

296
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,893
I told you it was nearby.

297
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:36,961
Thank you. You're so kind.

298
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:39,080
No. This will be 2 million.

299
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,659
Plus another 2 million
for the toothbrush from earlier.

300
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:41,969
You're kidding, right?

301
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:50,784
I didn't expect you to believe it.

302
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:54,610
You should smile a lot.
You look so cute when you smile.

303
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:57,928
Why is my face your problem?

304
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:01,241
Just go in. I'll wait outside.

305
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:02,346
Okay.

306
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,878
I look kinda cute when I smile.

307
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:21,914
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

308
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,530
What do you think? This is so cool, isn't it?

309
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,632
If you want to look cool, let me know.

310
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:31,984
I'll let you borrow it.

311
00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:33,694
Do you even know how to ride it?

312
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:34,938
Yes.

313
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:39,164
- Can your feet touch the ground?
- Of course.

314
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:51,270
I'm not going to fall off.

315
00:21:57,237 --> 00:22:00,112
Hey, hey, hey!

316
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:03,871
Hey!

317
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,915
- I'm sorry.
- I should be the one to say sorry.

318
00:22:15,915 --> 00:22:17,732
Why would you say sorry? It was an accident.

319
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:20,107
- But you apologized to me first.
- That's true.

320
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:23,335
I was a bit too careless. I'm not used to this.

321
00:22:23,335 --> 00:22:24,729
Off you go.

322
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:27,001
I can't go. You're holding my hands.

323
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:31,268
I have to go take care of something.

324
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,967
Do you remember the way back?

325
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,967
Yes, I'll be totally fine.

326
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:38,720
Be careful though. My bike is powerful.
You might not be able to keep up.

327
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:53,521
It was an accident. It was an accident.
It was an accident.

328
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:54,712
Let's go.

329
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:04,469
Hey, what are you doing?

330
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:06,362
Shrimp paste fried rice?

331
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:07,593
Cute.

332
00:23:08,728 --> 00:23:10,614
Me?

333
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:12,362
I meant the picture.

334
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:17,764
If only you'd started school this year,
you'd do well.

335
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,528
Stop talking about this.

336
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,383
I made my decision a long time ago.

337
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,053
Kang, come help me carry...

338
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:27,202
- Okay.
- Neth!

339
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:28,138
Have you eaten?

340
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:29,913
Not yet, Mom. I'm hungry.

341
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:31,744
Let me fix you up.

342
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,840
Don't cook for her, Mom,
or she'll eat up all the rice in the cooker.

343
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,026
This one is a greedy eater.

344
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,825
You're so mean to your friend.

345
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:39,174
Can I have two fried eggs?

346
00:23:39,174 --> 00:23:40,694
You got it.

347
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:48,032
By the way, where did you go?

348
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:50,385
I dropped someone off at the bicycle shop.

349
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:53,592
Who?

350
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:55,158
I don't know.

351
00:23:55,158 --> 00:24:00,432
He randomly walked in here and
asked if I had a toothbrush for sale.

352
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:03,675
Then he also asked me
if there's a bicycle shop nearby.

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,026
Oh, that boy in a green shirt, right?

354
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:10,934
Yes.

355
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:12,392
He's my new tenant.

356
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:15,432
He's from Bangkok.
His mom just dropped him off this morning.

357
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:18,598
But it seems to me his mom sent him here
to discipline him.

358
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:20,432
He looks like a troublemaker.

359
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:22,183
Discipline?

360
00:24:22,183 --> 00:24:25,432
When I met him, he didn't seem like a bad person.

361
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:29,005
Oh, you innocent guy.

362
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:32,793
Even you, who seem like a good guy,
have a bad mouth.

363
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:34,793
You're no different.

364
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:35,893
Neth.

365
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,000
- Neth, dear.
- Yes?

366
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,273
- Your rice is ready. It's warm and nice.
- Thank you, Mom.

367
00:24:40,273 --> 00:24:42,232
See, Mom? She's going to suck us dry.

368
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,915
Two fried eggs, right? Here you go.
Can you really finish it?

369
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:47,742
- Yes, I can. Thank you.
- Your body is still in great shape.

00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:01,395
Thank you.

372
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:16,953
Why is he not back yet?

373
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:24,552
Hey. What happened?

374
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:28,431
A frog ran in front of me.
I veered off and the chain came off.

375
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:32,449
I also got this wound.

376
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,127
You have to live with it.

377
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:38,590
The young frogs are impatient around here.
They always run in front of people's vehicles.

378

Thank you. If it weren't for you,
I'd be in a tough situation.

Hey. Where are you taking my bike?

Yes.

- Yeah.

Come on. Let me help.

Thank you for helping me and
dropping me off all the way here.

390

Do you have something in your room
to clean your wound?

391

See you later then.

392
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,789
Go put your bike away. I'll wait at my restaurant.

393
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:13,980
Okay.

394
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:24,040
You're overreacting. I'll put it away myself.

395
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:32,031
He's quite kind.

396
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,934
Ouch. That stings.

397
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,394
It will sting a bit.

398
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:03,984
It hurts.

399
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:05,954
Don't move.

400
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,315
Done.

401
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:43,872
Thank you. If it weren't for you,
I'd be in a bad condition.

402
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:48,178
I was just worried your wound would rot
and you'd have to cut off your arm.

403
00:28:48,178 --> 00:28:50,527
The doctors are busy around here.

404
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:52,363
I don't want to give them more work.

405
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:00,314
- Hey.
- Hmm?

406
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:02,301
Your restaurant is still open, right?

407
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:04,704
Of course. Are you hungry?

408
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:05,791
Yeah.

409
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:11,591
Wow.

410
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,632
This is my dream fried egg.

411
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:15,270
Why are you so skilled?

412
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,070
Calm down. It's just a fried egg.

413
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:19,373
I'm serious.

414
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:22,393
Just by looking at it,
I can tell it's a crispy fried egg.

415
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,664
Look at this.

416
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:26,480
The egg yolk is undercooked.

417
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,978
This is the correct fried egg
by international standards.

418
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:30,898
This is not a waste of being a fried egg.

419
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:39,869
It's so yummy.

420
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:42,348
Did your mom leave you with a phone
when you were a kid?

421
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,391
Your reaction is so over the top.

422
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:46,713
It's just a fried egg,
but you rave so much about it.

423
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:49,274
You're not originally from Nakhon Pathom, right?

424
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:50,368
No.

425
00:29:51,144 --> 00:29:53,166
I just moved here from Bangkok.

426
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,953
I transferred here for 12th grade.

427
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:56,640
So you're sent here to correct your behavior.

428
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,400
You talk like you knew.

429
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,908
This is literally so delicious.

430
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:04,435
I'm not kidding.

431
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:20,913
How much is the food?

432
00:30:20,913 --> 00:30:23,563
I'd usually charge 1,000 baht
but you said it's delicious,

433
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:25,335
so I'm only charging you 45 baht.

434
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:26,513
Alright.

435
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,835
- Do you accept a bank transfer?
- Sure.

436
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:37,467
But I don't know if the internet signal is good.

437
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,583
The signal at your restaurant
is better than in my room.

438
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:43,634
I don't want to complain,
but there's only one bar upstairs.

439
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,237
I'll find an excuse to come
and use the internet here again.

I miss you.

444
00:31:04,937 --> 00:31:10,081
Mom, can you transfer money to me?
I spent all the money to buy a new bike.

445
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:11,759
How is that possible?

446
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,388
Your account has like 10,000,

447
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:16,404
and I already transferred
an additional 5,000 for this month.

448

You're not supposed to spend your time going out.

The bicycle is an essential item.

Without it, I'd have to walk until my legs hurt.

456
00:31:36,787 --> 00:31:39,210
I don't know and I won't give you any more money.

dressing your wound, and the food.

fixed my bike, dressed my wound,

Oh.

You're drawing our restaurant?

I'm practicing coloring.

532
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:32,668
It's quite hard.

533
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:35,721
If you mess up on coloring on
this kind of paper, you can't fix it.

534
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,772
You're right.

- I want a tablet.
- A tablet?

537
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:48,279
What would you use a tablet for?
You just draw casually.

Mom, how many times have I told you
I don't draw casually?

539
00:37:56,959 --> 00:38:01,782
Are you serious about getting into art school?

540

Your mom just wants you to take time
to think about this.

Your last semester grades from
your previous school weren't very good.

579
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,499
But I think I did much better
than when I was in grade 11.

My mom gave me an ultimatum
to study hard and not get distracted.

and reality at the same time, right?
