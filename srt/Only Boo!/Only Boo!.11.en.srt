The contract says I can't date.

6
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:22,634
So what do we have to do?

7
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:25,737
We just have to pretend we don't know each other
when we're outside.

8
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,840
That's enough to hide it from people.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,440
Someone dug up a clip of you
with your boyfriend and leaked it.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,360
The company has found out
about you and Moo dating in secret.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,779
We'll get through this together.

12
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:38,080
Let's break up.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,544
Kang, don't let go of my hand. Kang!

14
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:42,960
- Who gave me this?
- One of your fans.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,016
Did you draw it yourself?

16
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:46,797
I saw him draw at a university festival.

17
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,214
Which university?

19
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:59,741
Wow, Jang. I can't believe
they gave us food support as a couple.

20
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:02,706
I know, right? I just saw it too. This is cute.

21
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:04,226
I knew there would be.

22
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:09,134
You two are inseparable.
I knew someday people would ship you together.

23
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:13,119
Hello?

24
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:15,850
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

25
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,807
Who gave me this?

26
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:19,752
One of your fans.

27
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:21,071
He dropped it just now.

28
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:22,669
- Did he leave just now?
- Yes.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,161
I can't eat anything.
I can't eat carbs. I can't eat sweets.

30
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:29,920
Payos, how about we take some photos
to thank the fans?

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,679
- Sure.
- Great.

32
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:35,704
Hey. You don't need to take photos of the food.

33
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:39,539
At this rate, just take photos
of yourselves together.

34
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:43,666
Alright. Could you take photos of me and Payos?

35
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,804
Here.

36
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,603
Let's go.

37
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:49,279
Come here.

38
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:51,550
I'll go do something else outside.

39
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,800
Would you like to eat anything?
Grab whatever you want.

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,702
Take the burger too.

41
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:57,643
I can't eat it.

42
00:01:57,643 --> 00:01:58,935
Come on.

43
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,355
Ready?

44
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:07,943
3, 2, 1.

45
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:13,178
Okay.

46
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,752
Potae, I think we should
take a thank you video too.

47
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:24,870
Go ahead.

48
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,600
Thank you so much for your food support
for me and Payos.

49
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,296
These are all Payos' favorites.

50
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,826
These are Jang's favorites too.

51
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:35,282
I'll steal all from him.

52
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:37,220
Don't do that.

53
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:43,878
Alright. Let me see.

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,148
- Payos, look.
- Where did you run off to?

55
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,490
I know where Kang is.

56
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,475
I'm finally going to see Kang.

57
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,624
Kang, what?

58
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:04,520
Kang definitely drew this. I remember his style.

59
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,426
I just ran to the fan.

60
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:10,675
He said he hired him to draw this
at a university festival.

61
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:12,098
The festival is on today.

62
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:14,494
If I make it there in time,
I'm definitely going to see Kang.

63
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,479
- Let's go.
- Yes.

64
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,322
Are you really going to see him, Moo?

65
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:30,556
Jang, he and I are really not together anymore.

66
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,083
I haven't talked to him for a year.

67
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,563
If you don't believe me, you can check my phone.

68
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:38,146
No need.

69
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,683
I just miss him. I just want to see him.
Can't I do that?

70
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:48,746
You do know there are limits
to what you can do, right?

71
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,856
Yes, I do. I promise I won't get
our band in trouble.

72
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:58,398
Then hurry there and come back quickly.

73
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,779
I will. Thank you, Jang.

74
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:08,920
Moo, I want to go with you,
but I have singing practice with Jang.

75
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,981
- It's okay.
- You don't have to go with him. I will.

76
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,567
I'm free today.

77
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,938

- Bye.

00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:43,697
Come here.

81
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:46,591
When will you talk to Yos the same way again?

82
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:48,052
It's been a year already.

83
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:53,621
I want to talk to him the same way.
I thought we were back to normal.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,701
And... what are your feelings now?

85
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,770
Friends?

86
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,931
Yeah.

87
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:14,021
Just friends?

88
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:17,107
But it turns out we aren't.

89
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:26,162
As you can see, he ends up
being closer to Jang than me.

90
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:28,240
So I don't care anymore.

91
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,192
I don't think Yos has feelings for Jang.

92
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,060
But I think Jang does.

93
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,000
Jang is the senior.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,919
He knows the rules. He won't break them.

95
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,517
He just takes care of all of us.

96
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:42,134
When I'm sick, he takes care of me too.

97
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:43,674
I don't think so.

00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,888

Let's talk about you and Kang.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,047
I thought you said
you wouldn't think about him again.

102
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:56,301
Actually, I have always thought about him.

103
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,253
I just didn't tell you.

104
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:05,256
It's not like that. It's not that
I don't see you as a friend.

105
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:08,310
I just didn't want to talk about it.
It makes me sad.

Are you really going to break up with me, Kang?

111
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:41,983
Sorry, the number you've dialed
is not available at this moment.

112
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:44,587
I tried every way to contact Kang.

113
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,780
I looked for him.

But I couldn't find him.

117
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,932
I thought I was definitely going
to find him at my university,

118
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:15,665
but I didn't.

119
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:20,246
I heard that he withdrew from
studying at the same place as me.

120
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,825
I'm sure he did that to avoid me.

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,388
You know, you've been with me
since the day I had no one

122
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:41,407

00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:49,776
I've missed being near you.

Kissing you.

I love you too.

130
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,170
I promise.

131
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:14,929
In the end, he let go of my hand.

132
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:42,683
I get you. It must not have been easy.

133
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,561
It's okay. I'm going to see him soon.

134
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:50,182
Let's go.

00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:04,537

Can we get a photo with you?

150
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:50,130
- You're so cute.
- Thank you so much.

I think he's still here somewhere.

00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,451
I have an idea.

00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,559
he will see me.

00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,420

There's this song I want to sing to someone.

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,325
Even though I don't know if he's here or not,
I want him to hear it.

165
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:44,985
Because this song was inspired by him.

I'm okay with the design.

211
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:13,504
Shone, can you start the car? Now!

212
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:15,514
- What?
- I'll tell you in the car.

213
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:18,513
Oh, okay. I'll call you back. Okay.

214
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:26,734
Moo!

215
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:29,379
Moo!

216
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:35,385
Where were you running to?

217
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:38,265
Kang came to watch me earlier. He really came.

218
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,357
I ran after him closely.

219
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:45,145
Damn it. I missed my chance again.

220
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:47,671
At least you know where he's studying now.

221
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:49,548
There's always a next time.

222
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,771
Was that some kind of event at your university?

223
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,616
Thank you.

224
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:00,952
It's a festival.

225
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:05,408
Each faculty set up booths to sell stuff.
There was also a concert.

226
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,832
Did something happen? You looked worried earlier.

227
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:17,513
I saw Moo at the university.

228
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:24,334
Are you okay?

229
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:27,208
We didn't talk.

230
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:31,290
I got away in time.

231
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,124
It's for the best.

232
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:36,555
You've managed to avoid him for a year.

233
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,514
Come on. Let's eat. Let me prepare it for you.

234
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:44,859
Thank you.

236
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:53,583
I'm done with classes for today. How are you, Mom?

237
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,785
When I'm not home, don't sneak out to sell food.

238
00:18:56,785 --> 00:19:00,243
If you hurt your back,
no one will take you to the doctor.

239
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,465
I'm not complaining. I'm worried about you.

240
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:05,682
Talk later. I'm going back to my dorm now.

241
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:06,903

246
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:33,351
Watch out.

247
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:37,335
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

248
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:39,603
Shone.

249
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,684
How are you, Kang? It's been a long time.

250
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,642
I'm good.

251
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:54,174
Do you still go to the same faculty?

252
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:57,491
Or did you change faculties
when you switched universities?

253
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,686
Still the same. Painting.

254
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,383
How long has it been since you last saw Moo?

255
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:09,224
You almost crashed into their popcorn earlier.

256
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:14,280
Several months.

257
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,247
You guys don't talk at all?

258
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:24,458
Moo has become an idol like he dreams of.

259
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:29,115
I have to live my life, focus on my studies,

260
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:32,164
do what I love, and pursue my own dreams too.

261
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:37,502
That's good. Keep moving forward.

262
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:40,793
Yes.

263
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:45,431
Are you going anywhere after this?

264
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:46,367
Well...

265
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:49,199
How about grabbing something
to eat with me? My treat.

266
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:53,498
No, thank you. I don't want to trouble you.

267
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,093
I parked in front of your faculty.
[Four months earlier]

268
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:02,918
- Hi, Shone.
- Hi.

269
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,713
Did you call me because you need anything?

270
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:08,414
Oh, I have something for you.

271
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,041
I've wanted to give you this for so long,

272
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,902
but back then you were with Moo
so I was too scared.

273
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,846
Since you two ended things some time ago,
I guess I can give it to you now.

274
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,831
Though you cannot be in Moo's dream,
please know that you always have me in yours.

275
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:15,298
By the way, would eating with just the two of us
make people think we're dating?

276
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:18,805
Never mind what people think.

277
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:25,539
As long as we know in our hearts
that we're not together.

278
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,468
Whoa.

279
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,505
Don't you want what people think
to come true at all?

280
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:37,676
Not again, Shone.

281
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:41,022
I'm just flirting a bit.

282
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:43,576
Just in case you want to change your mind
and give me a chance.

283
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:46,053
Fine. I'll stop flirting
and talk about work instead.

284
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:48,775
Have you seen what I sent you?

285
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:49,947
Yes, I have.

286
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:54,461
I want a new logo for my show to give that vibe.

287
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:58,899
If you have any ideas, you can send me your draft.

288
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:01,378
Sure.

289
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,364
There's congee in the fridge
in case you're hungry when you get back late.

290
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,291
Don't. No...

291
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,442
It's a bad dream, Tae.

292
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:53,788
It's just a dream.

293
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:58,500
It's just a dream, okay?

294
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,476
Did I have a bad dream again?

295
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,029
Yeah.

299
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,565

Please don't leave me.

In my dream,

305
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:53,585
you fought with me and left me.

306
00:24:54,898 --> 00:24:56,900
You won't leave me, right?

307
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,354

I've been looking for you for a whole year.

Why have you been looking for me?

331

I missed you.

334
00:27:44,785 --> 00:27:46,387
We already broke up.

335
00:27:46,387 --> 00:27:48,186
It was over a long time ago.

336
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:56,459
Kang, did you really not miss me?

337
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,539
I've been avoiding you and cutting contact.

338
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:06,100
Everything I've been doing should
give you a clear enough answer.

339
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:12,026
Come on, Kang. I know you're lying.

340
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:21,992
Accept the truth, Moo.

341
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,999
You and I are nothing to each other anymore.

Aren't you going to eat it?
Why do you keep fiddling with it?

348
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:03,991
Do you think I was too heartless
for saying that to Moo?

349
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:06,561
Heartless. Mean. Evil.

350
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:10,074
Hey, I'm your friend.
Why did you say that to me?

351
00:29:10,074 --> 00:29:13,606
You asked me if you were heartless.
I just gave you my answer.

352
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:17,431
But I understand that you want Moo to move on.

353
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:19,996
I get that.

354
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:24,824
Sometimes, we have to act heartless,
even though we don't want to.

355
00:29:26,703 --> 00:29:27,928
Yeah.

356
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:30,134
What about you, though?

357
00:29:30,944 --> 00:29:35,572
You want Moo to move on from you,
but have you moved on from him?

358
00:29:40,961 --> 00:29:43,360
This is your wallet, right, Moo?

359
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,256
Right? Okay. May I ask for your consent to open it?

360
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:51,053
- Of course.
- I can open it? Okay. Please let me.

361
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:57,914
You have one, two, three, four hundred baht.

362
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,460
I missed you.

363
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,921
I want you to be a part of my success.

364
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:05,956
Did you really not miss me?

365
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:10,233
How could I not miss you, Moo?

366
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:17,152
Oh, this must be your childhood photo, Moo.

367
00:30:17,152 --> 00:30:18,665
You had such a straight face here.

368
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:20,969
You're so cute with this straight face.

369
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:25,455
See? He's so cute.

370
00:30:25,455 --> 00:30:27,167
- You had a straight face.
- Yes.

371
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,958
I wasn't very friendly in the past.

372
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,323
Now that I've grown up,
I'm friendly with everyone.

373
00:30:31,944 --> 00:30:34,779
Look at that bright smile.

374
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:54,890
You look so cute.

375
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:58,275
Can we exchange our photos?

376
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,051
Sure.

377
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:57,505
♫ I still miss you ♫

378
00:31:57,505 --> 00:32:01,275
♫ Ever since you walked away ♫

379
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:05,408
♫ It's been harder than I can say ♫

380
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:10,817
♫ In the end, I'm the one left behind ♫

381
00:32:10,817 --> 00:32:17,430
♫ With the same ticket to where we hoped to find ♫

382
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,559
♫ You've gone from my life ♫

383
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,981
♫ I end up back at square one ♫

384
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:32,640
♫ Station No. 0 without you next to me ♫

385
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:40,640
♫ Nothing is left, only emptiness ♫

386
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:57,271
Kang, are you really going to leave me like this?

387
00:33:02,426 --> 00:33:04,113
Kang.

388
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:08,994
Kang.

389
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:12,952
I've been avoiding you and cutting contact.

390
00:33:12,952 --> 00:33:17,645
Everything I've been doing should
give you a clear enough answer.

391
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,248
Accept the truth, Moo.

392
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:25,278
You and I are nothing to each other anymore.

393
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:27,638
Are you really going to leave me like this?

394
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:31,472
Kang.

395
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:36,297
Hi. We're GUMP.

396
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:38,279
Come meet the four of us at our fan meeting.

397
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,814
Get up close to the stage.

398
00:33:39,814 --> 00:33:42,757
Hope to see many of you there.
We'll be waiting.

399
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:43,760
See you soon.

400
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,374
Bye.

401
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,034
Cut.

402
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,122
Next, we'll run through your blocking
with the music on the stage.

403
00:33:56,122 --> 00:33:58,237
I'll come get you later.
You can take a break for now.

404
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:00,116
- Okay.
- Thank you.

405
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:02,803
Let's take a break.

406
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:16,897
I'm going to buy coffee.
Does anyone want anything?

407
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:19,922
Can I go with you?

408
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:20,986
Sure.

409
00:34:22,156 --> 00:34:23,660
Do you want anything, Moo?

410
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,065
No, thank you.

411
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,410
- Tae?
- No, I'm good.

412
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,801
The two of you should go alone,

413
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:32,711
so when people see you, it can become content.

414
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:34,688
Create some moments. JangPayos moments.

415
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:36,038
Come on.

416
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:39,432
You guys are JangPayos, okay?

417
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:40,721
Off you go.

418
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:42,042
Come on.

419
00:34:55,736 --> 00:34:59,608
[No results found. Try another search.]

420
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:03,190
Do you want to be alone
or do you want me to stay with you?

421
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:12,247
Let me stay with you then.

422
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:15,179
If you want to be alone, tell me.

423
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:25,977
Did he block you?

424
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:27,891
He sure did.

425
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:30,313
I just want to see what he's doing.

426
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:39,844
It'd be great if you knew his password.

427
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:41,856
- It would.
- Yeah.

428
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:44,687
What did you say?

429
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:46,679
It'd be great if you knew his password.

430
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:49,849
Wait, I know it.

431
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:51,082
- You do?
- Yes.

432
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,826
I created that password for him myself.

433
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:55,081
Then log in.

434
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,808
Is it the correct one? I got in.

435
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,698
Here it is.

436
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:01,905
Yeah.

437
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:12,841
Hi, everyone. I'm starting a new show.

438
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:14,314
I can't tell you what it is yet,

439
00:36:14,314 --> 00:36:17,934
but I can show you the face of the guy
helping me with the logo.

440
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:23,042
See you soon.

441
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:26,063
Who is he?

442
00:36:26,063 --> 00:36:30,528
I'm doing this because I'm worried about you.
Don't get me wrong, okay?

443
00:36:30,528 --> 00:36:32,600
Accept the truth, Moo.

444
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,760
You and I are nothing to each other anymore.

445
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,862
Hey. What's wrong?

446
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:43,031
I can't take it, Tae.

447
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:44,700
Hey. Calm down.

448
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,442
I'll get you water. Calm down.

449
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:47,687
Just a moment.

450
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:02,122
Bro, we need to talk.

451
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,500
Moo, here's your water.

452
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:30,650
What's wrong, Tae?

453
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,192
Here's your water.

454
00:37:32,192 --> 00:37:33,543
Thanks.

455
00:37:37,108 --> 00:37:38,806
I got you guys coffee.

456
00:37:39,954 --> 00:37:42,281
This is for you, Moo.

457
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:43,755
Thank you.

458
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:45,274
This is for you, Potae.

459
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:49,723
I'm not thirsty. I don't want to have to pee.

460
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:08,153
♫ Every time you look at me ♫

461
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,555
♫ I lose control and go crazy ♫

462
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:17,171
♫ Like clock hands ticking slowly ♫

463
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:22,828
♫ It happens every time ♫

464
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:26,599
♫ What's this symptom? I still wonder ♫

465
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,263
I can't tell you what it is yet,

466
00:38:28,263 --> 00:38:31,595
but I can show you the face of the guy
helping me with the logo.

467
00:38:32,722 --> 00:38:34,391
Accept the truth, Moo.

468
00:38:34,391 --> 00:38:36,960
You and I are nothing to each other anymore.

469
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,754
I'm doing this because I'm worried about you.
Don't get me wrong.

470
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:59,293
Turn off the music! Turn off the music!

471
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:00,411
Oh gosh!

472
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:01,605
Tae, don't go closer.

473
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,647
We don't know where he's injured.

474
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,013
Moo!

475
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:08,138
Moo!

476
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:11,392
Moo!

477
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:13,503
Moo!

478
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:14,815
Moo!

479
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,980
Moo!

480
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,161
Moo!

481
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,414
You're awake.

482
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:51,001
Kang.

483
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,061
Is it really you?

484
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:56,394
Kang.

485
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:03,044
I'm sorry.

486
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,698
Please don't move.

487
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:11,080
Okay.

488
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,946
I love you so much, Kang.

489
00:40:18,946 --> 00:40:20,773
I love you the most.

490
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:23,890
I love you too, Moo.

491
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:28,948
I've missed you so much.

492
00:40:32,216 --> 00:40:35,177
I don't want to be alone anymore.
♫ I still miss you ♫

I'm here. Don't cry anymore.

496
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,319
I won't disappear again.

497
00:41:10,663 --> 00:41:12,319
Stop crying already.

498
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,617
Okay.

499
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:29,555
I don't know who has been sending these for a year.

500
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,815
I was going to throw them away.

501
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:35,124
If I keep being near you,
we can never be friends.

502
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:36,376
I'm moving out.

503
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:41,458
The summit without you means nothing to me.

504
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,570
You've never been able to forget Moo, right?

505
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:47,442
It must be your fan. It only talks to you.

506
00:41:49,294 --> 00:41:50,854
It's you, right, Kang?
