I love you, too.

I love you so much.

00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,349
I love you the most in the universe.

184
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,182
Why am I crying?

185
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,480
Don't cry.

186
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:32,167
I wish we could hold hands like this forever.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,759
I'll never let go of your hand.

188
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,872
I promise.

[Dance among the stars]

190
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:02,463
Whoa.

191
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:04,468
New Zealand?

192
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:07,164
I thought it'd be Bangkok and another city.

193
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:12,118
Are you okay?

194
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:14,802
Not that distance is an obstacle,

195
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:16,850
but he'll be away for many years.

196
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,351
It'll be so tough.

197
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:27,696
I used to be fearful and scared of many things,
only staying in my safe zone.

198
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,205
I don't want to be like that anymore.

199

Now I know how I feel...

200
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:45,207
and I trust my feelings.

201
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:52,820
I just want to love him like this
for as long as I can.

202
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:58,411
Yeah. I believe you can do it.

If you're sad and need someone to lean on,
I'll comfort you.

Up to you.

If you want to ghost me, just do it!
You jerk! Asshole!

224
00:14:57,901 --> 00:14:59,441
What did you make me do?

225
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:03,588
She hung up.

226
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,532
- She did?
- Yeah.

227
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,438
I got scolded for nothing.

228
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:09,473
What did she say?

229
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:11,328
You jerk! Asshole!

230
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,769
Her words, not mine.

231
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,142
Sorry.

232
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:16,552
Yeah.

233
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:19,769
But what did you do to make her
scold you like that?

234
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:22,577
I didn't do anything. I just didn't
pick up her calls for two weeks.

235
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:23,474
You deserved it.

236
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:25,769
If you don't want to talk to her, just say so.

237
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,475
If I knew how to say that,
I would've done it already.

How did you survive until now?

239
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:34,887
I always asked Payos to talk to those girls
but he's busy today,

240
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:37,986
so I made you do it instead
when you came here just in time.

But I'm really happy for you.

Okay.

306
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,762
So he's only doing this because you asked?

307
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:27,395
I guess so.

308
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:30,216

Yeah, I get it.

317
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:56,193
People who work hard for something
often feel pressured.

318
00:19:56,193 --> 00:20:01,760
On the other hand, people who do it just for fun
always get chosen.

319
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,381
Do we pressure ourselves too much?

320
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:06,521
I think so.

321

As Yos said, he just does this for fun.

322
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,077
His doing this for fun almost made me go crazy.

323
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:16,810
I had to spend a long time convincing him.
At first, he said he wouldn't go.

324
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,554
I was so mad, you know?

325
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:23,981
I tried so hard for the opportunity,
while he got it but didn't want to grab it.

326
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:27,500
That idiot. Actually, I wanted
to scold him more harshly.

Tae,

328
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,934
you should speak more nicely to Yos.

00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,267
Why?

330
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:38,471
He loves you.

331
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:43,111
Yeah. I love him too.

332
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,892
Now you know.

333
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:49,303
I got to go.

334
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:50,538

If you want something, you work hard for it.
If you want him to love you, you hit on him.

359
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,760
That's so sweet.

360
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,999
What would you like to eat?
This meal is on me.

361
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,609
Can I have Panang curry?

362
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,892
Hey. You're not supposed to give away food.

363
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:05,901
I'll treat you some other day.
My boyfriend is strict.

364
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:07,295
Stop talking.

365
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:09,256
Go to class. I'll sell food myself.

366
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,188
Come on. I only have a few months left with you.

367
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:17,611
Let me help you.
This is one of the things I want to do with you.

368
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:20,560
Help my boyfriend sell food.

369
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,587
You can help me at the park this evening,
so we can spend a long time together.

370
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:33,556
Okay, boo.

371
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:36,563
Let me return the cap
to this handsome owner of the stall.

372
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:41,896
- Go.
- Help me take off my apron first.

373
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:44,364
- Turn around.
- No, I'll stand like this.

374
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:56,529
I won't sell to anyone who screams.

375
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:58,916
It's okay. I will. Keep screaming.

376
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:10,243
So much for our sweet moments.

377
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:11,893
He really killed my vibe.

378
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:15,060
You chose to let him come along.

379
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,440
No, more like he's clinging to me.

380
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,943
Now I can't be lovey-dovey with you.

381
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,530
Kang, thank you so much.

382
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,815
If it wasn't for your food,
I'd have starved to death.

383
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,284
Now that you're done eating, go.

384
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,252
Leave.

385
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:33,578
Would you like some more, Tae?
Is that enough food?

386
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,574
I'm good.

387
00:23:34,574 --> 00:23:37,695
Kang, don't tell him that. He's a big eater.

388
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,994
Tell me honestly.

389
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:45,456
He's so clingy to you. Are you dating already?

390
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:49,448
It's as you see it.
[Showing off]

391
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:51,774
He wouldn't leave me alone
even when we weren't dating.

392
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:54,806
Hey, Payos.

393
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:56,245
Our artist-to-be.

394
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:59,014
Have a seat. Do you want some water?
Let me get it for you.

395
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:00,413
You don't have to.

396
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:01,677
You're not troubling me. Have a seat.

397
00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:02,646
Sit down.

398
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:04,409
How's it going?

399
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,785
- Your artist aura is shining.
- Let me give you a massage.

400
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:09,810
Just by seeing your face, I know
you're a great singer and dancer.

401
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,195
How's it going?

402
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:15,090
What do they want you to do
now that you already signed?

403
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:21,528
I... didn't sign it.

404
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,692
I...

405
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:32,649
I came to audition with my friends.

406
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:37,112
Passing alone would make me feel bad.

407
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,256
I'm sorry. I'd like to withdraw from this.

408
00:24:41,256 --> 00:24:43,222
Seriously, Yos?

409
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:48,336
Then something unexpected happened.

410
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,686
Payos, don't go yet.

411
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:53,769
I'm really sorry,

412
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:56,185
but my friends and I
have always fought for this together.

413
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:59,675
I don't want to leave them behind.

414
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:04,264
But I don't want you and your friends' effort
to pay off anywhere else.

415
00:25:04,264 --> 00:25:06,742
If I give you another chance,

416
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:08,443
will you give it a try?

417
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:12,882
I want your team to audition again.

418
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:14,664
I saw something in the three of you.

419
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,885
Don't worry.

420
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:20,808
- What?
- Are you serious?

421
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:23,138
Woo!

422
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:24,799
Did Jang talk to you himself?

423
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,258
Yes, I can't believe he did that either.

424
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:29,398
Yes!

425
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:33,426
Kang, we made it. We're getting another chance.

426
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:36,660
Congrats, Moo. Your opportunity has come.

427
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:39,926
Hey.

428
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:41,075
Hey.

429
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,409
What?

430
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:45,542
You missed out on the news.
They're boyfriends now.

431
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:47,762
Wow. My friend is something else.

432
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:49,209
So wicked.

433
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:51,435
Now let's focus on our dream.

434
00:25:51,435 --> 00:25:54,834
Let's show them all we've got.

435
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,533
Your Everest is right in front of you, Moo.

436
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:00,350
Don't miss this opportunity. Reach the summit.

437
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,640
Moo.

438
00:26:17,604 --> 00:26:19,419
Why did you bring me here?

439
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:21,909
Shh. Quiet.

440
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:24,112
No one really comes here in the early morning.

441
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:47,213
I just finished writing this song last night.

442
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:50,851
I plan to show the judges that I can write a song,

443
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:54,997
but I don't want them to be the first to hear it.

444
00:26:54,997 --> 00:27:01,177
I want you to be the first to hear it
because you're important to this song...

445
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:07,166
and you're important to me.

446
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:27,649
♫ The first day love made sense ♫

447
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:33,340
♫ It's the day when I met you ♫

448
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,807
♫ Because you're my love, so true ♫

449
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:43,128
♫ Boo, you make me realize ♫

450
00:27:45,882 --> 00:27:51,379
♫ Since you came into my life ♫

451
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:57,493
♫ All I wanna do is to smile ♫

452
00:27:57,493 --> 00:28:01,481
♫ To love you more than I can describe ♫

453
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:07,282
♫ More and more as the days go by ♫

454
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:14,076
♫ The word love that I told you before ♫

455
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:19,699
♫ I'll keep reminding you how much I adore ♫

456
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:26,183
♫ No matter how many more days or years ♫

457
00:28:26,183 --> 00:28:33,312
♫ I'll shout louder for you to hear, I love you ♫

458
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:37,244
♫ Love ♫

459
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:44,827
♫ Love you ♫

460
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:48,019
♫ Love ♫

461
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:50,916
♫ Love ♫

462
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:55,272
♫ Love you ♫

463
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:05,049
Thank you for not disappointing me.

464
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,753
Thank you for writing this song for me.

465
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:21,194
Thank you for making me feel so good...

466
00:29:25,151 --> 00:29:26,911
to have you as my boyfriend.

467
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:35,308
♫ Love ♫

468
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:41,299
♫ Love you ♫

469
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:44,521
♫ Love ♫

470
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,420
♫ Love ♫

471
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,433
♫ Love you ♫

472
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:02,585
These are 10 trainees fighting for their dream,

473
00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:07,418
reaching their goal to debut
and become new TTM artists.

474
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:13,174
Follow their journey on New Wave Project 2024.

475
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:14,508
I passed, Kang.

476
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:16,339
Well done.

477
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:17,858
Let's celebrate today.

478
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:18,979
- Yes.
- Let's go.

479
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:20,729
I want to eat mala hot pot.

480
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:22,657
Count me out.

481
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:26,575
I want to enjoy my alone time with my boyfriend.

482
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,262
- Right, Kang?
- Ugh.

483
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:33,187
Hey, tell me honestly.

484
00:30:33,187 --> 00:30:34,739
Aren't you annoyed with him?

485
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:36,324
No.

486
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:38,619
I like him for who he is.

487
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:41,091
My boyfriend is the cutest.

488
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:44,105
I can't be here anymore.
Love makes me want to throw up.

489
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:45,381
Let's go.

490
00:30:45,381 --> 00:30:47,333
I can't stay. Goodbye.

491
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,575
- I can't stay.
- Hold on.

492
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:51,694
Don't let us outdo you. Keep up. Come on.

493
00:30:51,694 --> 00:30:53,672
- What?
- Come on. I know you know.

494
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:54,977
What?

495
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,870
Yos.

496
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,284
What?

497
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:00,791
I think it's time to confess your feelings to Tae.

498
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,564
What the hell are you on about?

499
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:04,688
Stop talking too much or he'll find out.

500
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:05,765
All the better.

501
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:07,802
He told me he loves you too.

502
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:12,138
He also told me he loves me, but as a friend.
What don't you understand, Moo?

503
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:13,285
Yos!

504
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,459
Hurry up!

505
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:16,308
Give me a second.

506
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,171
Don't you want him to love you as something else?

507
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:19,489
Shut up before he hears you.

508
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:20,660
Hey!

509
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,178
Are you two gossiping about me?

510
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:24,032
No. I was just thanking Yos.

511
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:25,619
You guys go.

512
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,491
I won't keep you any longer. See you. Bye.

513
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:28,939
- See you.
- Don't forget to tell him.

514
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:30,820
- See you, buddy.
- Bye.

515
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,521
Bye.

516
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:34,442
I'm back.

517
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:41,658
Is everything alright?

518
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:43,521
- You mean what happened earlier?
- Yeah.

519
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:47,317
I was just trying to build up Yos' courage.

520
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:55,274
By the way, where's the gift for my effort?

521
00:31:55,274 --> 00:31:57,143
What do you want?

522
00:31:57,143 --> 00:31:59,006
Hmm.

523
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:01,276
This.

524
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,500
Here?

525
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:15,070
Just once, okay?

526
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,070
Okay.

527
00:32:20,451 --> 00:32:21,474
Kang!

528
00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:24,200
Oh.

529
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,169
Am I interrupting?

530
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:29,419
Sorry. I'll come back later.

531
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:30,779
Hey, just come in.

532
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,979
No. Enjoy your moment.

533
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:34,561
Say what you want.

534
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,136
Don't take your embarrassment out on me.

535
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:42,397
I saw the announcement
that Moo passed to the next round.

536
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:44,269
I wanted to come here and scream with you.

537
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:49,030
But what you just did was cute.

538
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:54,514
Anyway, congratulations, Moo.

539
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,681
Can I get your autograph now?

540
00:32:56,681 --> 00:32:59,160
In case you get famous and
harder to approach in the future.

541
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,204
Please.

542
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:02,904
- Give me a pen.
- I don't have any.

543
00:33:02,904 --> 00:33:04,219
It won't be hard to approach me.

544
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:07,779
I'll still be the same good boy.

545
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,250
When you become famous,
it'll be hard to stay the same.

546
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,309
Being a public figure will
cost you your private life.

547
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:14,640
Who knows?

548
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,118
You might have to keep
your relationship with Kang a secret.

549
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:24,046
I don't think so.
People are more understanding these days.

550
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:28,426
Moo, some people aren't.

551
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:31,178
If you have to keep it a secret, so be it.

552
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:34,285
Why do you say that?

553
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:36,701
Because I'm worried about you.

554
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:42,075
If keeping our relationship a secret
is better for you, let's do that.

555
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:47,361

556
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:48,615
Look.

557
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:53,531
We know in our hearts that we love each other.

558
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,079
That's enough.

559
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:59,419
You're right.

560
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:01,839
As long as the two of us know it.

561
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:06,558
Oh!

562
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:08,077
I feel like a third wheel here.

563
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:10,422
Did I buy a ticket to see you
crazy in love with each other?

564
00:34:10,422 --> 00:34:12,027
I can't. Separate!

565
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:15,189
Mom, can I have something to eat?

566
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:22,094
Yos, does my autograph look good enough?

567
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:24,367
I think it's time to confess your feelings to Tae.

568
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:26,799
Yos?

569
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:29,273
Yos?

570
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:30,432
What?

571
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,810
What were you daydreaming about?

572
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:36,680
Nothing. I wasn't daydreaming.

573
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:41,107
Why are you signing all that?

574
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,819
I'm practicing being a celebrity

575
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:46,206
so when my fans ask for my autograph,
I can sign for them.

576
00:34:46,206 --> 00:34:47,282
Look.

577
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:50,956
You need to practice too.

578
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:51,995
Come on.

579
00:34:52,988 --> 00:34:54,349
I'll keep mine.

580
00:34:58,637 --> 00:35:00,235
I'll eat while you practice.

581
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:05,294
Don't you want him to love you as something else?

582
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:15,409
Are you done? Let me see how you sign yours.

583
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,210
Let me see.

584
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:23,734
[I love you more than a friend.]

585
00:35:25,663 --> 00:35:27,139
Why did you crush that?

586
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:28,593
It didn't look good enough.

587
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,651
I'll practice more and
let you be the first to see it.

588
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:33,385
The food is cooked. Let's eat.
I'll go grab some water.

589
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:35,617
He's being weird.

590
00:35:39,686 --> 00:35:42,615
You saw that I'm going to the next round, right?

591
00:35:42,615 --> 00:35:43,748
Yes.

592
00:35:45,098 --> 00:35:46,891
I won't let you down, Mom.

593
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,742
I made it!

594
00:35:57,847 --> 00:35:59,639
I'm happy for you.

595
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:03,791
But you still have to get into university. Right?

596
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:08,578
My mom just said the same thing.

597
00:36:08,578 --> 00:36:10,261
Are you my mom or my boyfriend?

598
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:12,599
I'm concerned.

599
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,890
You have your admission exams in a few days.

600
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,029
Despite how I look, I study.

601
00:36:19,029 --> 00:36:22,653
If you don't believe me, test my knowledge.
I can answer anything.

602
00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:25,828
- Really?
- Of course. Try it.

603
00:36:25,828 --> 00:36:26,939
Just kidding.

604
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,180
Good.

605
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,333
I'm going to prepare for my admission exams too.

606
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,533
I hope to get accepted into
the same university as you.

607
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:37,480
That'd be great.

608
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,739
If we study at the same place,
we'll get to live together.

609
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,892
We'll be together 24/7.

610
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:46,095
I can't wait.

611
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:47,849
Do they sell time machines around here?

612
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:50,459
I'm going to buy one and fast forward to that time.

613
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,683
Calm down.

614
00:36:52,683 --> 00:36:54,659
Live in the present, Moo.

615
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:03,026
I'll reach the summit.

616
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:10,528
I'm so happy.

617
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,160

Well, well...

- Faculty of Music.
- That's great.

Congratulations.

To what do I owe this visit?

631
00:38:13,732 --> 00:38:18,148
It's my last day of school, so I came to thank you.

632
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:22,750
Thank you for shaping me
to become a better person.

633
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:28,890
You also worked hard to improve yourself.

634
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:34,217
Do you remember what you told me
when we first met here?

635

All changes come with discomfort,

636
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:44,838
but do you know how I got through those times?

637
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:48,056
I have no idea.

638

00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,799
I've found it...

643
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,326
and I've been very happy.

653
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:36,833
Of course.

00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,706
- I have a celebrity in my school.
- Where should I sign it?

655
00:39:38,706 --> 00:39:41,338
Right in the middle of my back.

656
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,200
Okay.

657
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:47,835

00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:55,038
You haven't even debuted yet,
but got so many gifts and fans already.

660
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:58,257
Look at yours. You got even more gifts than me.

661
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:01,642
There's no space left to sign on your shirt.

662
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:02,910
Right.

663
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:09,180
- What?
- You haven't signed my shirt.

664
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,416
I don't know what to write.

665
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:14,454
There must be something you haven't told me.

666
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,706
I know there is.

667
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:17,350
Please sign it for me.

668
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,177
I don't think that's necessary.

00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:27,946
- Your hand is so stiff, huh?
- Tae! Yos!

672
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,093

673
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:32,409
- Sure.
- Come on. Follow me.

Come on, Yos. Let's say goodbye to the field.

675
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:40,118
Okay. I'll follow you after I go to the toilet.

676
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:41,845
Hurry up.

677
00:41:17,615 --> 00:41:19,191
What are you writing?

678
00:41:21,635 --> 00:41:23,523
Do you write with your left hand now?

679
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,401
I knew you'd use this time to sign it in secret.

680
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,193
- Let me see it.
- You don't need to see it.

00:42:10,938 --> 00:42:12,685
You have to get used to it.

688
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:13,814
Hey.

689
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,701
Bring your confidence down a notch.

690
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,089
You just graduated. Don't get carried away.

691
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:22,536
Why can't I?

692
00:42:22,536 --> 00:42:25,619
I graduated with good grades
and got accepted into university.

693
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,328
Soon, I'll become an artist trainee.

694
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:29,378
My dream is coming true soon.

695
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:32,935
Well done.

696
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:37,243
By the way, I have something to tell you.

697
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:43,346
What is it?

698
00:42:48,282 --> 00:42:49,350
I...

699
00:42:52,732 --> 00:42:54,984
I got accepted into university.

700
00:42:54,984 --> 00:42:58,363
I'm going to be with you, Moo.

701
00:42:58,363 --> 00:42:59,697
Really?

702
00:42:59,697 --> 00:43:01,826
I'm so happy.

703
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:04,273
While I'm here, you take care of me.

704
00:43:04,273 --> 00:43:07,393
While you're there, I'll take care of you. Okay?

705
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:09,265
Sure.

706
00:43:09,265 --> 00:43:10,447
This is great.

707
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:13,097
I have a long list of things I want to do with you.

708
00:43:13,097 --> 00:43:16,046
I have a list of what I want to do with you, too.

709
00:43:16,046 --> 00:43:17,267

711
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:22,693
What's this?

712
00:43:27,157 --> 00:43:30,206
My list consists of only one thing.

713
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:33,857
Loving you.

00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,860
What do you want?

717
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:58,699
Can I get a kiss?

718
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,851
Even if you didn't ask, I'd give it anyway.

719
00:44:20,753 --> 00:44:26,818
♫ The first day love made sense ♫

720
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:32,772
♫ It's the day when I met you ♫

721
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:36,871
♫ Because you're my love, so true ♫

722
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:42,913
♫ Boo, you make me realize ♫

723
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:48,987
♫ The word love that I told you before ♫

724
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:54,600
♫ I'll keep reminding you how much I adore ♫

725
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:00,899
♫ No matter how many more days or years ♫

726
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:08,000
♫ I'll shout louder for you to hear, I love you ♫

727
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,567
♫ Love ♫

728
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:19,486
♫ Love you ♫

729
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:22,692
♫ Love ♫

730
00:45:22,692 --> 00:45:25,521
♫ Love ♫

731
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:30,068
♫ Love you ♫

732
00:45:44,585 --> 00:45:47,697
My life with Kang is the best.

733
00:45:47,697 --> 00:45:49,380
He's my chef.

734
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,604
He's my bolster.

735
00:45:50,604 --> 00:45:52,338
And he has soft cheeks I can kiss.

736
00:45:52,338 --> 00:45:55,623
Can you still be my friend like you said you would?

737
00:45:55,623 --> 00:46:00,140
Out of the 10 of you here, no one knows
how many of you will get to debut.

738
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,265
Do your best.

739
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:03,467
He won't talk to me. He only talks to Jang.

740
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,793
You're jealous.

741
00:46:05,793 --> 00:46:07,193
I'm so happy.

742
00:46:07,193 --> 00:46:11,527
Living with you feels like
we're practicing for our wedding night.
