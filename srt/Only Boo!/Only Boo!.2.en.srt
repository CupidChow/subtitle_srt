He's my new tenant.

He's from Bangkok.
His mom just dropped him off this morning.

7
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:23,240
She sent him here to discipline him.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,703
You gave me the toothbrush,

9
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:28,418
took me to the bicycle shop, fixed my bike,

10
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:31,552
dressed my wound, and gave me food.

11
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:35,564
Thank you, Bad-Mouth-Kind-Heart Bro.

12
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:37,206
You must be new.

00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:39,066

Hey.

17
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:00,442
- You sell rice and curry here too?
- Hey. You again?

18
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:01,673
Hi, Bad-Mouth-Kind-Heart Bro.

19
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:02,916
That's not my name.

20
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,301
What's your name then? You haven't told me.

21
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:09,880
Who's even called Stir-Fried Clams?

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,123
Kang. My name is Kang.

23
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:15,420

If you're not going to eat, move.

26
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:44,292
You're blocking other people.

27
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,615
Well...

28
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:49,561
This is all the money I have for the whole month.

29
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:52,212
Fine. You can pay me later.
I'll put it on your tab as usual.

30
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:53,802
Thank you.

31
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:59,678
Anyway, I know you're not actually
charging me 2-4 million.

32
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:02,971
How about I help you work
in exchange for food? I can do everything.

33
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:06,000
I can get food for customers,
sell, or wash dishes. Anything.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,849
Let's talk about that later.

35
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,999
Now hurry up and order.
Many other people are waiting.

36
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:16,381
Can I have this one? Just one.

37
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:23,748
Hey, I only want one.

38
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:25,640
Just eat and don't complain.

39
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,219
Only one is not enough.

40
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,906
Eating a big breakfast will make you smart.

41
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,045
Remember that.

42
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,274
Here you go.

43
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,203
Thank you.

44
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:42,288
What can I get you?

45
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,803
Hey!

46
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:00,947
You stole my spot again?

47
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:03,887
Where?

48
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:07,157
You're sitting in my spot.

49
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,156
That's how I reserved the table.

50
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:13,687
The bottle lid was to reserve the table?
I thought it was trash.

51
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,680
Hey. Are you trying to get on our nerves?

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,787
Are you trying to get on our nerves?

53
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:18,958
Tae, calm down.

54
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,762
He's new. He's clueless.

55
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,963
Now you know.

56
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:30,926
If you do it again, you're trying to mess with us.

57
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,211
Leave.

58
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:04,640
Oh, hey.

59
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,500
Why are you sitting there?

60
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,013
I didn't know who to sit with.
I don't have friends.

61
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:12,360
Be careful.

62
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,173
Those two are the school bullies.
Don't get into trouble with them.

63
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,673
I'll tell you something.

64
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:23,098
Last year during a lunch break,

65
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:26,451
something happened to a 12-grader named Plu
who was known as the alpha kid.

66
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,523
No one dared to mess with or defy him.

67
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:33,499
Everyone could only join him and give way to him,

68
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,767
except...

69
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,335
Who's Potae?

70
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:38,481
What's the matter?

71
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:44,500
You're the one who broke
my little sister Ploysai's heart, right?

72
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,983
You're dead.

73
00:05:55,318 --> 00:06:00,333
The next morning, Plu was finished
and he left the school.

74
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:04,006
After that, no one dared
mess with those two again.

75
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:08,469
I didn't want to mess with them.
That's why I walked away.

76
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,147
Anyway, thank you for warning me.

77
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:16,991
Wait.

78
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:35,971
What?

79
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,034

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,626
I'll probably be late for homeroom.

83
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:27,454
Hey, Ploypailin and Somsri!

84
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:29,702
Get into the classroom. You're late.

85

- Hi.
- Hi.

86

Oh, you're Mok Diloksakulkan, right?

87
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,752
Yes, I am.

88
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:41,028
What are you doing?

89
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm on my way to the classroom.

90
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,680
- Let's go. Come on. Follow me.
- Okay.

91
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:50,011
- Oh.
- Yes?

92
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,429
Let me tell your friends first. Wait here.

93
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,731
- Okay.
- Once I call you, you can come in.

94
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:57,963
- Okay.
- Also, don't forget to take off your shoes, okay?

95
00:07:57,963 --> 00:07:59,350
Okay.

96
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:06,267
Having fun chatting on the first day
of your second semester?

00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,924
Okay, you're all seated.

Today is a good day.
We're going to have a new friend.

99
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:14,836
Come on in.

100
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:18,220
Give him a big hand.

101
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:22,432
That must be the red hoodie guy from this morning.

102
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:24,932
Yeah, it's him. I can't believe he's in this class.

103
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:27,130
Be nice to your friend.

104
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,663
He just moved here from Bangkok.

105
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:32,043
His name is Mok Diloksakulkan.

106
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,543
I'd appreciate your advice. You can call me Moo.

107
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,611
Don't go yet. I'm not finished.

108
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:46,647
If you know who Moo's mom is,
you'll be chilled to the bone.

109
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:49,038
She's not a fan or an AC. Don't make that joke.

110
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:51,904
His mom is an alumna of this school

111
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:56,510
and is now a producer at a music company
with many famous songs.

112
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,089
Don't say a loudspeaker gets their songs heard.
That joke is also outdated.

113
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,018
This music company really has many famous songs.

114
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:05,658
GP Entertainment. Have you heard of it?

115
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,379
If any of you want to be a singer,
you can talk to Moo.

116
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:20,553
- Teacher.
- Right?

117
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:21,459
Yes.

118
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:23,852
Are you alright? You look a bit sheepish.

119
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:26,015
Keep your spirits up. It's your first morning here.

120
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,383
Go to your seat.

121
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:34,058
Alright, Let me do an attendance check.

122

Shit. They're already giving me side-eyes
on my first day.

126
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,021
Yes, you!

127
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,629
Excuse me.

128
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:33,659

00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:35,389
Let's go!

00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:49,471
Shit, Kang!

131
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,975
- Why are you cursing at me?
- I'm not. I'm just shocked.

132
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:53,866
What have you done? Why do you look like
you're running from ghosts?

133
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,525
Ghosts would be less scary.
I'm suddenly getting picked on.

134
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:57,672
Whose toes did you step on this time?

135
00:10:57,672 --> 00:11:01,160
I did not. I guess they're picking on me
because I'm new.

136
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,131
Luckily, I ran away first. I have to go.

137
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:05,241
Moo is over there! Get him!

138
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:06,334

00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:09,080

- Quiet!

Let go! What are you doing to me?

Let go!

147
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:23,827
Let go of Moo! What did he do to you?

148
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,226
What are you guys doing? Ganging up on him?

149
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:32,321
Let go of me!

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,550
Don't come any closer!

151
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,232
Don't come any closer!

152
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,440
Don't come any closer!

178
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,920
and your mom happens to be a producer,

179
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,890
so we'd really appreciate kindness
and support from your mom.

180
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,292
What a perfect coincidence, Master

181
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,661
Could you ask your mom to consider helping us?

182
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:58,186
So, you guys dragged me here
to make me watch you dance?

183
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,540
Yes.

184
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:03,478
I thought I was being threatened.

185
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:07,987
I thought you two were going to punch my face
and break my arms like you did to that 12-grader.

186
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,416
Here's the true story, Master.

187
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,272
Hey, calm down, bro!

188
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't try to make an excuse.

189
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,248
- Hey, bro.
- You two are going to get it.

190
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:21,385
Calm down, bro.

191
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:24,174
- Let's talk nicely.
- Yes!

192
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:27,680
Hey, come on!

193
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,366
Come at me!

194
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,930
More!

195
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,251
Oh, shit!

196
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,670
You're going to get it!

197
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,693
Shit!

198
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,157
Is he dead?

199
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,863
After that, Plu's dad took him out of this school.

200
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,861
It was an accident that allowed us
to pretend to be powerful.

201
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:07,463
Who wouldn't take that golden opportunity?

202
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:14,160
So there was no arm or leg breaking, right?

203
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,601
Of course not, Master. We're not thugs.

204
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:22,240
Like we said, we prefer dancing and singing.

205
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,783
We've been practicing for a year to audition.

206
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:26,519
We go to every audition there is.

207
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,946
We want a lot of people to see our talent.

208
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:30,440
Really?

209
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,177
- Me too.
- Really?

210
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:33,575
Would you like to dance with us then?

211
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:35,040
Can I?

212
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,904
Where do you guys normally dance?

213
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:38,661
I've wanted someone to help
with my dance moves for a few days now.

214
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,920
Tae can help you with that, Master.

215
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,146
That's amazing, Master. Let me take you there.

216
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:51,661
It's just one semester.

217
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:55,117
Go and study there
so there's no entertainment to distract you.

218
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:59,120
Just focus on doing well in school and
passing the university admission exam.

219
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,852
That's enough. End of story.

220
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,601
Mom.

221
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,913
You won't change your mind
no matter what I say, right?

222
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,800
If your dream is really important to you,

223
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,485
you must do what I ask.

224
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:20,025
Consider this one of the tests
you have to pass to reach your dream.

225
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,160
Don't want to go anymore.

226
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:26,444
What? Why not, Master?

227
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,221
I have my reasons. I'm sorry.

228
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,353
Master!

229
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:36,750

I better leave before my arms and legs
start moving on their own.

241
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:34,550
Everything is closed already?

242
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,526
Why does the canteen close so early?

243
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:39,634
I'm hungry.

244
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:56,917
What? The water is not running either?
I can't even get water to drink?

245
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,305
Whoa.

246
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:26,335
What are you doing?

247
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,502
Kang.

248
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,414
If I hadn't come back to get eggs,
you would've choked on water.

249
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:43,603
Here's a towel.

250
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:44,988
Thank you.

251
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,156
Hey, is this a table cleaning cloth?

252
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:52,529
It's clean. You can use it.

253
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,430
But you look very suspicious.

254
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,532
Why don't you wipe your face with it first
if it's really clean?

255
00:18:58,532 --> 00:19:00,327
It really is clean. You can use it.

256
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:01,840
- Let's wipe your face first.
- Moo, don't.

257
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,140
- Come on.
- Hey.

258
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,924
- Let's wipe your face first.
- Hey.

259
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:07,637
Moo! Don't! You're going to break them.

260
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:09,768
- What?
- The eggs.

261
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:11,217
Don't break them.

262
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,257
Fine. It's a table cleaning cloth.

263
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:15,633
I knew it.

264
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:18,952
You're pranking me again. You're so tricky.

265
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:39,199
I'm dry now.

266
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,652
You're dry, but I'm wet.

267
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:46,039
You were making me wipe my face
with a table cleaning cloth.

268
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:46,970
I'm hungry.

269
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,110
They only sell food here
in the morning and at lunchtime.

270
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,993
They all close in the evening.
There's nothing for you to eat.

271
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:55,992
Where do people get food in the evening?

272
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:58,081
Near Phra Pathom Chedi.
There are tons of food there.

273
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,249
- Phra Pathom Chedi?
- Yeah.

274
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:02,560
It's over 40 kilometers from the school.
I'll faint to death.

275
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,413
Do you have any food? I'm hungry.

276
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,456
This is all I have. If you're okay
with eating it, go ahead.

277
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:16,894
Of course, I'm okay. I'm more than okay.

278
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,984
It's hot.

279
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:24,775
What's the rush? Blow on it first.

280
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:38,600
You're good.

281
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,516
You make the most delicious omelet in the world.

282
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:55,168
Do you have any sauces?

283
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:56,511
Get them from behind you.

284
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,036
- Let me hold it.
- Thank you.

285
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:13,227
You can't eat an omelet without sauce.

286
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,434
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]
You're finished, right?

287
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:21,594
Wait. I'll wash it.

288
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:23,858
You already cooked for me.
You don't have to wash it.

289
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:35,543
Wait.

290
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:37,144
Put your hand here.

291
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:41,081
- Is it oily?
- Very oily.

292
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:42,752
Do you know how to wash dishes?

293
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:44,866
No.

294
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:49,672
Moo, you're in grade 12 now.
Don't you even know how to wash dishes?

295
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:53,934
No. Other people normally do it for me.

296
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:58,398
You live alone now. You must learn
to rely on yourself, you know?

297
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:01,174
I know, but I'm not alone now.

298
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:04,074
I have you, Kang.

299
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,585
I mean I can always ask you if anything.

300
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:18,418
Oh, so we add the dishwashing liquid first.

301
00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:22,430
Yes. You have to add the dishwashing liquid first
to remove the oiliness.

302
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,340
Then rinse with water.

303
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:26,900
That's it.

304
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,154
Where are you going?

305
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:32,924
Now that you're done eating, you can leave.

306
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:35,980
I don't want to leave. I won't have anything to do.

307
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,200
Where are you going? Let me go with you.

308
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,467
No answer means I can go.

309
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:40,568
Kang.

310

[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

311
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,950
Hey, Kang. You didn't wait for me to catch up.

312
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,276
You wanted to follow me, didn't you?

313
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,311
- Can you help me with this?
- Sure.

314
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,884
Wow. Did you draw all these yourself?

315
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,241
Yeah.

316
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:08,087
- By hand?
- Yeah.

317
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,252
Come on.

318
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,521
This one is torn.

319
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,907
Let me see.

320
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,892
It's okay.

321
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:22,656
I can draw a new one at home.

322
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:26,143
Why don't you use a tablet?
It's much more convenient.

323
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:28,795
You can keep your drawings and print them out.
When any of them tears, you can replace it easily.

324
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:32,110
I prefer drawing on paper.
I like the feeling more.

325
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,694
I don't think drawing on paper
and tablet are that different.

326
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,749
You're just not used to it.

327
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,189
I think a tablet is more convenient.

328
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:41,466
I don't want it.

329
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:43,027
You can borrow my tablet if you want.

330
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:45,371
No.

331
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:50,848
I'm not giving it to you for free. I'll let you
borrow it for 5 million and reduce my debt a bit.

332
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:55,727
If you want to pay off your debt,
give me money, not your stuff.

333
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,859
I'll let you borrow it for free then.

334
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:58,982
I don't want it.

335
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:02,689
Let's do the front row now.

336
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,131
Do you sell food here every day?

337
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:06,599
Do you sell food here every day?

338
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,470
I wake up at 3 a.m. to buy ingredients
for my mom to cook.

339
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,470
My mom sells at the dorm. I sell at the school.

340
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,898
After school, we sell here.

341
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:18,569
You sell food in the morning, at lunchtime,
and in the evening. You're amazing.

342
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:19,846
Not really.

343
00:24:19,846 --> 00:24:22,628
I just started helping my mom two years ago.

344
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,068
Doesn't working and studying
at the same time make you tired?

345
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:29,870
I don't study anymore.

346
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,310
Going to school wouldn't be helpful.

347
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,448
It's much better to help my mom sell food.

348
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:37,098
No wonder you can sell food every day.

349
00:24:37,098 --> 00:24:40,043
But what faculty would you go to
if you continued your studies?

350
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:42,311
I stopped thinking about that a long time ago.

351
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:44,051
Let me guess.

352
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:47,310
You'd study drawing and stuff.
You're very good at drawing.

353
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,799
I just draw casually. I'm not any good.

354
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:56,087
But I think you definitely look like someone
who's good at drawing.

355
00:24:58,543 --> 00:24:59,976
Stop talking too much.

356
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:01,598
Hurry and put that up.

357
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:03,107
Okay.

358
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,750
I'd like to order some food, please.

359
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,639
Sure. What can I get for you?

360
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:11,496
Kai palo and this one.

361
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:12,499
Okay.

362
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:15,620
Today, you have someone to help you, Kang?
He doesn't look familiar.

363
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,523
I'm his temp worker.

364
00:25:17,523 --> 00:25:20,296
I work in exchange for food.

365
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:24,928
I tried to send him away, but he wouldn't leave.
I don't know what to do.

366
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,055
Get a ladleful of rice.

367
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:32,928
Feel free to wait at your table.
We'll bring it to you.

368
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,928
Okay.

369
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,841
One egg and two tofu.

370
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:39,124
Two tofu.

371
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,440
I want to eat kai palo.

372
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,121
You can have some later.

373
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:50,072
- Okay.
- Wait.

374
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,942
Oh, spoon and fork.

375
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:02,810
Here you go.

376
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,299
♫ The more we fight, the closer we get ♫

377
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,003
♫ I try not to care but end up missing you ♫

378
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:17,428
♫ I want you to try to understand ♫

379
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:21,777
♫ I want to get through to your heart ♫

380
00:26:21,777 --> 00:26:26,207
♫ The more I try to stop,
the faster my heart beats ♫

381
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:28,189
Oh, no. When music is on,
my body moves automatically.

382
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:30,814
My neck is moving.
My arms and legs are also moving.

383
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:32,443
My whole body is moving.

384
00:26:32,443 --> 00:26:35,819
Moo, stop yourself! Stop it, Moo!

385
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:41,256
If your dream is really important to you,
you must do what I ask.

386
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:46,865
Consider this one of the tests
you have to pass to reach your dream.

387
00:26:46,865 --> 00:26:49,008
Kang, help me!

388
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,671
Help you with what? What's wrong with you now?

389
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,807
♫ Eyes locked and closer we get ♫

390
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:54,271
♫ They say intimacy is a bliss ♫

391
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:56,519
Kang, help me.

392
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:58,845
What's wrong?

393
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,305
- Can you hold my neck?
- Do I have to?

394
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:04,491
- Hold my neck.
- Okay.

395
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:10,012
♫ Can I love you? How many scores do I get ♫

396
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:11,877
♫ What should I do to be with you? ♫

397
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:14,024
My hands too.

398
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:16,760
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know. My hands!

399
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,204
Will you stop now?

400
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,310
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey.

401
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,970
My shoulders started moving.

402
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:28,420
Hold my shoulders.

403
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,620
Are you okay now?

404
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,030
My waist started moving. Can you hold my waist?

405
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,575
Can you hold my waist? Hold my waist.

406
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:47,811
Hey, it still won't stop. I'm waving.

407
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:52,837
- Hug me.
- Do I have to?

408
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,996
Hug me. I'm waving.

409
00:27:57,495 --> 00:27:59,698
Hug me. Quickly.

410
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:11,516
Let's call it a day. I'm tired.

411
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:14,628
I feel faint.

412
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:15,927
Not yet.

413
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,598
My moves are still awkward.

414
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:21,219
I need to practice more, so when
Master Moo's mom sees me, I can catch her eyes.

415
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:23,920
Before you can catch her eyes,
sweat will get into your eyes.

416
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,973
- Take a rest and drink some water.
- Alright.

417
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:27,205
28.

418
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:33,059
Did it stop?

419
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:36,741
Yes.

420
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:42,167
What's wrong with you?

421
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,961
Did you hear the music?

422
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:45,107
Yes.

423
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:48,545
Whenever I hear music, I dance and do body waves.

424
00:28:48,545 --> 00:28:50,695
My heart wants to dance,
but my brain tells me to stop.

425
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,775
My mom gave me an ultimatum
to study hard and not get distracted.

426
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:58,325
I don't want to hurt her feelings,
but it's hard to control my body.

427
00:28:58,325 --> 00:28:59,656
That's why I needed your help.

428
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,822
But you were dancing in exchange
for food the other day.

429
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:03,732
It's not the same. That's just for fun.

430
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,080
I think you're crazy.

431
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,975
Haven't you ever loved and
wanted to do something so much,

432
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:11,575
but couldn't because you didn't want
to hurt the people you love?

433
00:29:15,448 --> 00:29:17,616
I have.

434
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:21,948
Then why did you criticize me?

435
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:23,084
I'm sorry.

436
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,446
I guess I misunderstood you.

437
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:32,835
But we can work towards dreams
and reality at the same time, right?

438
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:36,041
You don't have to give up anything.

439
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,519
Do you think I can do that?

440
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,851
Yeah.

441
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:52,193
No one can stop your dream except yourself.

442
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:58,915
Kang, don't do this.

443
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
What?

444
00:30:02,688 --> 00:30:06,180
When you do that, you look cool.

445
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,194
You'll melt my heart.

446
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:16,139
If you want to dance, dance. I won't tell your mom.

447
00:30:44,227 --> 00:30:46,815
- It's hot.
- Yeah, it's hot.

448
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:49,225
Are you hot too? Let me help.

449
00:30:49,225 --> 00:30:50,588
Hey, what are you doing?

450
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:52,473
No, I don't want to get wet! Don't!

451
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:56,077
Oh, I'm sorry.

452
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:58,234
- It got into my eyes.
- I'm sorry.

453
00:30:58,234 --> 00:30:59,503
Are you alright?

454
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:01,647
- It got into my eyes, Tae.
- Where?

455
00:31:01,647 --> 00:31:03,419
Let me see.

456
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,051
Let me wipe it off.

457
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:08,088
Your eyes are not red. I'm sorry.

458
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,830
Stop it.

459
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,306
What the hell were you doing? I'm all wet.

460
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:20,836
Let's continue practicing.

461
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:37,843
Shit!

462
00:31:37,843 --> 00:31:38,858
What?

463
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:41,149
I have a date with Nomtan.

464
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,457
See you later. I have to hurry.

465
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:46,515
What about your dance practice with me?

466
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:49,560
Please stop by!

467
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:06,130
Please stop by!

468
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,398
Here.

469
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:26,991
You're tired from dancing, so I brought you this.

470
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:28,625
It'll make you feel refreshed.

471
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:33,055
My heart is already refreshed
that you brought it to me.

472
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:34,308
You talk too much.

473
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:41,915
Here.

474
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:54,384
I feel so refreshed drinking it.

475
00:32:54,384 --> 00:32:55,968
Try it.

476
00:32:55,968 --> 00:32:57,610
No, you drink it.

477
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,571
Please try it.

478
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,842
How was it?

479
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,145
Refreshing?

480
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:28,799
Your dance was great today.

481
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,621
My food is almost sold out.

482
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:34,754
Normally, I give what's left away.

483
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:39,204
Give it away?

484
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:42,161
Why don't you sell it at a cheap price
to avoid losing money?

485
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:47,084
I give whatever I can
to make this world a better place.

486
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:53,497
If there's a contest for
the most kindhearted person in the world,

487
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:55,695
you'd win first prize.

488
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:57,953
You're exaggerating.

489
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,032
I just give away a bit of food.

490
00:34:01,032 --> 00:34:06,335
But you really are kind,
compared to my mom who is so cruel.

491
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:10,044
What kind of person sends her kid away to struggle?

492
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:13,759
She also said that if I get bad grades
and fail to get into university,

493
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:16,351
she won't let me dance again.

494
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:18,572
You're the only one who let me dance.

495
00:34:21,986 --> 00:34:24,314
Why do you want to dance so much?

496
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:28,058
I want to be a world-class artist.

497
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,108
That ambitious?

498
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:33,735
Yeah.

499
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:38,632
Have you ever heard of the saying,
"Everyone has their own Everest"?

500
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:43,362
I know that dreams don't come true easily,

501
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:49,862
so I'll practice hard until I achieve my dream
and get to debut.

502
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:52,598
All of that is my Everest.

503
00:34:57,932 --> 00:35:00,432
What's your Everest?

504
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:27,096
Sorry.

505
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:30,000
Are you okay?

506
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,283
Huh?

507
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:34,447
- Are you okay?
- I am.

508
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:19,350
- Moo.
- Huh?

509
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:22,092
We've arrived.

510
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:23,530
We're at your dorm now.

511
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,472
Did I fall asleep?

512
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,953
Yes.

513
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:29,462
And you held me like this the whole way here?

514
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,721
Did you drool on my shoulder? Check.

515
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:49,927
I didn't.

516
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:04,479
- It's okay. I can do it myself.
- It's okay.

517
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:13,824
Thank you.

518
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:16,239
You helped me for free so many times.

519
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,960
Nothing is free. I've put it all on your tab.

520
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,583
That's fine,

521
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:25,565
but I have something for you so you'll have
something to do besides selling food.

522
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:29,356
Here. You can borrow this.

523
00:37:29,356 --> 00:37:30,799
Free of charge.

524
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:33,455
I said I don't want it.

525
00:37:33,455 --> 00:37:34,836
I don't really use it.

526
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,756
If you draw on it, you'll get more use
out of it than I do.

527
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:40,072
I don't want it.

528
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:41,593
You're not troubling me, Kang.

529
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,947
If you try drawing on it,
I guarantee you'll forget paper.

530
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:46,441
I said I don't want it.

531
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:49,064
- Trust me. It's good. I want to give it to you.
- I don't want it.

532
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:50,266
Can you please accept my kindness?

533
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:52,271
Hey, I said I don't want it!

534
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,198
Do you understand what I say?

535
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,065
And don't bring up drawing again.

536
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,372
You shouldn't have scolded him like that.

537
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,840
He doesn't know your story.

538
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,362
All the more reason
he shouldn't have talked about it.

539
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:35,862
And I said no many times.

540
00:38:37,304 --> 00:38:41,548
Kang, you must stop being like this.

541
00:38:41,548 --> 00:38:44,246
You have to overcome it.

542
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:46,191
No one blames you.

543
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,942
You say that because you're not me.

544
00:38:48,942 --> 00:38:51,305
And you said that to me again.

545
00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:54,160
I don't know what else to say.

546
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,375
Go and figure out by yourself
if what you said was right,

547
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,831
but I believe your dad
doesn't want you to be like this.

548
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:27,687
Kang got angry for no reason.

549
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,732
He's not my happiness here anymore.

550
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:32,635
I won't eat at his place anymore.
I won't bother him anymore.

551
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:35,655
Here they come again.

552
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:38,994
From now on, I'll slap and crush them
like how I'd slap a volleyball.

553
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:49,075
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

554
00:39:54,908 --> 00:39:56,044
I don't want it.

555
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:57,681
You're not troubling me, Kang.

556
00:39:57,681 --> 00:40:00,936
If you try drawing on it,
I guarantee you'll forget paper.

557
00:40:00,936 --> 00:40:02,512
I said I don't want it.

558
00:40:02,512 --> 00:40:04,895
- Trust me. It's good. I want to give it to you.
- I don't want it.

559
00:40:04,895 --> 00:40:06,324
Can you please accept my kindness?

560
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:08,164
Hey, I said I don't want it!

561
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:10,144
Do you understand what I say?

562
00:40:12,295 --> 00:40:15,141
And don't bring up drawing again.

563
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:43,897
Hello, hun.

564
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:47,655
Yes, I'm on my way back.

565
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,485
Don't tell him yet.

566
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:53,795
I want to see his face when he's happy.

567
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:21,020
Was I too harsh on him?

568
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:29,620
I wonder if Moo is still angry with me.

569
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,017
It's 3 a.m. now. I better wait until morning.

570
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:53,025
Moo?

571
00:41:54,356 --> 00:41:56,949
Kang, where did you go?

572
00:41:57,904 --> 00:41:59,904
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

573
00:41:59,904 --> 00:42:01,541
Why have you been waiting?

574
00:42:04,948 --> 00:42:07,103
I want to apologize to you.

575
00:42:07,103 --> 00:42:11,969
I don't know if I crossed any line
but seeing how mad you were at me,

576
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:15,994
I think you had your reasons.

577
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,907
And I thought over what I did.

578
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:22,727
It's my fault. I'm sorry, Kang.

579
00:42:22,727 --> 00:42:27,216
It's not your fault. I shouldn't have
taken my feelings out on you.

580
00:42:27,216 --> 00:42:28,277
Stop.

581
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:51,828
What did you do?

582
00:42:51,828 --> 00:42:53,531
It was just a mosquito.

583
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:56,481
I did what you told me to.
I shooed it away and it left.

584
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:01,035
But I'm not a mosquito.

585
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,562
No matter how much you shoo me away,
I won't leave.

586
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,182
After Kang and I made up,

587
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,366
I follow him everywhere.

588
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,770
Here's a friendly reminder.

589
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,592
If you keep spending your time helping me

590
00:43:42,592 --> 00:43:44,987
instead of getting enough sleep,
your academics are going to suffer.

591
00:43:44,987 --> 00:43:47,455
I sucked at those moves just now.

592
00:43:47,455 --> 00:43:48,840
I'll teach you how to dance.

593
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,864
Come on.

594
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:51,915
That I...

595
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,716
Why didn't you tell me you're sick?

596
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:58,002
Not only am I physically sick,
I've also started to feel lovesick.

597
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,778
Oh, Moo!

598
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:01,356
You like Moo, don't you?
