Your driving skill is bad.

Come here.

00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,040
Come.

00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,400
(My name is Ji Yu.)

00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,680
(An influencer manager
who has tough luck.)

(Today is the seventh day
since I was fired.)

18

(However,)

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,319
What's your name?

20
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,390
(The young man who's playing
with a dog in front of me)

21
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,319

Xia Mu, the live stream
is about to start.

25
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,260
Are you sure you want
to do plating for only one fruit plate?

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,220
Chef Zhang didn't teach that...

27
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,660
I will plate the fruit however I want.

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,001
You may take a rest.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,040
Xia Mu,

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,961
I sent you to learn cooking
from the top chef.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,390
Look at your attitude now.

32
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:16,961
Get this right.

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,681
I'm the live streamer.

34
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,401
You rely on me to make money.

35
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:22,320
I'm the boss.

36
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,800
Is it only work business
between us?

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,561
Don't you know

38
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,320
I got you this far?

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,961
Don't get carried away.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,841
Do you really think
you are a big-time manager?

41
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:36,640
Don't you forget

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,760
that your dad is a murderer.

43
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,040
You are abandoned and unloved.

44
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,360
Mr. Xu, please hear me out.

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Don't explain. Shut up.

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,561
You are fired. Scram!

47
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:55,360
Mr. Xu.

48
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,681
What has happened?

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,700
Wait for me at my place.

50
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:18,390
I will send you the password.
I will be back soon.

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,600
You sleaze, dress properly.

52
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,001
Who is the sleaze here?

53
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,881
Miss, don't be ridiculous.

54
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,241
I'm ridiculous?

55
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,800
(She hasn't changed at all)

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,080
(after so many years.)

57
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:57,040
I'm ridiculous?

58
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,520
This day couldn't get any worse!

59
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:01,561
Framed by my friend, got fired,

60
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:03,800
and now a kiddo is
calling me ridiculous!

61
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,040
Fine.

62
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,441
I will show you

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,161
what ridiculous really means.

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,161
Miss, calm down.

65
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,640
(Little Panda,
let me heal you this time.)

66
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,481
Uh, should I come back later?

67
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,561
No, right on time.

68
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,200
Chase this pervert out.

69
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,320
You are the pervert.

70
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,001
Well.

71
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,320
Getting fired is no big deal.

72
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,801
It's not the end of the world.

73
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:00,280
Here.

74
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:04,960
Careful, it's hot.

75
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,801
Characters in the series

76
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,200
would at least meet their true love

77
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:12,840
when they fail in their career.

78
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,400
How come I have to suffer

79
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,241
two failures in tandem?

80
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,561
Get a grip.

81
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,400
I happened

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
to know a food live streamer

83
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,361
who had just started.

84
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:22,960
You can give it some thought.

85
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,520
Who is it?

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,561
It's him.

87
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,041
I need to go now.

88
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:36,241
You...

89
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,801
Oh, right.

90
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,640
Don't simply let other strange men
shower at your place.

91
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:52,200
Are you really not giving
Ji Yu any chances?

92
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,361
She has crossed the line.

93
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,481
She wouldn't know how kind I am to her

94
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:59,160
if she didn't encounter
some difficulties.

95
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:00,441
Don't worry.

96
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,080
Very soon,

97
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,960
she will come to me

98
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,760
and apologize.

99
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
When the time comes...

100
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,280
What if Ji Yu doesn't come back?

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,481
Get out.

102
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,601
(Xia Mu)
He blocked my account.

103
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
He cooks quite well.

104
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,280
He is quite good-looking.

105
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,481
I can make him a persona
of a cat-type young boyfriend.

106
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,361
He is called

107
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:15,041
Shi Guang, right?

108
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,280
I knew you would agree.

109
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,601
Do you like him? He has real skills.

110
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,801
Way better than Xia Mu.

111
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:23,840
He might get short-term traffic.

112
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,601
But the growth of his followers
is too slow.

113
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:27,881
I will get him

114
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,361
a cooking show.

115
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:29,921
Look,

116
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,561
Shaanxi's Flavor
Foodie Observation Season.

117
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:34,400
It's a cooking competition show.

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,320
First place will be awarded
with a one-year endorsement

119
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,760
of the platform.

120
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:40,280
I know the judge
of the preliminary round.

121
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:41,561
He might win in the first round.

122
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,001
You are so confident.

123
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:43,760
All right.

124
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,601
I'm counting on you.

125
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:50,041
What? The judge of the preliminary round
is replaced?

126
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,001
Who is the substitute?

127
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,080
Do I know this person?

128
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,001
Of course you do.

129
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,200
Xia Mu?

130
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,220
(Judge)

131
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,960
I heard that you found a new influencer

132
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
called Shi Guang.

133
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,441
Who do you think you are

134
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,320
to share the same green room with me?

135
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,320
May I know who you are?

136
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,921
I'm here to inform you

137
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,601
that you are out.

138
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,321
Take your things and leave.

139
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:39,922
All right. Thank you.

140
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,241
I...

141
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
You are No. 3, Shi Guang, right?

142
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:49,881
The nerve of you.

143
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
Hello, Xia Mu.

144
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,560
Shaanxi's Flavor Cooking Competitive
is now underway.

145
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,680
Let's follow the judge

146
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,001
and see what the contestants

147
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,400
are doing.

148
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,841
Mr. Zhang.

149
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:23,201
Director Lu and I have been friends
for years.

150
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,601
Can you please do me this favor

151
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,800
and let Shi Guang advance?

152
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:28,440
It's not that I don't want to help you.

153
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,400
But the investors...

154
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:32,560
Can't you do anything at all?

155
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,481
I can't.

156
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:37,481
Contestant No. 3,

157
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,081
Shi Guang.

158
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,961
Can you tell us why you partake
in this competition?

159
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:46,241
I want to teach the audience

160
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:47,280
how to prepare local delicacies

161
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,040
through live streaming and videos

162
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,280
so that their cooking methods
and the stories behind them

163
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,361
can be passed down.

164
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:53,920
Every contestant

165
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,280
thinks the same as you.

166
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,961
Why should we pick you?

167
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,280
Besides,

168
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,361
it seems that your manager
has been caught up

169
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,160
in some negative news.

170
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,081
Choosing someone like you

171
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:11,260
might bring bad influence

172
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,800
to the show.

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,001
You are not the only judge

174
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,121
in the preliminary round.

175
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:27,001
Judges,

176
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,520
my Biangbiang Noodles is done.

177
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,560
Please have a taste.

178
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,440
Let's congratulate
contestant No. 3, Shi Guang,

179
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:33,841
for advancing to the next round.

180
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,920
I won't bother you anymore.

181
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,321
Yu,

182
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm amazing, right?

183
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,241
I'm confident in my cooking.

184
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,721
You can try next time.

185
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,841
Yu.

186
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:05,760
Ji Xu.

187
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,481
This...

188
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,800
This shirt is expensive.

189
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:19,001
How much? I will pay you.

190
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,560
This is a global limited edition.

191
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,920
There are only five pieces.

192
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,601
Plus, this is customized.

193
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,321
There are four other pieces.

194
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:32,241
I will compensate you
with a unique piece.

195
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,040
What?

196
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:52,001
Look.

197
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,601
This is the sole limited edition piece
in the world.

198
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:55,841
It's nice to wear, right?

199
00:11:58,361 --> 00:11:59,160
Shi Guang.

200
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,241
This is your first destination.

201
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,081
The car behind is prepared
by the production team.

202
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,841
Safe journey.

203
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:06,841
Thank you.

204
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,640
This car looks older than me.

205
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,241
Will it break down

206
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,721
before we reach Shannxi?

207
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:30,841
Count your blessing, young man.

208
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,400
This program is sponsored by Starmaker.

209
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:33,881
You offended Xia Mu before.

210
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:36,121
He demanded you two walk to Shaanxi

211
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,481
during the meeting.

212
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,841
This old car and
the little travel allowance

213
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,961
were requested by Ji Yu

214
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,590
after a long negotiation
with the production team.

215
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,160
How much travel allowance do we have?

216
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,440
Come.

217
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:48,680
3,000.

218
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,481
3,000?

219
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,241
Only 3,000?

220
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:53,400
Ji Yu,

221
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,680
no wonder

222
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,440
you are fired by Starmaker.

223
00:12:59,001 --> 00:12:59,321
You!

224
00:12:59,321 --> 00:12:59,660
Enough.

225
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:02,601
Forget it. I will pay for it myself.

226
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:05,601
The production team

227
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:08,241
will disqualify any contestants

228
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:09,841
who chip in for the allowance.

229
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:11,481
Well...

230
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,841
Yu, as my manager,

231
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:18,280
you can't let them control you.

232
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:19,640
You have to fight back.

233
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:21,601
You must speak

234
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:22,640
your mind.

235
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,090
You have to...

236
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,121
Wait.

237
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:31,440
Why did she leave?

238
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,520
Did I say anything wrong?

239
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,361
Take good care of her.

240
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:37,280
That's all I can do for you.
