=Episode 13=

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,159
Expose the big scandal of Starmaker
harming its managers tonight.

4
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:44,990
Now, make your orders!

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,399
(One box of persimmons for a truth.)

6
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,600
(Ten boxes.)

7
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,990
(Hurry up and talk, don't hold back.)

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,890
(I've ordered two jars of vinegar.
Come on, spill it.)

9
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,850
(Let the bullet comments fly
a little longer.)

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,719
(I've paid.)

11
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,560
Contact Linda.

12
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,959
Tell her to name her price

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,690
as long as she doesn't reveal.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,760
Yes.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,920
(My first project at Starmaker)

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,640
(was snatched from Xia Mu.)

17
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,760
A mere influencer dares

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,200
to compete with me?

19
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,599
You're overestimating yourself.

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,400
(From that day on,)

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,280
(I decided to get revenge on Xia Mu)

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,480
(to completely ruin him.)

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,439
(I discovered
that all of Xia Mu's resources)

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,519
(came from his manager, Ji Yu.)

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,519
(So I forged chat logs
showing Ji Yu insulting him.)

26
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,640
(Unexpectedly, this idiot)

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,120
(believed it
without even verifying.)

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,640
(Afterward, out of spite,)

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,400
(Xia Mu pretended to be depressed
and slandered Ji Yu.)

30
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,039
(And as you all saw.)

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,919
(The video released)

32
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,560
(a few days ago)

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,919
(was also taken by me.)

34
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,120
Xia Mu told me

35
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,680
that if I could kick them
out of the competition,

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,879
the championship would be mine.

37
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,039
So,

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,759
after hearing the truth,

39
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,159
do you still think Ji Yu is evil?

40
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,800
She was framed,

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,990
fired, and slandered
all over the internet.

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,479
Now that she's finally making
a comeback,

43
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,719
I hope you can go easy on her
with your words

44
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,400
because the one
who truly deserves the blame

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,800
(is me).

46
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,159
(I feel guilty.)

47
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,400
Our company has been trending
on social media for a while now.

48
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,280
Find Xia Mu quickly

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,479
and get a PR team

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,120
to handle this crisis immediately.

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,919
Yes.

52
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,800
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xia is missing.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,080
Go and find him quickly.

54
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,360
Can't you two be separated for a moment?

55
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,479
I've wronged you.

56
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,639
It's okay.

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
It's all Xia Mu's fault.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,319
If he had shown me the chat,

59
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,479
we wouldn't be like this today.

60
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,919
Family

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,680
becomes a mess in the end.

62
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,960
Comrades end up

63
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,759
with a tarnished reputation.

64
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,159
All these feelings

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,199
and emotions are not worth it.

66
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,520
I was totally devoted.

67
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:09,919
Yes.

68
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,879
Not worth going all in.

69
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,280
Xia Mu

70
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,719
is a scum.

71
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,160
Yes, he's a scum!

72
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,959
Yes, he's a scum.

73
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,480
Help yourself.

74
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,680
They've left. Let's continue drinking.

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,319
Xia Mu,

76
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,959
you and I

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,480
are irreconcilable enemies.

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,120
Yes, irreconcilable enemies.

79
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,639
Ji...

80
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,920
Ji Yu...

81
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,639
No, it’s not okay.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,800
A man

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,480
can't say it’s not okay.

84
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,199
Ji Yu...

85
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,800
Hello?

86
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,680
(Ji Yu,)

87
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
(the program crew asked me)

88
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,879
if you wanted to continue participating
in the competition

89
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,120
(or return to Beijing
to record the finale.)

90
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,759
I'll ask Shi Guang.

91
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:04,680
Okay.

92
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,160
Ask him when you wake up.

93
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,480
We only have Xi'an left.

94
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,519
Xi'an is both the beginning
and the final stop.

95
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,399
Even if we have no contestants,

96
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,600
I still want to finish the competition.

97
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,920
All right. No problem.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Wait.

99
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Isn't Ji Yu still in bed?

100
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,000
Why are you two together?

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,279
I...

102
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,639
Hello?

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,600
What's going on with these two?

104
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,450
Are you not going
to take responsibility?

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,399
We are all adults.
What's wrong with sleeping together?

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,680
This...

107
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,920
It's my first time.

108
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,480
So what?

109
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,079
Look.

110
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,600
These are my parents.

111
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,399
They were childhood sweethearts
and had a great relationship.

112
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,879
But when I was seven years old,

113
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,519
my dad still had an affair.

114
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,480
My mom would rather die than divorce.

115
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,000
In the end, she was beaten to death.

116
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,919
This is love.

117
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,759
Love

118
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,360
is the best outcome

119
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,399
over time.

120
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,080
More often,

121
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,320
it rots, deforms,
and becomes unrecognizable.

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,480
So,

123
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
rather than restricting human nature,

124
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,960
it's better to indulge
in animal instincts.

125
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
A brief moment of pleasure.

126
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,770
Understand?

127
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,440
Ji Yu.

128
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,000
When you lie,

129
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,770
your fingers
will unconsciously rub your clothes.

130
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Ji Yu,

131
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,480
I promise

132
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,559
I will never be like your dad.

133
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,080
So please don't reject me.

134
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,200
But I don't want to right now.

135
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,080
Not wanting to now doesn't mean never.

136
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
Ji Yu, I like you.

137
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,080
I want you to be my girlfriend.

138
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,480
I know you don't want to now.

139
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,519
But I will always be with you

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
until you accept this relationship.

141
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,600
Until then, we can be friends,

142
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,200
lovers,

143
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,120
or siblings.

144
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,279
I can be

146
