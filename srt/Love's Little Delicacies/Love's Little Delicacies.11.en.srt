00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,700
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,399
Guess

4
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,000
how many years
has the braised gravy been simmering?

5
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,119
It can't be a century, can it?

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,439
It's not that long.

7
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,679
I just made it yesterday. It's fresh.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,200
You must be Shi Guang, right?

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,200
Come.

10
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,200
Have a seat.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,599
Mr. Jiang told me

12
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,280
you offered to sell local specialties
to the village folks.

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,920
I will go and get the sample for you.

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,840
Give me a moment.

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,040
Wait.

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,400
When did Jiang Yang mention
the extra live stream commerce?

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,359
Uh...

18
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,840
I'm doing this live stream for free.

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
You didn't charge any fee?

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,359
Lower your volume.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,439
I trade this offer
for the braised gravy recipe

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,599
with the boss lady.

23
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,120
Normally, they don't allow
video shooting here,

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,400
so I could only give up the commission.

25
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,040
But I can learn to cook here

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,680
and film that for our footage.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,760
No wonder the boss lady

28
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,560
was so kind to you.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
It turns out
you didn't charge her a fee.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,799
What are you doing here?

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
(Shaanxi's Flavor)
It's the program's mission.

32
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,359
The production team only instructed us

33
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,159
to pick a restaurant
to promote products...

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,879
They didn't mention
we couldn't choose the same restaurant.

35
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,200
Besides,

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,439
their offer is so irresistible

37
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,239
that I can't refuse.

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,159
Anyway, I can't believe

39
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,640
how foolish someone must be
to not accept the commission.

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,360
Heh!

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,599
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,319
How many orders have you sold?

43
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,240
Do what you are paid for.

44
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,759
Come and have a look.

45
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,280
These are all samples.

46
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,159
I have recorded

47
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,879
buyers and stocks.

48
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,199
If you have any questions,

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
feel free to ask me.

50
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,080
Madam, Linda...

51
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,479
My son hired her.

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,039
She is a CFK from an MBA,
something like that.

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,039
It's KOL from an MCN.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,120
Right, that's it.

55
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,240
Have a look first.

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,639
I will get someone
to set up the shooting site.

57
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,240
The cooking method
for Shaanxi sheep entrails

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,680
is quite similar
to Inner Mongolia's dish.

59
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,080
Are there any Inner Mongolians

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
watching now?

61
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,319
The soup base for sheep entrails
varies according to preference.

62
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,240
The original soup base is thick

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,439
and has no gamey smell.

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,520
You won't resist the mutton aroma.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,439
If you add a spoonful

66
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,400
of Shaanxi's unique chili oil,

67
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,800
it enhances the aroma of the soup base.

68
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
What I just used

69
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,240
is the sheep entrails ingredient pack

70
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,340
in the first link
in the bottom left corner.

71
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,240
It contains sheep blood tofu

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,439
and entrails like heart, liver, lung,
intestines, and stomach.

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
One package is used for a pot

74
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,719
that serves three to four people.

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,520
Don't worry about the freshness
of the mutton.

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,639
They are slaughtered,

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,590
vacuum-sealed, packaged, and delivered
in a cold chain on the same day.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,039
As for potatoes and tofu,

79
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,479
they are in the second and third links
in the bottom left corner.

80
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,840
Of course, there is more
than one cooking method.

81
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,280
You can add your own ingredients

82
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,039
or seasoning

83
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,319
as well as

84
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,199
your best wishes.

85
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,919
Babies, shake your bodies.

86
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,079
We have big discounts.

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,480
Don't rest your fingers.

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,319
Super deal of 99 yuan.

89
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,240
Everything is a steal.

90
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,959
All great deals are exclusive here.

91
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,839
Hurry up and click on the link. Yeah!

92
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,319
We haven't received much traffic

93
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,850
because the live streaming just started.

94
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,480
The sales are now less than 2,000 orders.

95
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,680
Just admit you are incompetent.

96
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,439
Don't always blame
the short live stream duration.

97
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,439
Look at my sales.

98
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
You will never surpass it in your life.

99
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,319
The champion of the live-streaming
must be mine.

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Bring me the 100-year-old braised gravy.

101
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,839
I'm going to use that
in the next session.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,120
No problem. Right away.

103
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,319
I don't agree.

104
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,839
Without my permission,

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,439
no one will touch the braised gravy.

106
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,480
Mom,

107
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,920
I'm trying to promote our products.

108
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,260
We need something to attract viewers.

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,240
That's the last jar
of 100-year-old braised gravy.

110
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,519
What if it falls or something?
How will we carry on with our business?

111
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,040
Can't you be like them

112
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,360
and not worry me?

113
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,279
Ms. Linda's sales exceeded ten thousand
in only half an hour.

114
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,360
What's wrong with what I'm doing?

115
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,079
Selling the products
is the right thing to do.

116
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Bring the gravy jar here.

117
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,720
You!

118
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,120
Mom.

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,300
(The immoral agent must
leave Shi Guang's live stream.)

120
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,360
Hi, babies. Look at this.

121
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,480
This is the last jar
of 100-year-old braised gravy.

122
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,040
Someone commented
that the gravy is older than me.

123
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,959
That proves that I'm honest.

124
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,319
This is definitely a good buy.

125
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,519
Let's take a closer look

126
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,319
at this 100-year-old braised gravy.

127
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,759
Thank you, Wild Heart,
for the great rewards.

128
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,120
Guys, send your gifts.

129
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,079
My braised gravy!

130
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,639
You wastrel!

131
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,879
This is the final jar we have.

132
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,920
And you broke it.

133
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,680
We might as well close the shop.

134
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,959
You have to compensate me.

135
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,240
What does this have to do with me?

136
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,360
Your son told them to bring it here.

137
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,879
I was too eager to make good sales

138
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,920
and wanted to sell

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,839
all our products.

140
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,079
Now,

141
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,759
I have wasted

142
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,580
the only 100-year-old braised gravy
we had.

143
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,839
See? It's not my fault.

144
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,680
Who is this?

145
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,639
Who do you think I am?
It's me, Xu Fujiang.

146
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,279
(Linda, do you know the video
of you spilling the braised gravy)

147
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,480
has gone viral?

148
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,879
(All shareholders are affected badly)

149
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,120
because of that,

150
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,839
you know?

151
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm so disappointed in you, Linda.

152
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,040
(You must fix this within today.)

153
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
If not,

154
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,480
you will be fired

155
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,240
tomorrow morning.

156
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,839
Do you hear me?

157
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,680
Is there nothing that can be done?

158
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,160
Isn't there

159
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,680
something like a recipe?

160
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,240
We don't have that.

161
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,160
I wouldn't be so desperate if we did.

162
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,839
This braised gravy

163
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,120
has been passed down through
my husband's family for generations.

164
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,480
I only have the recipe
for adding ingredients.

165
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,639
Perhaps I can give it a try.

166
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,680
Really?

167
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,040
I can help you,

168
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,839
but on one condition.

169
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,320
You shouldn't have helped her.

170
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,260
I agreed to restore
the braised gravy recipe

171
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,840
so that she would give us
the complete footage.

172
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,039
That way, we don't have to draw a line
between us.

173
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,200
Shi Guang,

174
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm your manager.

175
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,720
We are only business partners.

176
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,120
Besides,

177
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
I'm older than you,

178
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,440
so I will look out for you

179
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,960
in everyday life

180
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
if I can.

181
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,720
If this has caused
any misunderstandings...

182
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,879
Ji Yu,

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,120
how long are you going to avoid me?

184
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,039
You have worked so hard.

185
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Not really.

186
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,000
Try this.

187
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,679
I can't taste any difference.

188
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,360
No, there is a difference.

189
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,480
But I can't tell what it is.

190
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,720
You don't often eat this,

191
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,039
that's why
you can't tell the difference.

192
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,039
No pressure.

193
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,039
My son

194
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,679
tried to do it several times,

195
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,770
but he couldn't restore
the original taste.

196
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,480
In that case, people who are familiar with
the food might tell the difference, right?

197
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,120
