=Episode 4=

3
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,280
My friend.

4
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,479
You have to help me with this.

5
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,119
Otherwise,

6
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,960
I can't perform tomorrow night.

7
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,679
My family has arranged
a blind date for me.

8
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,280
Are you threatening me?

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,640
Shi Guang.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,280
I really think of you as a friend.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,479
What about Ji Yu?

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,359
I really like her.

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,519
She is my agent.

14
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,400
I know that the two of you are close.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,480
But I really want to court her.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,680
You can help me.

17
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,599
I need to add another rule.

18
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,680
My agent is not allowed
to get into a relationship.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,760
Shi Guang.

20
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,120
Madam.

21
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,959
Is Ji Yu here?

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,280
She went to buy some seasoning for me.
She'll be back soon.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Shi Guang.

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,319
Ji Yu told me that you wanted
to learn how to cook Shaanxi cuisine.

25
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,159
I have a special dish to teach you.
Do you want to learn?

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,560
This Xue noodles dish

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,360
is a dish that Song's dad

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,919
cooked for me often when he courted me.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,919
After his dad passed away,
I cook it myself.

30
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,919
So, if you like someone,

31
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,319
you need to let her know

32
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,639
your feelings for her earlier.

33
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,319
Otherwise, it'll be unfortunate

34
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,319
if you lose her.

35
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,879
I don't like her.

36
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,319
Then why were you so mad
when they pretended

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
to be a couple to deceive me?

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,319
She is my agent.

39
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,520
Without my permission, how can she...

40
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,479
How can she fall in love
with someone else?

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,879
Don't worry.

42
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,800
She won't fall for Song.

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,039
Really?

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Yes.

45
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,439
This is the right way to do it?

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,319
Yes. This is how you do it.

47
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,439
We have practice at seven
at the old factory.

48
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,759
I've sent you the address.

49
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,439
Remember to bring
your rock band members along.

50
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,439
Okay. I'll hang up now.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,479
Are you not mad anymore?

52
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,159
Are you really not in love with Song?

53
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,680
It has always been just work for me.

54
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,759
Jiang Yang wants me to sign with them.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,400
Why are you asking me that?

56
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:25,960
I...

57
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,560
You are my agent, do you know that?

58
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,680
Yes. So?

59
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,960
So, you are mine.

60
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,960
You are mine alone.

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,680
Why haven't Ji Yu and Shi Guang
withdrawn from the competition?

62
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,520
According to the project team,

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,439
they are going to hold a small concert

64
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,560
to gain more fans.

65
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,960
A food blogger

66
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,879
is going to hold a concert?

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,319
How ridiculous.

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
The band that they are working with
rejected our offer to sign with us.

69
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,680
They are just fools who rejected us.

70
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,639
What can they achieve?

71
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,599
Hello.

72
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,719
It's me.

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,639
Help me do something.

74
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,639
What do you think?

75
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,759
This combination is lit, right?

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,199
Lu, stop practicing!

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,800
Something bad has happened to your shop!

78
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,600
(Chengyang Mutton Stew)
What kind of shop is this?

79
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,000
The mutton is terrible.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,120
Look.

81
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,759
The mutton is only prepared upon order.

82
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,959
So, your mutton stew is not authentic.

83
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
If you can't serve us
authentic mutton stew today,

84
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,279
I'm going to expose you online.

85
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,920
Well...

86
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,240
He's blackmailing us.

87
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Calm down.

88
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,680
If we can serve you

89
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,480
authentic mutton stew today,

90
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,399
are you going to compensate us

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,199
for everything that you've destroyed?

92
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,000
Sure.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,759
Otherwise, you'll have to compensate me.

94
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,720
Let me do a live broadcast for you.

95
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,199
My fellow viewers,

96
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,439
I'm going to expose
a terrible shop today.

97
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:23,560
This is great.

98
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,920
I was just thinking that this topic
is interesting enough

99
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,800
to help us gain some attention.

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,480
I was thinking about
doing a live broadcast.

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,839
Now, he's doing it for us.

102
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Leave it to me.

103
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
Let's come and take a look.

104
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,000
Do a live broadcast
with Shi Guang's account now.

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,000
My fellow viewers,

106
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,160
let us witness

107
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,360
his failure together.

108
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,160
His cooking skills are not bad.

109
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,120
Are you going to pay
with Alipay or WeChat?

110
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,439
Do you want to scan me
or should I scan you?

111
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,639
Shi Guang is awesome.

112
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,759
He made a name for himself

113
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,240
by quarreling with someone
and cooking for them.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,079
Isn't that great.

115
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,639
It's like a teaser for tonight's

116
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,920

117

(Make sure to create a topic for it.)

118

Don't worry. Everything will be great.

Tonight,

120
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,759

the number-one topic of the night.)

121

They are my best friend, Shi Guang,

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and his agent,

146
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,039
Ji Yu.

147
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,440
Mr. Xia, it's bad.

148
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,000
Shi Guang's live broadcast
has over 100 million views.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,700
What did you say?

150
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,720
Tell Linda

151
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,879
that if she wants
to become the champion,

152
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,120
she has to ruin
Ji Yu and Shi Guang's reputation.

153
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,320
Yes, Mr. Xia.

154
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,320
Go now!

155
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,720
I want to let Ji Yu know

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,240
that she is nothing

157
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,679
without me.

158
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,279
Shi Guang and her

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,080
have helped me gain

160
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
the attention
that I've never ever dreamt about.

161
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,240
Because of her,

162
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,720
I know what love at first sight is.

163
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,679
For the first time ever,
she has given me

164
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,879
the urge to stop for someone.

165
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,399
Song, what are you talking about?

166
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,320
Even my best friend is encouraging me.

167
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,639
So, let me

168
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,519
ask you this sincerely.

169
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,879
- Confess.
- Confess.

170
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,960
- Confess.
- Confess.

171
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,639
- Confess.
- Confess.

172
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,360
Ji Yu, from the first time I saw you,

173
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,240
I fell for you.

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,320
Are you willing to be my girlfriend?

175
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,039
- Accept him.
- Accept him.

176
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,559
- Accept him.
- Accept him.

177
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,799
- Accept him.
- Accept him.

178
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,159
- Accept him.
- Accept him.

179
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,039
- Accept him.
- Accept him.

180
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,759
Ji Yu.

181
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,720
Accept him.

182
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:35,919
Ji Yu.

183
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,960
Song.

184
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't stop Song
from confessing his love.

185
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,759
Sir.

186
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,960
I told you many times.

We are just business partners.

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
I don't like you.

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,639
I want to confess my feelings to you.

190
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,679
I don't want to hear it.

191
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,399
Tell me, then.

192
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,200
Do you have someone you love?

193
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,759
If you do,
I'll let you go right now.

194
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,759
The person she loves

195
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,960
is me.
