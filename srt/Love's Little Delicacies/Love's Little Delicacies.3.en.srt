=Episode 3=

3
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,240
Thank you for
your treat today, Mr. Song.

4
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,759
The owner of this shop is my friend.

5
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,280
Come here anytime
if you like this place.

6
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,159
It'll be my treat.

7
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,680
Sure.

8
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,159
She is my agent.

9
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,640
Why should you treat her?

10
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,640
About the question you ask me,

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,599
I'll think about it before
I give you an answer.

12
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,400
Stay away from her, do you hear me?

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:20,760
What are you doing?

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,159
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,159
Shi Guang, you are drunk.

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,280
I'm not.

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,560
See you tomorrow.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,879
Okay.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,159
Let's go.

21
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:30,799
Let's go.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,560
Let's go.

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,959
Why are you getting drunker and drunker?

24
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,439
How much did you drink?

25
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,599
Let me take you back to your room first.

26
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,790
Then I'll buy some
hangover medicine for you.

27
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:52,799
Ji Yu.

28
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,480
Let's go up.

29
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,799
What did you talk about just now?

30
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,480
Work.

31
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,280
Be careful.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Really?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It didn't look like work to me.

34
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,840
You are the one

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,400
who wants Qinqiang to perform
together with the rock band.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,879
So, I have to convince him to do that.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,479
Be careful.

38
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,560
But I think

39
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,039
that he has an ulterior motive
against you!

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,800
Okay. Be good.

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,879
Let's go inside first.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,639
Ji Yu.

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,400
I've done so much for you
all these years.

44
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,759

Are you awake now?

60
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,280
How much did you drink last night?

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,240
I almost brought you
to the hospital for gastric lavage.

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,680
I...

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,680
Did I do something strange

64
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,439
after I got drunk last night?

65
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,800
Yes.

66
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,399
What did I do?

67
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,480
Be careful. Come in.

68
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,839
Be careful.

69
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,439
Shi Guang.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
Shi Guang.

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,480
How much did you drink?

72
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,079
Shi Guang.

73
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,800
What's wrong?

74
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,199
Get up and get changed.

75
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,519
Then, eat your breakfast.

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I'm meeting Song later.

77
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,319
This song is not bad.

78
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,839
I can add it in.

79
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,240
Move aside.
Don't disturb me from working.

80
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,319
Does your work involve visiting
the bar early in the morning?

81
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm selecting the songs for his concert.

82
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,360
I've shot myself in the foot.

83
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,639
What?

84
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,879
Nothing.

85
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Hello?

86
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,000
(Come here at once.)

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,360
(Han is in trouble.)

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,160
What?

89
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,560
What happened?

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,279
Is it serious?

91
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,879
He was rushing to go for the practice.

92
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,120
A car hit him and broke two of his ribs.

93
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,079
He's fine.

94
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,279
But he has to rest for a month
according to the doctor.

95
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,880
So, we asked you to come here
because we want to know

96
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,560
if the show will continue to go on.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
The Sanqin Club doesn't have
enough people, to begin with.

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,680
What should we do now?

99
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,199
How about we cancel the show

100
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,519
and let him rest.

101
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,000
We don't have to cancel it.

102
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,279
We have Song.

103
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,360
You want me to help?

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,720
Sure.

105
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,279
But you need to help me first.

106
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,199
Let me do it.

107
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,319
Mum, this is my girlfriend, Ji Yu.

108
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,959
Nice to meet you.

109
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,279
Nice to meet you.

110
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,879
He is Ji Yu's cousin, Shi Guang.

111
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,160
What do you like about Song?

112
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,680
He

113
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,680
has a good personality.

114
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,480
He's handsome.

115
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,680
And he can play the guitar.

116
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,600
He can play the guitar?

117
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,720
How did the two of you meet?

118
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,600
He destroyed my fish and pebbles stew
with his guitar.

119
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,279
So, it means

120
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,399
that the two of you started as enemies.

121
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,800
You can say that.

122
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
I'll go and get some water.

123
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,399
You can continue.

124
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,759
You can continue.

125
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,919
Shi Guang.

126
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,039
Shi Guang.

127
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,320
I can tell that Song likes you a lot.

128
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,600
Unfortunately, you don't like him.

129
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,960
Have you seen through us?

130
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,279
Song

131
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
is a fool.

132
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,120
He can't tell

133
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,120
that your cousin likes you.

134
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,440
Am I right?

135
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,120
