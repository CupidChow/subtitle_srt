=Episode 6=

3
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,540
(Authentic Pinsanxian)

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,759
This is a hotpot shop.

5
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,200
How could their Pinsanxian be authentic?

6
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,840
Who says that we don't serve
authentic Pinsanxian here?

7
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,719
It's you guys again.

8
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm sure Mr. Zheng sent you guys here.

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,760
That's not it.

10
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,319
We're here to learn some recipes.

11
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,959
But I saw this brat

12
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,239
at the set today.

13
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,560
He even tried to kiss my wife.

14
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,400
That's not it.

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,599
You want to learn recipes from us?

16
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,239
I think you have an ulterior motive.

17
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,599
Turn right to leave.

18
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,599
I'm not teaching you.

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,200
Buddy, don't malign me.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,359
I have a girlfriend, you know?

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,799
Look. She's getting angry.

22
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,159
You...

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,359
Get out.

24
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,560
I said I'm not teaching you.

25
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,519
This is a token of our sincerity.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,000
400 yuan? Are you kidding me?

27
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,519
4,000 yuan.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,959
Thank you, mister.

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,120
I only wished to resolve
the issue as soon as possible.

30
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,199
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,319
He already...

32
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,719
I already kissed you this morning.

33
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,800
It should be fine if I kiss you again.

34
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,800
Why are you this angry...

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,319
Who said you could touch the money?

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,240
Huh?

37
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,719
You weren't angry when I kissed you?

38
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,599
Tonight, you'll sleep on the floor.

39
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,199
Switch off the lights.

40
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't switch them off.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
I can't sleep if you do that.

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Don't sleep, then.

43
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,360
Are you afraid of the dark?

44
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,400
Just switch off the lights.

45
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,919
I can chat with you.
You won't be afraid by then.

46
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,520
I already told you not to switch it off.

47
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,520
Fine. I won't.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,599
Great timing.

49
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,719
Don't come here.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Go away!

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,719
Don't come near me!

52
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,759
Go away! Don't come near me!

53
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
No!

54
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,759
Don't come near me!

55
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,280
Ji Yu.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,439
Don't come here!

57
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,290
I'll beat you to death!

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,960
Go away!

59
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,319
Ji Yu!

60
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,199
Sorry about that.
The circuit breaker tripped just now.

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,039
You guys can continue.

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,240
Have you experienced
something terrible before this?

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,399
That's none of your business.

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Don't be scared.

65
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,319
Just go to sleep.

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,120
I'll keep you company.

67
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,360
Dad, here you go.

68
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,560
Buddy, have some.

69
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
It's salty.

70
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,560
I'm done.

71
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,639
It tastes just nice. It's not salty.

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,240
Youngsters like you all
lack training and experience.

73
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,800
Come.

74
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Just ignore my father.

75
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,040
He's a picky eater. Let's continue.

76
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,360
Let me give you a massage.

77
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,680
No need for that.

78
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,920
Sit down. This is my expertise.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
Ji Yu, I'm sorry about last night.

80
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,000
It must've affected you two
from having fun.

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,120
That's why Shi Guang was beaten up.

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,000
It's all my fault.

83
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,160
Don't blame him.

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,120
What?

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,920
My wife and I heard everything.

86
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,439
Ji Yu, it's not
that I'm trying to criticize you,

87
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,839
but you were too harsh on him.

88
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,759
Shi Guang was crying because of you.

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,759
Don't you think it's possible

90
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,040
that I wasn't the one crying?

91
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,000
That's impossible.

92
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,360
The voice was coarse and rough.

93
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,519
I'm sure it was a man.

94
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,920
You...

95
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,199
I've already tried it ten times!

96
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,560
Why won't it work?

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,439
Do you even know how to teach people?

98
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,759
Pinsanxian is a soup.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,160
You won't be able to master it

100
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
in one day.

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,120
Back then, I spent around
three months to master it.

102
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,839
It's normal that you can't make it yet.

103
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,600
Around three months?

104
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,160
Of all the dishes to make,
we just have to make Pinsanxian.

105
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,439
Tell me, then. What should I do?

106
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,399
Actually,

107
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,839
you're already doing a great job.

108
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:01,920
Don't worry.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,490
I've never seen a genius even after
operating this shop for over a decade.

110
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,560
Now,

111
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,160
maybe Shi Guang
can't even make the stock yet.

112
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,160
Let's try it one more time.

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,199
This time, you should put less salt.

114
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,199
Listen,

115
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
if you wish to win a woman's heart,

116
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,040
you just need to cook for her.

117
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
Pinsanxian was the love token

118
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,920
between my wife and I.

119
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,959
And, one of its
most exciting side dishes

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,439
is the fried meatball.

121
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,560
For the meatballs,

122
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,319
you need to make them crispy.

123
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,879
After that, immerse them in the soup

124
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
and let them absorb it.

125
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,040
Once you bite into it,

126
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,639
you'll understand
the meaning of perfection.

127
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,399
This is also the hardest step

128
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,759
in mastering Pinsanxian.

129
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,920
Even a prodigy like me

130
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,800
spent one week on it
before I could master it.

131
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
Since you're just an ordinary person,

132
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,120
I think you can master it in one month.
Just work hard on it.

133
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,240
This is pretty simple.

134
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,720
This is impossible.

135
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,519
How could someone
succeed on their first try?

136
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,759
Let me try.

137
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,919
I even added
some diced lotus roots to it.

138
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,240
It makes it crunchier.

139
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,759
Kid, you're something else.

140
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,720
It just took you one minute?

141
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,799
You're truly something else.

142
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,320
Remember to create matching topics
for the live stream.

143
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,919
Shi Guang, you must be the devil.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
What's wrong? Wait for me.

145
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,360
It's nothing.

146
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,960
He was just shocked by my talent.

147
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,679
Try this.

148
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,559
I'll show you something later.

149
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,840
I don't feel like eating. I'm busy.

150
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,360
You have to eat.

151
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,600
You've been busy the entire day.

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Hurry and take a bite.

153
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,639
Alright.

154
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,159
What do you think? Is it nice?

155
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:46,000
It's normal.

156
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,799
How could that be? I...

157
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,519
Jiang Yang is calling me.

158
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,159
Hello?

159
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,279
Wait. I have a present for you.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,799
What did you say?

161
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,200
