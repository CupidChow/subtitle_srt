=Episode 19=

3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,920
The production team is at my house?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,600
That's sudden.

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,560
Already waiting
in the underground parking lot?

6
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,920
They just wanted to add in

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,479
a surprise visit section.

8
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,719
They can't just drop in unexpectedly.

9
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,039
They should tell us in advance

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,300
about movements and camera placement.

11
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,679
Wait for me here.
I have to deal with this.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,039
Alright, just go.

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,679
Okay.

14
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,000
Who...

15
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,200
Dad?

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,330
How much money do you owe again?

17
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,480
I'll pay it for you.

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,480
Just let me go.

19
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,000
Shut up, you.

20
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,480
Ji Yu!

21
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,599
Where is everyone?

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,319
Ji Yu!

23
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,599
Give me the key! Get out of my way!

24
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,599
What are you doing?

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,940
Tell Jiang Yang
that Ji Yu has been kidnapped.

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,760
Kidnapped?

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,959
That's an act, right?

28
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,599
Is it for real?

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
You ungrateful girl!

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,039
I gave birth to you, I raised you,

31
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,599
what's wrong with hitting you?

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,730
How dare you call the police?

33
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,439
I was imprisoned for so many years.

34
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,990
Your mother must have left you
a lot of money, right?

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,479
If you don't give it to me today,

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,240
I'll make sure you stay here forever.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,439
Go in!

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,199
Go in.

39
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,800
You better think about it.

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
If you don't give it to me,

41
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,879
just stay inside forever.

42
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,599
Why are you here?

43
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,159
I'm always here for you.

44
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,720
Are you alright?

45
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,240
I just saved you,

46
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,120
shouldn't you be thanking me?

47
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,959
You disgust me.

48
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,439
You got me,

49
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,240
but you won't escape from me.

50
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,319
How did you find my father?

51
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,959
Money makes the world go round.

52
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,610
Don't you know how hard up
your father is?

53
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,120
Ji Minghua, don't you try
taking advantage now.

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
I got her and I gave you the money.

55
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,560
You have no business in all other stuff.

56
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,959
Luckily, I still remember the password.

57
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,100
The internet police will be slow.

58
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,519
WeChat needs a QR code.

59
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,839
QQ...

60
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,959
I don't have Shi Guang's
contact information.

61
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,399
Oh, wait.

62
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't worry. Ji Yu will be fine.

63
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,240
We have called the police.

64
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,519
They will find out where she is soon.

65
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,759
Don't worry?

66
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,160
How can I not worry?

67
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,560
It's all my fault for
not watching over her.

68
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,439
No, I can't sit still and do nothing.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,199
I'm going out to find her.

70
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,439
It's not your fault at all.

71
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,940
(Daoli Little Panda posted a new status.)

72
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:41,720
Quick,

73
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,720
tell the police that I know where she is.

74
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,439
Okay.

75
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,120
Wait for me!

76
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
Ji Yu,

77
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,480
just give in.

78
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,360
No one will come and save you.

79
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,879
What are you doing?

80
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,560
In this world,

81
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
the only one who can save you

82
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,639
is me.

83
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,160
We can go back to the good old times,

84
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,560
can't we?

85
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,519
Help!

86
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,480
Let go of me!

87
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,519
Help!

88
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,560
Help!

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Help!

90
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:28,800
Ji Yu!

91
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,360
Let go!

92
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,199
Help!

93
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,360
Ji Yu!

94
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,920
Help!

95
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,720
Ji Yu.

96
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,199
Ji Yu, are you okay?

97
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,160
Are you hurt?

98
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,439
Shi Guang.

99
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,319
Don't worry.

100
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,199
I'm here.

101
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,079
Have a bite so that you gain some energy.

102
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,639
I just got a call from the police station.

103
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,360
They say Xia Mu and your father

104
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,639
are at the police station

105
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,559
being questioned right now.

106
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,919
That's good news.

107
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,639
Don't be upset anymore.

108
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,320
I will accompany you from now on, okay?

109
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,919
What the...

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,720
You...

111
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,159
What are you doing?

112
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,600
We are done shooting here,
we'll leave now.

113
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,399
Sorry to bother you.

114
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,639
It's okay, don't worry about it.

115
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,970
Bye bye. Thank you for your hard work.

116
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,420
- Jiang Yang, what are you doing?
- Jiang Yang, what are you doing?

117
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:34,960
I...

118
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,759
I sent a message to Shi Guang earlier.

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,159
You didn't see my message?

120
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,240
What were you guys doing then?

121
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,150
- What do you think?
- What do you think?

122
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,879
I...

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,290

your door password casually in the future.
