3
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,240
Shi Guang, you gained
five million followers yesterday!

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
We can remain in the show!

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,920
I told you already. Qinqiang opera rock
will definitely be popular.

6
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,260
(Yulin)

7
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,959
The mission for this stop
is a Pinsanxian contest.

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,879
This is where the GPS brought us.

9
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,120
A hotpot shop?

10
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,519
Go and ask them if this is the place.

11
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:36,920
Alright.

12
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,159
Mister.

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,000
Mister.

14
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,640
Is this

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,519
40th Li Lamb Restaurant?

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,000
You guys are mistaken.

17
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
This isn't the place.

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,400
What? This isn't the place?

19
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,879
We're mistaken?

20
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,180
(40th Li Lamb Restaurant)

21
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,780
(40th Li Lamb Restaurant)

22
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,319
There's someone here.

23
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,400
Where's the male lead?

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,639
We've been waiting two hours for him.

25
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,080
Is he trying to act like a big shot?

26
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,719
Yeah.

27
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,680
Is this the shop
designated by the program team?

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,840
It's strange.

29
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,039
I heard that their Pinsanxian

30
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,400
is the most popular among locals.

31
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,840
The male lead said
he's attending a banquet.

32
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
He won't be coming.

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,719
What about our shooting, then?

34
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,319
I have to promote our shop in advance

35
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,639
before the crew arrives.

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,919
This...

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,360
This...

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,599
Boss, I think that hunk will do.

39
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,639
I'm not an actor.

40
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,900
I'll pay you 1,000 yuan.

41
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,560
We're here to look for the boss.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,719
That's right.
We have something else to do here.

43
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:19,960
2,000 yuan.

44
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,759
2,000 yuan.

45
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,759
3,000 yuan.

46
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,120
I...

47
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,560
Deal.

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Ji Yu, what are you doing?

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,319
(Balance: 900)
We're running out of money.

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,599
Please suffer for our sake.

51
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,000
Go now.

52
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
(Balance: 900)

53
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,000
What are you doing?

54
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,240
Who allowed you to kiss my wife?

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,800
Who are you?

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
I!

57
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,240
Darling.

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,319
Our shop isn't doing too well.

59
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm here to make some pocket money.

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Why are you angry?

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,519
Darling,

62
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm just worried
that it might be too tough on you.

63
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,720
I bought this

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,079
yam bubble milk tea for you.

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,240
That's more like it.

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,639
You scared the young boy.

67
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,920
It's fine. Have a seat first.

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
Did I scare you?

69
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,399
No.

70
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,399
Your shop isn't doing too well?

71
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,839
Why did you come to my shop, then?

72
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,519
Go away. Don't bring your bad luck here.

73
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,720
Hey, are you trying to...

74
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
Bad luck?

75
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,240
You're a shop owner as well.

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,519
Do you think you're a big shot?

77
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,560
I quit!

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,120
That's right.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,120
Darling,

80
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,519
let's go.

81
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,319
Don't step on my skirt.

82
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,240
Come back!

83
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,920
You need to leave the costume behind!

84
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,680
Geez.

85
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,120
What kind of people are they?

86
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,360
No way!

87
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,279
4,000 yuan.

88
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,879
You two shouldn't look like
there's a feud between you two.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,079
You two need to be in love.

90
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,199
Shi Guang, you're done for.

91
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,199
Cut the crap. Finish the noodles.

92
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,040
That's right.

93
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,240
That's it.

94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,279
Closer.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,920
Perfect.

96
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,800
This is great.

97
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,519
That's it!

98
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,680
You have received 7,000 yuan.

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,800
Guys, great job.

100
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,600
The shooting was great.

101
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,800
Mr. Zheng, actually,
we're food bloggers.

102
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,399
We're here to learn
how to make Pinsanxian.

103
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,199
So, you two are actually celebrities?

104
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,000
Who's this?

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,879
You look like a Chinese opera singer.

106
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,199
I couldn't even recognize you.

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
With your looks,

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,560
you shouldn't try to swindle people.

109
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,720
Linda,

110
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,160
you do look ugly

111
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,759
when you get jealous.

112
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,519
Mister,

113
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,279
I'm Linda.

114
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,480
I'm

115
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,480
a food blogger

116
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,639
with eight million followers.

117
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,279
So, you're Miss Linda?

118
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,220
I've long heard of your name.

119
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,839
Mr. Dong told me about your arrival.

120
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
Mr. Zheng,

121
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,920
how could you teach
all kinds of lowly people?

122
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,560
Should I not be here?

123
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,720
You came to the right place.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,220
It's just
that they came to the wrong place.

125
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,160
What are you two still doing here?

126
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,160
Didn't you promise us
that you would teach us?

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,120
Nonsense. Who said so?

128
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,439
Just leave already.

129
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,319
Don't push us.

130
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,319
We'll leave by ourselves.

131
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,839
Leave the costume behind!

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,920
Let's go.

133
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,360
You guys!

134
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,160
I'll see how you guys
can compete with me

135
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,399
in three days.

136
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,040
That shop owner was too much.

137
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,490
So what if I don't have
that many followers?

138
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,960
I don't care about his stupid shop.

139
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah.

140
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,759
He looks down on food bloggers
that aren't that famous

141
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,100
just because his business is booming.

142
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,759
If so, we can just learn

143
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,960
the recipe from a shop
that isn't doing well, then.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,350
We can learn the recipe
no matter where we go.

145
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,759
Are you referring to

146
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,159
