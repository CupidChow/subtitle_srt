3
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,200
Say that again.

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,200
Where did the money we earned
from the live stream last night go?

5
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,240
To commemorate our first time,

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,600
I bought a meteorite.

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,159
It was a good deal.

8
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,200
There's also

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,840
(50 yuan Voucher)
a 50 yuan voucher for Rolls Royce.

10
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,000
That was the money
for our hotel stay tonight.

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,760
Can't you make things easier for me?

12
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,190
Where will we stay now
without money?

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,680
Uh...

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,560
I don't know.

(Free for Couple)

17
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,280
We'll stay here.

18
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,799
This is the place you found?

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,640
Free for couples?

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,400
For people like us

21
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,079
who are trying to become a couple,

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,159
it should be free too.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,480
Are you here to participate
in the event?

24
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,879
Couples have to kiss for a minute

25
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,390
and post a photo on their social media.

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,079
If you get more than twenty likes
and tag our location,

27
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,599
you can stay for free.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,079
Did you do this on purpose?

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,330
Give me your phone.
I'll take the picture for you.

30
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,159
Hurry up and kiss. I'm recording.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,239
Recording a video too?

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,480
You have a lot of tricks, huh?

33
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,960
Only tricks for you.

34
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,000
Are you a dog?

35
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,680
Don't rush.
We still have 30 seconds left.

36
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,560
Okay, your one minute is up.

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,159
Dude, you're quite professional.

38
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,360
Looks like you've never been
in a relationship.

39
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,280
How did you know?

40
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,520
The timing

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,560
should be changed to five minutes.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,439
A fan asked,

43
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,400
"Why do you want
to become a food blogger?"

44
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,319
I remember back in high school,

45
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,599
I stayed in the dorms.

46
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,199
The cafeteria food was terrible

47
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,280
and the portions were small.

48
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,400
So every time I got hungry at night,

49
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,159
I would watch food videos.

50
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,599
I remember following a blogger

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,400
named Daoli Little Panda.

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,199
I'm not sure if any
of you have heard of her.

53
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,080
Daoli Little Panda?

54
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,960
She's the one I mentioned before,
who said,

55
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,759
"Eating to fill up is just
an animal instinct,

56
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,960
but enjoying food is human nature".

57
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,120
Her food videos kept me company

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,159
(Daoli Little Panda)
through every hungry night.

59
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,520
Since then,

60
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,280
I wanted to become a food blogger.

61
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,599
If you had the chance,

62
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,800
would you want to meet her?

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,000
You know her?

64
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,759
I said, if.

65
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,400
If I could meet her,

66
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,519
of course, I'd love to.

67
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,490
Where's my chili powder?

68
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,959
Didn't you bring it?

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,600
It should be in the car.
I'll get it.

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,199
It's okay.

71
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,160
I'll go and get it myself.

72
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,370
At the same time, I can...

73
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,959
Be careful.

74
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:35,800
It's okay.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,480
Ji Yu.

76
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:44,839
Xia Mu?

77
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:46,614
I forbid you from being with him.

78
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,639
I made you who you are.

79
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,690
- It was me.
- Let me go.

80
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,759
You can only be with me.

81
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,240
It's over between us. So let me go.

82
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,490
Go to Beijing with me, okay?

83
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,600
After we get back,

84
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,390
I'll announce
that you're my girlfriend.

85
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,360
We've worked together for eight years

86
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,390
and dated for five years.

87
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,790
You can't just leave like this.

88
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,020
I don't want to hear all of these.

89
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,890
- Please.
-  let me go.

90
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,040
Let her go!

91
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:05,959
Shi Guang.

92
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Are you okay?

93
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,000
Xia Mu,

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,879
I really hate

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
the way you are now.

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,240
Didn't you say I am important to you

97
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,600
and you'll never leave me?

98
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,600
Why didn't you say that

99
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,680
when you fired her?

100
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
That was to teach her a lesson,

101
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,000
to correct her mistakes.

102
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,370
Do you still not understand
who is in the wrong, Xia Mu?

103
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,040
Do you remember the you who loved food?

104
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,800
You've long forgotten.

105
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,959
That person

106
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,480
can ruthlessly harm his peers

107
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,560
for a bit of resources

108
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,759
and roles now.

109
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,519
To gain more benefits,

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,759
he can easily

111
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,000
abandon quality content.

112
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,240
You even...

113
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,600
You even

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,680
repeatedly hurt me.

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,879
Girlfriend?

116
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,959
Don't you think it's a joke?

117
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,639
Ji Yu, I...

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,399
I remember you once said,

119
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,879
whether in poverty or wealth,

120
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,519
we would always be together.

121
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,800
Only now do I realize

122
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,920
what you meant by "together"

123
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,959
wasn't the same.

124
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,040
What you want is a submissive lover

125
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,759
who doesn't fight or argue.

126
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,360
I accompany you
when you need

127
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,199
and I'm kicked aside when you don't.

128
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,759
Am I something to cover up?

129
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,360
You want the warmth of a girlfriend

130
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,990
while maintaining your boyfriend image
in front of your fans.

131
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,790
Why do you dare to act
but not take responsibility?

132
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,240
Have you ever considered me
over all these years?

133
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,399
Ji Yu,

134
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,240
Can you give me another chance?

136
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,199

I'm willing to prove it to you.

188
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,480
Why are you silent?

189
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,960
Instead of thinking
about such boring questions,

190
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,440
why not think about
what we should do next?

191
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,159
The show is not finished yet.

192
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,440
(Flavors of Shaanxi)
We can't give up halfway, can we?

193
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,240
Can't you be a bit more romantic?

194
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,679
Mr. Shi Guang,

195
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,799
if you can get a vehicle

196
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,279
to take us to the city right now,

197
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,440
I'll talk poetry and literature
with you.

198
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,360
You two really know
how to give me trouble.

199
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,759
(Is a broken car not still a car?)

200
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,690
(The repair costs will be deducted
from your salaries.)

201
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,430
(I'm hanging up.)

202
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
How are we getting to the final stop?

203
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,519
