3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,039
Are we streaming this?

4
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,640
Yes, right now. There's no time left.

5
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,439
Alright, let's do it.

6
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,280
What's all this?

7
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:05,920
Get out!

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,439
Sir!

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,920
Sir!

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,920
Get out!

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:09,760
Sir.

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,840
I've said this many times,

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,799
we don't have any junk.

14
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,760
Go away now, shoo.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,599
Actually, sir,

16
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,319
we want to learn to make Hulu Chicken.

17
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,959
Cozying up to me won't work. Go away.

18
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,239
Sir, we are the production team.

19
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,490
You can call them if you don't believe.

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,439
You all are just a bunch of scammers

21
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,560
and come pretending with a camera even.

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,519
No...

23
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,920
Get out now. Shoo, shoo.

24
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:28,640
I...

25
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,760
(Zhang's Authentic Hulu Chicken)
This Hulu Chicken must be unauthentic.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,359
Let's go and learn about it elsewhere.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,319
Stop right there.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,200
Say, the camera
can come in for a close-up.

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,799
Sure.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
Young ones, watch and learn closely.

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,719
My store is the best on this street.

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,280
Don't you look down on me.

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,879
When I learned how to cook,

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,120
you weren't even born yet.

35
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,519
See, I persuaded him easily.

36
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,120
How childish.

37
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,519
Uncle.

38
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,599
Aunt got lost again.

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,560
Again? Which way did she go?

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,150
Never mind. Look after the store.
I'll go find her.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
Sir, you have yet to teach me...

42
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,120
Have a taste of our butter tea.

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,039
Thank you.

44
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,360
My aunt has Alzheimer's disease,

45
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,719
commonly known as dementia.

46
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,960
She went missing three times this week.

47
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,560
Did you put a bracelet on her?

48
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,199
My aunt is very cautious.

49
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,800
The bracelets and tags that we try to

50
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,639
put on her will be taken off.

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,199
We don't know what to do about it now.

52
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,159
This disease

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,159
could be treated to slow it down, right?

54
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,919
It varies from person to person.

55
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,719
My aunt refuses to be treated.

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,400
She wouldn't cooperate with the doctor.

57
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,000
I just hope that my uncle

58
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,199
would be able to find her soon.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,479
How about this?

60
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,719
Let us help you look for her.

61
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,719
Send us a picture of your aunt

62
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,360
and also

63
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,159
the places where she goes often.

64
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,560
Thank you.

65
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,919
Cuihua, this is someone else's.
Give it back.

66
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,039
This bag belongs to my daughter, Jiajia.

67
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,960
- This is Jiajia's bag.
- Give that back.

68
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,560
Cuihua.

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,319
This belongs to someone else.

70
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:27,879
No!

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,560
Let me talk to her.

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,919
Give it back! It's theirs!

73
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:32,919
Sir, we're here...

74
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,560
Be careful... Are you alright?

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Jiajia?

76
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,719
Jiajia?

77
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,719
I'm so sorry

78
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,560
that my wife caused you trouble.

79
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,759
It's fine, don't worry.

80
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,919
Thank you.

81
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,439
My apologies.

82
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,159
Take care.

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,360
Cuihua.

84
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,159
Sir.

85
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,560
You got the wrong person. Let's go home.

86
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,960
Madam, I am not Jiajia.

87
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,520
You...

88
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,879
I gave birth to you.

89
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,230
How could I ever get you wrong?

90
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,639
You're right. She is
your daughter, Jiajia.

91
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,159
You are right.

92
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,199
You're right.

93
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,960
What are you saying?

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,759
This lady has dementia.

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,800
Let's just play along.

96
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,120
Madam,

97
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
I am not a bad guy.

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm your daughter's boyfriend.

99
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,800
Let me take you home.

100
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,839
I know you.

101
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,160
Aren't you that hooligan
who kept pestering my daughter?

102
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm warning you

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,759
to stay away from my daughter.

104
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
I...

105
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,079
Come on, let's go home together.

106
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,290
Be good and come home with me.

107
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,260
Let's go home together.

108
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,079
This old lady...

109
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,199
You shot yourself in the foot,
didn't you?

110
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,959
Come. You stay away from us.
Don't follow us.

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,839
Why is this old lady so unreasonable?

112
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,199
Get out of here!

113
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,839
Don't come pestering my daughter.

114
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,759
That guy is too frivolous.

115
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,639
I won't let you be with him.

116
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
Uncle.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,160
What's going on?

118
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,759
She thinks that I am her daughter.

119
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,160
Thank you.

120
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,639
Jiajia is my late cousin sister.

121
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,759
She was about your age,

122
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,759
when she passed away.

123
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,839
She was on her way
to open the mianpi stall

124
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,920
when she was hit by a truck
that ran a red light.

125
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,199
That day...

126
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,040
My aunt fell sick,

127
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,560
so my cousin was running the stall alone.

128
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,800
After the accident, my aunt always felt

129
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,720
that she was responsible
for that.

130
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,160
Thank you.

131
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,199
My aunt became depressed,

132
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,160
and that induced her Alzheimer's disease.

133
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
She forgot about my cousin's death

134
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,290
and thought she was just out
running the business.

135
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
That is why my aunt goes to
the mianpi place every day

136
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,560
to find my cousin sister.

137
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,360
So, I want to thank you so much.

138
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,839
Don't...

139
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,160
We have a favour to ask.

140
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,319
Please let us shoot more videos here.

141
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,759
Yes, please. I am a food blogger

142
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,920
who wants to make

143
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,560
recipe videos on special dishes.

144
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,399
Sure! Come to the kitchen with me.

145
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,600
You are not allowed in the kitchen!

146
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,600
Aunt!

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,370
I know how to cook!

148
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,839
I know how to make everything
that you want to eat.

149
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,420
Braised beef brisket with tomato,

150
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,319
Kung Pao Chicken,

151
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,560
sweet and sour fish,

152
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,000
and Sichuan pepper chicken soup.

153
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
That is all?

154
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,040
What else would you like to eat?

155
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,600
I don't care, I'm not that hungry.

156
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,920
Jiajia, let's go.

157
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,240
Let's just eat something.

158
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,079
I'll do it for your sake and

159
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,120
have a little something.

160
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,560
Is that all you can do now?

161
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,160
How dare you go after my daughter?

162
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,160
What do you want from me?

163
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,759
Go left.

164
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,160
Go further right.

165
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
Harder!

166
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,040
You have aches in so many places.

167
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,079
I just made some chili oil mianpi,

168
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,319
do you want to have a taste?

169
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,990
It's my first time making it,

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,290
I'm not sure if it's delicious or not.

171
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,920
My daughter made it,
so it must be delicious.

172
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,040
I'll bring it in and taste it.

173
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,000
Ji Yu.

174
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,919
Don't you feel sorry for me at all?

175
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,000
Here, have this.

176
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
Are you brushing me off with just this?

177
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,919
How would you want me
to make it up to you?

178
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,840
I want this.

179
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:58,799
You...

180
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,159
You deserved that.

181
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,399
That is

182
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,960
a blessing in disguise.
