(Jiang Yang)
(Ji Yu,)

4
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,320
(you really know
how to get me into trouble.)

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,560
(Do you know
you two went viral for dating?)

6
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,780
(Dalin Dalin2)

7
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,840
This...

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
This is

9
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,359
- Linda.
- Linda.

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
Am I not good enough?

11
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,719
Hand over the video.

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,159
A mere small blogger
with only five million fans dares

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,760
to make demands of me.

14
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,439
I said, give me the video.

15
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,040
I obviously helped you.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,120
How can you repay kindness
with hostility?

17
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,840
Shi Guang?

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,680
What do you mean?

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,480
I can see it clearly.

20
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,159
You like Ji Yu.

21
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,239
But you don't dare to admit it, right?

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,359
Everything I'm doing now is

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,439
to help you get her.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,319
If I like her, I'll pursue her myself.

25
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,319
I don't need your help.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,280
Listen carefully.

27
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,719
If you dare touch her,

28
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,719
I won't let you off.

29
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,879
Hi.

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,039
Ji Yu!

31
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,639
Ji Yu,

32
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,879
let me explain.

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,759
I'm just here
to get the video from her.

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,439
Are you here to get the video

35
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,680
or to make a video with her?

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,280
No, she suddenly hugged me.

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,360
I didn't react in time.

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,719
I...

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Ji Yu.

40
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,919
Tell me. What do you want?

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,599
Simple. I want Shi Guang
to withdraw from the competition.

42
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,560
What do you mean?

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
Only one winner is allowed

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,570
in the Laifuping selling competition.

45
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,280
No way.

46
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,240
Ji Yu,

47
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,120
you should know

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,400
how much the scandal can affect

49
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,800
Shi Guang's single man's image.

50
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,719
You should know that.

51
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,080
I don't care.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
You can keep the video.

53
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,280
You seem

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,840
to care a lot about him.

55
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,479
Do you like him too?

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,800
(Who's the one who said
they only like cooking?)

57
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,960
(Who claims to be still single
on Valentine's Day?)

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,759
(Turns out fans were
the third wheel all along.)

59
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,639
(I really can't love anymore.)

60
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,199
(Having a girlfriend
while selling a single image.)

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,639
(At the end of the day,
he's just fake and reckless.)

62
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,319
(The character of this woman is so bad.)

63
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,879
(Shi Guang must not be
a good person either.)

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,280
(Is this woman older than Shi Guang?)

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,280
(Whoa, this is quite something.)

66
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,360
(A cougar-cub romance, living it up.)

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,680
(So Shi Guang found an older woman.)

68
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,599
(What's he after?)

69
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,660
(To the commenter above,)

70
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,560
(he's after her age.)

71
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,660
(He's after her for not bathing.)

72
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,780
You still have the mood to laugh?

73
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,839
There was a funny comment just now.

74
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,580
How about this?

75
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,839
We'll shoot a video later

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,399
to clear up our relationship.

77
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,360
What relationship do we have?

78
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,720
What does it matter to the fans?

79
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,480
Shi Guang,

80
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,560
if this situation continues to escalate,

81
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,079
your image will go down the drain,

82
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,199
and your account will be ruined.

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,439
Then my career, efforts, and hopes

84
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,079
will all be in vain, do you understand?

85
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,759
You only care about yourself.

86
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,040
So what if I like you?

87
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,360
Do you still want this marriage?

88
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,079
If you have someone else outside,
why should I continue?

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,920
You don't love me at all.

90
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't you get tired

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,040
of arguing every day?

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,120
Now, you find me annoying.

93
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,759
The thing I regret most in my life
is marrying you!

94
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,519
Xia Mu.

95
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,480
Xia Mu.

96
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,480
When can we make

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,480
our relationship public?

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,160
We'll talk about it later.

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,000
(What is love?)

100
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,920
(What is liking someone?)

101
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,560
(Time relentlessly erodes everything.)

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,319
(Even the deepest feelings)

103
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,040
