=Episode 9=

3
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,410
You go ahead with your work.
I need to record more footage.

4
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,040
I told you to simply fix anything
to eat.

5
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,200
What are you doing?

6
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,159
Eating to be full is just
an animal instinct.

7
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,319
Enjoying gourmet food is human nature.

8
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,519
A corporate slave like you
wouldn't understand.

9
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,799
Where did you hear that phrase?

10
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,560
My first love.

11
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,920
Oh, your first love.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,799
I see, I see.

13
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,420
(Daoli Little Panda.
Animals eat to live, humans live to eat.)

14
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,519
Do you know your first love's last name?

15
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,079
The last name is Dao.

16
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,519
No, that's not it.

17
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,120
I don't know either.

18
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,879
Have you met them?

19
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,560
No.

20
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,879
You don't know if it's a man or a woman.

21
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,159
You don't even know her last name,

22
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,360
and you call that your first love.

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,719
It's a feeling,

24
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,919
a taste.

25
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,319
Strange.

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,000
Why does this taste feel so familiar?

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,599
(Didn't you teach me this?)

28
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,599
I think

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,599
to own

30
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,639
those delicate hands,

31
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,840
she must be a petite and exquisite girl.

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,919
Someone who can write such healing words

33
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,400
must be a gentle,

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
quiet, and delicate girl.

35
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,479
What kind of guy do you like?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,680
You haven't answered my question yet.

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,960
This taste is really familiar.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,280
What kind of guy do you like?

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,439
Can't you just tell me?

40
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,439
You're so persistent, young man.

41
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,000
Fine.

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,879
I'll tell you.

43
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
A guy who's 165 cm tall,

44
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,919
has tanned skin,

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
likes RnB,

46
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,280
has tattoos,

47
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
and curly hair.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,840
So? Can you imagine what he looks like?

49
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,960
How can you like that kind of person?

50
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,479
Am I not good enough?

51
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,159
Are you okay?

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
Move aside. Stop taking advantage of me.

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,560
Hi, we meet again, Shi Guang.

54
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,720
What's up?

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,879
Hey, Linda.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,600
(I asked you to sabotage
Ji Yu and Shi Guang's collaboration,)

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
not to go on vacation.

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,160
If you mess up again,

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,800
you'll be the next to get fired.

60
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,480
How am I supposed to sabotage it?

61
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,000
Aren't you good at being a "green tea"?
[*conniving behavior]

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,160
Do I have to teach you?

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,399
Shi Guang has
five million followers now.

64
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,759
With that fan base,

65
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,480
it would easily be seen
as the work of anti-fans

66
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,360
if we start attacking him.

67
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,639
We need to find a way
to generate negative publicity for him,

68
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,959
like

69
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,399
a scandal or a romance.

70
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,000
(How to be a perfect "green tea"?)

71
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,959
Shi Guang,

72
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,240
will your girlfriend be mad
if I do this?

73
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,839
Shi Guang is on his way

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
to Laifuping right now.

75
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,639
Looks like I'll have
to sacrifice myself a bit.

76
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,490
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

77
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,839
If I said my skills are rusty
because I haven't driven in a long time,

78
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,959
do you believe me?

79
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,000
The rear light is damaged.

80
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,040
We need to find a repair shop to fix it.

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
I'll make a phone call.

82
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,439
You better behave yourself.

84
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,680
Shi Guang,

85
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,040
there's smoke coming out from my car.

86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,000
Can you help me fix it?

87
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,160
I'm really scared being here
in the middle of nowhere.

88
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,360
Open the hood.

89
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,639
If you help me fix the car,

90
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,800
won't your girlfriend be mad at you?

91
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,759
Don't speak nonsense.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Okay.

93
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,560
But the person you like
doesn't seem to like you.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,959
Yes, our is now at...

95
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,839
Are you done?

96
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,199
I finished the call.

97
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,800
They said there's a repair shop nearby.

98
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,240
We can just drive the car over there.

99
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
It's getting late.

100
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Why don't we find a place to stay?

101
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
We don't have the budget.

102
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,480
I have money.

103
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,360
As compensation,

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,439
I'll pay for your stay.

105
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,439
No thanks.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't want to stay
with someone like you.

107
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,600
Here you go.

108
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,160
I've booked the rooms for you.

109
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,879
Thanks.

110
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,399
I'm hungry. Go make some food.

111
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,480
I have to thank you for fixing my car.

112
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,800
Otherwise,

113
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,560
I would have had to squeeze

114
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,199
into a tent with you guys tonight.

115
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,040
No need to be polite.

116
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,240
We should help each other out.

117
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
It's cold.

118
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,279
Ms. Linda,

119
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,000
why don't you put on an extra layer?

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,840
Young people are full of energy.
We're not afraid of the cold.

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
But someone old like you

122
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,000
should dress warmly.

123
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,360
Shi Guang,

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,200
I want to eat spicy broad noodles.
Can you make it for me?

125
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,039
Sure, go ahead and make it for her.

126
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,039
By the way, use less red oil.

127
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,799
I remember Ms. Linda saying

128
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,799
she was on a diet

129
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,000
during her live stream.

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,799
Shi Guang's cooking is really good,

131
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,559
especially these spicy broad noodles.

132
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,879
You must have worked so hard.

133
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,960
Have more meat.

134
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,200
Too much meat is greasy.

135
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,399
Eating vegetables is healthy.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,559
If you want to eat,

137
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,840
you should eat
the spicy broad noodles you made.

138
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,600
Eating such greasy noodles late
at night,

139
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,290
aren't you afraid
of getting pimples the next day?

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,039
I'm full.

141
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,759
I'll go and get my beauty sleep.

142
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,080
All right, bye.

143
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,039
I'm done eating.
You can eat by yourself.

144
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,600
Fine.

145
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't eat then.

146
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,279
I thought you said

147
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,000
you were going to get your beauty sleep.

148
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't sleep.
So I want to enjoy the moonlight.

149
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,360
Can't I do that?

150
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,919
Here's

151
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,360
a bowl of Saozi noodles made
from a special secret recipe

152
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,279
just for you.

153
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,000
Thanks. But I'm already full.

154
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,399
Full?

155
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,080
Full from what?

156
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,279
Is it jealousy?

157
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,360
Jealousy? Jealous of what?

158
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,399
Jealous of you and Linda?

159
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,360
Or

160
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,360
is it him?

161
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,000
Tanned skin,
someone who's 165 cm tall,

162
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
and curly hair.

163
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,799
Get lost.

164
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,200
You like me, don't you?

165
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,720
Come on.

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,639
Have a bite.

167
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,100
Otherwise, the noodles will get soggy.

168
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
You can let me down.

169
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,799
But don't let the food go to waste.

170
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:50,679
What's wrong?

171
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,799
Nothing.

172
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,650
I just suddenly thought

173
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,960
of my mom.

174
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,559
Ji Yu,

175
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,399
then

176
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,000
let me make delicious food for you

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,240
on your mom's behalf from now on.

178
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:06,879
