=Episode 16=

3
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,280
You're quite crafty for your age.

4
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,810
You've got some tricks up your sleeve.

5
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,920
Be honest now,

6
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,120
how many girls have you
picked up with this trick?

7
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,560
I don't flirt with everyone.

8
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,560
You had my first kiss.

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,359
You are responsible for me now.

10
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,719
What? Responsible for what?

11
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,000
She might not want
to be responsible for me.

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,200
Nonsense! How is my daughter
responsible for you?

13
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,120
Jiajia.

14
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,959
If you don't like him, just dump him.

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,860
You don't have to be responsible for him.

16
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,040
I am in the wrong.

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,560
It's not that she is responsible for me.

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,799
I made the first move.
I am responsible for her.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,560
What are you all talking about?

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,719
You guys seemed joyful.

21
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,799
Jiajia,

22
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,799
should your father make me
unhappy one day,

23
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,359
I will dump him immediately.

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,719
I say, Cuihua,

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
what are you going on about right now?

26
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,360
Cuihua, it's late now.

27
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,960
Let's go back and sleep.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,840
Tonight,

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,000
Jiajia will be sleeping with me.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,759
Who will I be sleeping with?

31
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,560
Him.

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,400
What?

33
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,960
This must be fake with the poor quality.

34
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,360
Don't come near me.

35
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,919
Don't come near me!

36
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
I'll beat you to death!

37
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,560
Don't hurt Yu!

38
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,080
She is your daughter!

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
Let go, you!

40
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,879
Let go!

41
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,759
- I'll beat you to death!
- Don't hurt her!

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,800
Yu, run quickly!

43
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,120
Yu!

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,159
What...

45
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,080
What's wrong?

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,360
Are you having a nightmare?

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,319
Don't come here!

48
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,560
Mommy loves you forever.

49
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,599
I'm so sorry.

50
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,879
I had a nightmare

51
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,479
and woke you up.

52
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,719
What are you saying?

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,280
What is there to be sorry about?

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,639
I am your mother.

55
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,000
Go to sleep now.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,639
Mommy's here with you.

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,159
Come, sleep.

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,759
Actually, I'm not...

59
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
I always felt like

60
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,040
you have been away
for a very long time.

61
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,160
I remembered clearly

62
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,040
that you wheeled a cart out
in the morning

63
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,600
and said

64
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,399
you will come home after selling mianpi

65
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,399
to take us for a wedding photo shoot.

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,639
Why would I need all these anyway?

67
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,000
I only want you

68
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,240
to be safe and healthy.

69
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,199
Mom,

70
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,600
I miss you.

71
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,020
(Ji Yu's personal information)

72
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,900
(Main family member,
Father - Ji Minghua)

73
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,399
Take your time when pouring oil over it.

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,199
Pour evenly.

75
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,000
Let me see how the photo looks.

76
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,560
My daughter is so good at taking photos.

77
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,319
Take more pictures then.

78
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,279
Ji Yu, look!

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,199
This shot is so clear.

80
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,040
Never mind.

81
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,040
Don't just take photos of him.

82
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,199
Take some photos of me and your father.

83
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,959
Sure.

84
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,040
- Come!
- Let's take a picture!

85
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,720
Come here!

86
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,600
Old man.

87
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,879
- Your daughter is taking pictures of us.
- Okay, okay.

88
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,639
It's all just pots and pans here.

89
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,680
How about taking pictures outside?

90
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,120
Sure, let's take photos outside.

91
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,160
Wait...

92
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,439
I am not done cooking yet.

93
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,879
No one's talking to you.

94
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,120
Go and cook your food.

95
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,240
Hurry up, old man.

96
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,759
Fine, let's go.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,439
Am I not at all important?

98
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,480
When your dad and I got married,

99
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,879
we never had a formal photo
taken together.

100
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,639
Right, old man?

101
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,680
Jiajia did say she would take
our wedding photo last time.

102
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,120
What a pity...

103
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,490
A pity that I forgot about it.

104
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,410
I'll make it up to you now.

105
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,199
Are you going to take our wedding photo?

106
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,439
It has to be more formal than this.

107
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,439
I have to go back and get ready.

108
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,240
Mr. Zhang.

109
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
Are you taking pictures?

110
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,959
My daughter

111
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,000
wants to take our wedding photo for us.

112
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,399
Are you celebrating your
golden anniversary?

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,930
You should throw a party!

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,519
I'll invite people to come over.

115
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,930
Don't bother yourself.

116
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,839
Don't worry!

117
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,519
Mr. Zhang has been a regular.

118
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
I had Hulu Chicken for many years.

119
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,639
We have grown so close since.

120
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,040
This golden anniversary is
not a trouble at all.

121
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,920
I'll handle everything.
Don't worry about it!

grow old together.

128
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,959
They are already in their grey-hair era.

129
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,439
Then we shall wish them

130
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,279
all the happiness and affection

That's great!

133
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,040
After my cousin passed away,

134
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,240
my uncle and aunt haven't been
this happy since.

135
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,639
I thought you only wanted to take a photo?

136
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,199
Why, are you envious?

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,439
Of course, I'm envious.

138
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,120
So,

139
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,559
when will someone be prepared

140
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,279
to accept my confession?

141
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,879
Even the elderly couple had
some kind of a ceremony,

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
what is this attitude here now?

143
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,759
They are married,

144
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,980
what does it have to do with us?

145
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,200
Does this mean you accept me?

146
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,840
This is nice.

147
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,000
Let us wish Mr. Zhang

148
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,240
