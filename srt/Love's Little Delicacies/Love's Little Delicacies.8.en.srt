3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm a judge appointed
by the program crew.

4
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,799
When I say authentic, it's authentic.

5
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,439
Who are you

6
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,320
to judge Yulin's Pinsanxian?

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
Mister,

8
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,840
may I know

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,359
if this is the 40th Li Lamb Restaurant?

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,920
You are heading in the wrong direction.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,799
Young man, you need to practice more.

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,079
Isn't this Mr. Wang?

13
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,560
He is the successor
to Yulin's Pinsanxian recipe.

14
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,079
Master,

15
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,239
I thought you were not taking part
in the program.

16
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,439
What is he doing here?

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,079
Not bad.

18
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,439
Kid, you seasoned the soup well.

19
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,439
It's tangy and spicy. It's delicious.

20
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,280
Thank you for your compliment.

21
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,159
Linda made this.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,879
I'll take care of this.

23
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,439
What on earth is this?

24
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,840
It's both fishy and greasy.

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,560
The meatballs are falling apart.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,760
It's a complete mess.

27
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,000
Is this what you claimed

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,159
to be authentic?

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,400
Master,

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,799
Ms. Linda is a celebrity.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,760
Her company wants to invest
in my restaurant.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,599
I'm doing this for the business.

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,960
Good, well done.

34
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,840
You do things without a clear conscience

35
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,680
just for the sake of good business.

36
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,360
I don't have a disciple like you.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,159
No conscience.

38
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,400
Get out of the way.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,960
Shame on you.

40
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,360
In Yulin's Pinsanxian tradition,

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,039
there have never been strict rules.

42
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,800
Whether it's authentic or not,

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,599
the people of Yulin have the final say.

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,159
- That's right.
- He's right.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
So whose dish is the most authentic?

46
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,240
- Shi Guang!
- Shi Guang!

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,159
- Shi Guang!
- Shi Guang!

48
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,280
- Shi Guang!
- Shi Guang!

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
- Shi Guang!
- Shi Guang!

50
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,319
- Shi Guang!
- Shi Guang!

51
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,280
- Shi Guang!
- Shi Guang!

52
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,360
- Shi Guang!
- Shi Guang!

53
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,439
- Shi Guang!
- Shi Guang!

54
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,039
Your father is actually
a successor of Pinsanxian.

55
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,120
Why didn't you say such
an impressive thing earlier?

56
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,039
Pinsanxian isn't

57
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,159
some exclusive secret of our family.

58
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,080
Many people in Yulin know
a thing or two about it.

59
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,240
What's there to be proud of?

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,680
It's not the same. Yours is authentic.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
What's authentic or not?

62
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,080
Simply put,

63
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,479
Pinsanxian is just a cooking method.

64
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,360
Mixing meat and vegetables together.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,960
You can put in whatever meat you like.

66
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
It's just a common dish.

67
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,639
If you talk about authenticity,

68
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,840
everyone can claim theirs
is the most authentic.

69
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,080
In my opinion,

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm just trying to imitate the taste
my father taught me.

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,960
You're right.
The taste of home is the most authentic.

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
But then,

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,759
your sign also says "Zhengzong."
*[Authentic]

74
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,719
Isn't that bragging too?

75
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,759
Yeah.

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,520
My father opened this shop.

77
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,919
My father's name is Wang Zhengzong.

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,120
Are you here just
because of those two characters?

79
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,639
Haha!

80
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,280
Drink up.

81
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,000
Gosh.

82
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,960
What am I supposed to say about this?

83
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,220
(Jiang Yang)

84
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,680
Hello.

85
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,800
(Ji Yu)

86
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,599
Shi Guang is not beside you, right?

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,280
No, why?

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,920
I just heard

89
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,199
your dad got out of prison.

90
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,959
(Ji Yu)

91
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,519
Ji Yu?

92
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,160
Are you still there?

93
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,879
(Are you okay?)

94
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,399
So soon?

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,480
I thought he'd be in there for life.

96
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,040
I'm afraid he'll come after you.

97
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,759
Why don't you stay at my house?

98
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,040
(With me and Shi Guang here,)

99
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,160
(you'll be safer.)

100
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,759
We'll see.

101
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,680
He wouldn't dare
to do anything to me anyway.

102
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,560
Okay.

103
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,240
Then

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,560
be careful.

105
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,399
Silly guy.

106
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
It's just a minor wound.

107
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,680
There's no need to bandage it.

108
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,199
I'm coming in.

109
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,160
I thought you were afraid of the dark.

110
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Why is it so dark in here?

111
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,040
Why did you remove the bandage?

112
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,480
It'll get infected.

113
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,560
I won't die from that.

114
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,959
That won't do either.

115
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,879
It may leave a scar.

116
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,960
I got it as a kid after my dad beat me
when he was drunk.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
I have one here too.

118
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,560
Every time he was drunk,

119
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,160
he would drag me out of bed and beat me.

120
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,639
I slept with the lights on

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
so I could keep an eye on him.

122
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,079
But it's okay.

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,360
People have

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
to adapt to their environment.

125
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,759
You're not obligated
to pay for other people's mistakes.

126
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,959
Ji Yu.

127
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,040
If a dish is bad,

128
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,759
throw it in the trash.

129
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,199
There's no need
to force yourself to eat it.

130
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,759
Tonight, sleep with the lights on.

131
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,000
How will you sleep

132
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,959
with the lights on?

133
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,160
