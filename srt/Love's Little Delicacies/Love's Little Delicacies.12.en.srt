=Episode 12=

3
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,920
This is the one.

4
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:46,799
Mister.

5
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,359
Is anyone here?

6
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:48,719
Mister?

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,479
There's no one.

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,359
Get out.

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,759
Just leave.

10
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,159
Let's find several other places.

11
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,040
We'll definitely find
someone willing to help.

12
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,840
Yes, we should at least try.

13
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,519
You two must be the scammers reported
by the residents, right?

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,239
You're even carrying a camera.

15
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,280
Turn it off!

16
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:20,760
Go.

17
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,879
Catch them!

18
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,519
Don't run!

19
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,560
Stop!

20
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,439
Let's not record this part.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,400
Don't record it.

22
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,439
We'll cut this part in post-editing.

23
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,280
No, don't cut it.

24
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,000
We must keep it for the topic.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,519
It's attention-grabbing.

26
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,359
I think we should find someone we know.

27
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,719
Otherwise,
we might be mistaken for scammers.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,000
It's our first time here.

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,959
We don't know our way around here.

30
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,690
Where could we find someone we know?

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,760
Excuse me,

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,799
are you the food blogger Shi Guang?

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,400
Do you know this restaurant?

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,080
Let me see.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,060
(Timeless Braised Meat)

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
You're looking for this place?

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,560
I've been eating their braised platter
since I was a kid.

38
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,919
My grandpa is very familiar
with the owner.

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
Grandpa, this is Shi Guang.

40
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,990
He's here to ask for your help.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,560
I didn't sneak a taste.

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,479
Have a seat first.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,919
Hello, I'm a food blogger.

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,719
You like watching beautiful girls dance?

45
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,360
No,

46
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,719
we're here to ask you to taste...

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,280
No, I can't.

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,599
I can't help you two
with your wedding night.

49
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,719
Please wait a moment.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,240
I'll get my grandpa's hearing aid.

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,919
Mister, we're not a couple.

52
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,919
I know you're not being truthful.

53
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,919
Mister,

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,240
please taste this braised sauce

55
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,520
and tell us the difference.

56
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,319
You two don't have
a harmonious relationship?

57
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,719
That can't be.

58
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,599
You seem fine

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
to me.

60
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,560
Mister, can you stop imagining things?

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,199
You really are like a tigress,

62
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
always meddling.

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,759
No wonder your man
likes watching beautiful girls dance.

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,919
Grandpa, your hearing aid.

65
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,500
Let me help you put it on.

66
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,360
We're here to ask you to taste this.

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,759
Please taste it.

68
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,560
Too many bay leaves,
the flavor is too strong.

69
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,720
Young man,

70
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,360
did you make this yourself?

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,040
Yes.

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,600
You've got skills.

73
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,160
It's quite authentic.

74
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,800
You're flattering me.

75
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,759
The taste is good.

76
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,920
- This is the taste.
- This is the taste.

77
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,560
Linda, I made the braised sauce.

78
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,240
So what?

79
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm leaving anyway.

80
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,600
You've brought a lot of profit
for the company.

81
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,839
But now because of one failure,

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
Starmaker wants to fire you.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,319
For them,

84
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,000
solving the problem

85
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,920
means getting rid of the person
who caused the problem.

86
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,319
Miss Ji Yu,

87
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,519
you should understand this well, right?

88
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,439
I thought

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,120
they were only targeting me.

90
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,560
The USB with the video is on the table.

91
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,759
Close the door when you leave.

92
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,560
There are still so many agricultural
products in the warehouse.

93
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,160
What will happen to them
after you leave?

94
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,680
Tonight is the last live stream.

95
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,360
I can't sell everything by myself.

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,190
Go through the breach
of contract process then.

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,199
What's the big deal?

98
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,120
We can't do that.

99
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,639
The villagers worked hard

100
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,990
to sell their agricultural products.

101
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,600
You can give up on yourself.

102
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,720
But you can't
let their hard work go to waste.

103
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,990
Who are you
to order me around like this?

104
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,000
If you try to run, I'll post the video
of you threatening us online.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,959
Let's see

106
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
how your fans react.

107
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,600
Miss Linda, if you still want to be
in the self-media business

108
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,160
after leaving Starmaker,

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,759
I don't need to remind you

110
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,199
how important your image is.

111
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,439
This is called

112
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,519
having a taste of your own medicine.

113
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,839
Anyone can shoot a video.

114
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,879
Fine.

115
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,319
Have it your way.

116
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,399
Today is our last live broadcast

117
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,800
in Fuping County,

118
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,000
and it's the only collaboration

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,439
between Linda and me.

120
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Hi, everyone!

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,319
I'm Linda.

122
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,439
Tonight, Shi Guang and I

123
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,000
are doing a special live stream
featuring Fuping fruits and vegetables.

124
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,560
When you think of Fuping,

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,519
you think of persimmons.

126
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,199
But actually, Fuping is famous

127
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,319
for hanging persimmons.

128
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,600
These hanging persimmons

129
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,120
are sweet and glutinous without seeds,

130
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,800
making them perfect
for the elderly and children.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,199
Fuping County is named
for its abundance and peace.

132
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,120
It's one of the important birthplaces
of Chinese civilization.

133
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,199
As early as the ancient times

134
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,160
when human civilization
was still primitive,

135
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,560
the founding Emperor
of the Chinese people,

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,560
once collected copper from Shouyang

137
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,759
and cast cauldrons on Jingshan Mountain
in the south of the county.

138
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,519
After Yu the Great governed the world,

139
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,680
he also cast the nine cauldrons,
symbolizing supreme power, here.

140
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,399
Therefore, Fuping has been known

141
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,639
as a famous town in Guanzhong
since ancient times.

142
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,040
Yes.

143
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,560
It is the hometown of dairy goats,

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,720
Qiongguo sugar,

145
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,800
and persimmons.

146
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,480
All right.

147
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,120
Everyone can click

148
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,040
the link below to purchase.

149
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,720
Hi.

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,319
Not only do we have persimmons today,

151
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,319
but we also have some tea oil.

152
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Miss, come here
and help me figure out the amount.

153
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,120
That's right, my dear fans.

154
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,480
Just click to purchase
the same persimmons

155
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,120
and enjoy them at home.

156
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,440
They are great for children
and the elderly to try.

157
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,519
I've noted it down.

158
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,960
You guys
are really professional at this.

159
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,440
Not at all. I'm just learning this
at the last minute.

160
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,740
I'm not as professional
as the other hosts.

161
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,000
What are you talking about?

162
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,720
You pick it up quickly.

163
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,120
If you become a host,
you'd definitely be better than them.

164
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,320
I can tell you

165
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,399
can't stand

166
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,879
Linda being clingy with your guy.

167
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,039
You've misunderstood.
I'm not dating him.

168
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,240
You two are clearly together.

169
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,240
If you like him, help him boldly.

170
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,399
Get to know his life,

171
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,240
and work with him.

172
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,610
What's wrong
with hosting live streaming?

173
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,440
If Linda can do it, so can you.

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,759
Give this to him.

175
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,080
Come on.

176
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,759
I...

177
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,519
Hurry up and go.

178
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,559
Yes, this is really delicious

179
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,759
and you can take it home to try.

180
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,600
These persimmons

181
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
are soft and glutinous,
not like the other ones.

182
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,320
This is a specialty made
by the owner herself,

183
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,960
Qiongguo candy.

184
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,200
You can try it.

185
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,320
(Old woman,)

186
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,799
(stay away from my Shi Guang.)

187
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,320
(The manager dares
to forcibly pair up with Shi Guang.)

188
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
(So disgusting.)

189
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,279
(Bad manager,
get out of Shi Guang's live stream.)

190
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,639
(Do you remember
what you did to Xia Mu?)

191
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,559
(Either she stays, or I'll go.)

192
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,039
(Everyone, let's return
and refund together.)

193
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,240
Sales were good, why is this happening?

194
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
I'm sorry,
please don't return your orders.

195
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,440
I'll leave right away.

196
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,799
Shi Guang.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,399
Should we pause the live stream for now?

198
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,960
No need, continue streaming.

199
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,399
Ji Yu is a very important person to me.

200
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,799
I...

201
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,600
Ji Yu and Xia Mu's situation

202
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,320
is not what you think it is.

203
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,519
Ji Yu was fired by Starmaker

204
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,559
because of a trap set by them.

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
You don't know the truth

206
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,960
but are quick to spread rumors
and demand refunds.

207
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,440
You are affecting my sales.

208
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,240
Are you spies sent by Starmaker?

209
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,759
What are you talking about, what trap?

210
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,480
Do you want to know the truth
about Xia Mu getting beaten?

211
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,559
Then place an order by clicking
the link in the lower-left corner.

212
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,720
If we get over 100,000 orders,

213
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,080
I will reveal the big scandal

214
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,320
of Starmaker harming
its managers tonight.

215
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,159
