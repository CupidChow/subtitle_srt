3
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Ji Yu!

4
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,039
You think you can hide,

5
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,719
and I won't find you.

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,119
Let me tell you.

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,640
Your whole life, Ji Yu,

8
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,479
belongs to the Ji family, and

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,960
that includes your soul after death.

10
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,570
Don't even think about running away!

11
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,190
I have told you many times,
your daughter hasn't been home recently.

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,760
As her father, how could you be scolding
your child like this?

13
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,519
You have no say over

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,359
how I should scold her.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,000
She is my daughter.

16
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,760
I will reprimand her as I wish.

17
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,000
Stop being a busybody.

18
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,000
Get lost!

19
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:19,879
Get out!

20
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,640
Bah!

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,920
Who does he think he is?

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,640
You want to hide from me?

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,840
Bah!

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,200
What bad luck.

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
Are you Ji Yu's father,

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,159
Mr. Ji Minghua?

27
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,120
Who are you?

28
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,719
I'm your daughter's boyfriend.

29
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,040
My name is Xia Mu.

30
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,560
What do you want me for?

31
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,519
I have something

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,879
to discuss with you.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
Not bad.

34
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,000
How is she?

35
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,390
That's what happens to the elderly.

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,890
Their cardiovascular system gets weak.

37
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,240
They get out of breath
when they are excited.

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,960
She will be fine after a couple of days
in the hospital.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,759
What can happen to me?

40
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,960
I was just too happy.

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,560
You all are worrying about it too much.

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,680
Cuihua, watch your temper.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Don't be so impatient, okay?

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,000
Shut up, you.

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
Your words are so annoying.

46
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,479
Pity Mr. Zhang.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
Would you become like this
when you get old?

48
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,290
Keep quiet if you don't know what to say.

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,960
Aunt.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,960
All women are just the same.

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,960
You look lovely.

52
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,599
You know,

53
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,479
I met your dad in the store.

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,919
Your dad made Hulu Chicken

55
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,520
and also mianpi,

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,199
jujube glutinous rice cake,

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
and what's that called again...

58
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,240
jiaotuan!

59
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,120
Are you alright?

60
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,960
Don't fuss around. Sit down.

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
Go get some water!

62
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,319
Alright.

63
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,159
I want an apple.

64
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,360
I want the crunchy one that is sweet.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,599
I don't want the sour one or

66
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,400
the soft, mealy one.

67
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,159
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,479
I want to tell you

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
that your dad back then

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,960
used his Hulu Chicken making skills

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,719
to charm and keep me around for life.

72
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,040
So, when you look for a man,

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,839
you must find one

74
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,639
who can cook.

75
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,120
When you love him,

76
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,639
he will be your man.

77
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,680
When you do not love him,

78
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,600
he is still a cook.

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,399
I want my daughter to do my makeup.

80
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,279
But...

81
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,160
I paid you money.

82
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,000
It's okay. You can take a break.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,680
I'll do it.

84
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,439
Okay.

85
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,279
When your dad and I got married,

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,399
there were no creams
or powders of the sort.

87
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,480
Times have changed.

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,279
Look at you young people,

89
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,360
there are so many things meant for beauty

90
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,199
and there is more every day.

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,199
Don't you be deceived
by that beautiful young man.

92
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,079
When you're looking for someone,

93
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,800
find someone like your father.

94
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,970
He is a person of substance.

95
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,279
I won't be so easily deceived.

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,199
That young one looks well-groomed now,

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,360
but as they get old,

98
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,040
they all look the same.

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,160
More importantly, see if
he treats you well and

100
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,000
is he worth trusting with your life?

101
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,560
I understand.

102
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,279
Ji Yu, are you done?

103
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,600
The photographer is here.

104
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,480
We're ready.

105
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,079
That's too thick.

106
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,879
Too much.

107
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,759
It's a tad long.

108
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,199
Do you know how to put on makeup?

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,040
