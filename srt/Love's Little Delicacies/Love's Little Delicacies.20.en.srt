=Episode 20=

3
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,960
Hello to our viewers.

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
Welcome to the final episode

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,840
of Shaanxi's Flavor

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,119
Foods on Roads Battle.

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,840
Our final winner Shi Guang

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,880
and his agent slash girlfriend Ji Yu

9
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,310
are heading towards
the final meeting point.

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,690
Let's see what they
have in store for us.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,280
This is your clue.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,799
Thank you.

13
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,000
We are at the last stop finally.

14
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,600
Let's go.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,079
Come.

16
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,120
Bye!

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,180
See you at the last stop.

18
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,480
What?

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,690
Did you go the other way again?

20
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,799
No...

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,400
This is the right way I guess.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,640
I followed the location
given by the production team.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,439
Does it look like we're
recording the show here?

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,640
Go down and ask for directions already!

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,400
Where can we find anyone?

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,919
I'm really sorry, bro.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,159
It's my first time driving this.

28
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,439
Still getting the hang of it.

29
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,280
Alright, bye.

30
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,599
Fortunately, I have left

31
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,690
all the things in the car.

32
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,439
What did the production team say?

33
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,080
The production team has confirmed

34
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,190
that the address is correct.

35
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,199
It could be that this time

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,800
at the meeting point is different.

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,479
It's like triggering the mechanism
in an escape room.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Perhaps.

39
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,199
The viewers tonight who tuned in

40
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,360
shall see us getting lost

41
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,420
and our views will plummet.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,120
Who said that it will?

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,520
Next up, I would like to ask Ms. Ji Yu.

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,199
As partner of the champion Mr. Shi Guang,

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,479
what is your first impression of him?

46
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,199
Let's do this to keep our views.

47
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,360
Work with me for a bit.

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,879
A dirty scoundrel?

49
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,680
So,

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
when did you start to change

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,199
your perceptions towards him?

52
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,199
Don't worry. Just go to sleep now.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,560
I'll be here with you.

54
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,800
When you sat by my bed and

55
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,120
watched over me while I slept.

56
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,039
Then,

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,400
when did you start to develop feelings?

58
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,479
If a dish is spoiled,

59
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,639
just throw it in the trash.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,260
You are not obligated to
pay for other people's mistakes.

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,319
Shi Guang.

62
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,560
What are you doing? Leave her alone!

63
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,000
She's a pervert!

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,159
When you told me

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,199
don't pay for others' mistakes

66
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,439
and

67
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,560
backed me up with resolve.

68
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:18,800
That's all.

69
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,120
I have answered all my questions.

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,690
It's your turn.

71
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,639
What about you?

72
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,000
When did you start developing feelings?

73
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,720
If crushes count as well,

74
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,600
that would be a long, long time ago

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,199
when you were still

76
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,290
managing Daoli Little Panda.

77
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,639
I had no plans for my life at that time.

78
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,480
I only followed my parents' plans

79
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,600
one step at a time.

80
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,120
It was then that I thought,

81
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,680
what is the meaning of life?

82
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,199
It wasn't till I saw your food videos

83
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,490
that I found a new
sense of direction in life.

84
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Why are all of you here?

85
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,959
(Daoli Little Panda,)

86
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,000
(I remember that you once said,)

87
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
(you wanted to make a video
on Shaanxi's flavours.)

88
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,690
(Mr. Shi Guang is here to help you
realise your dream.)

89
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,460
(This is my first time eating
sour jujube noodles.)

90
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,319
(It's really sour.)

91
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,319
(That day, I just saw Song)

92
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,199
(professing his love for you
at the concert.)

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,839
(The feeling in my heart)

94
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,279
(was like this mouthful of jujube noodles.)

95
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,780
(The jujube glutinous rice cake is sweet
because of the dates.)

96
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,780
(There is the fragrance of glutinous rice)

97
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,920
(and it's sticky texture.)

98
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,040
(Ji Yu, when I ate that,)

99
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,839
(I thought of the great night
that we spent together.)

100
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,800
(It was all too sweet.)

101
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,439
(I hope that)

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,800
(I get to eat that every single week.)

103
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,580
(There is a cold dish in Shaanxi
called bitter vegetables.)

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,959
(It has a little more sweetness
compared to bitter gourd.)

105
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,639
(I often wonder,)

106
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,839
(why would people like)

107
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,360
(some foods that are bitter?)

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
(They are likely after the sweetness
that comes after the bitterness.)

109
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,800
(Ji Yu, I don't want to
get into a fight with you.)

110
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,519
(I don't like anything bitter.)

111
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,079
(I only want the sweetness.)

112
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,690
(This bowl of hot oil noodles
at the crazy spice level)

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,600
(is so spicy till one could go mad.)

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,490
(They say that spicy is not a flavour)

115
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,560
(but a sensation of pain.)

116
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,319
(It hurts but one just can't stop eating.)

117
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,399
(Ji Yu, I am probably the first)

118
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,040
(lunatic to liken chili peppers to love.)

119
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
(It's spicy, painful and satisfying.)

120
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,199
(A bowl of hot oil noodles)

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
(is enough to last a lifetime.)

122
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,720
I made this video

123
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,519
according to your project idea.

124
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,439
I shot all the other parts

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,140
that you didn't get to finish.

126
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,399
Jiang Yang told me

127
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,279
the reason you gave up that account

128
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,399
was because you were stressed out in life.

129
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,390
It was a choice you made out of necessity.

130
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,720
I will bear that together with you.

131
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,959
Ji Yu, I will help you

132
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,040
reestablish your little panda account,

133
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,100
so that you can always be yourself.

134
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,240
This is my new pastry creation.

135
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,120
Give it a taste.

136
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
It's so bitter.

137
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,360
I call this pastry "Past Lives".

138
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,240
A past life without you

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
must have felt bitter.

140
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,319
Try the other one.

141
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,959
What's this? It's so sour.

142
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,480
This is called "Next Life".

143
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,199
If I can't be with you in my next life,

144
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,380
to continue our fate together,

145
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,199
to me,

146
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,240
things would taste sour.

147
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:51,959
Try the last piece.

148
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,639
I call this "The Life Right Now".

149
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,639
Ji Yu,

150
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,879
I have met you in this life.

151
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,279
The times spent with you

152
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
and the future that beholds for
the two of us,

153
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,390
all this feels sweet to me.

154
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,040
Although

155
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,600
you are sometimes bad-tempered,

156
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,040
self-reliant and always scolding me,

157
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,519
you are also brave and

158
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:30,920
determined

159
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,120
to only be yourself,

160
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,679
your dazzling self.

161
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,519
You are also very strong.

162
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,279
You withstood the pressures of life,

163
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,279
faced all the discontentment in life,

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,039
walked alone and

165
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,200
became the best agent in this industry.

166
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,039
You never gave up in the face

167
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
of low points in your career.

168
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,600
You strove

169
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,120
to turn me, a micro-influencer,

170
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,039
into this mega-influencer
with millions of fans.

171
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,919
Ji Yu,

172
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,580
you are the reason I got into this line.

173
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,840
You are the reason that I move forward.

174
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,399
You will be my only partner in life

175
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,279
from here on out.

176
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,060
♪Am I your first choice?♪

177
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,180
♪I put out the fire in your gaze♪

178
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,180
♪Let's give each other our last blessing♪

179
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,840
Good!

180
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,720
May the beautiful Ms. Ji Yu tell me,

181
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,200
will you accept Mr. Shi Guang's love

182
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,240
and be his girlfriend?

183
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,399
What kind of a stupid ring is this?

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,519
Do you remember that I told you

185
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,080
I bought a meteorite the other day?

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,639
