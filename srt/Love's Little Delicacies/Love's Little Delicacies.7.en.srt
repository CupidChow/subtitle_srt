=Episode 7=

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,119
Who picked on my student?

4
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,520
It's not that. It was a competition.

5
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,479
Isn't the competition tomorrow?

6
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,759
Why did it change to today?

7
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,159
Starmaker made the last-minute changes.

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,640
They did it with bad intentions.

9
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,240
Then compete with them.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,960
No way my student is afraid of them.

11
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,280
Shi Guang, let's go.

12
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,080
I will personally support you
on the front line.

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,260
(40th Li Lamb Restaurant)

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,280
Why...

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,079
Why is it a woman?

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,959
So what if it's a woman?

17
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,079
My wife doesn't allow me
to look at beautiful women.

18
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,360
Or else she'll do this to me.

19
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,959
I thought you had an impressive master.

20
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,560
He turns out to be a coward.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,680
Who are you calling a coward?

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,439
I wanted to report you
to the program crew

23
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,680
to kick you out of the competition

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,400
for not preparing Pinsanxian
at the designated place.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,120
It looks like I overthink.

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,840
With such a random person
as your master,

27
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,239
can you really learn to make Pinsanxian?

28
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,360
You will find out during the competition

29
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,920
if I know how to make it.

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,879
Shi Guang, wait for me.

31
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,719
Shi Guang.

32
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,599
Attention, everyone!

33
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,519
I want all of you
to be my witness today.

34
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,200
Shi Guang is my student.

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,759
(Judge)
If anyone claims

36
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,560
the Pinsanxian he makes isn't authentic,

37
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,560
I will immediately close down
my shop and leave.

38
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,919
- Okay.
- Good.

39
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,319
If you lose, I want you
to apologize to me on the spot.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,479
Sure,

41
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,680
If I lose,

42
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,240
not only will I apologize to you here,

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,120
but I will also promote
your shop for free.

44
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,560
But too bad, I won't lose.

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
We have those too.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,639
Here, Shi Guang.

47
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,319
Put it down.

48
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,840
You can only use the utensils provided
by the judge.

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,639
What about her pot?

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,360
It's mine.

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,039
I'm the judge.

52
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,319
He...

53
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,680
You're letting him use a rice cooker
to prepare Pinsanxian.

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,039
Zheng Daqian,

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
do you think I don't dare
to beat you up?

56
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,840
Don't forget that I'm the judge.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
You're the judge, huh?

58
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,039
It's okay, Master.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,039
I can make it using a rice cooker.

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,319
Give me a hand.

61
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,639
Did I hear it wrongly?

62
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,719
You can make it using it?

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,319
Shi Guang, you're impressive.

64
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,800
It's just a dish.

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,479
As long as it's a container
that can heat,

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,920
any pot or pan will do.

67
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,079
You're something, kid.

68
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,480
Ji Yu, meatballs.

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,360
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

70
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,120
Be careful.

71
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,680
It's okay. Keep going.

72
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,600
No, you must rinse it with cold water.

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,519
Shi Guang.

74
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,879
Shi Guang.

75
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,000
Shi Guang.

76
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,160
It's not too late to deal with this
after the competition.

77
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,360
Don't be ridiculous.
It will be too late then.

78
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,279
No, it won't.

79
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,079
I said, no means no.

80
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,560
Is the competition
more important than you?

81
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,279
Fine.

82
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,959
I'll rinse it.
You should go back to the competition.

83
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,680
Don't waste time.

84
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,959
Hurry. Be good and go.

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,240
Go ahead.

86
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,199
What luck.

87
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,439
Reach out your hand.

88
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,920
Why did you come back?

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,120
Apply this ointment.

90
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Put out your hand.

91
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,920
It's not necessary to apply ointment
on a minor injury like this.

92
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,839
You're my manager.

93
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,639
If you don't treat it right away,

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,600
you won't be able to handle work
if it worsens.

95
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,639
You talk as if I broke a bone

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,759
and have to be hospitalized.

97
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,560
Don't talk nonsense.

98
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,480
Does it still hurt?

99
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
What were you doing?

100
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,120
Is it okay to simply apologize
after bumping into her?

101
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,040
She scalded her finger because of you.

102
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,920
I already said
I didn't do it on purpose.

103
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,639
Why are you being so unreasonable?

104
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,040
I think you did it on purpose.

105
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,079
You wanted Shi Guang to hurt himself
so he'd lose the competition, right?

106
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,560
Mister,

107
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,759
just admit that he's not skilled.

108
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,759
Stop your incompetent rage
and slandering here.

109
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,240
You're so...

110
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,480
Master.

111
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,879
I'll show you

112
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,680
how I will win you.

113
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,520
She's not even pregnant.
Why even help her walk?

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,720
That wasn't good.

115
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,439
It doesn't matter.

116
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,319
They won't finish with the time left.

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,800
Thirty minutes left before time's up.

118
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,639
It looks pretty good, doesn't it?

119
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,439
I think this guy did well.

120
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,519
Time's up.

121
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,439
It's probably not fully cooked.

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Who knows.

123
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,559
It looks quite okay.

124
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,639
Both contestants have finished making

125
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,039
their Pinsanxian dishes.

126
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,960
Now,

127
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,240
it's up to me and everyone here to taste

128
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,159
and select the most authentic
Pinsanxian.

129
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,480
- Okay.
- All right.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,799
Try it out.

131
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,120
Try this one first.

132
00:08:59,279 --> 00:08:59,879
Look at this.

133
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,240
Get yourself a pair of chopsticks.

134
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,519
Eat this.

135
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,320
This is not bad.

136
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,080
The taste is not bad.

137
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,120
This one

138
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,000
looks good.

139
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,440
It's tasty.

140
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,679
Isn't it good?

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,799
The taste is average.

142
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,879
It's pretty okay.

143
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,039
What?

144
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,600
I think this one is pretty good.

145
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,679
Who are you voting for?

146
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,279
This taste isn't quite right, right?

147
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,120
This won't do.

148
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
This one is a bit off.

149
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,399
What flavor is this?

150
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,279
The meat isn't right.

151
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,080
The taste...

152
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,000
This is good.

153
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,440
- The one Shi Guang made is really delicious.
- Not bad.

154
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,159
It's really not bad.

155
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,039
Shi Guang's dish is tasty.

156
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,159
I think so too.

157
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:51,960
Me too.

158
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,039
It's a bit far off.

159
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,399
Why are they spitting them out?

160
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,080
Did you give me bad ingredients?

161
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,960
This meat tastes...

162
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Didn't you praise my cooking
this morning?

163
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,879
What's going on here?

164
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,919
Did you lie to me?

165
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,679
The meat I gave you this morning
was marinated leftovers.

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,879
I didn't marinate the meat
for the competition.

167
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,840
I thought

168
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,440
you would know

169
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,600
that meat needs to be marinated
to remove the smell

170
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,160
since you've been
a food blogger for so long.

171
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,559
So I didn't tell you in advance.

172
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,360
I'll have the Starmaker withdraw
your advertisement.

173
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,440
Please don't do that.

174
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,679
I have a solution.

175
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,320
This is too poorly made.

176
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,240
Attention, everyone.

177
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
Bad taste. It's unacceptable.

178
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,639
Everyone, quiet down.

179
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,400
This taste is awful.

180
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,759
As per the decision of the judge,

181
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,639
although contestant Shi Guang's
dish was decent,

182
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,039
he added half a bottle of vinegar
to the broth.

183
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,679
This is against the rules.

184
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,799
In comparison,

185
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,799
Ms. Linda's dish was executed
with complete steps,

186
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,320
within a reasonable time frame,

187
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,159
and had a clear broth.

188
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,919
Though

189
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,159
- there was a slight greasiness...
- Nonsense.

190
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,159
But indeed,

191
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,519
it followed the authentic method
of making Pinsanxian.

192
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,399
Therefore,

193
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,519
I declare Ms. Linda as the winner.

194
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,399
- What?
- What?

195
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Is this even judging?

196
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,039
Clearly, Shi Guang's dish was delicious.

197
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,039
Nonsense.

198
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,960
What's the meaning of this?

199
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:04,919
You're a fake judge, right?

200
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
Fake judge?

201
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm a judge appointed
by the program crew.

202
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,080
When I say authentic, it's authentic.

203
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
- Fake judge.
- Fake judge.

204
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,440
What a lousy judge.

205
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,240
Who are you

206
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,399
