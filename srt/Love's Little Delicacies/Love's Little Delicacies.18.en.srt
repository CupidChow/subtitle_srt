=Episode 18=

3
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:42,759
Aunt Cuihua.

4
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,780
Chao?

5
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,200
Chao!

6
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,039
You are back from abroad.

7
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,000
I was about to go visit Jiajia
at the cemetery.

8
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,960
Jiajia is here!

9
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,879
There, there.

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,280
Did we

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
lead to trouble?

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,840
Don't worry.

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,920
I'll make Madam Zhang's favorite foods,

14
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,680
and she won't be sad anymore.

15
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,480
This doesn't change anything.

16
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,680
Jiajia will never come back.

17
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,120
I don't think we should have lied to her.

18
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,560
Ji Yu, Jiajia is gone. That is a fact.

19
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,680
There is no need to carry the pain
of others on your back.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
That would be exhausting.

21
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,879
But she's not anyone, she is my...

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,560
She is

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,319
Madam Zhang.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,640
Ji Yu,

25
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,560
this might be a cold thing to say,

26
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,239
but don't you think you are projecting

27
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,280
too many emotions onto Madam Zhang?

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,040
You wanted to be her family,

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,479
you don't want to make her
suffer from her pain,

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,479
you imposed all this onto her.

31
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,840
You can't take her place in pain.

32
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,680
Ji Yu, you are not her.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,039
You are not her family.

34
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,080
But I do want to have a family.

35
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,680
I want my mother
to come back and love me.

36
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,080
Is that too much to ask?

37
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,479
Ji Yu.

38
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,080
There, there, my good girl.

39
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,400
Here.

40
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,280
Don't sulk anymore.

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,560
I know you are very kind.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,840
You didn't want to hurt me.

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,280
But Shi Guang is right.

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
Regarding Jiajia,

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,680
only I can walk out from this shadow.

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,400
No one can persuade me to.

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,039
Can you choose not to think about it?

48
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,280
That way you won't be sad.

49
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,879
But Jiajia will be.

50
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,719
Death is not the end of one's life.

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,039
Being forgotten is.

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,039
I'm sad.

53
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,439
I blame myself for being a bad mother

54
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,280
for my most beloved daughter

55
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,360
had been forgotten by me

56
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,520
for so many years.

57
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,080
Both of you are good kids.

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,520
I like you both.

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,919
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,759
If you don't forgive him,
my little godson-in-law

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,839
is going to cry.

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
Here.

63
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,560
Go left. Further left.

64
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,439
Too much now. Go right. Go down.

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,639
It's almost done.

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,920
Looks good.

67
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,360
How nice.

68
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,879
Look.

69
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,920
There are fans of Shi Guang and I
as a couple?

70
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,959
(That's right.)

71
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,480
After Linda exposed
the Starmaker's scandal,

72
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,759
people are starting to ship the couple.

73
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,399
Look,

74
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,680
there's "Young Cub

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,279
Rescues Cougar in Distress",

76
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,279
so

77
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,880
(don't worry about making it public.)

78
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,680
(I'm watching over them for you.)

79
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,920
Ji Yu.

80
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,560
What is it?

81
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,990
I'm going back to Beijing soon.

82
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,879
We may not see each other for a long time.

83
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,279
Don't you have any mementos

84
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,480
that you want to give to me?

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,279
Memento?

86
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,199
I didn't prepare any.

87
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,879
Wait, no.

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,670
The post-production preparation
after going back

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,940
to Beijing will only last for a week.

90
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,439
No.

91
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,959
You had it prepared.

92
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,680
It's late. Hurry up and catch the plane.

93
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,439
Not yet!

94
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,480
I have to do it now.

95
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,879
Otherwise, it will be confiscated
when I go through airport security.

96
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,879
Scissors? Why is it in your pocket?

97
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,360
Hair bound, husband and wife.

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,680
In love, without a doubt.

99
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,639
Alive, return to me.

100
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,079
In death, ever long for thee.

101
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,079
Don't bring up death out of nowhere.

102
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,439
You're just catching a flight.

103
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,680
Ji Yu,

104
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,920
you said that you will be
responsible for me.

105
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,560
Now,

106
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,040
this is the proof for it.

107
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,759
When did I say that?

108
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,160
I don't care, you just did.

109
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,560
That's what your heart says too.

110
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,560
Alright.

111
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,959
Not only is there proof,

112
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,120
I will go and tell everyone

113
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,480
that you...

114
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,240
Alright, I get it.

115
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,480
Let's go now, we are really late.

116
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,120
Make a topic based on the content
that Shi Guang posted.

117
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,150
Get his official announcement
onto the trending search.

118
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,399
Yes, Mr. Jiang.

119
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,040
Mr. Jiang, it is trending right now.

120
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,720
What are you doing?

121
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,959
Ji Minghua,

122
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,680
I can pay off your gambling debts,

123
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,439
but I want your daughter in exchange.

124
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,040
Sure,

125
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,439
no problem.

126
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:26,800
So,

127
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,370
give me the money then.
