=Episode 2=

3
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
If the production team is kind enough,

4
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,040
they should've asked Shi Guang
and Ji Yu to walk.

5
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,599
They were just lucky.

6
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,239
This show is sponsored by Starmaker.

7
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,599
I can kick them out at any time.

8
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,799
I can help you.

9
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,760
But don't forget,

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,640
the champion

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,599
can only be me.

12
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,340
(Weinan)

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,100
There is a good restaurant
serving fish and pebbles stew.

14
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:42,121
Let's go and try it later.

15
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:44,321
Shi Guang.

16
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:44,950
What are you doing?

17
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:45,321
Shi Guang.

18
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:45,670
Move aside.

19
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,121
She shouldn't be your manager.

20
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:48,161
I'm your fan.

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,881
She will abuse you.

22
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:51,280
That's right. She's violent.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,440
Shi Guang, don't trust her.

24
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:53,601
She controlled Xia Mu.

25
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,401
You can't trust her.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,601
We will protect you.

27
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:56,681
Shi Guang, don't believe her.

28
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:59,080
This woman is shameless.

29
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:00,961
Shi Guang.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,920
You mustn't believe her, Shi Guang.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,080
What nonsense are you talking about?
Move.

32
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,200
Ji Yu wouldn't hurt someone
for no reason.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,120
Do you think you know the truth?

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,360
Don't believe her.

35
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:13,001
We are doing this for your own good.

36
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,281
You must be careful, Shi Guang.

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,281
You had better take the advice,
Shi Guang.

38
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,520
Shi Guang, you have to trust us.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,080
Shi Guang, trust us.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,761
She will ruin you.

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,520
Don't be fooled.

42
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,120
We are helping you, Shi Guang.

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,920
Shi Guang!

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,481
Don't fall for her trick.

45
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,800
Shi Guang, don't go.

46
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:34,960
Don't go, Shi Guang.

47
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,800
(Old Flavor Fish and Pebbles Stew)
This's Old Flavor Fish and Pebbles Stew.

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
I told you about this restaurant before.

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,441
Let's go in and try.

50
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,881
Try our signature dish,

51
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:00,441
fish and pebbles stew.

52
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:01,761
Thank you, mister.

53
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,561
It's fine.

54
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:08,080
There are pebbles in the dish.

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,400
Jiang Yang, continue.

56
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,841
Ji Xu, I have already clarified

57
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:15,001
the slapping incident

58
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,841
but somewhat someone made this incident

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,321
a topic in the hot searches last night.

60
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:19,680
I'm so speechless.

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,721
I tried every way to persuade
the production team,

62
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:24,841
but they still think your public image

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,920
has bad influences.

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,080
They gave you

65
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,761
three days starting from today

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,481
to either prove your commercial values

67
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,200
and gain followers by a million,

68
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,240
or...

69
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,001
Just say it.

70
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:42,240
Or both of you will be
kicked out of the program.

71
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,001
Gain a million followers in three days?

72
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,281
Are they insane?

73
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:50,601
That's possible.

74
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:52,281
I took an online promotion event

75
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:53,240
before.

76
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:57,200
It might be easy

77
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,680
to gain a million followers.

78
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:00,841
Are you serious?

79
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,441
Be realistic, okay?

80
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,960
You are no longer the good-time manager.

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,001
What should we do then?

82
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:10,880
What should we do?

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,800
Beat him up.

84
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:16,240
Old man,

85
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:17,961
how old are you?

86
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:19,401
Why did you occupy our place?

87
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,961
I rent the place legally.

88
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,000
Where is the contract?

89
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:23,680
Show us.

90
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,880
You are so disrespectful.

91
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,841
Who are you? Mind your own business.

92
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,560
Why about we call the police?

93
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:35,081
What's so great about that?

94
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,800
Old man, just you wait.
This is not over yet.

95
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:40,880
Let's go.

96
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,240
Are you all right, mister?

97
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,580
I'm good.

98
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:54,120
Miss and Mister,

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,601
try our signature dish.

100
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,920
Thank you, mister.

101
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,390
Seasoned flour mush
and fried dough twist.

102
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,041
Mister, who are those people?

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
Last year,

104
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,440
I rented a place

105
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,601
for the Sanqin Club's practice sessions.

106
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,800
Sanqin Club?

107
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,800
That's a Qinqiang troupe

108
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,841
formed by me and my friends.

109
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,081
We planned to rent a place

110
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:24,281
where we could sing
whenever we had time.

111
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,401
We wouldn't disturb others too.

112
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,481
Unexpectedly, after I paid the rent,

113
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:32,320
the agent went missing
without giving me the contract.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,041
Han, I came to back you up.

115
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,481
Where are those scoundrels?

116
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,201
You mustn't let them off so easily.

117
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:40,120
They came here to make a scene
several times.

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,641
Exactly. Besides,

119
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,641
we are going to perform
the day after tomorrow.

120
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,201
I have already informed
all the villagers.

121
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:47,041
We can't just change venues
at the last minute.

122
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,401
No, we must chase them away.

123
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
We can change the venue.

124
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:53,000
It's just that

125
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:54,641
we don't have money.

126
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:57,521
Money matters is easy.

127
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:58,680
We will take care of it.

128
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,041
We have to gain followers.

129
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,440
There's no need to help them.

130
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,201
We can help out the old folks

131
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,201
with their performance

132
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,721
and gain some followers
at the same time.

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,721
What's that? Gain followers?

134
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,201
Can live-streaming opera performances
help us gain followers?

135
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:19,961
I think rock music is better.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,800
You are right.

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,880
Since we can't get rid of them,

138
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,760
why don't we invite them
to join the performance?

139
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,721
Let's hold

140
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,680
a Qinqiang opera rock concert.

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,880
Qinqiang opera rock?

142
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,760
Doesn't it sound interesting?

143
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,401
Let's go and meet them.

144
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,841
Why aren't you drinking?

145
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,841
Come on. Drink some more.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
Cheers.

147
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,401
Bravo! Come on.

148
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,360
Bravo!

149
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:02,481
Come on. Yay!

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,081
You should've come sooner.

151
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:07,920
Goodness.

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,680
You didn't tell me it was so fun.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,961
Why aren't you singing?

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,360
Come on, let's drink.

155
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,521
What are they doing?

156
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,140
What's going on here?

157
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,420
Are they going to fight?

158
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,481
What are you doing here?

159
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,401
Qinqiang opera rock concert?

160
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,841
I'm not doing that.

161
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,281
Hi, Song. My name is Ji Yu.

162
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,240
Chief artists manager
of Starmaker Culture.

163
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,401
I think the Qinqiang opera
and the rock music

164
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,841
will make a great combination.

165
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,920
Starmaker approached me once before.

166
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:53,560
I ignored them.

167
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,281
Why?

168
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,521
I simply don't like them.

169
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,780
They are arrogant
because they are influential.

170
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,120
It seems that we are on the same side.

171
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,521
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

172
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,360
Ji Yu, an independent manager

173
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,721
who dismissed Starmaker.

174
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,481
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,961
Let's go and have a drink.

176
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,961
Sure.

177
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,360
Me too.

178
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,081
Move. What are you doing?

179
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,681
I came here with them.

180
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,880
I'm with her.

181
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,441
Can't you tell?

182
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:38,601
Wait.

183
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,240
Please make way.

184
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,000
Ms. Guan, you are here. Please come in.

185
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:07,400
Starmaker mentioned you before.

186
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:08,921
They said you often get into fights

187
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,201
and are abusive.

188
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:12,120
Ridiculous.

189
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:15,441
