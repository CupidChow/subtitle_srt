1
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,022
I pity myself for having to live

2
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:46,222
with a horny bastard
who sucks in bed.

3
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:49,022
So you sleep with him
out of pity?

4
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:52,122
But you're more than enough
Should I go down on you?

5
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:55,832
Oh, please.
I'll do the same for you.

6
00:00:55,902 --> 00:01:01,242
Darling, I'm already so wet.

7
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:05,072
Yes! Yes!

8
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:08,782
There! More!

9
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:12,182
I'm better
than your wife, right?

10
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:14,482
Why do you bring up
that pig?

11
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:17,992
Okay. Then you don't mention
that bastard either.

12
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:19,582
Okay. Faster...

13
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:24,602
what?

14
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:29,802
I'm... Sorry.

15
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:31,202
So...

16
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:36,212
The horny bastard they're
talking about is me, isn't it?

17
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:44,212
Unfortunately
you're the horny bastard.

18
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,822
Why do you think
young werther was sad?

19
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:51,422
Because he loved
his friend's wife.

20
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:54,832
Why did sad werther die?

21
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:58,732
He killed himself because
he couldn't commit adultery.

22
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:01,432
Anyway, that was
the phone conversation

23
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:05,272
between your wife
and your husband.

24
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,772
What do you want to do now?

25
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:10,782
I'll do it.

26
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:15,382
I'll pay you whatever you want

27
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:17,972
Just have them arrested.

28
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:22,982
This job is not
about arresting people.

29
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,492
This job is about
arresting the scene.

30
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,692
I don't care what you arrest
Just have them arrested for adultery.

31
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:30,092
Fine.

32
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:32,092
Let's get started.

33
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:43,002
- Who is it?
- You son of a bitch!

34
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:54,212
- Do you have a light?
- Who the fuck are you?

35
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,122
Who are you calling a fuck?

36
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:09,462
The Scent

37
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:20,982
- Hey, Poong.
- Yes?

38
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:22,782
What you are
collecting them for?

39
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:24,882
I'm not collecting them.

40
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:28,182
I'm creating a scientific
and logical database.

41
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:31,192
What data?
You dumb son of a...

42
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:33,692
That must be damn difficult.

43
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:36,992
Once this office catches fire,

44
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:39,402
it will go up in flames
because of your lighters.

45
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:43,492
Damn blaze of glory with
those damn motel lighters.

46
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:47,602
Don't look at your phone
when I'm talking to you, you punk.

47
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:50,102
Young ones these days
don't have any respect.

48
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,302
And you're too tall
to talk to.

49
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:55,412
Bend down, you skinny punk.

50
00:03:57,682 --> 00:04:00,022
Hello? Yes...

51
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,052
I'm looking for it.
So don't worry.

52
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:05,652
Are you working on side-job?

53
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:07,662
No.

54
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:10,062
Who are you looking for?
Come clean with me.

55
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:14,172
A horny run away dog...

56
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:15,572
You're a fool, aren't you?

57
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:20,972
Giant motel.
Address is 971 Yang-joo

58
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,872
in Kyung-ki province.

59
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:24,972
Twister motel. Address is
888 Goon-po in Kyung-ki province

60
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:26,482
You are a fool.

61
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,492
Nice smell.

62
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:35,282
Was someone here
this afternoon?

63
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,582
What?

64
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:39,792
- A girl?
- Bingo.

65
00:04:40,462 --> 00:04:43,692
She said
she'd be back to see you.

66
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:46,492
She was pretty
And looked rich.

67
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,702
Let's see...

68
00:04:55,882 --> 00:05:00,812
what're you going to do?
I don't feel good about this.

69
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:03,212
I don't feel good either.

70
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:07,452
There are
45,000 motels nationwide.

71
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:09,352
That's more than
number of churches.

72
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:11,862
68% of them use the motel

73
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:14,552
only for sex and sex alone

74
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:18,362
And 42% of those
sexes are adultery.

75
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:21,772
- Your name is...
- It's Soo-jin. Kim Soo-jin.

76
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:26,072
Oh, Soo-jin.
A common name, isn't it?

77
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:30,472
Okay, Ms. Kim
what brought you here?

78
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,672
My husband is having an affair.

79
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:35,582
Let's cut to the chase.

80
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:37,882
Do you want him
arrested for adultery?

81
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:39,482
Or do you want him
to beg for mercy?

82
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:56,992
I'm angry now...
but I'm not sure.

83
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:00,102
Okay then.

84
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:02,402
I'd like to say
something if I may.

85
00:06:03,882 --> 00:06:05,742
If you're going
to take him back,

86
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:08,252
think about
if you did anything wrong.

87
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:10,152
I didn't do anything wrong.

88
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:12,452
Then don't think twice.

89
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,352
You're not a husband
but a criminal!

90
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:15,852
I'm a victim!

91
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,752
- I'll punish you!
- I'll do it!

92
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:20,162
I'll humiliate you!

93
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:21,352
I will ruin your life!

94
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:23,662
I'll ruin his life!
I'll ruin it...

95
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:25,462
Okay. Let's ruin his life.

96
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:27,762
I need personal information of your
husband, car registration number.

97
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:30,362
And...
Do you know about his woman?

98
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:33,862
Shush. That's my job.

99
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:40,082
Hey, you.

100
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:43,782
I'm surprised you called.

101
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:45,182
What's up?
Anything good?

102
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,882
How long more do I have to wait?

103
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:50,892
I thing we've done
more than enough.

104
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,692
What is this?

105
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,092
Filing for Divorce

106
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:00,002
- I can't sign this.
- What?

107
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:02,302
What did I do wrong
to deserve a divorce?

108
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:03,802
You cheated on me.

109
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,842
I did not. I never did.
I'm innocent.

110
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:08,342
Aren't you tired of repeating
the same thing for 2 years?

111
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:09,742
Yes, I am.

112
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:12,642
- I'll see you in court.
- Hey...

113
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:15,742
what you do is romance
and what others do is adultery?

114
00:07:15,822 --> 00:07:18,942
No, they're all adultery...
My lovely Hye-young...

115
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,652
I love you!

116
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:26,952
Name, Nam Young-gil.

117
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:28,762
Address
135 Sungbuk-gu, Seoul...

118
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:32,362
I don't need a report paper
Just give me the essentials.

119
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:35,272
Well... Very little
is known about him

120
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:37,272
since he runs
a casino in Singapore.

121
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:38,862
Other than the fact
that he's a billionaire...

122
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,372
I have an incoming call.

123
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:45,472
- Hello?
- This is Soo- jin.

124
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:49,682
My husband called and said
he's not coming home tonight.

125
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,182
Just because he's not coming home
it doesn't mean he's cheating on you.

126
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,382
Just wait a while.

127
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:28,052
One, two, three...

128
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,452
Room No. 303.

129
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,382
You're in 303.
So I get 302.

130
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,872
Working hard, aren't you?

131
00:09:58,352 --> 00:10:00,472
Watch out.
She'll drain you out.

132
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,592
Hey, honey. I arrived.

133
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:14,092
Is it 303 or 304?
I'm standing at the door.

134
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:18,292
Who are you?

135
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:22,292
Ooops. Wrong room.
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,312
It must be 304, not 303.
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:29,002
My honey mumbles a lot.

138
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:31,802
You look busy.

139
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,612
Please carry on.

140
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,882
What is it?
Are you alone?

141
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:16,882
Where is your friend?
Your family?

142
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:19,082
I can do it by myself.

143
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:23,092
You'll take pictures and
take the condom all by yourself?

144
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:26,192
You must be the Joan of Arc
of 21st century.

145
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:28,392
I'll be damned...

146
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:32,102
Is he... really here?

147
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:35,512
- Next door.
- With a woman?

148
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:39,412
Of course he's with a woman.
He's not gay, is he?

149
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:42,312
Take out your camera.

150
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:48,622
We have no time!
He went in 20 minutes ago.

151
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:52,322
He...
takes a while to shower.

152
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:57,632
What? He's not taking a bath
y'know. It's not sauna.

153
00:11:58,202 --> 00:12:01,132
What the...
This is getting ridiculous.

154
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:06,772
Listen, let's stop here.

155
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,282
I don't think you can do this.

156
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,072
So, you go back home and

157
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:15,982
smile brightly at your husband
when he comes back.

158
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:25,692
Nuisance... Nuisance...
Fucking nuisance...

159
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:34,802
Damn...
Triple crown of nuisance...

160
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,102
You were right.

161
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:51,212
I couldn't do it
from the beginning.

162
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:56,022
I'll pay you what I promised.
So don't worry.

163
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:58,322
Well, money is not everything...

164
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:03,832
I'm hurt
if you put it that way...

165
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:09,162
Hey...

166
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,272
I don't drink while I work.
I really shouldn't... I really...

167
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:21,082
I really can't drink beer.
Oh, shit...

168
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:24,482
Then let's go in after this.

169
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,682
Cheers for Ms. Kim.

170
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:40,992
We drank.
Now let's go.

171
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:50,702
What...
what are you doing?

172
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:53,112
I'd like to pull out my hand...

173
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:00,512
Should we be doing this?
Shouldn't we...

174
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:38,292
Damn! I'm fucked.
Damn...

175
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:45,592
I'm a man who
separates work and play

176
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:49,292
And I'm destroyed by a can of beer.

177
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:55,002
Hey... I usually don't make
this kind of mistake.

178
00:14:57,382 --> 00:15:00,612
You started everything.

179
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:03,812
I'm a man of strong will.

180
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:06,552
But I think we're fucked.

181
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,852
Let's figure out
how to get of this mess.

182
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:13,762
What the...
You sure drool like a dog.

183
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:17,162
Not good
for a hot girl like you.

184
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,962
You never know women.

185
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:46,882
Who did this?

186
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,392
You did this?

187
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:50,182
Who are you?

188
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:55,092
- What's your name?
- Kim... Soo-jin...

189
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:57,192
That's the name of Nam's wife.

190
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:02,292
Wait. Don't move,

191
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:13,342
135 Sungbuk-ku...
Kim Soo-jin...

192
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:18,542
Yes... He's my husband.

193
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:21,552
I am his wife.

194
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:27,362
Then who killed him?

195
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:31,462
I was in a shower and I heard
something I came out but...

196
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,262
found my husband...

197
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:36,572
You're saying
you didn't see the killer.

198
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:46,872
Do you realize
whatjust happened?

199
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:49,972
A scene of adultery just
turned into a scene of murder.

200
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:51,882
With 2 dead bodies.

201
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:54,582
What do you mean 2?

202
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:58,192
You and I will be
framed as murderers

203
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,592
and we'll grow old
and die in prison.

204
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:16,642
- Hello? What's up?
- Where are you?

205
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,542
I'm on my way home.

206
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:34,652
You son of a bitch!

207
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:44,962
Fuck!

208
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:51,172
You must do as I say
Understand?

209
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:04,622
Where are you now?
You remember where All-in motel is?

210
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:06,022
Yes.

211
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:07,532
Bring your ass over here now!

212
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:11,522
- What is this about?
- Just come right now.

213
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:29,252
No man motel and he cut
powers to security system.

214
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:35,352
Then took whole
security camera footage.

215
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:39,052
This is not an accident.

216
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:41,152
It was planned.

217
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:50,962
Hey...

218
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:52,372
would you like one?

219
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:01,272
Do you know Kim Soo-jin?

220
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:02,082
What?

221
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:04,672
Don't you know your
husband's wife, Kim Soo-jin?

222
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:08,982
Oh, that's right.
You're not supposed to know.

223
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:12,892
But I thought you're...
not Kim Soo-jin...

224
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,982
Kim Soo-jin is not...

225
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:16,692
why the fuck you two have
the same name?

226
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,392
It's damn confusing.

227
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:21,702
Even the last name is the same.

228
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:24,502
That pricked only liked
Kim Soo-jin.

229
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,322
On my god!

230
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,622
It's not god.
It's a corpse, you punk!

231
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:14,192
Now remember everything you
and your husband touched in here.

232
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:19,982
Cups... and table...

233
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:22,192
wipe them.

234
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:25,992
You touched them
you wipe them

235
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:29,402
we don't work for you, y'know.

236
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,302
You're not a damn princess...

237
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:35,302
Oh my god!

238
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:39,402
I told you it's not god
It's a corpse, you damn fool.

239
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:55,522
- Who is that?
- Nam's wife.

240
00:21:56,602 --> 00:22:00,832
- Then who's this?
- Nam's wife.

241
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,532
What? What does that mean?

242
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:07,062
Fuck! I don't know!
I don't know, you stupid fuck.

243
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:09,672
That's why I'm digging.

244
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:12,582
If I knew
I'd have called an excavator!

245
00:22:12,652 --> 00:22:13,582
One, two. One, two.

246
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:15,272
I'm doing my best trying
to save our lives.

247
00:22:15,352 --> 00:22:18,282
What the fuck are you doing?

248
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:20,292
Look at you fucking
around with a trowel.

249
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:21,882
Get the fuck down here.

250
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:26,292
Use your damn height.
Bend down more!

251
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:45,112
Hey, Poong.
Take the Mercedes and dump it.

252
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:48,512
Yes... what?

253
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:51,912
You want me to dump
the Mercedes? What a waste...

254
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:54,212
If so, do you want to keep it
and be buried here too?

255
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:56,112
Nope...

256
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:31,192
75 million won and...

257
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:42,902
Hey, Poong. Make sure you get
rid of the unregistered phones.

258
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:44,492
- Yours too.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:48,512
I'm sorry such things happened

260
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:50,702
when you're getting
reinstated tomorrow.

261
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:53,202
I told you
I didn't feel good about it.

262
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:54,612
I was right, wasn't I?

263
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:00,912
That's right.
You were right.

264
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:02,112
But I have a feeling that
you'll get a knock

265
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,452
on your head in 2 seconds.

266
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:07,552
One, two!
Come here, you punk.

267
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:11,252
I want you to...
Look at this!

268
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,762
Why the hell
are you looking up?

269
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:16,362
I want you to come to this address
by 2 o'clock in the morning, okay?

270
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:23,972
So, can you do it or not?

271
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:26,572
This lock is
far more advanced than

272
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,882
the ones we used to pick
with niddles.

273
00:24:28,952 --> 00:24:31,082
This needs
absolute concentration

274
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:32,882
You wait far away from me.

275
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,292
So can you do it
if I stay far away?

276
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:40,092
Shush!
Don't you trust my skills?

277
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:43,692
I'm almost done...
Just stay there and look out.

278
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,302
What are you looking at
when you're talking?

279
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:52,702
I'm really curious.

280
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:02,802
Turn off the lights
you dumb fuck!

281
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:05,652
Why did you follow me in?

282
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:09,652
- Put that back.
- Put this back?

283
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:12,162
You took it off.
You put it back.

284
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:13,452
That's tough...

285
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:16,462
You want to go back to prison?
Should I call the cop?

286
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:26,762
Kim Soo-jin...

287
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:30,272
You intentionally dragged
me into this and you croaked.

288
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:34,972
Even pretending to be
someone else's wife.

289
00:26:37,842 --> 00:26:40,782
Visit your friend tomorrow and
make up an alibi.

290
00:26:41,552 --> 00:26:43,782
Don't forget to act naturally.

291
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:46,882
And keep calling your husband.

292
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:50,082
So you can tell the cops
you kept trying to reach him.

293
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:54,392
Then about a week later
you file for a missing person.

294
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:16,242
- Hello?
- I want to call the police.

295
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:17,742
What?

296
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:20,152
My husband is dead and buried

297
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,242
Why should I hide it?

298
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:23,152
What are you talking about?

299
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:25,352
There is no other suspect.

300
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:26,862
We were the only ones
at the scene

301
00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:28,862
with one dead body
for each of us!

302
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:32,062
Even if the police doubt us for now
we must report to find the truth.

303
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:34,572
Do you think they'll believe
what we tell them?

304
00:27:35,332 --> 00:27:38,772
I will catch the killer
before that, okay?

305
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:41,072
That should work, right?

306
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:45,372
...Hello? Fuck!

307
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:04,222
It's hot.

308
00:28:05,402 --> 00:28:09,232
He used to call 2, 3 times a day
even when he's in Singapore.

309
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:12,132
I can't reach him for 2 days.

310
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:13,832
Maybe he didn't subscribe
for the roaming plan...

311
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:15,842
The location tracking
based on his mobile phone

312
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:18,242
showed he last used
his phone in Ga-pyung.

313
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:20,242
Does he know anybody there?

314
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:23,542
No.

315
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:28,442
Ah, I get it now.

316
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:31,752
There are many golf clubs
in Ga-pyung, right?

317
00:28:31,822 --> 00:28:34,162
Business tycoons
such as your husband

318
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:36,852
sometimes lay low
when they want to cool off.

319
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:38,262
Not to brag about myself

320
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:40,862
but I've been
in the force for 13 years.

321
00:28:40,932 --> 00:28:42,962
I can figure out these things.

322
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:45,462
Coffee's nice...

323
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:52,372
In fact... the reason why
he visited Ga-pyung was...

324
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:57,782
wow, nice house.
It's surrounded with glasses.

325
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:00,082
- Hey!
- Long time no see.

326
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:01,782
What are you doing here?

327
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:03,292
It's my first day back today.

328
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:05,722
I must work the scene
if I'm back.

329
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:08,822
How big is this house?

330
00:29:09,502 --> 00:29:10,622
It's been a while.

331
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:14,232
Why, did you miss me?
I didn't.

332
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:15,532
Anyway, did you rest well?

333
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:17,932
Yes, I rested well for 2 years

334
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:20,342
I rested too long
I began to smell.

335
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:21,532
Don't I smell?

336
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:26,042
- Are you a detective?
- Yes... why?

337
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:28,952
You don't look like one.

338
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:33,642
Gees... That's a big deal if
a detective dosen't look like one.

339
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:37,252
You were saying... your husband
visited Ga-pyung because?

340
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:47,262
When he returned, he sometimes
visited Ga-ptung to play golf.

341
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:51,472
Recently, he was
under a lot of stress

342
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,872
expanding his
casino business in Philippines.

343
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:58,572
So... he kept saying he
wanted to rest for a while.

344
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:05,582
Bingo! That must be it.
He went to play golf a lot.

345
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:08,882
You called us
crying and reported

346
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:12,192
you couldn't reach your
husband. Why all of a sudden...

347
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:18,992
I think I overreacted.

348
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:22,302
You were acting as if
something serious has happened.

349
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:25,792
I think
I'll wait few more days.

350
00:30:35,182 --> 00:30:36,612
I'm sorry.

351
00:30:37,982 --> 00:30:39,422
No, we're sorry.

352
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:48,022
What a waste of time.

353
00:30:52,202 --> 00:30:53,822
What the hell is he about?

354
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:58,632
Making wrinkles on the face
of a such a beautiful woman.

355
00:30:58,702 --> 00:31:01,542
I want him to go missing.

356
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,342
I want him to evaporate.

357
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:07,472
Anyway, from the look of it
isn't it a fuck case?

358
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:09,282
Of course
it's a fucka-doodle-do case.

359
00:31:09,352 --> 00:31:10,472
Right?

360
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:16,382
Oh, damn. Can you put
than horn on vibrate?

361
00:31:16,462 --> 00:31:18,892
- I want to put it on silent.
- Right?

362
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:44,412
- Detective Kang.
- Yes? Yes...

363
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:50,222
Sign this papers
and get your ID back.

364
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:51,522
Okay. Thank you.

365
00:31:51,592 --> 00:31:56,222
Wow, you sure
look good in uniforms.

366
00:31:56,702 --> 00:31:58,422
That's why I fell
in love with you.

367
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:00,932
I gotta go
my sexy Hye-young.

368
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,432
You only had 2 year
suspension this time,

369
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:06,672
But I will end
your career next time.

370
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:08,762
Hey, hey...
why are you saying that?

371
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:10,372
You're scaring me
on my first day back.

372
00:32:11,342 --> 00:32:12,672
I love you.

373
00:32:13,352 --> 00:32:15,282
Why do you keep doing that?

374
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:17,582
Did you want to
show off this time?

375
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:20,482
Is that why you answered my call
while you're doing that?

376
00:32:23,762 --> 00:32:27,492
That's a misunderstanding
what happened that day was...

377
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:31,002
what misunderstanding?
I heard everything!

378
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:33,992
A phone call.
Hold on.

379
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:39,902
Yes, chief... Now?
Okay, I'll be right there.

380
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:50,112
- I'm right here
- Is that a joke?

381
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:57,622
- Is this Mr. Nam's residence?
- Yes...

382
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:59,622
This is Yang-pyong police.

383
00:32:59,692 --> 00:33:02,222
Your husband's car was found.

384
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:23,472
What are you doing here?

385
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:26,582
Are you crazy?

386
00:33:26,652 --> 00:33:28,682
- I killed him.
- What?

387
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:31,192
I killed my husband.

388
00:33:36,262 --> 00:33:37,492
What are you talking about?

389
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:40,002
My husband is dead and I
pretended nothing has happened.

390
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:42,702
It's the same as me
killing him.

391
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,602
Are you playing
a game with me?

392
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:47,302
- My husband's car was found.
- What?

393
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:49,502
If they can't reach him by today,

394
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:52,012
they're going to start
investigation.

395
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,512
I can't take it anymore.
I'm too scared.

396
00:33:56,582 --> 00:34:00,812
Mercedes... Fuck!
Poong, that son of a bitch...

397
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:14,562
She said her husband is missing
She was just consulting me.

398
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:19,572
I think my husband
was having an affair.

399
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,872
I saw him talking on the phone

400
00:34:22,942 --> 00:34:25,472
in the middle
of the night sometimes.

401
00:34:28,352 --> 00:34:30,082
Why didn't you say
that yesterday?

402
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:40,892
It's degrading...
for a woman.

403
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:42,892
Now this case
is officially filed.

404
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:44,992
We'll start investigation.

405
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:50,602
- Don't worry too much.
- Please find my husband.

406
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:56,402
Well... if you need any help
related to adultery...

407
00:34:57,782 --> 00:34:59,902
Please consult Detective Kang.

408
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:01,712
He's an expert in that matter.

409
00:35:01,782 --> 00:35:04,342
We suffer
from all kinds of pain

410
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:06,852
But adultery hurts us
the most, right?

411
00:35:06,922 --> 00:35:10,252
- Help as much as you can
- Of course... I'm an expert...

412
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,862
why did you say
there was a woman?

413
00:35:19,632 --> 00:35:21,262
It's getting out of hands.

414
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:24,462
I'll identify dead Kim Soo-jin.

415
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,272
It's a matter of time
before we nail her down.

416
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:30,972
Just go home.

417
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:43,882
She is attractive.

418
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:49,092
Is she?
I don't know.

419
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:53,002
No... Her perfume
is quite stimulating.

420
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:59,692
Her husband is missing and
she has time to use perfume...

421
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:04,632
She must've hated her husband.
Just like someone I know.

422
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,652
Ga-pyung in Kyungki province

423
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,962
His car was abandoned
in the forrest Nam Young-gil...

424
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:30,172
Something must have happened.

425
00:36:31,142 --> 00:36:33,472
She said he's having an affair.

426
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:36,662
Isn't this flat out a fuck case?

427
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:40,082
He's probably in Bali
screwing someone.

428
00:36:40,552 --> 00:36:42,672
If you look at
his phone records,

429
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:45,272
he's been talking
a lot with Kim Soo-jin.

430
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:47,982
Of course he talked
a lot with his wife.

431
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:50,392
It's a different person
with the same name.

432
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:52,892
- Different person?
- And this is...

433
00:36:56,262 --> 00:36:58,792
Different Kim Soo-jin's
phone record.

434
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:00,692
On the day Nam went missing,

435
00:37:00,772 --> 00:37:04,432
she called this number
many times.

436
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:06,532
I checked the number and

437
00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:08,732
found out the phone
was not registered.

438
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:11,442
What if...

439
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:13,442
this is notjust a disappearance?

440
00:37:13,512 --> 00:37:15,242
That different Kim Soo-jin and

441
00:37:15,312 --> 00:37:17,542
the owner of the unregistered
number is our prime suspect.

442
00:37:17,622 --> 00:37:20,452
Trace that number and

443
00:37:20,522 --> 00:37:22,352
search everything
about dead Kim Soo-jin.

444
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:28,662
Looks like no one's home.
Let's go.

445
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:34,662
You're damn stubborn.

446
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:36,672
Pressing the bell 30 times.

447
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:40,562
Who are you?

448
00:37:43,142 --> 00:37:44,272
Do you live here?

449
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:46,572
Relax and...

450
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:49,672
just answer few questions.

451
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,682
Okay...

452
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:54,982
How did you two meet?

453
00:37:55,052 --> 00:37:58,582
We met at the gym.
I was a trainner for her.

454
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:01,792
She had a pretty face
and a body...

455
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,332
we hit it off and
started living together.

456
00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:06,422
But we broke up last month.

457
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,632
She started going out
with a rich old bastard.

458
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:11,932
I got mad and
wanted to move out

459
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:14,532
but she told me
to just stay here.

460
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:18,042
Saying she'll rip him off
and fly to America.

461
00:38:19,212 --> 00:38:20,642
What did she do for living?

462
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:23,652
She was a model but
she worked at clubs at night.

463
00:38:24,522 --> 00:38:26,952
- Hey!
- What?

464
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:31,152
- You practiced, didn't you?
- What do you mean?

465
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:32,262
You knew the police
would talk to you

466
00:38:32,322 --> 00:38:34,162
So you prepared what to say.

467
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:37,062
What did you do 2 nights ago?

468
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:40,262
I played some game
at my friends shop...

469
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:41,862
And went out to drink
about 2 in the morning.

470
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,962
Who the fuck are you lying to?

471
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:46,872
You can ask my friend.

472
00:38:46,942 --> 00:38:49,172
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

473
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:52,372
Why are you doing this?

474
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:55,182
It's okay if you're sure.

475
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:58,382
It's just a hunch.

476
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:03,992
What are you doing here?

477
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,522
- She's not in.
- Oh... She's not in.

478
00:39:06,592 --> 00:39:07,722
She went out to exercise.

479
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,522
No, you can't go in there.

480
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:11,622
So, you don't come in
until I come out.

481
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:37,852
Ma'am
you shouldn't lie to me.

482
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:40,252
This is what I work for.

483
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:46,262
I don't expect you
to talk for nothing.

484
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:48,462
Take this and relax.

485
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:54,472
I go home in the evening...
I don't know much...

486
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,372
Come on, Ma'am...

487
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:02,672
Damn, you're a hustler
of maids' industry.

488
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:04,682
Take it and let's talk.

489
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:08,282
- I think I remember something.
- You sure do.

490
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:10,182
I do remember now.

491
00:40:12,462 --> 00:40:16,792
Few months ago
when I first came here

492
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:19,802
there were police at the house.

493
00:40:20,572 --> 00:40:24,402
Mr. Nam beat
Mrs. Nam pretty bad and

494
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:27,202
she called the police.

495
00:40:27,272 --> 00:40:29,212
But when they actually arrived

496
00:40:29,272 --> 00:40:33,112
she told them
they were just arguing.

497
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:00,042
Is it because it's mixed with
the scent of your sweat?

498
00:41:02,012 --> 00:41:03,942
Scent of your perfume is
quite sensual.

499
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:07,772
It was a gift from my husband.

500
00:41:07,852 --> 00:41:09,372
He liked the scent.

501
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:17,092
Ah... That's why the dead girl
had the same scent.

502
00:41:19,162 --> 00:41:20,682
What brought you here?

503
00:41:23,162 --> 00:41:28,792
The dead girl new about me
Even my past.

504
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:32,802
What does that
have to do with me?

505
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:40,612
We have to figure that out together
If we want to catch the killer.

506
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:45,012
Why it had to be me...
why was I selected...

507
00:41:51,392 --> 00:41:53,622
You called the cops about
6 months ago, didn't you?

508
00:41:57,602 --> 00:42:00,932
That's when you first found out
your husband was cheating on you.

509
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:03,132
So?

510
00:42:04,002 --> 00:42:05,872
You brobably got mad.

511
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:07,672
No, you couldn't take it.

512
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,972
Although he was old, you married
him because he was so rich.

513
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:12,672
But he got fed up with you and

514
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:16,082
started seeing
another woman. That' why...

515
00:42:16,152 --> 00:42:17,482
I killed him?

516
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:24,682
6 months is more than enought
for you to worry, plan and execute.

517
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:28,792
Is that why I killed him?

518
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:30,382
Just because he cheated on me?

519
00:42:30,462 --> 00:42:32,292
One woman once killed her husband

520
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:34,192
because he made noise
while eating.

521
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:39,102
My husband was not like that.

522
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:44,812
That may not be the only reason.

523
00:42:47,382 --> 00:42:48,712
Stop it!

524
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,912
You wanted to kill him so bad

525
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:53,812
Otherwise
you might end up dead.

526
00:42:56,692 --> 00:42:58,322
Please get out.

527
00:42:58,892 --> 00:43:02,332
And don't ever return.

528
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:52,002
- Hello?
- This is Soo- jin.

529
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:57,302
Oh, what's up.

530
00:44:57,382 --> 00:45:00,212
Do you enjoy tailing and
peeping on someone?

531
00:45:01,482 --> 00:45:04,742
You look like you have something
to say. Please come inside.

532
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:42,982
I loved and married
a man of my dreams.

533
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:50,082
But I think he loved me
too much...

534
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:53,502
He suffered
from delusional jealousy

535
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:58,002
Everyday
he'd doubt and beat me...

536
00:45:59,672 --> 00:46:03,902
So I divorced him and
married my husband now.

537
00:46:06,812 --> 00:46:13,052
But since he was rich
he had many women.

538
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,252
It'd have been better
if I didn't know...

539
00:46:18,222 --> 00:46:21,952
How dare you question me?
How dare you!

540
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:31,762
You are a flower
I legally purchased.

541
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:34,672
I... I only love you.

542
00:46:34,742 --> 00:46:37,472
I'm just having fun with others!

543
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:39,772
If I questioned him
he'd beat me...

544
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:46,682
Recently, he started
going out with a girl

545
00:46:46,752 --> 00:46:48,782
who had the same name as me.

546
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:51,982
Why did you say
you didn't know her?

547
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:55,692
I... I didn't want to
talk about her...

548
00:46:57,462 --> 00:46:59,492
It disgusts me even to talk...

549
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:05,632
I really didn't kill...

550
00:47:08,012 --> 00:47:10,242
It's hard to live
through the day.

551
00:47:13,112 --> 00:47:15,742
I hated him enough to kill him...

552
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:20,952
But since he's actually dead
I miss him...

553
00:47:23,222 --> 00:47:25,252
I feel sorry for him...

554
00:48:33,522 --> 00:48:35,652
Come on, say something.
You called me.

555
00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:39,652
You called me
about the papers again?

556
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:43,862
This case is not about adultery
why are you so obsessed with it?

557
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:48,562
What do you want to say?

558
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:50,072
Kim Soo-jin...

559
00:48:54,652 --> 00:48:57,382
- Hello?
- Can you come now?

560
00:48:57,452 --> 00:48:59,682
What's up?

561
00:48:59,752 --> 00:49:01,882
Someone is following me
since this afternoon.

562
00:49:03,352 --> 00:49:04,622
Okay, bye.

563
00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:09,722
Is that... her?

564
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:13,732
No, it'd Detective Seo.
I think I'd better go.

565
00:49:14,802 --> 00:49:19,242
Since when you take
his calls so nervously?

566
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:23,432
I gotta go.

567
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:19,102
Fuck, it's high...

568
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:53,622
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was you.

569
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:58,322
Hold on.
It's almost done.

570
00:52:00,402 --> 00:52:02,422
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

571
00:52:03,302 --> 00:52:05,272
It's just a graze...

572
00:52:11,142 --> 00:52:16,772
Thank you about last night
And tonight...

573
00:52:19,452 --> 00:52:21,682
You have a special scent.

574
00:52:23,952 --> 00:52:25,482
Strangely suductive...

575
00:52:25,962 --> 00:52:27,792
Must be the perfume.

576
00:52:28,662 --> 00:52:30,392
Although it's the same perfume,

577
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:34,392
it feels different
from the dead Soo-jin.

578
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:38,802
How so?

579
00:52:41,872 --> 00:52:45,212
I don't know...
I can't describe it.

580
00:52:46,582 --> 00:52:51,112
Do I still have that scent?

581
00:53:28,152 --> 00:53:28,882
Hello?

582
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:32,392
We have a report
on Nam's burial sight.

583
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:33,682
What?

584
00:53:41,872 --> 00:53:43,892
Those damn sons of bitches...

585
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:46,102
They kill in Seoul
and dump the bodies here.

586
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:47,802
My province is turing
into grave yards...

587
00:53:47,872 --> 00:53:51,102
No more lands in Seoul
because of so may buildings.

588
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:53,112
Chief Oh
please do me a favor.

589
00:53:53,182 --> 00:53:55,302
What are you talking about?

590
00:53:55,382 --> 00:53:57,402
Since we have 2 dead bodies...

591
00:53:57,482 --> 00:53:59,212
30 reward points
for a murder case

592
00:53:59,282 --> 00:54:01,222
You know better, don't you?

593
00:54:01,292 --> 00:54:03,522
Hey, send the bodies
to hospital now.

594
00:54:03,592 --> 00:54:05,562
We filed the report.

595
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:08,562
Is someone talking about me?
My ears are itchy like crazy.

596
00:54:08,632 --> 00:54:12,962
Hey, we're the ones who called
for that excavator!

597
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:17,062
Then, if you come down
here with a shovel

598
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,362
and dig out all
the potatoes down there,

599
00:54:19,442 --> 00:54:21,272
Are those potatoes
all yours? Huh?

600
00:54:22,642 --> 00:54:26,972
What do potatoes
have to do with this?

601
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,672
That's right!

602
00:54:28,752 --> 00:54:31,872
So just dig out the potatoes
for all I care...

603
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:38,282
30 reward points for 2 corpses...

604
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:40,692
I'll be happy for 2 month.

605
00:54:41,162 --> 00:54:42,892
Snakes! Snakes!

606
00:54:44,162 --> 00:54:48,192
Don't kill them
They have their rights.

607
00:54:48,272 --> 00:54:50,702
Snakes don't have rights.
They don't have lefts either.

608
00:54:50,772 --> 00:54:52,402
- What the...
- I'm sorry.

609
00:54:52,472 --> 00:54:54,202
You can't come in here.

610
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:57,712
Chief Oh
we're all detectives here.

611
00:54:57,782 --> 00:55:00,012
Where the hell have you been?

612
00:55:00,082 --> 00:55:01,012
What happened?

613
00:55:01,082 --> 00:55:02,602
The body came up
all covered in blood.

614
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:05,952
Don't be late anymore!

615
00:55:09,422 --> 00:55:12,362
I fell into mud on the way.

616
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:14,952
- Detective Kang.
- Wha... what?

617
00:55:16,632 --> 00:55:17,652
Isn't it a little strange
about the reporter?

618
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:18,852
What is?

619
00:55:18,932 --> 00:55:20,362
The reporter
didn't identify himself.

620
00:55:20,432 --> 00:55:23,562
And knew exactly where
the bodies were buried...

621
00:55:23,632 --> 00:55:25,972
And called in few days
after the murder...

622
00:55:26,842 --> 00:55:30,862
It feels like an accomplice
having a change of heart

623
00:55:30,942 --> 00:55:32,372
rather an a witness.

624
00:55:33,342 --> 00:55:36,372
Damn that Chief Oh
all I wanted was to share...

625
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:40,272
- Share what?
- Look, there are 2 corpses.

626
00:55:40,352 --> 00:55:43,682
It'd be nice to share one each.

627
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:48,492
When the case is closed,

628
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:51,192
it'd be nice to share
the records too

629
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:55,102
Then... are we handing over
all the rights for investigation?

630
00:55:55,672 --> 00:55:57,602
Whoever arrest
the killer first, wins.

631
00:55:57,672 --> 00:55:58,292
Of course!

632
00:55:58,372 --> 00:55:59,702
They haven't found out
anything about the reporter

633
00:55:59,772 --> 00:56:01,702
other than the fact
it's a woman, right?

634
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:04,742
- Woman? Are you sure?
- Yes

635
00:56:06,412 --> 00:56:10,242
why? The fact that it's a woman
suddenly brings interests?

636
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:13,552
You want to start with visiting her
and lead to personal surveillance?

637
00:56:18,322 --> 00:56:19,952
Snake! Snake!

638
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,362
Act your damn age...

639
00:56:23,932 --> 00:56:25,862
Do the personal surveillance!

640
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:32,062
Woman... Fuck!

641
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:48,072
Where were you going?

642
00:56:48,852 --> 00:56:52,292
Hospital.
They found my musband's body.

643
00:56:52,862 --> 00:56:54,382
Yes, they found it.

644
00:56:54,462 --> 00:56:57,192
There were only 3 people
who know the sight.

645
00:56:57,262 --> 00:56:58,792
Me, you and Poong.

646
00:56:59,462 --> 00:57:03,402
It's not me...
I don't think it's you...

647
00:57:04,102 --> 00:57:05,632
Then it must be Poong.

648
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,742
Do you still not trust me?

649
00:57:08,812 --> 00:57:10,432
Yes, I do.

650
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:12,532
What's your next move?
Tell me

651
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:13,442
Let me out.

652
00:57:13,512 --> 00:57:15,542
You must have everything
in your head. Tell me.

653
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:16,142
Stop the car!

654
00:57:16,212 --> 00:57:18,742
Stop playing innocent and
answer the question!

655
00:58:30,022 --> 00:58:33,552
You did this, didn't you?
Say it.

656
00:58:35,132 --> 00:58:36,652
Say you didn't do it!

657
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:55,672
Hello?

658
00:59:56,942 --> 00:59:59,472
What do you want
at this hour...

659
01:00:13,262 --> 01:00:16,992
Detective Kang...

660
01:00:17,062 --> 01:00:20,592
has been accused of having
an indecent relationship with

661
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:24,602
the wife of Chief inspector of
Seoul North District police station.

662
01:00:24,672 --> 01:00:27,602
Your indecent behavior with
the wife of your superior

663
01:00:27,672 --> 01:00:31,202
has severly degraded
the police force.

664
01:00:31,282 --> 01:00:34,212
I never degraded
the police force.

665
01:00:34,782 --> 01:00:37,912
Okay! If that's case

666
01:00:37,982 --> 01:00:41,012
Did you have a particular
reason to help her

667
01:00:41,082 --> 01:00:43,612
while obstructing
official police work?

668
01:00:44,692 --> 01:00:47,712
I just felt bad for her.

669
01:00:49,692 --> 01:00:52,822
She was covered with bruises
from her husband's beating

670
01:00:54,202 --> 01:00:56,932
And her mind was
torn into pieces.

671
01:00:57,002 --> 01:01:01,842
I didn't know you're
a such a man ofjustice.

672
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:04,572
I thought I could
understand her pain.

673
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,272
My mother suffered the same.

674
01:01:10,052 --> 01:01:13,782
Can't you understand my pain?

675
01:01:18,362 --> 01:01:20,692
Chief, we confirmed the owner
of the unregistered number

676
01:01:20,762 --> 01:01:23,892
that Soo-jin called.

677
01:01:24,562 --> 01:01:25,692
Who is it?

678
01:01:25,762 --> 01:01:29,202
I slapped around the phone
broker a little

679
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:32,392
and he said it's a guy named Poong
who used work as a sidekick.

680
01:01:33,672 --> 01:01:37,002
And he said
Poong made 2 phones.

681
01:01:38,982 --> 01:01:41,102
Once you hear this message,

682
01:01:41,182 --> 01:01:43,912
go to the office and
throw away everything. Now!

683
01:01:51,492 --> 01:01:55,822
Look, look...
This was a private agency.

684
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:58,232
Yes, a private agency...
You're right...

685
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:01,232
Couple problems, family matters
and adultery specialists.

686
01:02:02,702 --> 01:02:03,832
Nothing special, right?

687
01:02:03,902 --> 01:02:05,662
No, nothing, nothing

688
01:02:05,742 --> 01:02:07,862
They cleaned the place good.

689
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:11,062
Let's not waste our time.

690
01:02:11,342 --> 01:02:13,782
- Where is toilet?
- Over there...

691
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:18,582
I think... it's over there
Maybe not.

692
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:22,092
Hey, stop...
Don't force it.

693
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:23,982
Looks like nothing's here.

694
01:02:31,062 --> 01:02:34,192
Why do you have to
force everything?

695
01:02:34,262 --> 01:02:36,892
I told you...
It's clean.

696
01:02:37,972 --> 01:02:41,102
Nice work, Poong
tall skinny bastard.

697
01:02:41,172 --> 01:02:42,802
Where did you hide it?

698
01:02:43,372 --> 01:02:45,902
Why the hell this won't fluch?

699
01:02:48,482 --> 01:02:51,502
What is this?

700
01:03:12,442 --> 01:03:13,772
Oops...

701
01:03:14,442 --> 01:03:15,772
I'm fucked.

702
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:19,782
Chief
personal info of Poong.

703
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:26,372
No need to look.
He's our man.

704
01:03:26,452 --> 01:03:29,582
All the motel lighers
were found from his office.

705
01:03:30,052 --> 01:03:33,892
But... he was a petty thief who
used to steal coins from pachinko.

706
01:03:33,962 --> 01:03:36,892
I don't think he murdered anyone
Definitely not 2...

707
01:03:37,562 --> 01:03:40,292
How do you explain
so much money?

708
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:42,992
Once a sidekick
forever a sidekick.

709
01:03:43,972 --> 01:03:45,802
There must
his master somewhere.

710
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:51,002
Detective Kang.

711
01:03:51,882 --> 01:03:53,102
Yes, what?

712
01:03:55,282 --> 01:03:56,612
I think you're right.

713
01:03:57,782 --> 01:04:00,912
A petty thief
to clean 2 dead bodies...

714
01:04:01,892 --> 01:04:03,222
That's impossible.

715
01:04:04,222 --> 01:04:08,562
He used 2 unregistered phones.

716
01:04:10,232 --> 01:04:12,462
He's just a sidekick.

717
01:04:14,932 --> 01:04:16,762
Who is his master...

718
01:04:18,442 --> 01:04:21,672
Once we arrest his master
this case is over.

719
01:04:22,542 --> 01:04:27,372
His master, it'd be nice
to know who he is...

720
01:04:27,442 --> 01:04:31,882
It'll be good for us...
But impossible to find him...

721
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:34,282
The autopsy is over and

722
01:04:34,352 --> 01:04:38,192
we'll have DNA results of the sperm
from Kim Soo-jin's body tomorrow.

723
01:04:38,762 --> 01:04:41,592
If we get results of DNA
that must be the master...

724
01:04:41,662 --> 01:04:43,792
we'll have the killer soon.

725
01:04:48,072 --> 01:04:50,902
Did I do it?
Did I not do it?

726
01:04:51,572 --> 01:04:54,902
I did it. That's why
I was buck naked.

727
01:04:54,972 --> 01:04:57,502
No, I didn't do it.

728
01:04:57,572 --> 01:05:00,202
Even if I passed out
I must have felt something.

729
01:05:00,282 --> 01:05:03,802
Something hot...
Damn, hot!

730
01:05:11,822 --> 01:05:14,052
Ah fuck!

731
01:05:15,032 --> 01:05:18,052
I did it, I did it.
Well done, you dumb fuck.

732
01:05:21,232 --> 01:05:22,262
How am I supposed to
catch the killer

733
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:24,362
before the DNA result is out?

734
01:05:24,432 --> 01:05:26,662
Crazy fuck...

735
01:05:29,142 --> 01:05:31,872
You're here. I've been
looking all over for you.

736
01:05:32,742 --> 01:05:34,872
The security camera
footage of the motel

737
01:05:34,952 --> 01:05:36,282
on the day of murder
just arrived

738
01:05:36,352 --> 01:05:38,182
Let's go watch it!

739
01:05:38,252 --> 01:05:41,782
- Security camera?
- Yes, itjust arrived.

740
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:47,392
What are you doing?
Let's go.

741
01:05:53,262 --> 01:05:55,202
Click on this one.
This one.

742
01:05:55,272 --> 01:05:57,202
Hey, move your hand.

743
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:11,642
Ah, it's on.

744
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:22,652
What is this?

745
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:24,962
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

746
01:06:26,332 --> 01:06:29,262
What's going on?

747
01:06:30,202 --> 01:06:31,832
What happened?

748
01:06:32,602 --> 01:06:34,232
What is this DVD?

749
01:06:34,442 --> 01:06:38,972
You look like a dog.
Wanting to take a dump.

750
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:41,772
I want to take a dump.

751
01:06:41,852 --> 01:06:45,982
You should have done it earlier.
We have to watch this now.

752
01:06:46,852 --> 01:06:50,382
What're you doing here
so early in the morning?

753
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:54,392
- I'm too busy.
- No, you do your work.

754
01:06:55,862 --> 01:06:57,592
But I wonder who saved your ass

755
01:06:57,662 --> 01:06:59,992
whenyou got caught
cheating on you wife?

756
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:03,092
I somehow knew
your wife's phone number.

757
01:07:03,172 --> 01:07:04,432
No, no...
you do your work.

758
01:07:07,802 --> 01:07:11,542
You won't get any prints
He was wearing gloves.

759
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:13,942
Then what am I
supposed to find?

760
01:07:14,012 --> 01:07:16,142
I wouldn't be here
if I knew that.

761
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:18,652
Find anything
And quickly.

762
01:08:11,702 --> 01:08:15,932
She looks like she's wearing
a dress even at a funeral.

763
01:08:16,012 --> 01:08:18,342
Don't stare.

764
01:09:02,252 --> 01:09:03,782
Do you have a light?

765
01:09:21,602 --> 01:09:25,542
Did you get some sleep?
You look tired.

766
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:27,542
You look good though.

767
01:09:28,312 --> 01:09:32,252
Do I? Don't I look sad?

768
01:09:36,122 --> 01:09:38,142
The killer...
Can you arrest him?

769
01:09:41,122 --> 01:09:43,462
It'll be
all over for us once

770
01:09:44,332 --> 01:09:46,762
we catch the guy
who attacked you.

771
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:48,562
We?

772
01:09:52,742 --> 01:09:55,762
That's right It's we now...

773
01:09:56,842 --> 01:09:59,172
The case is
getting more complicated

774
01:10:00,642 --> 01:10:02,772
But I don't know
how I feel about it.

775
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:12,692
You still don't trust me.

776
01:10:15,562 --> 01:10:18,192
It's not a matter of me
trusting you.

777
01:10:18,762 --> 01:10:21,602
It's a matter of
how I get out of this.

778
01:10:27,772 --> 01:10:29,902
You're wearing the perfume
even for the funeral.

779
01:11:17,152 --> 01:11:18,182
Hey, didn't Detective Kang say

780
01:11:18,252 --> 01:11:21,782
he wanted to talk
to Kim Soo-jin?

781
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:23,882
He went to the family room.

782
01:11:24,562 --> 01:11:25,892
The family room?

783
01:11:59,802 --> 01:12:01,422
Detective Kang...

784
01:12:33,662 --> 01:12:38,002
I've been
in the force for 15 years

785
01:12:38,072 --> 01:12:40,592
But I've never seen a detective
so devoted to comforting the widow...

786
01:12:40,672 --> 01:12:44,302
what a humanist...

787
01:13:25,452 --> 01:13:27,882
what does a detective
want from me?

788
01:13:27,952 --> 01:13:29,182
I just have a few questions.

789
01:13:29,252 --> 01:13:30,692
I'm back.

790
01:13:32,862 --> 01:13:36,192
Tell him we're closed
darling!

791
01:13:37,762 --> 01:13:39,282
We're closed, sir.

792
01:14:00,582 --> 01:14:04,642
Detective Kang
let's have a word.

793
01:14:07,922 --> 01:14:09,952
You talked with
Kim Soo-jin over the phone

794
01:14:10,032 --> 01:14:11,462
Not with Detective Seo.

795
01:14:11,532 --> 01:14:14,762
Is it strange for the victim
to call the detective?

796
01:14:14,832 --> 01:14:16,862
On the day
Nam's dead body was found

797
01:14:17,532 --> 01:14:20,062
you called her
more than 20 times.

798
01:14:21,342 --> 01:14:22,962
Are you suspecting me?

799
01:14:23,642 --> 01:14:25,672
Actually
I'm a little scared

800
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:28,482
Feels like
it's bigger than it seems.

801
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:30,272
Don'tjump to conclusions
please.

802
01:14:31,652 --> 01:14:33,282
Why did you call me
in the morning?

803
01:14:37,352 --> 01:14:38,482
Wrong dial.

804
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,992
My... You're as quick
as your service.

805
01:14:46,062 --> 01:14:47,192
Move out of the way.

806
01:14:47,262 --> 01:14:51,892
You delivered a package
to police station

807
01:14:51,972 --> 01:14:53,402
Do you remember who sent it?

808
01:14:53,472 --> 01:14:55,492
Of course.

809
01:14:55,572 --> 01:15:00,602
It's not easy to forget a woman
with a beautiful face and hot body.

810
01:15:00,682 --> 01:15:01,802
A woman?

811
01:15:01,882 --> 01:15:05,252
And I don't know
what perfume she used

812
01:15:05,312 --> 01:15:09,342
But it was delicate and...
seductive.

813
01:15:11,622 --> 01:15:14,562
She didn't say
where she was going.

814
01:15:20,532 --> 01:15:24,162
103 Search street, Seoul...

815
01:15:24,232 --> 01:15:26,262
You live on Search street
you keep making me search you...

816
01:15:26,342 --> 01:15:28,572
Look at you flinch.

817
01:15:28,642 --> 01:15:31,272
Stop pretending to be a blind!

818
01:15:31,342 --> 01:15:35,472
Children were all grown up
and I was Ionely...

819
01:15:35,552 --> 01:15:37,382
I didn't call you about that

820
01:15:38,252 --> 01:15:41,382
You saw someone on the way out
from the motel, didn't you?

821
01:15:41,452 --> 01:15:46,392
What? I didn't do
anything with him!

822
01:15:48,362 --> 01:15:49,882
You saw someone, didn't you?

823
01:15:50,862 --> 01:15:52,492
Yes, I did.

824
01:15:53,962 --> 01:15:55,292
Do you remember the face?

825
01:15:56,072 --> 01:15:59,902
I don't know...
I just glanced at him.

826
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,992
Mr. Lee might remember.

827
01:16:02,072 --> 01:16:03,202
Ma'am.

828
01:16:05,212 --> 01:16:07,642
Do you remember the man
we saw that day?

829
01:16:07,712 --> 01:16:11,042
This man...
from Shin-chon the other day...

830
01:16:12,522 --> 01:16:16,752
Come here!
He's the one right?

831
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,752
He looks like him.

832
01:16:20,422 --> 01:16:22,362
Come here, damn it.

833
01:16:22,432 --> 01:16:23,862
That's right.

834
01:16:29,232 --> 01:16:30,562
Detective Kang!

835
01:16:31,432 --> 01:16:33,162
Wait.
We're dealing with a case.

836
01:16:33,242 --> 01:16:35,572
Yes, I think that's him.

837
01:16:35,642 --> 01:16:38,162
- Hey, Stop!
- Detective Kang!

838
01:16:38,242 --> 01:16:39,472
Detective Kang!

839
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:42,072
What are you doing?
Get him!

840
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:54,292
Hey, Detective Kang!
I heard you're back.

841
01:16:58,362 --> 01:17:01,992
Hey, get him!
Up there, there!

842
01:17:03,872 --> 01:17:06,232
He went up.
I'll go down.

843
01:17:07,102 --> 01:17:08,832
Why are you arresting me?

844
01:17:08,912 --> 01:17:09,532
Come with us, Detective Kang

845
01:17:09,612 --> 01:17:11,732
Hey, up there...
Get him!

846
01:17:19,822 --> 01:17:22,252
Did you get him?

847
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:26,552
Yes, that's him.

848
01:17:26,622 --> 01:17:29,562
He's a detective, you fool.

849
01:17:29,632 --> 01:17:35,462
Really?
But he sure looks like him.

850
01:17:35,532 --> 01:17:37,162
Check one more time.
Are you sure?

851
01:17:37,232 --> 01:17:38,562
Hey!

852
01:17:40,242 --> 01:17:44,872
You lying bastard...
Did you see me at the motel?

853
01:17:44,942 --> 01:17:47,382
Maybe... I didn't...

854
01:17:47,442 --> 01:17:49,972
Are you sure?
Did you see me?

855
01:17:50,052 --> 01:17:52,672
- What're you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

856
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,982
Say it's not him.

857
01:17:55,052 --> 01:17:57,182
He must be the killer

858
01:17:57,252 --> 01:17:59,282
He panicked and
is making up stories.

859
01:17:59,362 --> 01:18:02,482
No, no! I made a mistake!

860
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:05,032
Right...
He had a mole under his nose.

861
01:18:05,092 --> 01:18:06,822
That's right!
A mole! Here, here!

862
01:18:06,902 --> 01:18:09,332
Are you sure?

863
01:18:09,402 --> 01:18:11,232
What's wrong with you?

864
01:18:13,002 --> 01:18:15,632
Why... do you have
something to hide?

865
01:18:17,312 --> 01:18:18,532
What did you say?

866
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:24,242
Don't over do it.

867
01:18:34,922 --> 01:18:37,152
I'm sure it's not him

868
01:18:37,232 --> 01:18:40,352
He had a mole under his eye.

869
01:18:40,432 --> 01:18:42,362
You said the mole
was on his chin!

870
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:44,962
He had a lot of them!

871
01:18:45,032 --> 01:18:47,372
Why does he keep
having more moles?

872
01:18:48,642 --> 01:18:50,072
Chickenpox... maybe?

873
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:54,872
I think...
you should let your wife go.

874
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:58,772
You're the guilty one here
Don't be difficult.

875
01:18:58,852 --> 01:19:01,182
Guilty? How so?

876
01:19:01,252 --> 01:19:02,982
Should I tell you?

877
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:06,222
Fuck, I told you
I really didn't do it then

878
01:19:06,292 --> 01:19:08,022
You really didn't do it then?

879
01:19:08,692 --> 01:19:11,222
You're saying you did it now?

880
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:13,422
No... I'm not saying that.

881
01:19:14,102 --> 01:19:16,332
You have something with
Kim Soo-jin, don't you?

882
01:19:18,602 --> 01:19:21,332
Right, right...
My bad feelings are always right.

883
01:19:21,402 --> 01:19:25,342
How can a detective
sleep with a victim?

884
01:19:25,412 --> 01:19:27,342
And her husband was murdered!

885
01:19:28,612 --> 01:19:31,742
Kim Soo-jin?
This one or that one?

886
01:19:31,812 --> 01:19:33,542
Which one? Damn...

887
01:19:33,622 --> 01:19:35,952
Do I look like I'm talking
about the dead one?

888
01:19:38,622 --> 01:19:42,852
Hey... I nailed it
didn't I?

889
01:19:44,232 --> 01:19:50,062
You...
and the widow... Right?

890
01:19:51,032 --> 01:19:53,972
Yes, I slept with Kim Soo-jin
Are you satisfied?

891
01:19:58,142 --> 01:20:02,082
Out of all men in the world...
I envy you the most.

892
01:20:02,752 --> 01:20:05,482
You...
the master of adultery...

893
01:20:06,152 --> 01:20:07,482
Fuck master...

894
01:20:07,952 --> 01:20:11,082
He's the fuck master.
Please say hello.

895
01:20:12,862 --> 01:20:15,092
Can we have a more
fucking meat here?

896
01:20:19,762 --> 01:20:25,702
Perfume...
It stared everything

897
01:20:25,772 --> 01:20:29,602
why the fuck are you talking
about perfume at a BBQ place?

898
01:20:30,872 --> 01:20:32,502
I lost my mind
because of her perfume.

899
01:20:32,582 --> 01:20:36,012
Hey, master, master!
Fuck master!

900
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:48,722
All men must be the same.

901
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:54,632
He remembered you.
Even your perfume.

902
01:20:55,902 --> 01:20:57,422
What are you talking about?

903
01:20:57,502 --> 01:20:59,022
The bike messenger.

904
01:21:01,902 --> 01:21:03,532
You killed your husband
didn't you?

905
01:21:04,642 --> 01:21:07,472
Yes, I killed him.

906
01:21:09,952 --> 01:21:13,072
What? What did you say?

907
01:21:20,462 --> 01:21:25,192
I don't care about the looks
or the age about my man.

908
01:21:30,472 --> 01:21:32,402
You completely fooled me.

909
01:21:32,872 --> 01:21:35,702
Doesn't it make you aroused?

910
01:21:36,172 --> 01:21:39,402
Swapping videos excite me

911
01:21:39,982 --> 01:21:42,412
I really want to try that.

912
01:21:50,992 --> 01:21:55,222
He had unique sexual
preferences.

913
01:22:02,402 --> 01:22:03,732
What's going on?

914
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,762
You know her, don't you?

915
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:12,172
I imagined about this at the gym.

916
01:22:12,242 --> 01:22:15,972
You watch me
having sex with her.

917
01:22:16,052 --> 01:22:17,382
You must be crazy.

918
01:22:17,452 --> 01:22:20,472
Once you watch it
you'll like it.

919
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:28,282
He tied me down and beat me
in front of that woman.

920
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:36,702
Honey.

921
01:22:39,472 --> 01:22:42,302
Soo-jin, soo-jin

922
01:22:44,372 --> 01:22:45,502
Soo-jin.

923
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,512
Soo-jin.

924
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:57,012
I wanted to kill both of them.

925
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:02,222
So I talked him into coming to
the motel telling him

926
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:05,762
I wanted to try it
again with her.

927
01:23:07,332 --> 01:23:09,162
That's why you killed them.

928
01:23:11,332 --> 01:23:13,362
Why did you bring me into this?

929
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:17,472
Don't assume anything.

930
01:23:18,142 --> 01:23:22,272
I don't know why you were with
Kim Soo-jin in the next room...

931
01:23:22,952 --> 01:23:26,382
And why she's... dead

932
01:23:29,352 --> 01:23:31,482
You expect me
to believe that lie?

933
01:23:32,762 --> 01:23:34,282
What if you don't?

934
01:23:38,562 --> 01:23:40,392
You played me all along.

935
01:23:42,972 --> 01:23:47,902
I'm sorry but it's not over.

936
01:23:50,372 --> 01:23:55,212
That day... Dead Kim Soo-jin
was naked in the room 302.

937
01:23:55,982 --> 01:23:58,212
Autopsy must have been finished

938
01:23:59,482 --> 01:24:02,612
Your remains will be found soon.

939
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:17,462
Kim Soo-jin... She died
while she was with you.

940
01:24:21,342 --> 01:24:24,472
I am the witness of that.

941
01:24:29,852 --> 01:24:31,972
Everything will be okay
if you catch the killer

942
01:24:33,352 --> 01:24:35,982
before the autopsy
results come out.

943
01:24:37,652 --> 01:24:41,782
Everything will be okay.

944
01:25:12,822 --> 01:25:14,552
Hey, it's me.

945
01:25:14,622 --> 01:25:17,752
Some magnesium carbonate was
detected from the knice.

946
01:25:17,832 --> 01:25:19,262
It's something gymnasts or

947
01:25:19,332 --> 01:25:21,462
weightlifters use to get
firm grip on their hands.

948
01:25:22,632 --> 01:25:26,662
Do they used that at the gym?

949
01:25:26,742 --> 01:25:29,672
It's possible for a trainer...

950
01:25:33,442 --> 01:25:34,882
Do you know this man?

951
01:25:38,052 --> 01:25:40,782
Yes, that's him!
This bastard kicked me!

952
01:25:41,652 --> 01:25:42,672
How about this man?

953
01:25:45,552 --> 01:25:47,182
He was his sidekick.

954
01:25:49,662 --> 01:25:50,892
Thank you.

955
01:25:52,362 --> 01:25:54,192
Trainer Lee is off today.

956
01:25:54,262 --> 01:25:56,392
Why don't you call him
on his cell?

957
01:25:56,472 --> 01:25:58,192
He's not answering the call.

958
01:25:58,272 --> 01:26:00,292
We don't know any other number.

959
01:26:00,372 --> 01:26:01,502
- Trainer Jung.
- Yes?

960
01:26:01,572 --> 01:26:03,602
Is Mr. Kwon here yet?

961
01:26:04,412 --> 01:26:06,532
He's scheduled for 2 o'clock
but he's not here yet.

962
01:26:06,612 --> 01:26:08,742
Let me know when he comes.

963
01:26:08,812 --> 01:26:12,752
Just give me one...
Just one...

964
01:26:15,722 --> 01:26:18,052
Central police station...
Speed violation

965
01:26:18,122 --> 01:26:20,752
September 18th, 03:18...

966
01:26:21,522 --> 01:26:23,352
Yang-pyung highway...

967
01:26:24,932 --> 01:26:27,052
Right on! I got you now!

968
01:26:31,832 --> 01:26:33,362
You punk...

969
01:26:38,142 --> 01:26:39,272
where are you going?

970
01:26:40,242 --> 01:26:41,872
This is your last chance
If you have a problem, tell me.

971
01:26:41,942 --> 01:26:43,172
So I can help you.

972
01:26:43,252 --> 01:26:44,972
The problem
is you can't help me.

973
01:26:45,052 --> 01:26:46,282
Detective Kang!

974
01:26:46,552 --> 01:26:49,282
- There you are.
- Yeah, why?

975
01:26:49,352 --> 01:26:51,382
I searched all the motels
based on the lighters

976
01:26:51,452 --> 01:26:53,082
from the private agency.

977
01:26:54,562 --> 01:26:57,792
The workers there remembered
your face clearly.

978
01:26:58,862 --> 01:27:00,292
Even Poong's.

979
01:27:01,762 --> 01:27:03,392
Please come with me.

980
01:27:08,402 --> 01:27:09,932
Detective Kang!

981
01:27:14,212 --> 01:27:15,732
Block the gate!

982
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:17,942
Tackle him!

983
01:27:21,522 --> 01:27:23,142
Detective Kang!

984
01:27:48,842 --> 01:27:50,572
Please come down.

985
01:27:53,652 --> 01:27:56,382
I said please come down.

986
01:28:03,662 --> 01:28:06,222
Okay...
So put the gun down.

987
01:28:06,302 --> 01:28:07,632
I don't want to do this.

988
01:28:07,702 --> 01:28:10,632
I... didn't do it.

989
01:28:11,302 --> 01:28:12,532
Get down.

990
01:28:12,602 --> 01:28:14,542
Get down?
I can't get down here.

991
01:28:14,602 --> 01:28:18,042
I will arrest the killer
and turn myself in!

992
01:28:18,112 --> 01:28:20,442
If you don't comply
I will fire

993
01:28:20,512 --> 01:28:21,442
Get down.

994
01:28:21,512 --> 01:28:24,542
I have to catch the killer
damn it!

995
01:28:24,612 --> 01:28:26,442
Please get down, now!

996
01:28:31,022 --> 01:28:35,152
- You...
- I didn't hit him hard...

997
01:28:36,332 --> 01:28:37,662
You came.

998
01:28:56,252 --> 01:29:01,182
You punk... where have you been?
What the fuck is this?

999
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:04,012
The horny runaway dog...
My side-job.

1000
01:29:05,192 --> 01:29:08,622
- How did you...
- Know where you were?

1001
01:29:08,692 --> 01:29:12,222
Since I was on the wanted list
I just followed you around.

1002
01:29:12,292 --> 01:29:13,922
That looked like
the safest thing to do.

1003
01:29:14,002 --> 01:29:15,622
And gives me an excuse
when I get caught.

1004
01:29:15,702 --> 01:29:19,932
So you followed the cops instead
of running away from them?

1005
01:29:21,002 --> 01:29:23,032
You're an a fool.

1006
01:29:24,912 --> 01:29:26,032
I'm not.

1007
01:29:26,112 --> 01:29:28,842
You selfish bastard
saving only your ass.

1008
01:29:31,912 --> 01:29:33,042
What are you doing to do now?

1009
01:29:33,122 --> 01:29:35,142
What else?
Must catch the killer.

1010
01:29:35,222 --> 01:29:39,352
I don't feel this time either.

1011
01:29:50,332 --> 01:29:51,362
Hello?

1012
01:29:52,232 --> 01:29:54,262
Lee Jin-kook's car
just left the gym.

1013
01:29:54,342 --> 01:29:56,362
I'll be right there!

1014
01:29:56,442 --> 01:29:58,872
Just hold on to him!

1015
01:30:08,552 --> 01:30:10,582
Hey, fuck!

1016
01:30:12,652 --> 01:30:14,382
Get up, asshole!

1017
01:30:15,962 --> 01:30:17,692
Asshole.

1018
01:30:17,762 --> 01:30:19,692
Just... wait a while.

1019
01:30:21,362 --> 01:30:24,092
Wait... Cramp...

1020
01:30:24,172 --> 01:30:27,192
why the fuck are you
doing this? You crazy fuck!

1021
01:30:27,272 --> 01:30:30,002
I've heard
a lot about you, sir.

1022
01:30:30,072 --> 01:30:32,202
You crazy fuck!

1023
01:30:34,382 --> 01:30:36,502
- Who the fuck are you?
- Not there...

1024
01:30:49,592 --> 01:30:51,422
Hey, Lee Jin-kook!

1025
01:31:12,052 --> 01:31:16,682
Dead Kim Soo-jin
requested Detective Kang

1026
01:31:17,252 --> 01:31:19,782
to arrest the scene of her
own adultery.

1027
01:31:20,862 --> 01:31:23,092
In order to black mail
your husband.

1028
01:31:23,162 --> 01:31:25,182
All she wanted was his money.

1029
01:31:37,172 --> 01:31:39,302
When everything was done,

1030
01:31:39,372 --> 01:31:42,002
she tried to blackmail
Detective Kang.

1031
01:31:42,082 --> 01:31:43,812
Then he got scared and

1032
01:31:43,882 --> 01:31:46,512
didn't want his relationship
with her to be exposed.

1033
01:31:47,282 --> 01:31:49,012
So he kills her.

1034
01:31:50,392 --> 01:31:54,322
But... the prime suspect for
your husband's murder is...

1035
01:31:54,392 --> 01:31:56,122
Detective Kang...

1036
01:31:59,392 --> 01:32:01,122
You sound affirmative.

1037
01:32:01,902 --> 01:32:05,262
Because I'm the witness.

1038
01:32:21,252 --> 01:32:22,772
You killed Kim Soo-jin
didn't you?

1039
01:32:25,452 --> 01:32:28,482
You must die
you son of a bitch!

1040
01:32:28,562 --> 01:32:31,192
- Kim Soo-jin...
- what?

1041
01:32:35,262 --> 01:32:37,392
She asked me to kill her.

1042
01:32:37,972 --> 01:32:40,992
Kim Soo-jin asked you
kill Kim Soo-jin?

1043
01:32:41,972 --> 01:32:43,492
What do you mean a witness?

1044
01:32:43,972 --> 01:32:46,602
I wanted to arrest the scene
of my husband's adultery.

1045
01:32:48,582 --> 01:32:50,412
But... when I stepped
into the motel

1046
01:32:51,382 --> 01:32:54,612
I saw two of them dead.

1047
01:32:56,492 --> 01:33:01,422
Of course, Detective Kang...
was right there.

1048
01:33:05,832 --> 01:33:09,262
Later, Soo-jin asked me
to Kill Nam

1049
01:33:09,332 --> 01:33:11,462
Promised me a big share.

1050
01:33:11,532 --> 01:33:13,262
That's how I joined in.

1051
01:33:18,742 --> 01:33:22,272
But after all, Nam's wife was
behind everything.

1052
01:33:22,342 --> 01:33:27,182
She asked Soo-jin to kill Nam
promising 30% of her inheritance.

1053
01:33:30,852 --> 01:33:31,982
Then?

1054
01:33:32,952 --> 01:33:35,482
Then Nam's wife came to see me.

1055
01:33:36,762 --> 01:33:41,992
She asked me to kill Soo-jin and
Nam for big sum of money.

1056
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:48,002
What about me?
Why was I dragged into this?

1057
01:33:50,072 --> 01:33:54,912
I don't know about you.
Ask Nam's wife about it.

1058
01:33:55,382 --> 01:33:59,912
You mean... I was completely
played by her.

1059
01:34:05,422 --> 01:34:09,152
If so, why didn't
Detective Kang kill you?

1060
01:34:09,932 --> 01:34:13,762
He knew...
about my inheritance.

1061
01:34:18,032 --> 01:34:20,562
So he kept calling
to threaten you?

1062
01:34:21,542 --> 01:34:22,662
Yes.

1063
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:28,972
And he was not
the only one at the scene.

1064
01:34:29,042 --> 01:34:31,672
- Poong!
- No...

1065
01:34:33,552 --> 01:34:34,782
Lee Jin-kook.

1066
01:34:41,962 --> 01:34:43,582
Now you know?

1067
01:34:45,962 --> 01:34:49,492
She played you good
you dumb ass!

1068
01:35:18,932 --> 01:35:20,262
Hye-young...

1069
01:35:28,642 --> 01:35:30,762
I said I didn't feel good
this time either.

1070
01:35:33,142 --> 01:35:35,172
But he just won't listen.

1071
01:35:38,152 --> 01:35:41,082
- Is that what she said?
- Yes.

1072
01:35:42,852 --> 01:35:45,482
That story will sell good.
Even I'd believe it.

1073
01:35:48,562 --> 01:35:52,292
Why did you do it?
Did you kill about of lust?

1074
01:35:52,362 --> 01:35:53,992
You liked Kim Soo-jin
that much?

1075
01:35:54,062 --> 01:35:56,902
I didn't do it!
It's not me!

1076
01:35:56,972 --> 01:35:59,402
Yes, Chief.
Although he's obsessed women

1077
01:35:59,472 --> 01:36:01,902
he won't go around
killing people.

1078
01:36:03,172 --> 01:36:06,142
We have evidences and even
testimonial from Kim Soo-jin.

1079
01:36:06,212 --> 01:36:08,332
Where is she?
Tell her to come out.

1080
01:36:08,412 --> 01:36:10,942
The victim doesn't want
to see you now.

1081
01:36:11,012 --> 01:36:12,342
What? A victim?

1082
01:36:12,412 --> 01:36:14,752
If she's victim
am I a criminal?

1083
01:36:15,922 --> 01:36:18,042
Bring back Lee Jin-kook!

1084
01:36:18,122 --> 01:36:21,152
He's was the only one
who knew the truth.

1085
01:36:21,222 --> 01:36:23,452
That's enough
Detective Kang!

1086
01:36:24,132 --> 01:36:25,462
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1087
01:36:25,532 --> 01:36:27,152
You are a policeman
for god's sake.

1088
01:36:27,232 --> 01:36:28,752
What the fuck did you say?

1089
01:36:31,132 --> 01:36:33,362
Let go!

1090
01:36:46,252 --> 01:36:49,582
Kim Soo-jin!
Hey, Kim Soo-jin!

1091
01:37:09,302 --> 01:37:10,832
Ms. Kim.

1092
01:37:17,712 --> 01:37:19,242
Let me ask you one question.

1093
01:37:20,022 --> 01:37:23,352
Detective Kang claims
that everything was

1094
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:25,752
done by you and Lee Jin-kook.

1095
01:37:27,722 --> 01:37:28,852
So?

1096
01:37:30,832 --> 01:37:32,162
Please forgive us.

1097
01:37:32,232 --> 01:37:35,562
Detective Kang is her husband.

1098
01:37:36,032 --> 01:37:39,662
I don't know what to say...
about your husband.

1099
01:37:40,342 --> 01:37:42,962
- Chief!
- What now?

1100
01:37:43,042 --> 01:37:46,972
The autopsy results for
Kim Soo-jin just came in.

1101
01:37:48,142 --> 01:37:50,482
They found no sign of sperm.

1102
01:37:50,552 --> 01:37:52,782
Did he ejaculate outside?

1103
01:38:13,902 --> 01:38:16,342
You know everything
why don't you say anything?

1104
01:38:17,712 --> 01:38:19,542
Tell them you're innocent?

1105
01:38:21,012 --> 01:38:22,642
Yes, innocent!

1106
01:38:22,712 --> 01:38:25,652
Then the corpses buried
themselves? You crazy fool!

1107
01:38:27,622 --> 01:38:30,142
Do you think
they'll belive what I say?

1108
01:38:36,222 --> 01:38:40,462
Let me go... Please...

1109
01:38:40,532 --> 01:38:41,762
what?

1110
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:43,762
I must catch her myself.

1111
01:38:44,932 --> 01:38:47,062
That's the only way
to get out this.

1112
01:39:05,392 --> 01:39:07,412
Catch her and
turn back everything.

1113
01:39:12,092 --> 01:39:13,922
You can just leave like that!

1114
01:39:15,402 --> 01:39:16,622
Hit me.

1115
01:39:26,212 --> 01:39:27,142
Chief!

1116
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:29,842
I will kill him this time!

1117
01:39:30,412 --> 01:39:31,942
We haven't confirmed
he's the killer yet.

1118
01:39:32,012 --> 01:39:35,242
I just bought a new car on
36 months installments.

1119
01:39:35,322 --> 01:39:37,342
Then what?
A paycut for 3 months?

1120
01:39:37,422 --> 01:39:38,942
I will bury him today

1121
01:39:39,022 --> 01:39:41,962
and proudly turn myself in!

1122
01:39:42,722 --> 01:39:45,062
- No, Chief!
- He's not even human.

1123
01:39:49,332 --> 01:39:52,562
- I'm sorry. Don't move.
- Don't move!

1124
01:39:53,432 --> 01:39:54,872
- Chief...
- what?

1125
01:39:54,942 --> 01:39:56,372
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

1126
01:39:56,442 --> 01:39:57,872
Give me your car keys.

1127
01:39:58,342 --> 01:40:00,862
- Give him your car keys.
- Give him yours!

1128
01:40:00,942 --> 01:40:03,272
No, no!

1129
01:40:03,342 --> 01:40:05,972
I just bought mine
on 36 months installments.

1130
01:40:06,052 --> 01:40:08,172
Hey, pal... Take it!

1131
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,772
No, you can't... No!

1132
01:40:11,552 --> 01:40:13,492
Is your car more valuable
than your life?

1133
01:40:15,362 --> 01:40:16,582
Hey, no!

1134
01:40:17,562 --> 01:40:20,792
- I'm sorry. Get down.
- Get down, everyone!

1135
01:40:20,862 --> 01:40:22,592
- Hey, pal...
- what?

1136
01:40:22,662 --> 01:40:24,102
- Get down
- Get down...

1137
01:40:24,772 --> 01:40:25,792
Get down, Chief

1138
01:40:25,872 --> 01:40:28,202
- Me too?
- Yes

1139
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:31,402
Please, drive carefully!

1140
01:40:31,472 --> 01:40:35,702
Get down... I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...

1141
01:40:40,382 --> 01:40:41,912
what are you doing?
Get him!

1142
01:40:57,102 --> 01:41:00,532
Hey, hey! Get him!

1143
01:41:02,302 --> 01:41:04,462
No, no! Get it out of the way!
Stop the car!

1144
01:41:17,052 --> 01:41:20,082
I'll go with you!

1145
01:41:22,862 --> 01:41:25,492
Black sedan... is heading toward
Nakwon market from Insa-dong...

1146
01:41:36,572 --> 01:41:40,602
Hey, be careful! You'll kill
us before we catch him!

1147
01:42:00,802 --> 01:42:02,022
Out of the way!

1148
01:42:26,852 --> 01:42:28,582
What are you doing?

1149
01:42:29,462 --> 01:42:31,292
You weirdo...

1150
01:42:39,172 --> 01:42:40,902
what the fuck?

1151
01:43:05,932 --> 01:43:07,552
Move out!
Why follow me?

1152
01:43:30,252 --> 01:43:31,982
Here he is!

1153
01:43:38,962 --> 01:43:40,292
Get him! Stop!

1154
01:43:55,982 --> 01:43:59,712
A package came for you,
ma'am.

1155
01:44:04,522 --> 01:44:07,962
Why are you getting a taxi?
We don't know where he went.

1156
01:44:08,022 --> 01:44:10,052
He must be going to
see Kim Soo-jin.

1157
01:44:10,122 --> 01:44:12,462
- Why?
- What else?

1158
01:44:12,532 --> 01:44:15,262
It's either he's going to kill
her or run away with her.

1159
01:44:16,032 --> 01:44:17,662
Taxi!

1160
01:44:20,032 --> 01:44:22,162
- I'll pay you double the meter!
- Haggling is illegal.

1161
01:44:22,242 --> 01:44:23,462
Just get it.

1162
01:44:42,662 --> 01:44:47,692
Ms. Kim, why did you
send me the DVD?

1163
01:44:48,162 --> 01:44:50,792
It's a thank you
note to Detective Kang.

1164
01:44:50,872 --> 01:44:52,492
What?

1165
01:44:52,572 --> 01:44:55,702
Detective Kang...
he's a good man.

1166
01:45:00,482 --> 01:45:02,912
If you leave this time
stay gone

1167
01:45:03,982 --> 01:45:05,842
Don't ever come back!

1168
01:45:09,222 --> 01:45:13,242
You're telling me to get
away from your husband?

1169
01:45:14,422 --> 01:45:16,862
Stay away from him forever...

1170
01:45:22,332 --> 01:45:24,162
Are you finished?

1171
01:45:25,732 --> 01:45:27,562
Let me ask you a last question.

1172
01:45:32,742 --> 01:45:36,272
Did you...
sleep with my husband?

1173
01:46:10,512 --> 01:46:11,842
Detective Kang!

1174
01:46:12,512 --> 01:46:15,242
You took my car
knowing it's a new one.

1175
01:46:15,322 --> 01:46:16,842
You were careful, right?

1176
01:46:17,522 --> 01:46:19,852
What are you doing?
Get him.

1177
01:46:23,122 --> 01:46:26,652
I'm exhausted...
Let me have a break.

1178
01:46:26,732 --> 01:46:28,352
Where is Kim Soo-jin?

1179
01:46:32,432 --> 01:46:34,372
Coffee is cold.

1180
01:46:40,542 --> 01:46:43,572
This DVD is delivered
to your wife.

1181
01:46:44,852 --> 01:46:46,472
Who sent it?

1182
01:46:46,552 --> 01:46:48,572
This is how they died...

1183
01:46:51,352 --> 01:46:59,282
I also wonder who saved
this poor detective's life.

1184
01:47:01,162 --> 01:47:04,832
Haven't you done enough?
It's must be Kim Soo-jin!

1185
01:47:04,902 --> 01:47:06,632
If you know so well
ask her yourself.

1186
01:47:06,702 --> 01:47:08,642
Don't torture me.

1187
01:47:09,402 --> 01:47:12,342
Okay, the day before she
disappeared all the money

1188
01:47:13,312 --> 01:47:14,432
from Nam's account

1189
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:16,842
was withdrawn to
a borrowed-name account.

1190
01:47:17,612 --> 01:47:19,642
And all his stocks
were sold off.

1191
01:47:21,922 --> 01:47:24,042
I'll ask you
for the last time.

1192
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:26,652
Where is she?

1193
01:47:33,932 --> 01:47:37,962
You came? I didn't
think I could see you.

1194
01:47:39,732 --> 01:47:41,962
Put everything
the way they were!

1195
01:47:46,542 --> 01:47:49,372
I sent the DVD which contains
the truth of the murder...

1196
01:47:49,442 --> 01:47:51,382
to your wife.

1197
01:47:52,252 --> 01:47:54,982
Except the part you're
cleaning out the corpses.

1198
01:47:56,252 --> 01:47:57,382
What?

1199
01:48:00,552 --> 01:48:01,892
Why now?

1200
01:48:02,862 --> 01:48:07,732
You were the only man
who honestly took care of me.

1201
01:48:21,812 --> 01:48:24,042
I must disappear to make
all the evidences

1202
01:48:24,112 --> 01:48:27,442
that are against you disappear.

1203
01:48:33,222 --> 01:48:34,852
Do you want to come with me?

1204
01:48:51,142 --> 01:48:53,162
I'll answer for the last time.

1205
01:48:54,942 --> 01:48:56,382
If I knew it... would I be here?

1206
01:48:56,442 --> 01:48:57,972
I'd arrest her myself.

1207
01:48:58,052 --> 01:49:00,882
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
A detective being manipulated...

1208
01:49:00,952 --> 01:49:03,882
Yes, I am.
So I'm quitting.

1209
01:49:05,492 --> 01:49:08,422
I hope you remain as a honorable
and beautiful detective.

1210
01:49:11,492 --> 01:49:12,932
I'm sure you know,

1211
01:49:14,202 --> 01:49:16,432
you'll probably get out
on lack of evidence.

1212
01:49:16,502 --> 01:49:21,032
Is that right?
I love this legal system!

1213
01:49:21,802 --> 01:49:25,032
But you'll stay in jail
until the results come out.

1214
01:49:26,112 --> 01:49:27,132
That's the law.

1215
01:49:27,212 --> 01:49:30,542
I don't like this legal system.

1216
01:49:32,412 --> 01:49:37,352
I hope you think about what you've
done wrong while you're there.

1217
01:49:39,122 --> 01:49:42,352
- Take care of yourself.
- Yes, sir.

1218
01:49:44,632 --> 01:49:46,562
- Take him out.
- Hey,

1219
01:49:47,132 --> 01:49:50,362
he's still a detective
So no cuffing.

1220
01:49:53,532 --> 01:49:58,472
- No, cuff him.
- Stubborn bastard...

1221
01:49:58,542 --> 01:50:02,672
I've never seen
a stubborn bastard like him.

1222
01:50:02,742 --> 01:50:05,682
Are you happy cuffing
a detective?

1223
01:50:05,752 --> 01:50:07,872
I want to pierce those
handcuffs on your tongue.

1224
01:50:22,262 --> 01:50:23,892
What are you here for?

1225
01:50:28,572 --> 01:50:33,602
Hey, what are you here for
you son of a bitch!

1226
01:50:34,682 --> 01:50:35,802
Serial...

1227
01:50:39,282 --> 01:50:40,512
Adultery.

1228
01:50:56,602 --> 01:51:00,622
The air is so fresh out here.
Let's walk.

1229
01:51:09,842 --> 01:51:12,972
I feel good this time.
Please go see her.

1230
01:51:20,652 --> 01:51:22,092
What's that look about?

1231
01:51:23,162 --> 01:51:25,182
I didn't think you'd come...

1232
01:51:26,862 --> 01:51:29,092
No matter what...
we've been married for 10 years.

1233
01:51:30,262 --> 01:51:32,992
You're right.
We haven't signed the papers.

1234
01:51:36,372 --> 01:51:39,812
What is this? Tofu?
I'll be stuffed.

1235
01:51:40,882 --> 01:51:44,212
So I saw you.
I gotta go.

1236
01:51:44,282 --> 01:51:45,712
You're going already?

1237
01:51:46,382 --> 01:51:48,712
You know how busy the cops are.

1238
01:51:51,892 --> 01:51:53,012
Hye-young...

1239
01:51:56,792 --> 01:52:00,522
I'm sorry...
and thank you.

1240
01:52:09,842 --> 01:52:12,772
1 year later

1241
01:52:12,842 --> 01:52:15,372
My husband is having an affair.

1242
01:52:25,952 --> 01:52:28,292
Why was young werther sad?

1243
01:52:28,362 --> 01:52:30,882
Because he liked
his friend's wife.

1244
01:52:30,962 --> 01:52:32,692
Why was sad werther...

1245
01:52:38,872 --> 01:52:40,602
He's new at this.

1246
01:52:43,672 --> 01:52:45,202
What brought you here?

1247
01:52:45,672 --> 01:52:47,112
Your husband is having
an affair, isn't he?

1248
01:52:47,882 --> 01:52:50,112
Ah, before that...
You name is?

1249
01:52:50,182 --> 01:52:53,612
It's Soo-jin...
Kim Soo-jin...

1250
01:52:53,682 --> 01:52:57,812
Kim Soo... Kim Soo-jin?

1251
01:53:19,342 --> 01:53:23,172
- Hello?
- Kim Soo-jin?

1252
01:53:24,042 --> 01:53:25,882
You didn't forget my voice.

1253
01:53:28,552 --> 01:53:30,572
How can I forget?

1254
01:53:31,852 --> 01:53:35,882
If I said I was sorry
would you believe me?

1255
01:53:36,462 --> 01:53:38,392
Don't say that.
It's not like you.

1256
01:53:39,962 --> 01:53:42,902
I have one question.

1257
01:53:43,962 --> 01:53:45,902
Why did you choose me?

1258
01:53:46,372 --> 01:53:47,802
Why?

1259
01:53:48,672 --> 01:53:53,702
A detective very
particular about adultery...

1260
01:53:53,772 --> 01:53:56,212
You were under
suspension for that

1261
01:54:06,022 --> 01:54:09,152
Just as I expected,

1262
01:54:09,222 --> 01:54:12,162
you acted like a professional
trying to get of the mess

1263
01:54:12,232 --> 01:54:14,352
You cleaned the murder
scene perfectly...

1264
01:54:15,232 --> 01:54:17,252
and buried the bodies perfectly.

1265
01:54:19,932 --> 01:54:24,372
I think my cut is too small
for all the work I do.

1266
01:54:24,442 --> 01:54:29,272
Give me 10 billion won,
then I'll disappear from Korea.

1267
01:54:29,342 --> 01:54:31,572
I don't know what I'll do.
If you don't,

1268
01:54:31,652 --> 01:54:34,082
So you protected me
from Lee Jin-kook

1269
01:54:34,152 --> 01:54:38,882
who'd kill
his girlfriend for money.

1270
01:54:39,352 --> 01:54:41,582
You thought you're watching me...

1271
01:54:42,362 --> 01:54:44,382
But you were
actually watching him.

1272
01:54:45,862 --> 01:54:47,882
I'll be damned...

1273
01:54:47,962 --> 01:54:51,192
I have a question too

1274
01:54:51,272 --> 01:54:54,892
why did you help me?

1275
01:54:55,972 --> 01:54:59,102
Was it out of pity?

1276
01:54:59,172 --> 01:55:04,242
You... are a attractive woman
Very difficult to resist.

1277
01:55:04,312 --> 01:55:06,842
Then why did you not take me?

1278
01:55:06,912 --> 01:55:09,852
You were the first man
to do that.

1279
01:55:11,522 --> 01:55:14,542
Because I have a loving family...

1280
01:55:14,622 --> 01:55:17,252
It's true I was attract to you

1281
01:55:17,322 --> 01:55:20,562
but "No Adultery"
is a rule that I live by.

1282
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:24,259
