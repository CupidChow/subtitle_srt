1
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:15,163
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

2
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,319
What's going on?

3
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:33,772
How unfair of him.

4
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:36,769
How could he do this?
How could he leave without a word?

5
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,778
Choi Hee Jin. What is this? A letter?

6
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:53,745
What does this say?

7
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,247
Central what?

8
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:27,914
Nam... something, something.

9
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:32,325
Three... something, something, something.

10
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:35,078
Seriously, is he testing me or what?

11
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:38,962
If he's going to write me a letter,
he should think of me and write Korean.

12
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:41,498
Don't you even know how to write
using the modern writing?

13
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:52,358
What's this?

14
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:00,795
<i>Am I doing all right riding this?</i>

15
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:04,098
You're doing well
for only trying a couple hours.

16
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:06,225
Young people sure are different.

17
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:17,807
Are you finally awake?

18
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,418
Oh! You're going to fall.

19
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:24,906
Are you okay?

20
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,018
Oh no.

21
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,972
Where did you get the bicycle?

22
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:31,213
I borrowed it from the homeowner.

23
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:33,723
You were not waking up.
I was bored, so I wanted to learn this.

24
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,223
I tend to sleep in a lot.

25
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:40,227
I thought you had left me a letter
and left.

26
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:41,227
Letter?

27
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:43,318
Why did you write this letter if you
were still here?

28
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:46,389
That's not a letter.
It's your home address.

29
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:47,947
I wrote it down in case I forgot.

30
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:52,914
Seoul Central, Namchang-dong #32.
Woorim #302.

31
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:55,157
Oh.

32
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:57,586
You can't even read your address?

33
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,580
You are much more ignorant than I...

34
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,090
It's your first time riding a bike.
Why don't you stop showing off?

35
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,629
Do you think there's any man your age
who doesn't know how to ride a bike?

36
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:10,438
Aren't you hungry?

37
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,646
I'm about to pass out from hunger
because I waited for you.

38
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,199
Why didn't you wake me up?

39
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,819
Tell me what you want to eat.
I will buy it.

40
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,430
Where are you going?
Wait! I'll wash up.

41
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,709
I can go by myself.

42
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,589
I have to go. You don't have money.

43
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:27,622
Money?

44
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:35,944
I am so overflowing with money
that I have no place to put it.

45
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:37,963
When did you sell it again?

46
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,692
It was hard the first time.
It was easy the second time.

47
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,932
Wow, this thing...

48
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,132
It's a royal gift given by Taejo
Yi Seong Gye.

49
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,562
That's correct.

50
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:51,535
It is a gift that my ancestor personally
received from King Taejo.

51
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:57,459
How could a sword from the early Joseon
era be in such excellent condition?

52
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,482
We kept it well-protected.

53
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:01,940
- How much can I get?
- Oh?

54
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:14,723
Even if it's in good condition,
I can't give you more than this.

55
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,971
Are you playing around here?

56
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:29,161
During my second time around,
I developed some skills and got more.

57
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,862
I think I could get more
if I sold it a third time.

58
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:35,901
I thought about buying you another car.

59
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,028
You already have one,
so that seems wrong.

60
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:40,329
I don't need it.

61
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:45,076
A car that could disappear one day,
I'd be too worried to ride it.

62
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:49,148
I'll just remember the sentiment.

63
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:54,858
Regardless, I don't know what tastes
good so tell me.

64
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:58,918
Then, get some milk and juice.

65
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,454
No, hold on a bit.

66
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:13,387
Who is he kidding?
Who is he calling ignorant?

67
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:24,298
Go to the market
and buy what is written there.

68
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:29,007
You won't know even if you look at it.
Why are you looking at it?

69
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:32,437
Ah, it's this thing called English.

70
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:35,026
English is much more widely used
than Hanja.

71
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,279
Don't put too much effort
into reading it.

72
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,262
Just give it to the employees.

73
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,644
I will buy them.

74
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:50,821
I am really worried getting someone
who doesn't know the alphabet to go.

75
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:57,571
Be careful on your bicycle.
You'll fall on the ground.

76
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:05,002
Oh, I guess a foreigner wrote this.

77
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:09,550
It was not a foreigner,
but someone with useless pride.

78
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:12,548
One orange juice.

79
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,011
What is this?

80
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:16,728
This is curry, right?

81
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,362
It's spelled wrong, so...

82
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,793
It should be spelled C-U-R-R-Y.

83
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,490
It was spelled C-A-R-R-E.

84
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:26,521
That's why.

85
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:32,012
As long as you understand it.

86
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:34,192
Just give me what you think it is.

87
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,096
Three minutes.

88
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,668
You only have three minutes left.

89
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:47,218
You have three minutes left
before we separate forever.

90
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,319
If you don't want to regret it forever

91
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,620
call me right this moment,
right now.

92
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,975
Call me right now.

93
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:01,026
She always did have good sense.

94
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,536
Where are you?

95
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:09,348
Do you really want to die,
you rotten wench?

96
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:10,976
I'm sorry I called late.

97
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:13,228
How about Dong Min?
Did he get home without incident?

98
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:16,519
Did he get home without incident?

99
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,053
What's going on?

100
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,973
Hey, where are you going?
Take your clothes.

101
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:40,408
Do you think there
would've been an incident or not?

102
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:44,393
Can you even ask me that question,
you rotten girl?

103
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:45,735
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,956
But, I couldn't lie to him when he was
sitting right in front of me.

105
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:50,683
I thought that would
be wronging him more.

106
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:58,759
I'm sorry. I really am...

107
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,259
He thinks I knew you were cheating and
made up a story about psychiatric issues.

108
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,437
He was totally attacking me.

109
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:08,259
What did I even do wrong?

110
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,028
Where are you?

111
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,461
Paju.

112
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:20,791
Then... did you just spend the night
with your crazy fan?

113
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,725
He's not a crazy fan.

114
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,759
Seriously, what are you planning to do?

115
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,389
You told me you would be on my side
if he was a real person.

116
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:32,402
What?

117
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:34,312
You saw that he's a real person.

118
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:39,464
So, even if everyone curses us,
you have to be on my side, okay?

119
00:09:39,464 --> 00:09:41,264
You are spewing a lot of crap.

120
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,393
- What...
- I'll talk to you later at home.

121
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,644
Hello? Hello...

122
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:50,107
This wench is writing fiction.

123
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:53,128
When did I say I would take her side?

124
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:55,014
When? When...

125
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,961
<i>I'd rather you really cheated on him.</i>

126
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:01,797
I'll try to understand if you cheat
with a man named Kim Boong Do.

127
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:06,269
If he was a man that was really here,
why would I do this to you?

128
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,658
If you have a man that you like,
I would definitely be on your side.

129
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:13,976
I did.

130
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:16,659
Oh dear.

131
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,971
Why did I say such a thing?

132
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,610
My mouth is the problem.

133
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:29,710
I don't know if I bought the right thing.

134
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:31,928
Let me see.

135
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:35,046
Okay.

136
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:37,869
Milk.

137
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:39,738
Juice.

138
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,014
Curry.

139
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:45,726
So, you did want curry?

140
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,017
- Yes, curry.
- Okay.

141
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,105
So, it was curry.

142
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:54,339
I don't know English at all,
so I didn't know.

143
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,130
You were scared
because you didn't know English.

144
00:10:57,682 --> 00:11:00,352
Curry is correct. You did well.

145
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,003
Sit down. I'll cook for you.

146
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,565
I think you'll be shocked
at how good it is.

147
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:12,224
This is usually something I only eat
once a year on birthdays.

148
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:14,350
I'm making it specially for you today.

149
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,806
The cooking time is very short for this,
so you might think it's not much.

150
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,765
It is actually a very difficult recipe
that uses advanced technology.

151
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,964
<i>(Today's Menu - Curry Rice)</i>

152
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:29,524
First, opening the bag.

153
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,798
It is important to open it
right on the line.

154
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:37,908
You see the place to open it, right?

155
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:40,143
You have to open it right on this line.

156
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:43,856
If you are a little bit off,
you will ruin everything.

157
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,248
Once you open this curry,
you then pour the curry on the rice.

158
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,743
Like this, in a pretty way.

159
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:00,563
Very thoroughly.

160
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,775
Third, putting on the wrap.

161
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:05,913
This is something most housewives
can't even attempt.

162
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:14,409
Okay, the last step.

163
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:16,822
Put it in the microwave
and turn it on for three minutes.

164
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:22,440
Two minutes and 50 seconds won't do.
Three minutes and ten seconds won't do.

165
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,548
Exactly three minutes.

166
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:25,419
It is vital to leave it in
for three minutes.

167
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:27,852
Oh! It's turning.

168
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,551
Now, with that...

169
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:59,642
the food of all foods,
curry rice, is now complete.

170
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,090
Oh, I'm so tired.

171
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:09,974
You don't need thank me too much.
Just enjoy your food.

172
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,764
Wow.

173
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:15,256
You are scam me too much because
I don't know the ways of the world.

174
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:19,225
Oh, what are you saying? What scam?

175
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,096
It's been several months
since I first arrived.

176
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:22,797
How dare you?

177
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:30,929
Okay.

178
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:35,749
Oh, but what did you do this morning?

179
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:36,850
What do you mean?

180
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,380
You were standing in front of the door
all dressed.

181
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,028
You were, right? What were you doing?

182
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,687
Are you sure you weren't dreaming?

183
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:45,471
I wasn't dreaming.

184
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,600
Didn't you go somewhere
early this morning?

185
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:52,729
I am grateful to eat it,
but I'm not sure about the taste.

186
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,625
Dong Min.

187
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:03,765
We don't have time.
We're on in five minutes.

188
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,855
Are you back from showing off
your couple status?

189
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:10,916
You seemed excited
at the awards ceremony.

190
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:14,433
Hey, buy me drinks when we're done.

191
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:15,857
Buy you what?

192
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:17,995
How ridiculous.

193
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:22,625
Why would you ask me to buy you drinks
instead of the opposite?

194
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,381
What kind of scandal are you going to
create to make problems for me?

195
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,761
You can't just go home, okay?

196
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:33,500
Oh, Dong Min.
You weren't late last night, right?

197
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,936
Sorry for ending things so late.

198
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:36,115
It was fine.

199
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,745
By the way, Director.

200
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:42,394
I have a good idea.

201
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:46,082
How about we kill Queen In Hyun
by feeding her poison?

202
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,876
I think it could become a big issue.

203
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:52,150
I didn't tell him to say it, Director.

204
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,422
Don't get the wrong idea.

205
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:56,047
Yes, it was my idea.

206
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,792
What do you think?

207
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:58,994
Why would we kill Queen In Hyun?

208
00:14:58,994 --> 00:15:01,462
Because he's tired of her.

209
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:03,168
Because he can't stand seeing her.

210
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,239
If he kills her because he's tired
of her, he's a psycho, not a king.

211
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,120
If you want to think of it like that,
Sukjong is a psycho.

212
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,062
He killed Jang Heebin
because he is a psycho.

213
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:14,761
He'll kill either one of them.

214
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:17,837
I'm saying we should make it new
and kill Queen In Hyun.

215
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:21,543
Fusion is much better received,
Director.

216
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:24,489
Director, Director, Director, Director!

217
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:29,663
He doesn't listen
even when I give him good ideas.

218
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,933
I better go talk to the writer.

219
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:33,977
Did you two fight?

220
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:39,162
What is this? For real?

221
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:41,993
It hasn't even been a day
since that show at the awards ceremony.

222
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:47,384
You have to buy me drinks.

223
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,869
Where do you get off throwing a tantrum?

224
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,259
They can hear you outside.

225
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:18,188
I just can't film feeling like this.
Tell them to film another scene.

226
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,058
Hey, man.

227
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:21,548
I can't do it.

228
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:31,508
I just remembered
that you forgot one thing.

229
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:34,418
You didn't buy the coffee mix
even though I wrote it down.

230
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:36,038
I didn't buy it on purpose.

231
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,294
Why? I need my coffee.

232
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:41,092
Let's go out to drink some, since I've
learned how to ride this bike.

233
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:44,092
You want to take me out on this?

234
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:46,969
The scenery was very nice
when I headed out earlier.

235
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:51,176
How can a total beginner
take a girl on his bike?

236
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,679
Aren't you overestimating yourself?

237
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:57,279
I sweated all morning learning
just to give that girl a ride.

238
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,336
Get on.

239
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:12,519
But, if we happen to fall,
let's take care of our own selves.

240
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,281
How can you say something
so irresponsible?

241
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:17,928
Hold on tight.

242
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:05,910
You really do learn everything quickly.

243
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,981
I will admit that.

244
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,688
I told you that is my one strength.

245
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:17,951
You wouldn't starve
even if you lived here.

246
00:18:17,951 --> 00:18:19,471
I think you'll make it.

247
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:21,381
Do you enjoy teaching?

248
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:23,790
How about teaching ancient Chinese?

249
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,476
Or, you could teach horseback riding
since you ride well.

250
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,251
No, you can actually live unemployed.

251
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,071
You can get money whenever you want.

252
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,314
You wouldn't ever have to work
if you sell your heirlooms.

253
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,790
What an envious life.

254
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:44,482
Do you think so?

255
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:49,213
Is it much more fun here than there?

256
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,314
Honestly, it is. Right?

257
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:52,734
I don't know.

258
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:59,651
Being a government official in that time

259
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:03,670
it's all about fights between factions
and you don't know when you might die.

260
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,912
Suppose things worked out and
you became a minister of a province

261
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:09,049
Medicine isn't well developed there,
so you'll die early.

262
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:13,461
What's so great about it?
Don't you think?

263
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:17,881
Well, I guess so.

264
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:26,753
Wait! I have the talisman.

265
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,792
If I throw this right in there,
you'll be stuck here forever.

266
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:40,288
Should I throw it in there?

267
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:41,540
What do you think?

268
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,663
Oh? Your silence is a yes.

269
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:49,478
I'm really going to throw it.
I really am.

270
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,925
What did you do?

271
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,211
I said I would throw it.

272
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:01,911
Look at you getting scared.

273
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:18,267
You must be really scared.

274
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,025
About not being able to go back.

275
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,960
You know I don't think things through.

276
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,519
I really might burn it up,
so take it back.

277
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:21,790
Why is he calling?

278
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,231
Hold on.

279
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,363
It's me, Choi Hee Jin.
You called me.

280
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:30,691
<i>Yes, I couldn't get in touch
with Soo Kyung.</i>

281
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,310
<i>I got in touch with her though.</i>

282
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,064
Okay, but what was it about?

283
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:36,894
What?

284
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,066
<i>The filming schedule has been
completely changed.</i>

285
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,266
<i>You can come on set tonight, right?</i>

286
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:45,955
Well, yes I can if you need me to.

287
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:48,167
But, why was it changed?

288
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,605
<i>Dong Min was suddenly
admitted into the hospital.</i>

289
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:53,384
Admitted to the hospital?
Why? Is he sick?

290
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:11,900
Did you hear?

291
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,445
You see the results
of what you did yesterday?

292
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:18,425
Did he really go in with stomach cramps
from stress because of me?

293
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:20,238
No, no.

294
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,925
I'm one hundred percent sure it's a
fake illness.

295
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,358
Why would he do that?
He should talk to me about it.

296
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:28,047
Why would he skip out on filming?

297
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:32,295
Apparently, he asked the director to
poison Queen In Hyun.

298
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:33,769
He said he can't stand to look at her.

299
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,422
What?

300
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,288
The point is this.

301
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:41,165
Dong Min's feelings are completely
twisted right now.

302
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:44,498
He's allowed to dump people,
but can't stand to be dumped.

303
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:47,055
We don't know what he will do in
the future.

304
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:52,507
What are you going to do?

305
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:54,838
The director must've noticed because
he asked to see me.

306
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:57,433
I'm on my way to see the director.

307
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:04,223
I better go to the hospital.
Which hospital is it?

308
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:21,317
What can I do?
I don't think I can go for coffee.

309
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,782
Is he saying he's sick?

310
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:24,893
Did you hear everything?

311
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:27,163
It seems like he's faking it to me.

312
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:28,442
Do you really have to go?

313
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:31,471
Whether he's faking it or not,
he says he's sick, so I should go.

314
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:34,480
It's true that I was the one who caused
the reason for a possible illness.

315
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:37,940
He doesn't seem like someone
who would get sick over that.

316
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:42,291
Oh, how do you know that he would
get over that or not?

317
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:46,380
I think you're getting jealous
that I'm going to visit him.

318
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:48,625
I don't think so.

319
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:52,634
You are getting jealous.
It's very obvious.

320
00:23:53,574 --> 00:23:56,324
You're worried we might meet and make up.

321
00:23:56,673 --> 00:23:58,351
You must be secretly worried.

322
00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:01,482
Don't get too jealous,
and stay alone for a moment.

323
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,039
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

324
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:36,238
They say he went down to his hometown
to take care of business.

325
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:39,656
His servants do not know how many days
it will take.

326
00:24:41,926 --> 00:24:43,696
There is no way he went there.

327
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,240
Where is Kim Boong Do's hometown?

328
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,708
It is Chunggcheong-do, Cheongpoong.

329
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:54,047
He has to be away for, at least,
five days for his lie to make sense.

330
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:58,358
Then he will not show up in Hanyang
for five days.

331
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:02,194
Didn't the queen head to her mother's
house yesterday?

332
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:03,218
Yes.

333
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:07,974
Wait for a day
the queen leaves the palace.

334
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:13,634
On that day, you must make sure
Kim Boong Do cannot enter the palace.

335
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:19,136
The heavens are helping us.

336
00:25:20,864 --> 00:25:22,153
The timing is very good.

337
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:27,522
Go to Kim Boong Do's hometown and
find people who can be witnesses.

338
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:28,657
Yes.

339
00:25:28,657 --> 00:25:31,346
- You need to find more men.
- Yes, sir.

340
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:32,798
The more, the better.

341
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,249
We will be going to
the Queen Mother's home tonight.

342
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,199
Oh right, about that gisaeng wench...

343
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:42,951
She took one servant
and went to the temple.

344
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:46,029
I was about to follow her
and stab her right there.

345
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:49,219
Leave her be.
She is Minister Min's woman.

346
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,211
Once things are resolved,
he will want to take care of it himself.

347
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:04,472
Oh, how do you think he is?

348
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:06,137
You probably already know.

349
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:09,314
Honestly, he's not here
because he's sick.

350
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:11,303
I came in because I'm sick. I'm so sick.

351
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,575
Who are you talking to?

352
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:14,248
Hold on a second.

353
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:15,318
Someone's here to visit.

354
00:26:15,318 --> 00:26:17,477
- I decline.
- It's Hee Jin.

355
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:20,236
What should I do?

356
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:22,252
She's downstairs.
Should I tell her to leave?

357
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,681
Tell her to come up.

358
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:31,269
I'm warning you beforehand.
Don't cause a scene in the hospital.

359
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:33,994
If you want to fight,
get discharged and then fight.

360
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:37,903
Yes, Hee Jin. You can come up.

361
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:40,260
This is room 1503.

362
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:41,603
Yes.

363
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:06,056
<i>Who is it?</i>

364
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:10,097
Dong Min, it's me.

365
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:12,126
<i>Come in.</i>

366
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:31,714
I was really surprised.

367
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,886
I heard you're not very sick.

368
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:36,834
I gave it some thought.

369
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:40,162
I suffered all of this because I fell
for your lies and betrayal.

370
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:45,117
Come on in.

371
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:53,546
Not just once, but twice.

372
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:17,880
A couple is one in body and mind, right?

373
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,015
You don't feel it's unfair
for you to get sprayed for him?

374
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:25,048
I don't think it's unfair,
but this is a bit childish.

375
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:28,200
Didn't you know that I've always
been really childish?

376
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,049
You should have expected this when you
started cheating on me.

377
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:33,508
- That...
- Oh, I forgot one thing.

378
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:39,255
Right, he threw a pillow at me too.

379
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:42,271
Oh, do you want
to get locked in a bathroom too?

380
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:43,511
You want to see how that feels?

381
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:46,246
Okay. Come over here.

382
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:49,923
You can go and tell on me
to that son on a bitch.

383
00:28:49,923 --> 00:28:53,242
Tell him I did it. Is he a gangster?
He's very good at fighting.

384
00:28:53,242 --> 00:28:54,892
Hey! Wait.

385
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:57,462
Let's talk about it.
I came to talk not to do this.

386
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,866
Talk about what? I don't need to talk.

387
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,743
I saw it all with my own eyes,
so why should we talk?

388
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,557
I'll explain. I'll explain it.

389
00:29:04,557 --> 00:29:06,356
I didn't cheat or lie to you.

390
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:08,730
I'll explain to you how things
turned out this way.

391
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:12,827
You didn't cheat or lie,
but things turned out this way?

392
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,318
Are you going to play me
until the very end?

393
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,450
Are you seriously...

394
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,171
Dong Min, Director Yang is here.

395
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,291
Hey.

396
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:28,859
What are you two doing?

397
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:31,233
Uh... Director.

398
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:37,714
What is that on your face, Hee Jin?
Is that water?

399
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:40,910
No, no. It's not that.

400
00:29:43,368 --> 00:29:44,888
I'm just sweating a lot.

401
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:48,585
Did you wash your face with sweat?

402
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:52,317
Director, why don't you
sit here for now?

403
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:56,221
Why... why are you standing?
You need to get in bed.

404
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:58,472
Here you go. Lie down.

405
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:00,807
Well, uh...

406
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:04,493
Director, what would you like to drink?

407
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,031
Here you go.

408
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:13,067
So, how are you? You look okay.

409
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:15,435
No, I'm not okay.

410
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,557
Director, I'm being very serious here.

411
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:23,896
I can't film with Queen In Hyun.
Remove all our scenes together.

412
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:28,567
This is about empathy.

413
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:31,515
I cannot empathize with a cheating
Queen In Hyun and act.

414
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:35,347
How can I look at the fox-like face
and act like I'm in love with her?

415
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:36,823
I cannot film with her.

416
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:42,221
He just got a shot of something just now.

417
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:44,266
- He's drugged up a bit.
- Let me go!

418
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:47,123
I can't act with an actress who can't
control her personal life.

419
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:48,625
I'm serious, Director.

420
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,702
You can poison Queen In Hyun or
behead her.

421
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:55,271
Or don't restore her to her place.
Just let her grow old and die there.

422
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:58,026
Please take care of this for me.
I cannot film with her.

423
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:02,119
Hey, man. You can't do this.

424
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:05,319
Look, Han Dong Min...

425
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:08,226
She pretends to be innocent,
but she's fake and she cheats.

426
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:09,498
Queen of scandals.

427
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:11,605
How can a girl like that
be Queen In Hyun?

428
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:14,987
If the dead Queen In Hyun knew,
she would cry.

429
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:16,237
This is so ridiculous.

430
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:22,211
Throw this away.

431
00:31:31,644 --> 00:31:33,483
I'm sorry, Director.

432
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:38,531
Well, I don't know who is right here.

433
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,285
I don't even need to know.

434
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:44,424
Until we can persuade him,
we'll have to film separately and cut it.

435
00:31:45,748 --> 00:31:47,236
I'm sorry.

436
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:52,205
I knew he would cause a problem,
at least once.

437
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:54,455
I didn't think it would be
over something like this.

438
00:31:55,384 --> 00:31:57,582
Director! Let's go.

439
00:31:59,163 --> 00:32:02,259
Anyway, I'll see you on set
and we'll talk later.

440
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:03,346
Yes, Director.

441
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:29,789
Oh, he's probably waiting.

442
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:51,843
Yes. Oh, I see.

443
00:32:51,843 --> 00:32:53,451
The man staying in room 201.

444
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:54,915
What?

445
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,660
Where did he go?

446
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,038
<i>I don't know.</i>

447
00:32:58,598 --> 00:33:00,268
He's not here.

448
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:03,567
Oh, okay. Thank you.

449
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:06,998
What's going on?

450
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:09,863
Did he just step out, or did he go back?

451
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:25,400
Yes.

452
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:29,247
He definitely went somewhere
this morning.

453
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,167
It wasn't a dream.

454
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,244
I'm really going to throw it.
I really am.

455
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:41,990
What did you do?

456
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,471
I said I would throw it.

457
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:47,066
Look at you getting scared.

458
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:52,628
It couldn't be...

459
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:56,346
Is he hiding a woman in the Joseon era
while going back and forth?

460
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,769
He did admit to being a player.

461
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:08,599
Do you know what a player is?

462
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,519
What is a player, my lord?

463
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,681
This kind of thing is a player.

464
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:22,697
No way. It doesn't even suit him.

465
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,753
Then again, how would I know how he
acts there?

466
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:30,695
It's not like I can go look there?

467
00:34:51,347 --> 00:34:52,896
Have you come regarding your master?

468
00:34:52,896 --> 00:34:54,905
I thought you might be worried.

469
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:57,996
Though I know he sent a message that
he was safe.

470
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,306
I saw for myself that he was safe,
as well.

471
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,347
What?

472
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:04,251
He visited me early this morning.

473
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:05,447
This morning?

474
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:06,588
Teacher.

475
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:11,719
How did you come back here?

476
00:35:12,498 --> 00:35:14,519
I caused you alarm last night,
did I not?

477
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:18,610
I received the message
that you were safe. It is a relief.

478
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,110
What brings you here at this hour?

479
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:23,701
I could not sleep.

480
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:26,081
I hoped that you were awake.

481
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:30,472
It seems he had more worries now that
he has found the talisman.

482
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:32,202
What kind?

483
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:35,913
Has something happened to him?

484
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:41,092
It seemed as if he wanted
to go to the new world.

485
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:02,132
Hello? Where are you?

486
00:36:02,132 --> 00:36:04,670
The park. Are you done?

487
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,052
The park? I'm passing that area now.

488
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:12,021
I was surprised because I heard
you weren't at the pension.

489
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:13,762
What did you do all this time?

490
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:15,101
I toured Seoul.

491
00:36:15,101 --> 00:36:16,304
A tour of Seoul?

492
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:21,217
I was busy every time I came,
so I had never taken a good look.

493
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:22,994
I thought it was a good time
to look around.

494
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:26,402
A tour of Seoul.

495
00:36:27,231 --> 00:36:30,824
Must have been nice.
I worried for no reason.

496
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:32,036
Did anything happen?

497
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:33,391
Like what?

498
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:36,570
I wondered if that man
had bothered you or not.

499
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:40,360
Would I take that from him?
Do you know who I am?

500
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,119
You are the easiest person
in the world to bully.

501
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,389
You could have come with me
if you were so worried.

502
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:47,811
You said you'd take
responsibility for me.

503
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,322
I thought he would feel sicker if I went.

504
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:53,751
A cat is being considerate of the mouse.

505
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,840
You declared you'd take responsibility.
What is this?

506
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,182
You had no plans.

507
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:02,693
I thought about it,
and there is no other way.

508
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:05,130
We have to wait it out
until he gets over his anger.

509
00:37:05,704 --> 00:37:09,371
Oh my! What kind of absurd answer
is that?

510
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:11,210
I am just shocked.

511
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:13,893
You're serious and not kidding, right?

512
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:15,181
You are in the car, right?

513
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,753
Don't change the subject.
I am really shocked right now.

514
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:20,036
Open the glove box on the right.

515
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:22,161
The right?

516
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:29,416
What is this doing here?

517
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,447
I put it there and forgot to tell you.

518
00:37:42,737 --> 00:37:45,065
Why are you giving me money?
What am I supposed to with it?

519
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:48,525
Why do keep acting like a rich man
from a comic book?

520
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:50,034
You're not taking responsibility
like you said.

521
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:54,414
Can you... use that for me?

522
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,699
What?

523
00:37:57,101 --> 00:37:59,143
I think we should stop using pay phones.

524
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:01,581
I need to stop wearing other people's
clothes.

525
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:06,760
It's too hard leaving the city
just to see you once.

526
00:38:09,364 --> 00:38:14,023
I would like it if you could
get me a place near you.

527
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:19,442
Of course, I should buy a cell phone.

528
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:21,481
Several pieces of clothing too.

529
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,442
Will that be enough money?

530
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:29,005
It is enough, but...

531
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:33,443
I said I would take responsibility,
but I thought about it.

532
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:40,842
To take responsibility for jumping into
your life and causing confusion

533
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:43,193
can't be done by being your
temporary boyfriend.

534
00:38:44,902 --> 00:38:46,693
I can't do it by buying you an
expensive car.

535
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:51,244
I can't do it by spraying water on
that man.

536
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:54,086
I realized that none of that
will suffice.

537
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,494
To really take responsibility...

538
00:38:58,885 --> 00:39:02,226
I started to think I need
to be by your side constantly.

539
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:11,554
What do you think?

540
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,632
That's the only conclusion I can reach?

541
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:38,974
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

542
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,547
It's a very...

543
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:57,262
a very good conclusion.

544
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,797
Is it?

545
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:08,726
I have a good eye for people.

546
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:57,086
<i>What are your worries?</i>

547
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:04,393
I have been busy
trying to save my own life.

548
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:07,246
I have also been focused
on reinstating the queen.

549
00:41:08,038 --> 00:41:10,309
I ran forward without even looking.

550
00:41:11,586 --> 00:41:13,509
Now, everything has been resolved.

551
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:16,458
I have recovered my memories.

552
00:41:17,228 --> 00:41:20,277
Now that you've recovered them,
what is the problem?

553
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,186
The place I am living now
has become the past to me.

554
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:33,036
Can I still live here
without any troubles?

555
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:07,114
<i>I have knowledge of our history
that I cannot dare speak of.</i>

556
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,389
<i>I must now live out our daily lives
that has already been set.</i>

557
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:15,498
Is that truly a life
a human should live?

558
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:22,887
Could a life be happy for a person
who knows their fate?

559
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:48,163
<i>Strangely, the future has now
become my present.</i>

560
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:53,452
So, the life I must now live out...

561
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:55,981
is it possible in that other land?

562
00:42:56,632 --> 00:42:57,911
I am beginning to question it.

563
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:00,958
Still, how could he?

564
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:03,552
How could he think such thoughts?

565
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:05,496
I do not know very well.

566
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:08,907
It seems he has formed a relationship
in that place.

567
00:43:11,985 --> 00:43:14,422
I do understand how you feel.

568
00:43:14,422 --> 00:43:17,413
It is a strange place where no one will
remember you.

569
00:43:17,865 --> 00:43:21,036
Could that life be happy for you?

570
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:26,784
There is nothing harder
to bear for man than solitude.

571
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:29,364
Yes, that is true.

572
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:34,695
<i>But, what if...</i>

573
00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:42,335
<i>there was even one person
who would remember me?</i>

574
00:43:43,516 --> 00:43:45,900
Wouldn't that life be a little different?

575
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:51,123
Then...

576
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:58,072
you are saying that he truly wishes
to leave?

577
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,793
Would anyone be able
to make that decision easily?

578
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:04,217
However, his heart has already headed
in that direction.

579
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:24,326
Are you sure that is the truth?

580
00:44:24,326 --> 00:44:26,961
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

581
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:29,342
You must die to live.

582
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,679
It is a magical talisman that lets Kim
Boong Do live when he's about to die.

583
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:37,472
That is why I lost him
when he was right in front of me.

584
00:44:37,472 --> 00:44:40,853
However, it works only for him.

585
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:44,855
Even if we take it from him,
it is useless to us.

586
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:46,889
Is that so?

587
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:49,413
What should I do? He has seen me.

588
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,159
The guards will be after me soon.

589
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:55,614
I cannot do anything in the city
if you do not give me your orders now.

590
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:59,860
Whatever the case,
shouldn't I get rid of the talisman?

591
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,650
If you give your orders,
even if I die at the hand of the guards

592
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,739
I will get into Kim Boong Do's home
and take that talisman.

593
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:09,748
- Then I will make sure to kill him.
- No.

594
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:12,032
Don't do that.

595
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:16,838
You say he must die to live.

596
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:21,568
Then it is corresponds to,
you must live to die.

597
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:22,628
What?

598
00:45:22,628 --> 00:45:25,829
If he was able to turn this game over
with one talisman

599
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:30,369
there is no reason why this talisman
cannot bring about his ruin.

600
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:00,833
It's Florence.

601
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:03,126
Have you been to Florence?

602
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:04,248
No.

603
00:46:05,757 --> 00:46:09,394
I got a strange feeling when I saw that,
so I wanted to go there.

604
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:13,373
You can't even speak English,
so why would you go abroad?

605
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,311
I better be your translator.

606
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:24,083
I think I will be better than you at
English after one month of studying.

607
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,501
Oh? What's with this absurd confidence?

608
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:29,512
I studied English for many years.

609
00:46:29,512 --> 00:46:30,853
We can make a bet.

610
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:34,123
What basis do you have to say that?

611
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:36,557
How do you spell curry?

612
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:39,510
Curry?

613
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:45,081
C-A-R-R-E?

614
00:46:45,952 --> 00:46:47,161
This is why.

615
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,538
It's correct.

616
00:46:49,538 --> 00:46:50,992
What is it?

617
00:47:09,643 --> 00:47:11,972
<i>We had met by coincidence.</i>

618
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:15,925
<i>An odd meeting in the gap between time.</i>

619
00:47:16,731 --> 00:47:19,447
<i>Inevitability was the cause of that
coincidental meeting.</i>

620
00:47:20,114 --> 00:47:22,744
<i>The end was coming to an end.</i>

621
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:42,032
<i>Playboy to The Most Beautiful
Woman on Earth.</i>

622
00:47:42,032 --> 00:47:43,610
<i>Hello, Playboy.</i>

623
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,119
<i>Have you been doing well?</i>

624
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,916
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

625
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:50,541
<i>How could you leave the King and
cheat on him?</i>

626
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:51,806
<i>Awesome.</i>

627
00:47:51,806 --> 00:47:55,630
<i>We will do a complete re-investigation
of the case from last April.</i>

628
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:59,641
<i>Kim Boong Do will be executed for the
crime of high treason.</i>

629
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:01,472
<i>They are arrows!</i>

630
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:03,853
<i>Watch out!</i>
