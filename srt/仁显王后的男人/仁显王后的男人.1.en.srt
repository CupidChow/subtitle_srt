3
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,623
Get him!

4
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,556
<i>1694, Joseon 20th Year of Sukjong.</i>

5
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:31,824
<i>Five years earlier, King Sukjong had
dethroned Queen In Hyun.</i>

6
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:35,804
<i>The Westerners that opposed him
were purged as a result.</i>

7
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:39,048
<i>Lady Jang Ok Jeong became the new Queen.</i>

8
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,752
<i>Then five years passed.</i>

9
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:47,300
<i>With Lady Jang and the Southerners in
power and the wickedness growing</i>

10
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,986
<i>Sukjong started
to have a change of heart.</i>

11
00:03:50,352 --> 00:03:54,570
<i>The Westerners were working on a
plan to reinstate Queen In Hyun.</i>

12
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:58,372
<i>Min Am, the Minister of the Right,
realized the king's change of heart.</i>

13
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,830
<i>So he came up with a plot to remove
Queen In Hyun for good.</i>

14
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:07,909
<i>(1694, Joseon 20th Year of Sukjong)</i>

15
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:21,240
<i>(Queen In Hyun)</i>

16
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,185
<i>I could not stop thinking about
my desire to be with you again.</i>

17
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:40,240
<i>Though I wish to stop Min Am's schemes,
it will not be easy.</i>

18
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:45,228
<i>Please understand the frustrations
I am going through.</i>

19
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:05,180
<i>Your Majesty, I deserve to die
for the things I've done wrong.</i>

20
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,062
<i>Thanks to your great favor,
I was able to live.</i>

21
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:15,041
<i>On top of everything, you've written
to ask about my well-being.</i>

22
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,406
<i>I am shedding tears as I am so touched.</i>

23
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,317
Who goes there?

24
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,278
Is that you, Sam Wol?

25
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:14,958
<i>However, I will be unable to repay you
for your great favor.</i>

26
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:19,517
<i>How can I speak of all I've done wrong?</i>

27
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,829
<i>My only hope is that blood will
no longer be shed because of me.</i>

28
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,901
<i>I beg of you.</i>

29
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:52,240
Are you okay?

30
00:06:56,242 --> 00:06:57,613
My apologies, Your Highness.

31
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,346
<i>(Minister of the Right, Min Am)</i>

32
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:53,061
<i>Minister, I will enter now.</i>

33
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,870
How did it go?

34
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,399
Well... there was a problem.

35
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,019
There was a problem?

36
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,815
<i>(Jang Ok Jeong, Current Queen)</i>

37
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,738
They failed? How?

38
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:22,110
Kim Boong Do from the Hongmoongwan
brought some people with him.

39
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,614
How did he know about it?

40
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:26,955
He got his hands on a letter
sent by Minister Min Am.

41
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,581
What?

42
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:29,975
This could be trouble, Your Majesty.

43
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:32,307
If that were to get to the king...

44
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:35,398
How could he be so careless?

45
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:38,842
Why don't you call the Minister
and discuss things?

46
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:41,759
Are you crazy?

47
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,649
You want me to call in someone who
could become a traitor tomorrow.

48
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,446
Where is my older brother?

49
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:48,659
Tell him to come to me right now!

50
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,471
How did you know to come tonight?

51
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:58,111
Activity at the Queen's residence was
unusual, so I had been keeping watch.

52
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,561
Today's incident was planned
by Minister Min and the Queen.

53
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:03,341
You should not assume that the Queen
had something to do with this.

54
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,250
How can you speak so carelessly?

55
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:15,860
What is this?

56
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,027
It is a secret letter
from Minister Min Am

57
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,822
giving the order to kill you,
Your Highness

58
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:32,841
They will be aware that I have this,
so they will take action.

59
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,740
I have no time to waste.

60
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,929
Before they make a move

61
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:45,154
I will take this to the king and will
request that the Queen be deposed.

62
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:47,979
Depose the Queen?  How impudent of you.

63
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,724
How dare you make a move to depose
the Queen.

64
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,635
This is not my will,
but that of the king.

65
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,816
It is also the will of the people.

66
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,602
Please do not worry.

67
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:07,412
We will protect you until the very end,
Your Highness.

68
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,134
Keep quiet and watch what you say.

69
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:26,139
Yes, my lord.

70
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,200
You will need to protect Her Highness
with your lives.

71
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,990
You are protecting the entire country.

72
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,240
- Do not worry.
- Let's go!

73
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:28,379
What is it?

74
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,236
You've ruined the mood.

75
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:33,791
Things were just getting good.

76
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,600
I'm sorry, my lord.

77
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,128
I will get a new one right away.

78
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,735
My lord.

79
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,357
All right. All right.

80
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:08,120
My lord, what brings you by?

81
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,746
I came to see you.

82
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:13,296
Are you injured?

83
00:13:13,296 --> 00:13:16,211
- No.
- What is that blood!

84
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:18,322
I need you to hold onto this for me.

85
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:24,211
What... is this?

86
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:26,461
It is an important letter that will turn
the palace upside down.

87
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:29,957
There are too many who've caught the
scent of blood, and are hunting.

88
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:32,609
I felt I'd lose it before I even met
the king, so I came here.

89
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:36,892
I'll come back for it in a few days.
Keep it safe.

90
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,923
What are you up to?

91
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:43,201
I ought to make what's wrong
right again.

92
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,653
I have waited too long.

93
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,413
My lord.

94
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:06,033
Keep this on your body.

95
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:07,123
What is it?

96
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:12,947
It's a talisman that I received from
a monk at Hyunamsa Temple.

97
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:15,065
It will protect you.

98
00:14:17,177 --> 00:14:19,835
I am not such a sad person that I need
to rely on a talisman.

99
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:23,534
Yet, it's all right for you to rely
on a mere gisaeng?

100
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,645
I suppose you are correct.

101
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,020
Let's go!

102
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,350
We should go.

103
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,817
Stop! Who is it?

104
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:20,418
I'm Kim Boong Do from the Hongmoongwan.
Open the door.

105
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:23,875
You are not in your regular attire.

106
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,404
I came here on urgent Royal orders
and had no time to change.

107
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,967
Open the door now.

108
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,361
Give us your sword first.

109
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,260
Open the gates!

110
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,378
I had a confidential letter for the king.
Please allow me to see him.

111
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:57,827
However, you must keep it a secret.

112
00:16:57,827 --> 00:17:00,009
At this hour?

113
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:04,894
The king is already in bed.

114
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:08,094
Eunuch Hong, there is no time to waste.

115
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,336
The king will know if you tell him
I am here.

116
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,641
I understand.

117
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:19,125
However, this is an unusual situation,
so I'm afraid people will talk.

118
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:25,124
Why don't you meet with him quietly
in the Hongmoongwan study?

119
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,685
All right.

120
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,574
I wondered who the mole
in the palace was.

121
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:18,175
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

122
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:22,257
<i>(318 Years Later, Seoul 2012)</i>

123
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:31,884
Audition!

124
00:20:31,884 --> 00:20:33,612
Where's the audition for Queen In Hyun?

125
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:36,036
Ah, you're here for the audition?
It's on the third floor.

126
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,133
I looked all over third floor
and couldn't find it.

127
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,121
- It's the next building.
- What?

128
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:43,609
It's not this building, but the third
floor of the next building.

129
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,500
You can get there through the lobby
if you go downstairs.

130
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:31,632
Hello.

131
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:33,531
Did you go? Are you there?

132
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:35,080
I am here, but...

133
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,130
it's over.

134
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:40,778
Huh? Why? Did you audition already?

135
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:42,857
It was over before I even got here.

136
00:21:43,357 --> 00:21:45,027
I'm too late anyway.

137
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:48,482
They promised to finish the magazine
shoot early, but they totally didn't.

138
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,778
I told them so many times that my
audition was at 3:00 p.m.

139
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,104
I still wanted to give it a try.

140
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:58,310
Now that the shoe strap is broken,
I feel like giving up.

141
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,853
I'm an hour late, so how can I do it?

142
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,445
What are you talking about?
It's 3:00 p.m. now.

143
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:07,146
It's 3:00 p.m. now. You're not late.

144
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:10,421
It's 4:05 p.m.

145
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:13,838
I'm telling you, it's 3:05 p.m.
Hey! Are you wearing my watch?

146
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:14,894
Yes.

147
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:17,450
- That thing is fast!
- Really?

148
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:20,907
It really is!

149
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:25,137
Then I can't give up like this.

150
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:28,473
Who cares about the shoe strap?
I still have a chance.

151
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:31,318
I have to go.

152
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:36,313
Excuse me. Hold on.

153
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:39,588
Who can I blame, Your Majesty?

154
00:22:39,588 --> 00:22:42,884
I lacked the ability and virtue
to know my own status.

155
00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:44,753
I have brought this on myself.

156
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,077
Can you turn sideways and give it a try?

157
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:50,761
- Yes.
- The other side.

158
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,823
<i>(Jang Heebin)</i>
Let's start again.

159
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,510
Her side image and frontal
are kind of different.

160
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,569
I lacked the ability and virtue to know
my own status.

161
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:03,650
I have brought this on myself.

162
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,877
I was so foolish, and missed my timing.

163
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:10,410
You should blame this on my foolishness.

164
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:12,817
Choi Hee Jin?

165
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:15,172
We're running a bit behind.
You'll be on in 30 minutes.

166
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:16,260
Okay.

167
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:20,082
Come backstage when she is finished.

168
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:21,701
Where should I get changed?

169
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,238
Yeah?

170
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:10,219
Late? I have 30 minutes to spare.

171
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:13,298
Shoes? I borrowed them.

172
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:17,228
That employee turned out to be one
of the few fans I have in this world.

173
00:24:17,228 --> 00:24:20,839
Yes, she lent them to me right away
when I told her I had an audition.

174
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,577
Anyways, to give up is to lose.

175
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:25,926
That's what I learned today.

176
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,559
I have a good feeling today.
I think something will happen.

177
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:32,713
- What is that?
- <i>What?</i>

178
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,522
Oh my! What is that?

179
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:37,094
<i>What is it now?</i>

180
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:39,741
Oh, oh! What do I do?

181
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:02,736
Damn it!

182
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:05,421
<i>What is it? Why did you say damn it?
What's going on?</i>

183
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:09,375
<i>Hello? Hey, are you listening to me?</i>

184
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:19,034
Pull it down. Down. I said pull it down.

185
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:20,567
<i>Pull what down?</i>

186
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,973
Down. Pull the blinds down.

187
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,189
Pull it down. Yes!

188
00:25:29,907 --> 00:25:31,675
Pull it down!

189
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,061
Don't do it. Don't do it.

190
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:41,792
- Chun Soo.
- Don't call them over.

191
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,613
<i>Choi Hee Jin? What's going on?</i>

192
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:54,520
Chun Soo, look at this.

193
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:56,851
Chun Soo!

194
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,077
What?

195
00:26:03,286 --> 00:26:06,681
We don't have time.
Get changed for our next schedule.

196
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:12,488
That crazy son of a...

197
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:25,724
Hey, Choi Hee Jin.

198
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:29,557
Your skirt is inside out.

199
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:34,114
Did my skirt get turned inside out?

200
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:37,513
It's been a long time.
Have you been well?

201
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,262
You're the same as always.
Your hobby of making people miserable.

202
00:26:40,262 --> 00:26:43,419
The blinds really wouldn't go down.

203
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:46,473
But, that was perfect timing, right?

204
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:49,257
What brings you here?

205
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:50,693
I have some business to attend to.

206
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:55,112
You weren't waiting there undressed
because you knew I was here, were you?

207
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,893
Why would I wait for you?

208
00:26:57,893 --> 00:27:00,458
You must be insane now that you've
become so famous, Han Dong Min.

209
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,183
It's just that I don't understand
the situation.

210
00:27:03,183 --> 00:27:04,451
What were you doing there then?

211
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,844
Were you with someone there
in broad daylight?

212
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:08,590
I came for an audition. Why?

213
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,194
I had no time and no place to change.

214
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:13,557
I went into that room and got caught
in that mess.

215
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,517
I'm sure all the production companies

216
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,476
are desperate to have
a Hallyu star like you.

217
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:18,791
A rookie like me has to go
around auditioning

218
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,107
saying "please cast me".

219
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:22,609
I have no choice but to go around
like a salesperson.

220
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,781
Ah, you're here to audition
for "Queen In Hyun's Man."

221
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:28,047
Ah, now you understand the situation?

222
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,086
I do.

223
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:32,863
I heard you left your management company.
How come?

224
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:34,099
How did you know?

225
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:36,854
Your number changed, so I called them
and they told me.

226
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:38,651
Why were you
trying to find out my number?

227
00:27:38,651 --> 00:27:41,161
I was curious. I was curious to know
how you were doing.

228
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,714
Weren't you curious?

229
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:45,255
You should give me time to be curious.

230
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:47,099
All year long, 24 hours a day

231
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,826
there's a scandal about you and some
actress on the entertainment shows.

232
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:53,215
They all have different last names,
but there are so many of them.

233
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,826
There's actress Yoon, Sung, Shin, Kim,
and Hwang.

234
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:59,567
Oh, I noticed you've started dating
singers too now.

235
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:01,338
You're quite amazing.

236
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:03,900
I see that you're still very angry.

237
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,411
Did we both agree to break up?
Why are you so angry?

238
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:09,595
Yes! We both agreed to break up.

239
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:13,471
You said you had your second chance,
and said I shouldn't hold you back.

240
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:17,582
So, yes I agreed to it.
Now, don't act like you know me.

241
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:19,352
What's with you?
You don't want to be held back again.

242
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:21,448
You'll be targeted by your fans

243
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:23,544
if you date a celebrity
who isn't on the same level.

244
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,903
Good luck on your audition.

245
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:30,936
Thank you.

246
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:40,270
Why is he laughing? That bastard.

247
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:52,040
Choi Hee Jin. Hee Jin!

248
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:53,269
Yes.

249
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:56,144
Forget him, Choi Hee Jin.

250
00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:59,182
Han Dong Min is one last obstacle.

251
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:01,147
Giving up is losing.

252
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,295
Coming in now?

253
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,113
Come on in.

254
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:14,321
Stand right there, please.

255
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:19,106
Please introduce yourself.

256
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:21,477
Hello. My name is Choi Hee Jin.

257
00:29:21,776 --> 00:29:23,845
- You're a former Miss Jeonnam.
- Yes.

258
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,450
I was in the final round in 2007.

259
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,990
Then why is it that you don't have much
experience after that?

260
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,686
Looks like you only attended
private academies.

261
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:36,409
Yes. I wanted to focus
on studying acting.

262
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:40,346
While doing so, I gained experience
acting in theaters.

263
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:43,159
Which plays did you act in?

264
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:44,993
Anything that we would know?

265
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:49,681
Last year, in "Our Twisted Hero"...

266
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:52,632
Oh, President is here.

267
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:58,826
Here. Say hello to Han Dong Min.

268
00:29:58,826 --> 00:29:59,982
Hello.

269
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:03,403
Oh, hello Han Dong Min.
Thank you for working with us.

270
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:05,741
I'll work very hard. Nice to meet you.

271
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:08,778
It's been a long time. Hello, Director.

272
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,269
Oh, I see you're looking for my partner.

273
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:16,201
Would you like to see too, Dong Min?

274
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:17,708
You have to like her too.

275
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,836
- Should I observe?
- Of course. Sit down.

276
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:27,571
Han Dong Min will be playing the role
of Sukjong.

277
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:30,529
- What?
- She's so happy that she's yelling.

278
00:30:34,554 --> 00:30:37,739
Director, what do you think of this
kind of Queen In Hyun?

279
00:30:38,143 --> 00:30:42,002
Since it is called "New Jang Heebin",
I'm thinking of giving it a new feel.

280
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:45,801
Not a weak Queen In Hyun who suffers
at the hands of Jang Heebin.

281
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:47,881
But, a Queen In Hyun
who stands her ground.

282
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:51,296
If she is unhappy,
she curses at the king too.

283
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:52,623
You know?

284
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:56,186
We should really try it.

285
00:30:56,186 --> 00:30:59,653
It's a good idea
to pull in younger viewers.

286
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:01,810
Think about it, Director Yang.

287
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,483
Yes, it is very different and new.
I'll do that.

288
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:06,405
Damn it.

289
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:21,595
I'm going to die. I'm so tired.

290
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:28,086
Is she not here yet?

291
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:39,722
She should've finished
her audition already.

292
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:22,287
Hello.

293
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:24,885
Yes.

294
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:29,071
I'm eating ramen
because I feel exhausted.

295
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,104
You should've come home to eat with me.

296
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:34,863
How did the audition go?

297
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:37,252
I don't know.

298
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:38,755
What do you mean you don't know?

299
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:41,105
What? Why?

300
00:32:41,105 --> 00:32:44,554
You practiced so hard this time.
You said you were confident.

301
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,930
What? You ran into Han Dong Min?

302
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:53,699
What? You took off your clothes?
He came into the audition?

303
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:56,148
What? He's playing King Sukjong?

304
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:58,057
It's really over now.

305
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:01,715
Every time I said my lines,
he was there snickering away.

306
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:03,266
He made me mess up my lines!

307
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:11,354
Sorry to disappoint you,
but don't expect anything.

308
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:16,766
He is such a curse to your life.

309
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:24,998
Hey! It might be for the better.

310
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:27,838
Han Dong Min is Sukjong,
so how can you be Queen In Hyun?

311
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:30,400
How can you look at that face and
act like you love him? Forget it.

312
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,169
Even if you get it, don't do it. Don't!

313
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:34,343
Of course I'll do it if I get it.
What are you saying?

314
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,375
Hey, hey. Don't, don't. I don't like it.

315
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:47,335
Also, this is my order as your manager.
Get home right away.

316
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:51,001
You are a celebrity, after all.
Why are you sitting out there like that?

317
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:53,872
I'll order whelks.

318
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:56,501
Hurry home in a taxi.

319
00:33:56,962 --> 00:33:58,345
Deal on the whelks.

320
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:16,472
I had a really good feeling when I was
able to borrow those shoes.

321
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:41,891
Hello.

322
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:42,925
<i>Where are you?</i>

323
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:44,144
Who is this?

324
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:47,407
You forgot your ex-boyfriend's voice?
That's a bit much.

325
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:49,840
- I'm done working. Where are you?
- How did you get this number?

326
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,630
You want to be Queen In Hyun, right?

327
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,630
What?

328
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,623
If you want to do it,
come to Paper Sun now.

329
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:57,952
You remember,
where we used to go to often.

330
00:34:57,952 --> 00:34:59,893
<i>I have some advice for you.</i>

331
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:02,603
Hello?

332
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:12,590
You must truly be crazy.

333
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,150
You've gone nuts since you got famous.

334
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,780
If you bother me one more time,
I won't let you get away with it.

335
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,599
Seriously, do you have a death wish?

336
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,137
<i>(Director Yang Min Hyuk)</i>

337
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:47,728
Mister! Stop, stop!

338
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:52,822
Miss, that's really dangerous. Wait!

339
00:35:52,822 --> 00:35:55,246
You have to pay me first.

340
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:58,824
Why in that important moment?

341
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,108
- Han Dong Min, that bastard.
- <i>Hello?</i>

342
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:02,427
<i>Hello?</i>

343
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:05,135
Hello. Director!

344
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:07,978
<i>I thought this was broken.
Why do you sound so far away?</i>

345
00:36:07,978 --> 00:36:10,333
Oh, that's because I'm in a tunnel.

346
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,844
Can you not hear me, Director?
I can hear everything you say.

347
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:14,625
<i>Are you able to talk now?</i>

348
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:17,576
Yes, please go on, Director.
I'm listening.

349
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:21,331
What? What?

350
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:23,458
Then...

351
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:27,242
<i>Let's work together.
We've decided to choose you, Hee Jin.</i>

352
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:31,436
<i>Let's work hard and make a hit together.</i>

353
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:35,043
<i>Hello? Are you listening?</i>

354
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:37,128
<i>Choi Hee Jin?</i>

355
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,175
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Thank you, Director!

356
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:44,414
I'll work so hard, Director.
I know I can do well.

357
00:36:44,414 --> 00:36:46,117
Thank you, Director.

358
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:48,652
I'll become the best Queen In Hyun.

359
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:52,789
Thank you, Director. Thank you.

360
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:56,735
I can really become the best
Queen In Hyun. Thank you!

361
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:58,751
Thank you, Director!

362
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:14,699
Did you hear something?

363
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,766
Hear what?

364
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,893
I heard something breaking.

365
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:20,657
Is someone inside the Hongmoongwan?

366
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,117
No. I'm sure everyone left
a long time ago.

367
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:24,766
Let's make one round and take a look.

368
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:27,050
What do you think you are doing?

369
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,809
- My lord.
- Oh, my lord.

370
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:32,257
Why are you guards hanging around
the Hongmoongwan?

371
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:35,208
It's just that we heard
some strange sounds.

372
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,518
Who would be here at this hour
that you make excuses?

373
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:41,605
Do you two have some other intent?

374
00:37:41,605 --> 00:37:45,003
Oh no. He must have heard wrong.

375
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,434
- Get going.
- Yes, sir.

376
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:46,369
What happened? What about Kim Boong Do?

377
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,418
Is he dead?

378
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,739
Well, that is...

379
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,851
Where did he go?

380
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:55,762
This is an unexpected event.

381
00:39:57,733 --> 00:39:59,313
Where has everyone gone?

382
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:11,199
<i>Hey, man! It's not there.
You have to put it on the other side.</i>

383
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,255
<i>Over here?</i>

384
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:14,797
<i>The other side. Gosh, seriously!</i>

385
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:12,945
This will not do.

386
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:30,590
Excuse me.

387
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,568
Which role are you playing?

388
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:36,788
Which role are you?

389
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:43,231
I'm one of the actors in this drama too.

390
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:44,911
I'm Queen In Hyun.

391
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:47,798
I'm the Queen In Hyun.

392
00:41:49,552 --> 00:41:51,150
You haven't heard, have you?

393
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,139
That's because it was just decided
30 minutes ago.

394
00:41:55,217 --> 00:41:59,032
It actually hasn't been announced,
so I'm not supposed to tell you.

395
00:41:59,032 --> 00:42:02,916
I'm just so happy about it that I can't
help myself.

396
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:04,967
Keep it to yourself, okay?

397
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,226
Have some of this.
I bought snacks for the crew.

398
00:42:14,927 --> 00:42:17,315
Do you not like donuts?

399
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:21,048
Excuse me.

400
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:24,686
Are you not an actor in this drama?

401
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:39,364
Excuse me. Are you okay?

402
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,365
Wait.

403
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:49,983
Would you happen to know, young lady?

404
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,280
What?

405
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,992
Am I dead right now, or am I dreaming?

406
00:42:56,496 --> 00:42:57,547
What?

407
00:43:01,393 --> 00:43:05,445
Are you asking me
because you're truly curious?

408
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:10,047
I am asking because I'm truly curious.

409
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:13,916
<i>This is my memory of our first meeting.</i>

410
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:16,896
<i>It was not three years,
or even thirty years.</i>

411
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:20,695
<i>He had jumped forward 300 years,
but how was I to know?</i>

412
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:23,637
<i>So, I answered his question honestly.</i>

413
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:28,500
Then don't get angry.

414
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,518
I'm only answering because you asked.

415
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,657
From what I can tell...

416
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:36,547
you are not dead or dreaming.

417
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,010
I think you've just
lost it a little bit.

418
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,068
<i>You couldn't even get cast
for a supporting role.</i>

419
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:06,125
<i>How did you get cast for a main role
in one go?</i>

420
00:44:09,394 --> 00:44:10,865
<i>Do you know Kim Boong Do?</i>

421
00:44:11,626 --> 00:44:14,144
<i>I need to catch you first in order to
catch Kim Boong Do.</i>

422
00:44:14,144 --> 00:44:15,355
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

423
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:18,405
<i>Yoon Wol has been taken.
What should I do?</i>

424
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:22,775
<i>Hello. My name is Choi Hee Jin.</i>

425
00:44:22,775 --> 00:44:25,264
<i>Must be nice to get a role so easily.</i>

426
00:44:25,264 --> 00:44:28,378
<i>Did you get involved with my audition,
by any chance?</i>

427
00:44:29,443 --> 00:44:32,067
<i>I thought it was a dream,
but it was not a dream either.</i>

428
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,414
<i>The things I saw were so strange and
inexplicable.</i>

429
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:37,195
<i>I cannot get them out of my mind.</i>

430
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:39,704
<i>What's with him, seriously?</i>

431
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:45,525
<i>He must have gone insane because he
tried to be an actor and failed.</i>

432
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:50,577
<i>- Don't come near me.
- Should we date again?</i>
