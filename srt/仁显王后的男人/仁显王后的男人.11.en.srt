1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
Who is it?

2
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,690
Hui Jin. Hui Jin.

3
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,590
Hey, what are you doing standing there?

4
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,000
You fool, you should follow at
the same pace with your partner.

5
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,200
You didn't even look at the camera,
your head was like elsewhere.

6
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,140
I thought I saw someone.

7
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,610
That... Gim Bung Do.

8
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,930
Please don't make that kind of face.

9
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,410
I know, it's an illusion.

10
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,750
There were too many people.
I must've momentarily hallucinated.

11
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,560
Going insane... seriously.

12
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,490
What? Who is Gim Bung Do?
I don't even know what he looks like.

13
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,960
Have you been well?

14
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,770
It's been a while.

15
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,510
Are you... Mr. Gim Bung Do?

16
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,980
Are you really Mr. Gim Bung Do?

17
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,980
Who exactly are you?

18
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,580
It's not like you're the real Gim Bung Do,
why do you keep saying that you're Gim Bung Do?

19
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,180
Besides, you're always looking for Hui Jin.

20
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,520
By any chance,
do you not remember me?

21
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,860
How could I possibly remember you?
This is our first meeting.

22
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,260
Who are you, really?

23
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,330
I'm asking you, who are you?

24
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,670
I feel disappointed.

25
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,200
I even thought that
we were really close.

26
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,600
Us?

27
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,280
And... the car too?

28
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,550
Hui Jin bought the car,

29
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,290
with her own money.

30
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,150
I've never seen you before.

31
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,020
How is it that I went to
bought a car together with you?

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,960
And when did I teach you how to drive?

33
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,030
Ah, seriously!

34
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,360
You're saying the exact same
thing as Hui Jin, how strange.

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,030
Right now, this situation is so absurd
that I think I'm going to be crazy.

36
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,840
I don't even know who you are.
It's also the first time I've heard your voice.

37
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,840
Hui Jin said that it was someone
she knows who appears in her dreams. No...

38
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,910
According to Hui Jin, you're someone
who really was in the history records,

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,650
how is it possible that
you're sitting right here?

40
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,050
You should be dead and buried
hundreds of years ago.

41
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,850
Don't you think I would find this absurd?

42
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,990
It is absurd.

43
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,790
Knowing that, why are you still like this?

44
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,730
Since you admit it, let's just be
open and have an honest talk.

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,930
You're a fan of Hui Jin, right?
I can tell with just one look.

46
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,800
Say it honestly.

47
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,540
As a manager, I've met
all sorts of fans.

48
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,280
What I said is correct, right?

49
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,950
Finally you admit it.

50
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,820
Now that I've said it so directly,
you have nothing to say.

51
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,290
Hello?

52
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,630
Ah, yes.

53
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,630
I'm outside.

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,030
Just a moment.

55
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,970
No no, it's nearby. Yes, yes.

56
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,570
<i>It wasn't memories that disappeared.
It was time that disappeared.</i>

57
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,050
<i>Gap. The gap in time, everything
disappeared through the gap in time.</i>

58
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,400
<i>The time started over again
from the beginning.</i>

59
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,340
Yes, Hui Jin is at the lounge.

60
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,610
All right, I'll give you a call right
away when I get back. Yes.

61
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,950
He doesn't look like a bad person...

62
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,020
Anyway, what's going on?

63
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,850
Excuse me, something came up
and I have to leave first.

64
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,860
Yes, you may leave first.

65
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,040
Is there anything else
you don't understand?

66
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,980
No, I understand everything.

67
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,390
Choe Hui Jin is nothing special.

68
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,320
Even though she looks
really slim and great on TV...

69
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,720
if there's no makeup,
she's really ordinary.

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,460
She completely relies on
makeup and lights to look good.

71
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,330
I know because we live together.

72
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,870
It's not like you're not good-looking.

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,270
Why have the delusion
about being her boyfriend?

74
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,210
Based on your looks, I'm sure
you're really popular with the ladies.

75
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,810
Is that so? That's really comforting to hear.

76
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,480
Can I ask you some questions too?

77
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,210
Go ahead.

78
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,490
You said you are a
graduate student, right?

79
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,220
What do you mean, university?

80
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm asking you where you study,
which university did you attend?

81
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,630
Sungkyunkwan...

82
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,090
Sungkyunkwan University?

83
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,570
Really?

84
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,770
<i>Starting now, tell the truth.</i>

85
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,840
<i>Yes.</i>

86
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,640
<i>You said you are a
graduate student, right?</i>

87
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,840
<i>Which university is it?</i>

88
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,980
<i>I'm asking you where
do you study, the school you attend.</i>

89
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,450
<i>Sungkyunkwan...</i>

90
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,580
<i>Sungkyunkwan University?</i>

91
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,650
<i>Is that true?</i>

92
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,250
<i>Didn't you say to only speak the truth?</i>

93
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,520
Is that real or not?

94
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,320
Didn't you say to only speak the truth?

95
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,390
Where do you live?

96
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,520
Bukchon.

97
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,130
Bukchon?

98
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,130
It is said that the houses
there are really expensive.

99
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,540
- Is it by any chance a tile?
- It's a tile-roofed house.

100
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,980
- Then do you live with your parents?
- No.

101
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,010
They both passed away.

102
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,950
Aren't you a student,

103
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,150
how do you manage your expenses?

104
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,620
I have inheritance.

105
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,750
Inheritance?

106
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,890
Exactly how much inheritance can...

107
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,430
Why are you laughing?

108
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,590
You're as straightforward as ever.

109
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,400
What?

110
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,030
Having the same thoughts in the
same order every time like this...

111
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Asking the questions in the
same order isn't easy.

112
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,440
You're quite consistent.

113
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,640
What?

114
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,110
Then I'll ask one more question.

115
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,710
Does Miss Choe Hui Jin feel
that dream was just a dream?

116
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,910
Well, of course. A dream is a dream.

117
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,450
She has a boyfriend, what else
is there for her to think of?

118
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,590
She has a boyfriend?

119
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,320
You didn't know? Aren't you her fan?

120
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,790
Everyone knows about it.

121
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,990
It was because I wasn't
here for a period of time.

122
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,480
Who...

123
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,400
Han Dong Min.

124
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,730
Didn't you see earlier on?

125
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,200
Both of them walking together?

126
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,540
Even if you went abroad,
didn't you see it on the internet?

127
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,390
That's right.

128
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,880
<i>If that number calls again,
do not pick it up.</i>

129
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,190
<i>Why not?</i>

130
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,490
<i>It's asking you to do nude modeling.</i>

131
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,960
<i>It's that number again.</i>

132
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,290
<i>Don't answer it.</i>

133
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,630
Then I'll leave first.

134
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,840
You must keep your
promise regarding Hui Jin.

135
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,850
I won't call her.

136
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,380
You promised, for real.

137
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,720
I won't  hurt someone that I like.

138
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,860
I won't make contact again.
You can rest assured.

139
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,730
Then... where are you going to go now?

140
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,900
Of course I have to return home.

141
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,030
Home?

142
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,540
In Bukchon, right?

143
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,470
Why did you come out?

144
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,970
Return my hand phone to me.

145
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,710
What are you doing?

146
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,920
Give it back to me!

147
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,310
What are you doing? Really.

148
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,180
Just now those phone calls weren't
about nude modeling, were they?

149
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,650
That phone call,
wasn't it Gim Bung Do?

150
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,160
It's him? It's him, isn't it?

151
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,660
I clearly saw him with my own eyes.

152
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,130
I was afraid you'd be like
this, indulging in a fantasy.

153
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:51,930
What?

154
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,810
I did actually meet someone
claiming to be Gim Bung Do...

155
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,210
Where is he?

156
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,940
He left.

157
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,410
Where did he go?

158
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,150
He probably went home.

159
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,950
He already acknowledged that
everything was just you dreaming.

160
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,350
Hey, where are you going?

161
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,700
Hey. Where are you going?
The live broadcast is about to start.

162
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,500
How can you leave like this?

163
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,180
Hey! Are you insane? Do you
have a conscience? Come back!

164
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,180
Taxi! Taxi!

165
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,910
Ajussi, please drive faster.
(Ajussi - older man, uncle)

166
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,920
But agassi, you're an actress, right?

167
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,030
Yes.

168
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,050
Turning left here is faster
to get to the public park.

169
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,770
That's right. It seems like I've seen
you before in one of those dramas.

170
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,790
Ah, Sageuk. You're acting
as a royal queen, right?
(Sageuk - Korean historical dramas)

171
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,460
Yes, ajussi. Please hurry up.

172
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,270
It's an honor to meet you. You're
much more beautiful than on screen.

173
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,400
But where are you
going wearing a dress?

174
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,010
It's not a dress that would suit a taxi.

175
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,540
Ajussi, can you please just drive faster?
Will you take responsibility if my life is ruined?

176
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,080
Step on the accelerator.

177
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,290
Agassi, taxi fare!

178
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,090
Please wait here. I will pay you
right away when I come back.

179
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,030
Did you get on
without money to pay?

180
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,030
I'll be right back, please wait.

181
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,370
<i>Look here!</i>

182
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,220
Who is it?

183
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,820
I'm a lowly monk from the temple.

184
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,760
What?

185
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,960
Forgive me for my lack of manners at this late hour,
but Master Yeong Myeong has asked me to
ensure the safety of the administrator.

186
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,890
Safety?

187
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,100
The young master is currently asleep.

188
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,770
Master.

189
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,570
Did anything happen to the young master?

190
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,180
He was at the temple earlier on
and something happened.

191
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,250
What? When did the
young master go there?

192
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,720
He should have brought me along if
he was going there. What is it again?

193
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,790
My Lord?

194
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,330
My Lord.

195
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,260
You weren't asleep yet?
Actually, I was about to call you anyway.

196
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,270
Didn't you go up to the temple?

197
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,870
How did you know that?

198
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,610
There is someone who was sent from
the temple, inquiring about your safety.

199
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,540
Is that so? I was also about
to send a letter, but already...

200
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,550
Inform him that I am well.

201
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,080
What exactly happened?

202
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,950
It's not something bad. Prepare to go
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

203
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,090
R-Royal Investigation Bureau?

204
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,700
The head of the assassins is Ja Su.

205
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,370
Take advantage of them before they escape out
of the capital, they should hurry and arrest them.

206
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,170
Tell them it would be easier to
capture them according to Yong Pa.

207
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,170
{\fs12\pos(190,220)\b0}-=Countenance Records (Yong Pa) - Arresting a
criminal based on records of his physical features.=-

208
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,900
Tell them it would be easier to
capture them according to Yong Pa.

209
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,100
Yes.

210
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,450
You were awake too,
I must've made all of you weary.

211
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,450
When did you return?

212
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,990
It wasn't even a quarter of an hour.

213
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,650
Did you find it?

214
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,320
I've found it.

215
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,200
This is a secret, so don't say anything,
not even to Master Yeong Myeong.

216
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,800
Now, knowledge of its existence
is becoming a poison.

217
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,470
Yes.

218
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,270
Then... did you meet?

219
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,810
Did you meet that woman too?

220
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,890
What do you think happened?

221
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,620
Pardon?

222
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,090
Hey, I heard Hui Jin went missing.

223
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,630
That... she will be back.
There's still a lot of time left.

224
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,230
Where did she go?

225
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,240
That... I also...

226
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
And I thought she was fully recovered.

227
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,580
Why is she like this again? Did you finish
looking outside? How about at home?

228
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,710
Is it Hui Jin?

229
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,390
What?

230
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,720
No, it's not.

231
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,790
Where are you?

232
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,800
Right now, I'm on my way back.

233
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,270
You have really gone insane,
do you want to die?

234
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,870
I'm only appearing for the later half
of the show, It's all right, I won't be late.

235
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,410
Surely you didn't meet that man?

236
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,740
He said with his own
mouth that he's not it.

237
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,480
No, I didn't meet him.

238
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,280
I looked for him but there's no one there.
That's why I'm on my way back.

239
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,820
But I didn't bring my purse with me.
Can you come out the back door in 10 minutes?

240
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,950
<i>Why are you here?</i>

241
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,890
<i>Did you follow me here?</i>

242
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,620
Did you meet that woman too?

243
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,750
What do you think happened?

244
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,950
Pardon?

245
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,700
Fortunately it was not an unforgivable
crime. Knowing this is enough.

246
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,370
Go to sleep. You must be tired.

247
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,500
Please rest.

248
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,390
Your Excellency.

249
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,320
What happened?

250
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,590
Gim Bung Do found out my identity.

251
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,460
I especially came to visit you
before going out the city walls.

252
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
How could you let him find out?

253
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,800
I'm sorry,

254
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,800
Although I was exposed by him,

255
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,270
I managed to find
out some information.

256
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,000
Find what?

257
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,800
What?

258
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,740
The truth about his
disappearance on that night.

259
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,610
I have also confirmed
it with my own eyes.

260
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,610
Everything that happened
was because of the talisman.

261
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,080
Talisman?

262
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,150
Stop right there!

263
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,620
Sorry to trouble you.

264
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,690
I'm here to deliver a message from Administrator
Gim Bung Do of the Office of Special Advisers.

265
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,890
Who is it regarding?

266
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,030
It's a matter of the
Royal Investigation Bureau.

267
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,240
Open the gate!

268
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,510
Have you seen His Excellency?

269
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,120
Looks like what was said by
the ancestors was true.

270
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,860
Life after death, death after life.
It's interconnected.

271
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:35,861
{\fs12\pos(190,220)\b0}-=He who risks death shall live,
and he who seeks life shall die.=-

272
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,930
Doesn't it make sense after hearing it?

273
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,530
Let's go. We have a lot to do.

274
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,680
Mr. Dong Min.

275
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,020
Nice to see you. Cheers.

276
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,160
It's nice to see you too.

277
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
- Dong Min oppa!
(Oppa - older brother, boyfriend)
- Hello.

278
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,390
- Oppa, see this?
- Wow! That's cool. Congratulations!

279
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,470
Oppa, you were so funny today.

280
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,570
All those are ad-libs right?

281
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,910
Of course.

282
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Have you ever seen me
reading through a script?

283
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,950
I knew it would be like this.

284
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,510
You're the best.

285
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,380
Oppa, come here and
let's have fun together!

286
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,780
Forget it. Have you seen Hui Jin?

287
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,650
My partner, where did she go?

288
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,590
I don't know.

289
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,460
You don't know?

290
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,190
- Then continue drinking.
- Oppa!

291
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,790
Continue.

292
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,870
But your figure...

293
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,050
<i>Let's meet later.</i>

294
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,380
<i>Because I'm going to be late.</i>

295
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,120
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

296
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,320
<i>I also have to return because of
urgent matters, there's no need to be sorry.</i>

297
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,790
<i>Are we not leaving?</i>

298
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,000
Looks like I'm going to have
to charge extra for this.

299
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,060
<i>Mr. Bung Do, I can
make it by 12 o'clock.</i>

300
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,120
<i>Don't be late.</i>

301
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,260
<i>There's no other place to meet,
so I'll see you at my house.</i>

302
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,510
<i>Because of certain circumstances.</i>

303
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,040
<i>You must've heard it
from Su Gyeong already.</i>

304
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,140
<i>Anyway my house address is Seoul City Central,
Namchang-dong No.32, U Rim Street No.302.</i>

305
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,200
<i>I can't even write it down!</i>

306
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,810
<i>Ajussi! Don't you even have a pen?</i>

307
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,880
<i>I'll find my way there.</i>

308
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,740
<i>How can you?
You don't even know where.</i>

309
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,750
<i>Seoul City Central, Namchang-dong No.32,
U Rim Street No.302.</i>

310
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,020
<i>I have a good memory.</i>

311
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:23,560
<i>A cafe with a nice atmosphere...</i>

312
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,430
<i>What's your phone number?</i>

313
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,540
Let me clarify, I didn't
intend to frighten you.

314
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,810
Why are you here?

315
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,410
Not outside?

316
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,010
I don't like this.

317
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,080
Didn't you tell me to
come to your house,

318
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,280
because people might see?

319
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,220
I definitely didn't intrude on purpose.

320
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,650
Looks more like you absolutely
intended to trespass.

321
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,550
This can be easily misunderstood.

322
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,230
I never thought a woman
would undress after entering.

323
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,830
You didn't know?

324
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,430
The people here are
all like this. It's normal.

325
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,900
Surely not...

326
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,170
There's a lot that you still don't know.

327
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,500
Didn't you trick me too often
because I'm unfamiliar with this world?

328
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,040
By the way, why are you standing like that?

329
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,980
It's a bit difficult to explain,

330
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,180
but wearing this takes a bit of effort.

331
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,600
It's different than wearing a jeogori.
(Jeogori - upper garment of hanbok)

332
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,910
I would help if it were a cloth string
like on traditional clothing.

333
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,980
You're certainly confident when it
comes to traditional women's clothing.

334
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,920
Go ahead and change
your clothes comfortably.

335
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,520
I'll wait for you outside.

336
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,260
You're going out now that
you've seen everything?

337
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,060
That is all there is to see,

338
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,400
I'm leaving now.

339
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,730
You keep insisting that
you're not a player,

340
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,800
but I was right all along, you're
the biggest player I've ever seen.

341
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,610
Wait a minute.

342
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,150
Give it to me, the talisman.

343
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,750
Why the talisman?

344
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,290
I'm not going to let you disappear as
you wish, and leave me confused anymore.

345
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,820
I will hold onto it until you leave.

346
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,890
Give it to me now.

347
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,300
So now I can't even
leave whenever I want?

348
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,560
Don't you think that's being a bit unfair?

349
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,630
I'm always left waiting for someone not
knowing when they might show up.

350
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,380
This way it's fair.

351
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,880
<i>Hyeong.
(Hyeong - older brother)</i>

352
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,150
<i>I came to pick up Hui Jin.</i>

353
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,020
<i>Come here to pick me up.</i>

354
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,490
Where else would she be
if she's not hiding at home?

355
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,700
Didn't you go outside?
You're really a player.

356
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,700
By calling me a player so often,
you're making me into one.

357
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,440
But, that friend came.

358
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,040
Who?

359
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,570
Your boyfriend.

360
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:58,980
What?

361
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,510
Why is he here?

362
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,510
He should be at the club.

363
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,700
Hui Jin.

364
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,790
Where's the talisman?

365
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,190
Don't go. You don't need to go.

366
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,660
He can't come in.

367
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,130
<i>Choe Hui Jin.</i>

368
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,670
Although I feel apologetic,

369
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,670
if I don't answer he'll probably leave.

370
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,940
Seems like he's opening the door...

371
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,170
Choe Hui Jin.

372
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,020
Aigoo, what happened inside of this house...
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)

373
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,780
Hui Jin. Hui Jin.

374
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,900
Hey, Choe Hui Jin!

375
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,840
What is it?

376
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,770
You were at home,
why didn't you open the door?

377
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:12,520
I was falling asleep.

378
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,180
Why did you come?

379
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,920
I came here worried because I
couldn't contact our Hui Jin.

380
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,530
I left first because I was a bit tired.
What is there to worry about?

381
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,130
But the security code, how did--

382
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,070
I asked Su Gyeong, of course.

383
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,420
Hey, she's your manager she didn't
even know where you went to.

384
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,670
Sitting alone drinking alcohol,

385
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,140
does that make sense?

386
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,810
I secretly sneaked out,
of course she has no clue.

387
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,280
Even so,

388
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,420
if you're leaving, can't you
at least say something?

389
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,090
Are you going to keep
ignoring me like this?

390
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,620
There were too many people around earlier,
so I couldn't tell you. Sorry.

391
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,160
Let's go out. Let's go out.

392
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,360
Why?

393
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,160
Let's go to the coffee shop next door.

394
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,760
Why? It's pretty nice here.

395
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,230
It's too messy in here.

396
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,570
When was it ever clean?

397
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,170
I have something to tell you.

398
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,510
Can't you say it here?

399
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,710
It's not something I can say here.

400
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,980
It's serious.

401
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,710
But I don't want to
hear anything serious.

402
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,250
I said I have something to tell you.

403
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,250
Can't I hear about it tomorrow?

404
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,820
Ah, so cold!

405
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,060
What's this?

406
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,530
Is your place leaking somewhere?

407
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,130
Is it?

408
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,670
What kind of house still leaks?
It's not even raining.

409
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,530
Occasionally it's like this.

410
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,670
Maybe something is wrong
with the water drainage.

411
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,670
Where are you going?

412
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,890
Ah, it's cold!

413
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,420
What is this? Who is doing this?

414
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,960
Seems like it really is broken.

415
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,160
Frequently, there's a lot
of water like this.

416
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,360
Where? I don't see it.

417
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,770
It always comes pouring down just like
this whenever there's a rain water.

418
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,770
It doesn't seem to be here.
It's that side right?

419
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,640
Look! Your clothes are wet. What to do?

420
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,840
Is this sponsored?

421
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,180
- Wipe it quickly.
- Wait.

422
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,780
Where is this hole?

423
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,920
Go. I'll wipe.

424
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,720
What should we do?

425
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,130
Here, we have to wipe it quickly.

426
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,930
Hey, how can your house be like this?
Move out immediately.

427
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,080
Yes, that's right.

428
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,870
Wipe it neatly then come out.

429
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,210
Do you know you're unexpectedly childish?

430
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,280
I'm only curious as to what it does,
I was simply exploring.

431
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,220
What is this used for?

432
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,960
What are you going to do about him?

433
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,560
It's not his fault.

434
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,430
He doesn't know anything.

435
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,100
It looks like I punished the wrong person.

436
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,170
You're the one who's giving
your heart to two men.

437
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,500
What are you saying? Are you
saying that I'm having an affair?

438
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,910
I didn't do anything wrong!

439
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,840
I'm like this because of you, but
you say that I'm two-timing?

440
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,580
Compared to marrying the Prime Minister's daughter,
I'm much more innocent than you are.

441
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,320
Prime Minister's daughter?

442
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,850
How do you know about this?

443
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,260
Do you think there's anything that
isn't in the historical records?

444
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,920
I'm always watching you. What's wrong?

445
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,530
You must be very happy.

446
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,660
This is the opportunity you've been
hoping for to improve your status.

447
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,260
Plus, they say she's a peerless beauty.

448
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,530
To be honest,

449
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,940
looks like I should be
the one getting angry.

450
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,750
Can I take responsibility for you?

451
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,430
How?

452
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,310
I'll come again after considering it,

453
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,040
how I should take responsibility.

454
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,510
Just to see Queen In Hyeon's face,

455
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,050
I risked my life to come here.

456
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,580
What else can I not do?

457
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,060
You practiced this beforehand, didn't you?

458
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,400
You talk too well, how unlucky.

459
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,270
I wanted to meet you too,
with a more stylish appearance,

460
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,130
but I just ended up taking
off my clothes. Darn it.

461
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,340
Where's the talisman?

462
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,450
I'll be the one to take responsibility.

463
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,850
Just make sure to keep
your promises from now on.

464
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,790
Hey, Hui Jin!

465
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,390
You'll come again tomorrow, right?

466
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,130
Hey, move to a new
apartment immediately.

467
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,800
You're a leading actress,
does this make any sense?

468
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,270
Aigoo, really. I will let Cheon Su
have a look into it.

469
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,740
It's okay, I'll figure it out by myself.

470
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,480
More importantly,
I have something to say to you.

471
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
How can you live in this kind of house?

472
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,280
Water rushing down like some waterfall.

473
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,690
Let's break up.

474
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,760
What did you say?

475
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

476
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,660
Let's break up.

477
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,070
What did you just say?

478
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,470
I don't know how
to make you understand.

479
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,610
There's a person I used
to meet in the old days,

480
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,410
who suddenly showed up. So...

481
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,210
Someone who you've dated
before showed up again?

482
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,210
- Isn't that me?
- No, not you.

483
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,350
It was long before
we started dating again.

484
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,360
A man in your dreams wasn't enough,

485
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,090
now yet another man shows up?

486
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,560
You're not even just saying let's break up,

487
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,290
you're making all these excuses?

488
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,900
- It's that man.
- Who?

489
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,230
The man from my dream.

490
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,500
I thought it wasn't a dream,
and sure enough it wasn't one.

491
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,370
How should I explain this exactly?

492
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,910
It seems that I lost
a certain part of my memory.

493
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,070
What is it called... Amnesia?

494
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,580
Just understand and accept it as that,
that way you'll feel better.

495
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,790
At any rate, I started to see him again.

496
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,660
If you were to ask how long has it been,

497
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,330
that would be difficult to explain.

498
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,860
Anyway, it was before I started seeing you again.
It is definitely not a simultaneous meeting.

499
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,870
No matter what, I'm sorry
things turned out this way.

500
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,270
I also can't keep on deceiving you.

501
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,010
Hey! My patience has its limits too!

502
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,480
Because you fell sick after the accident,
I have been enduring all this while.

503
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,020
You! Don't you know I have a temper?

504
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,650
Even knowing how my temper has
been recently, you're doing this now?

505
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,120
So right now, who are you seeing?

506
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,230
That fellow called Gim Bung Do
from your dream

507
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,430
really appeared? Yes? Is it like this?
Is that what you're saying now?

508
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,830
From where? Where did
he suddenly appear from?

509
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:22,270
That...it's said to be very far way,
so there is no way of contacting him.

510
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,380
Bring him here. If I can see him with
my own eyes, I'll try to reconsider.

511
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,050
You keep talking nonsensical stuff
about someone who's non-existent.

512
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,650
If he really appears,
what are you going to do?

513
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,580
What you mean what to do? Will I
not care? I will kill him of course.

514
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,520
Bring him to me, that punk.
Ask him to come here right away!

515
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:41,790
It's not like I'm lying. I have been saying
this from the start. I can't forget that person.

516
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,190
Stop saying things
that don't make sense!

517
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,870
Didn't I quietly let you go before?

518
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,470
What did you say?

519
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,540
When you were two-timing.
Didn't I let you leave?

520
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,340
I never said a thing.
Didn't you say that it was cool?

521
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,740
Weren't you the one who told
me to be cool for once?

522
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,880
That when you really meet the one you love,
to be honest to your own feelings.

523
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,280
You said that it was better than
telling a lie, didn't you say that?

524
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,360
All that was your words, that's why
I'm honestly speaking right now...

525
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,030
Just because we switched
places, words changed--

526
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,340
Hey! Until when are you
going to bring those up?

527
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,900
Then, are you telling me that
you want to get back at me?

528
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,700
Is that why you started
seeing me again? You're really...

529
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,770
What the hell?

530
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:33,640
Hey! Until when are you
going to bring those up?

531
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,540
Then, you're really getting back at me?

532
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,480
Is that why you started
seeing me again? You're really...

533
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,150
What the hell?

534
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,550
You haven't left yet?

535
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,620
When you said that you'll take
responsibility, I felt uneasy.

536
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,290
I've done so many
things in order to save you.

537
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,020
You don't understand men.

538
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,090
What are you? Why... there...

539
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,900
Is that the punk, Gim Bung Do?

540
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,230
I am Gim Bung Do. I was also the
one who sprayed the water, sorry.

541
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,310
Bastard. You're dead.

542
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:22,070
I've always thought your easily
provoked nature was a problem.

543
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,020
How could you let your
emotions get to you?

544
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,660
Get away from Hui Jin. Bastard.

545
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,470
What is with you? Bastard.

546
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,300
You're that Gim Bung Do? Bastard.

547
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,380
It's fate that every time
we meet, we fight.

548
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,860
What? Fate?

549
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,620
I tolerated you twice. There's
no need for a third time.

550
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,090
This is golden advice, you should avoid it as you see fit.
I'll let you know the appropriate method. This way.

551
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,100
What nonsense is this
bastard saying? Really.

552
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,250
No, you better put that down.

553
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,900
Why are you being like this,
let's talk it out with words.

554
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,340
You judge well. You'll be safest there.

555
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:54,810
Bastard. Who are you?
What is with you? Really.

556
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,480
Didn't I say that I'm Gim Bung Do?

557
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,420
Hey, Hui Jin is my lover. Bastard.

558
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,160
The whole world knows and you
dare to suddenly appear. Bastard.

559
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,620
How can there be such acts?

560
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:16,430
Jumping into... what you
say isn't wrong. Hold on.

561
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,970
What do you call it when
you steal a man's woman?

562
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,080
What do men here say when
they steal another man's woman?

563
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,120
I apologize. Let me start again.

564
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:43,650
Of course, it's not wrong to say that I've butted in,
but if we consider it carefully, I was here first.

565
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,990
What?

566
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,400
Furthermore, just because there's a goalkeeper,
doesn't mean you can't score a goal.

567
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,740
It would have been great if we had settled this nicer,
but since things already turned out this way,

568
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,010
rest here and calm down a bit.

569
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:05,010
I'm going crazy.

570
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,670
I memorized that and recited it to him,

571
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,290
but what is a goalkeeper?

572
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,250
- Let's go out.
- Go out where?

573
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,680
We can't let him stay
there forever, right?

574
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,960
If we release him,
he's going to be mad again.

575
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,770
Su Gyeong will come and release him.

576
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,640
We don't have to run away.

577
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,540
I said let's go.

578
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,850
Taking away the talisman and saying
let's go out, what exactly is your plan?

579
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,650
I already said I'm not very smart.
Don't keep asking me questions.

580
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,520
I think my head's going
to explode, seriously.

581
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:54,000
I heard your ceiling is leaking.
What are you going to do about fixing it?

582
00:44:55,330 --> 00:45:00,140
Leaking? This is the first
time I've heard of it.

583
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,010
How can that be? He said the water is
leaking wildly like a waterfall.

584
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:08,540
What? What is it now?

585
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,150
Sometimes the water doesn't come out from
the tap very well, but we've never had a leak.

586
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,020
It's Dong Min oppa.

587
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:28,560
Hello? Ah yes, Oppa, I'm on my
way with Cheon Su right now.

588
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:36,710
Locked up? Where?
What? Gim Bung Do?

589
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,920
Some bastard called
Gim Bung Do just suddenly appeared,

590
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,850
and I get locked up here. What?
What was it that he said?

591
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,790
Something about, can a goal not be made
even though there's a goalkeeper?

592
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,330
After he said that, he left with Hui Jin.

593
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:01,930
What does that person look like?
Is he really tall, by any chance?

594
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:09,140
He's someone you know?
So you also knew about this?

595
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,270
That Hui Jin was two-timing?

596
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,680
All that stuff about him being from a dream,
are you the one who made that up?

597
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,550
It's not like that.
She's not two-timing.

598
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,620
Ah, but it's so hard to explain.

599
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,690
But, he left with Hui Jin?
Where did they go?

600
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,490
How would I know where they went?
That guy just left me locked up here.

601
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,230
Here! In the bathroom!

602
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,300
Yes, we'll come right away.

603
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,370
What happened?
What was that about two-timing?

604
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,980
No, it's not like that.

605
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,720
What is this? Really! Am I crazy?

606
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:04,390
Look, look at me. Do I look crazy?

607
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,240
Yes.

608
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,400
Are two guests staying overnight?

609
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,740
No, just one.

610
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,140
Looks like there is a man.

611
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,810
That man is staying by himself.
I'm going to leave right away.

612
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,700
Fine.

613
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,360
Here's the key. If it's shut, you won't
be able to go in so don't lose it.

614
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,370
There's a fridge, of course.
That thing, that's the fridge, got it?

615
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,370
You can use this phone. There should be
instructions somewhere in here.

616
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,040
Here. Now you should be able
to read some hangul, right?

617
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,180
Here. If you turn it towards the
red line, there will be hot water.

618
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,250
Same goes for the bathroom.
Don't be an idiot and burn yourself.

619
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,460
Also, feel free to use anything here
because there's no extra charge.

620
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,730
Right, do you know this kettle?

621
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,660
This one is very simple. See this button?

622
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,800
Here, it turns on the water.
Then, press this.

623
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:20,200
Are you... letting me sleep here by myself?

624
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,740
What can we do?
Everything's a mess right now.

625
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,150
I have to go back and clean
up the mess we made.

626
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,150
I'll come again tomorrow morning
when there's no filming.

627
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,960
But, I don?t think
I will be able to sleep.

628
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,240
How could just leave me to this
long, long night by myself?

629
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,430
What?

630
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,560
You?re leaving me in this strange place.

631
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,770
And you even
took my talisman away.

632
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,310
Don't tell me you're really going to go?

633
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,380
If you're bored,
you can just watch the TV.

634
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:09,990
There are many interesting things.

635
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,590
Right, they're showing my drama again.

636
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,590
I don't know how much of
my bare face will come out--

637
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,420
What are you doing?
I have regained my sanity.

638
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,220
We shouldn?t be doing this
right now with no plan.

639
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,950
We still have many issues to settle.

640
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,490
Didn't you say that my impulsive
personality was a big problem?

641
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,960
Looks like I forgot to tell you something.

642
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,360
What?

643
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,770
That impulsiveness of
yours is very attractive.

644
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:58,430
Player.

645
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:07,600
I didn't know it at first, but I think
I really am a player. I admit it.

646
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:02,170
-=Next Episode Preview=-

647
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,110
This place where I live has
become the past to me.

648
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,130
We have to take that talisman
and kill that fellow.

649
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,660
There is no reason to fail
because of one talisman.

650
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:19,230
You didn't have an affair and you didn't lie,
but things turned out this way?

651
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,720
Who are you kidding?

652
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,490
It seemed like he wanted
to go to the new world.

653
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,730
Even if there's only one person
who can remember me,

654
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,740
that life would be different,right?
