1
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,040
Ja Su, you know how important this is,

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,040
yet you still utter nonsense.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,810
The importance of this,
I clearly understand it.

4
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,380
But, I saw it with my own eyes.

5
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,920
I was about to stab him in the neck,

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,020
but he just completely vanished.

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,090
He surely has not left the palace yet.

8
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,530
I will call the officers.
You find your own way out.

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:56,070
Might as well just put all the blame on him.

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,010
Otherwise, how is it possible to capture
him in a palace of this size?

11
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,050
This is not possible.

12
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,720
What are you doing?
Hurry and disappear.

13
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:20,030
I thought he was just an incompetent scholar.

14
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,330
Exactly what tactics did he use?

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,970
Excuse me.

16
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,540
What role are you playing?

17
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,540
What role are you playing?

18
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,750
I'm also one of the actors in this drama,

19
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,520
Queen In Hyeon.

20
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,790
I am Queen In Hyeon.

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,330
You've not heard yet, right?
It was just recently decided.

22
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,990
Thirty minutes ago.

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,900
Because it's not publicly announced yet,
I'm actually not supposed to tell you.

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,240
But, I'm really so happy that I can't hold it in.

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,040
Please keep it to yourself.

26
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,640
Right, please have some of these.

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,880
I've bought some snacks.

28
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,950
Do you not like donuts?

29
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,630
Excuse me, are you not
an actor for this drama?

30
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,040
Excuse me, are you okay?

31
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,580
- Excuse me, do you possibly know...
- Sorry?

32
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,390
Whether I am dead or whether I am dreaming?

33
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,990
Sorry?

34
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,970
Are you seriously asking me
because you are curious?

35
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,370
I am seriously curious about this.

36
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,540
Then, please don't be angry,

37
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,870
since you wanted an answer.

38
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:16,680
The way I see it,
you're neither dead nor dreaming.

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,350
It's more like you've been drinking too much.

40
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,460
It's not... That's just the way I see it.

41
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,930
I'm not saying that
you really did drink a lot.

42
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,700
Looks like you didn't catch my joke.

43
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,210
What I meant was,
your question was a bit strange.

44
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,210
What I said wasn't serious.

45
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,940
Miss Choe Hui Jin?

46
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,640
Yes?

47
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,010
The Director said to wait another 10 minutes.

48
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,850
Okay, I will be right here.

49
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,690
What's this?

50
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,820
Leaving without a word.

51
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,430
He really must be crazy.

52
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:07,960
Si. Do. Tong. Rae. Gan. Pil. Gu. In.

53
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,610
<i>Who dares to use a sword in the palace?</i>

54
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,750
<i>This is clearly a conspiracy.</i>

55
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,620
<i>You must certainly find this fellow.</i>

56
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,990
Surely he has not yet left the palace.

57
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,670
Give me my sword.

58
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,770
Lord of Doctrines,

59
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,470
something unforeseen has happened
in the palace. No one is allowed to leave.

60
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,840
Even I can't leave?

61
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,710
For now, you can only wait here.

62
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,410
I did not wear my official uniform,
yet you let me enter.

63
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,080
If others were to find out about this,

64
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,750
then you will be kicked out of the palace,
not being able to say anything for yourselves.

65
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,220
Pardon?

66
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,420
It was you who said that it
was a royal order, so we...

67
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,950
We are doing this for your sake--

68
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,220
I do not wish to hear your excuses.

69
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,260
All I ask is for you to keep your mouths
shut and tell no one I was here.

70
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,790
Quickly hand me my sword!

71
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,730
No matter who asks,
don't tell them that you have seen me tonight.

72
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,100
That is the only way you will both live.
Do you understand?

73
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

74
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,640
<i>Your Majesty, congratulations to you.</i>

75
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,950
Congratulations on your enthronement as the Queen.

76
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,260
May you continue to prosper, Your Majesty.

77
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,430
Thank you, Court Lady Jo.

78
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,330
If Your Majesty is successful,
only then will I be successful.

79
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,970
I knew that this day would come,

80
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,270
that's why I have always
been loyal to Your Majesty.

81
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,110
However, it has been a worrisome day.

82
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,180
You and I were always meant to prosper.

83
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,910
This is not by heavenly blessings nor natural causes.

84
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,110
From now on, we must keep going forward.

85
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,920
You are right, Your Majesty.

86
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,850
Let's have a toast.

87
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,420
I want to use English.

88
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,420
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

89
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,930
Always using the royal language
has finally paid off.

90
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,370
You weren't even cast as a supporting role,

91
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,840
how did you manage to become
the lead actress right away?

92
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,140
Awesome!

93
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,510
You're funny.

94
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,740
Didn't you say that if I am acting
with Han Dong Min as Suk Jong,

95
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,040
that I should absolutely not do it?

96
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,340
Now that it's done,
why are you so happy?

97
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,480
Hey, really...

98
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,950
That was only to comfort you.

99
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,810
Isn't it better if it's Han Dong Min?

100
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,580
Honestly speaking,
there is a feeling of misfortune.

101
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,850
But working together with Han Dong Min,
there's a chance to earn more money.

102
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,160
The recent trend is Han Dong Min.

103
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,400
It's all right if I don't
make money immediately.

104
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,960
It is only just the beginning now.

105
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,030
Don't even think of making me confused.
I won't be.

106
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,000
You sure know how to joke, Your Majesty.

107
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,370
First of all, you can let
out a sigh of relief...

108
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,840
but in the future, I'm going to give
you a good amount of intense training.

109
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,180
All this while, always being unemployed,

110
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,580
that's why I'll make proper use of you.

111
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,250
Really... do it right.

112
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,350
Here, here. Eat this too.

113
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,960
Who can it be, this late?

114
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,630
Who are you?

115
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,730
=Are you Su Gyeong?=

116
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,230
Who are you?

117
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,530
=I'm Dong Min oppa.=
(Oppa - older brother, boyfriend)

118
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,970
Who?

119
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,870
Hey, it's Han Dong Min.

120
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,000
What?

121
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,010
Omo, it's really Dong Min oppa.
(Omo - oh my)

122
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,450
Hi, it's been a long time.

123
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,220
Why are you here at this hour?

124
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,520
Hui Jin did not answer my call.

125
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,020
I have something to say to her.

126
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,360
What? What...

127
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,860
The Director said that he wanted to
give Queen In Hyeon's role to Hui Jin,

128
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,600
but I'm just a little hesitant.

129
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,100
Sorry?

130
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,340
What is it?

131
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,970
What are they talking about?

132
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,880
Why did he come?

133
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,180
Really...

134
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,450
Never thought there would
be this kind of circumstance.

135
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,620
What?

136
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,950
He doesn't seem to think
you fit as Queen In Hyeon.

137
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,820
What should we do?

138
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,760
That bastard is really,
right to the end...

139
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,330
Wait... the Director, Chief and
President have all selected me.

140
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,860
Who is he to say that
he's not happy with it?

141
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,560
Hey, how can you say it like that?

142
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,600
This is regarding Han Dong Min's partner,

143
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
of course he has the right
to have a word in this.

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,570
If he insists that he's not willing...

145
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,040
This is also a serious problem.

146
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,010
First, start a conversation and try
to communicate for a while.

147
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,210
He said he called you,
but you did not pick up.

148
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,510
Go out. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

149
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,280
What should I say?

150
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,420
When I went for the audition,
I didn't know Han Dong Min was involved.

151
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,820
Why do I need his permission?

152
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,990
Who is he?

153
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,990
Isn't he the King?

154
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,660
Really...

155
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,980
I didn't know that you were
living here all this while.

156
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,450
Seems like there's not a
single penny left since then?

157
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,780
The flower pot that I gave
to you before, where is it?

158
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,880
My autograph is even on there.

159
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,650
Because there was somebody else.
So the gift given by an ex-lover,

160
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,090
if I still had it,
wouldn't that make me a crazy girl?

161
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,290
You... How did you know
what I was going to say?

162
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,490
I called you out and you refused.

163
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,660
When did our relationship turn into a "when I call
you out, you must come out" kind of relationship?

164
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,100
A person who hasn't called for the past 2 years,

165
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,700
isn't this laughable?

166
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,870
A rookie becoming Queen
In Hyeon is not bad at all.

167
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,340
For me, it's no big deal if
she is my ex-girlfriend either.

168
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,970
Then why are you being a stump?

169
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,540
No matter what, what you lack
in your acting makes me worried.

170
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,510
- What?
- Doesn't everyone know about your bad acting?

171
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,920
Omo, how long ago was that?

172
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,180
Didn't you see earlier?
Everyone was praising me.

173
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,820
That short sentence, just by memorizing,
anyone could have acted it out well.

174
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,220
This is a 50 episode sageuk, can you continue acting?
(Sageuk - Korean historical drama)

175
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,660
It won't be long before your
true nature is unmasked.

176
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,530
- I'm not the old Choe Hui Jin.
- What's different about Choe Hui Jin--

177
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,500
So...

178
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,900
Are you asking me to clean up now?

179
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,700
It will be determined based on flaws. Here.

180
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,040
I've told the Director that it will be decided

181
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,840
based on flaws.

182
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,610
See page 78.

183
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,440
You came to my house just to see my acting?

184
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,450
If only one person acts, it will be very awkward.

185
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,480
I will act with you.

186
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,720
Isn't this too much?

187
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,690
No matter what, the lead actors--

188
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,390
Quickly. I'm also a very busy person.

189
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,260
They're waiting for me downstairs.

190
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,090
I'm starting.

191
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,660
Why not criticize my hastiness?

192
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,330
Why are you always enduring it?

193
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,670
My Queen. My Queen...

194
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,080
Hurry and give me an answer, My Queen.

195
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,680
I was not able to find the right
moment because of foolishness.

196
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,320
Please b-b-blame me for my foolishness.

197
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,590
Was it really because you
couldn't find the right moment,

198
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,860
or were you pretending not to know?

199
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,160
How could I...

200
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,860
I am a sinner, Your Majesty.

201
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,670
Come...

202
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,600
Come...
-=She does not approach him=-

203
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,830
-=She does not approach him=-

204
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,000
Didn't I tell you to come over?

205
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,740
If My Queen will not come,
should I come closer?

206
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,480
What? Don't come any closer.
Aren't we just reading the script?

207
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,380
Should we start seeing each other again?

208
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,410
What did you say?

209
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
How about we start dating again?

210
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,350
The entertainment channel that you're always watching,

211
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,420
there have been no more
scandals about me lately, right?

212
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,290
I've had no contacts recently.

213
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,460
This is all your fault.

214
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,460
In fact, since earlier on...

215
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,660
the way you laugh,
has always been stuck in my head.

216
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,160
That's why I couldn't continue acting.

217
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,370
Looks like you still see me as a fool. However...

218
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,910
Your flaws seems fine.

219
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,210
Okay, I like it.

220
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,210
Passed!

221
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,390
This bastard... seriously.

222
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,590
Hey, you ass...

223
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,800
Hyeong, start the car.
(Hyeong - older brother)

224
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,830
What...

225
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,200
Quickly, hurry.

226
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,540
You're really...

227
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,310
Choe Hui Jin, Queen In Hyeon is yours!

228
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,680
What did you say?

229
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,220
I said, Queen In Hyeon is yours!

230
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,690
It's mine even if you don't appoint me!

231
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,260
Queen In Hyeon was originally mine!

232
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,460
How irritating.

233
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,700
Hey, what are you doing exactly?

234
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,400
We haven't even signed the contract yet,

235
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,430
and you're already entering an actress' house.

236
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,800
Do you want to create a scandal?

237
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,470
Hyeong. Hyeong,

238
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,840
It's been a while since
my heart beat like this.

239
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,670
What?

240
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,710
Don't mention heartbeats.
Whenever you say that, I break out in a cold sweat.

241
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,650
Thinking about the past...

242
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,550
That was the best time.

243
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,660
Hey, hey, hey.

244
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,900
Why did he leave so fast?

245
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,900
I'm speechless, seriously.

246
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,630
What did he say?

247
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,300
I've been completely deceived.

248
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,670
I should have reported him to the police.

249
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,040
He thinks I'm still the old Choe Hui Jin...

250
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,910
It's seriously hilarious.

251
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,810
What are you saying?
Did something happen?

252
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,440
Fortune and misfortune have come together.

253
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,680
Seriously...

254
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,650
<i>Do you not like donuts?</i>

255
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,720
But, who was he really?

256
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,890
He didn't look like an actor...

257
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,060
<i>Do you possibly know,</i>

258
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,630
<i>whether I am dead or whether I am dreaming?</i>

259
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,400
That's right.

260
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Even his way of talking was weird.

261
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,640
It was completely a sageuk way of talking.

262
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,210
He must have gone crazy because he wanted
to become an actor so badly but he didn't get it.

263
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,150
So that's why he wore those clothes and
came to the filming site to say lines?

264
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,290
How pitiful, pitiful...

265
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,050
<i>All possible hiding places have been inspected,</i>

266
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,520
but there is nothing.

267
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,890
Furthermore, we have observed
the movements of the people,

268
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,190
but it seems as though no one
knows about this incident.

269
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,900
In other words, the officer did such a great act alone?

270
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,900
Is it not His Majesty's wish?

271
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,570
Using this competition as an excuse,

272
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,180
there has been a lot of friction recently.

273
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,320
He is surely acting according to His Majesty's orders.

274
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,190
It was unwise to let Gim Bung Do go.

275
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,790
Did he not lose all of his family members?

276
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,490
<i>Criminals shall consume poison.</i>

277
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,930
<i>Heavens, what is this?</i>

278
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,470
<i>Your Excellency, Your Excellency.</i>

279
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,600
<i>Please wake up, Your Excellency.</i>

280
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,410
<i>Omo, omo, Your Excellency.</i>

281
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,550
Soon, he will certainly harbor hatred in his heart.

282
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,360
He is but a scholar.
How is it that he knows martial arts?

283
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,590
He acts according to His Majesty's orders...

284
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,970
His Majesty wants to attack me first.

285
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,270
<i>My Lord, it is Ja Su.</i>

286
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,270
Come in.

287
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,710
Is there new information?

288
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,580
Yes.

289
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,950
While investigating the people of Gim Bung Do,

290
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,980
we have found a special person.

291
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,680
Special person?

292
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,350
Who is it?

293
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,630
<i>The length of time that
one goes far into the future.</i>

294
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,170
<i>The opening that can infallibly save a person.</i>

295
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,450
How are you feeling?

296
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,820
I am better.

297
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,190
Forgive me for always having to trouble you.

298
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,790
You're always able to give me a fright.

299
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,130
When Yun Wol worried about you,
I thought it was all over.

300
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,230
How nice.
I just wanted to ask you something.

301
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,370
Yun Wol gave me this talisman.

302
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,640
What does it mean?

303
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:21,910
The length of time that
one goes far into the future.

304
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,480
The length of time that
one goes far into the future.

305
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,580
The opening that can infallibly save a person.

306
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:28,900
The opening that can infallibly save a person.

307
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,750
It has a very refined meaning.

308
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,120
A refined meaning?

309
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,490
I'm not too sure.
It is Master who wrote this.

310
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,460
He has gone to meditate.

311
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,330
Is that so?

312
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,730
But, why are you interested in the talisman?

313
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,000
Honestly, I have faced a very strange situation.

314
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,140
A strange situation?

315
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,580
<i>At first, I thought I had died,
but I was never dead.</i>

316
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,320
<i>Later on, I thought I was dreaming, but I wasn't.</i>

317
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:15,030
<i>Gan. Pil. Gu. Ni.</i>

318
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,070
I have not slept, yet I am normal.

319
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,570
How should I explain this?

320
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,470
It is a rather strange matter.

321
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,200
What I have seen is so
strange that it is hard to forget.

322
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,440
It will not leave my mind.

323
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,940
Even then, I am still envious of you.

324
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,280
Perhaps consider it as seeing the Immortal World.

325
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,450
Although it was brief,
it looks like you have seen a fairy there.

326
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,850
A fairy?

327
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm curious as to why you are laughing.

328
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,130
Although I have seen a woman,
her attitude is...

329
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,470
I do not think I have met a fairy.
She is not one.

330
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,600
If a fairy had that kind of look,

331
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,870
then the Immortal World is not immortal.

332
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,640
Even if you do not tell me details,
I can still understand.

333
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,140
I will be leaving when it becomes dark.

334
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,750
Please take care of your body.

335
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,780
You must think about your family.

336
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,020
This is something I am doing because of the family.

337
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,220
You have already experienced a lot of things.

338
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,360
No matter what,
it seems like the talisman saved my life.

339
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,130
Looks like I have to keep it well.

340
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,630
Just as you have said.
After experiencing a lot,

341
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,330
it feels like there is nothing
that cannot happen in one's life.

342
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,970
It also seems like nothing can be trusted.

343
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,900
About Yun Wol...

344
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,870
I will not tell her that you have come,
please do not worry.

345
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,440
If she knew you were wounded,

346
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,840
she might give you a hundred more talismans.

347
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,280
Yun Wol.

348
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,020
Omo. Your Excellency, My Lord.

349
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,130
Without any notice, did you need anything?

350
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,970
All this while, I was too
busy and unable to see you.

351
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,100
I've missed hearing the sound of your voice.

352
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,240
My Lord.

353
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,310
Yes. What song were you playing?

354
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,740
Let's hear it.

355
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,270
Gim Bung Do, this name...

356
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,310
Pardon?

357
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,910
Do you know Officer Gim Bung Do
of the Office of Special Advisers?

358
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,950
Officer of the Office of Special Advisers?

359
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,360
It seems that I have seen him a several times.

360
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,690
He came by several times with a few men.

361
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,490
You are good at telling lies.

362
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,660
Pardon?

363
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,370
I heard that you were the slave
girl of Gim Bung Do's late wife.

364
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,640
I just found out today that both of
you have an unexpected relationship.

365
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,210
That, you are wrong.

366
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,550
How could I... just a slave girl?

367
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,390
Our crucial matter is unexpectedly
facing destruction in your hands.

368
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,390
It is unimaginable.

369
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,760
You have misunderstood, Your Excellency.

370
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,290
I do not know where you heard such words.

371
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,290
What if I found out the person unexpectedly
framing me was in my house?

372
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,630
I would possibly have compassion on them.

373
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,070
You are really a very crafty bitch!

374
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,870
Come in!

375
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,010
- Yes!
- Yes!

376
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,210
Your Excellency, My Lord.

377
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,510
Tie her up.

378
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

379
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,980
Why are you doing this?

380
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,420
In order to capture Gim Bung Do,
I must capture you first.

381
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:11,360
I must let him know that he
certainly left you to die at my hands.

382
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,390
Seeing how much he cherishes you,
he will certainly come to find you.

383
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,770
That is a misunderstanding. I am just
a slave girl. Who would care for me?

384
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,140
Unbelievable. This is a trap, My Lord!

385
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,900
<i>My Lord.</i>

386
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,150
According to your orders,
we have imprisoned her,

387
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,550
and told the servants to
keep an eye on her properly.

388
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,580
She didn't resist?

389
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,850
Yes.

390
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,520
You can leave now.

391
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,050
<i>His Royal Majesty has arrived.</i>

392
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,230
<i>Exactly how many days has it been?</i>

393
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,730
<i>Have these criminals still not
admitted their treacheries?</i>

394
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:34,340
<i>Your Majesty, among them, please give
unconditional forgiveness to Gim Bung Do.</i>

395
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,710
<i>What does that mean?</i>

396
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:42,980
<i>He was not aware of his father's crimes.</i>

397
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,320
<i>Unknowingly, the whole household
has received the same punishment.</i>

398
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,390
<i>Gim Bung Do is their only son.</i>

399
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,990
<i>Please have compassion on their family,
and give him an unconditional forgiveness.</i>

400
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,860
<i>Do you really mean it?</i>

401
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,930
<i>I am sincere, Your Majesty.</i>

402
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,770
<i>Why did you let him go?</i>

403
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,110
<i>Doing such a useless act.</i>

404
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:19,420
<i>Your Majesty, Gim Bung Do is one
of His Majesty's favorite courtiers.</i>

405
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,720
<i>If he were to be exiled now,</i>

406
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,390
<i>His Majesty would still sympathize
with him even after punishing him.</i>

407
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,560
<i>Your Majesty should understand
His Majesty's intention and sympathize with him.</i>

408
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,840
<i>That is what suits the kind
heart of Your Majesty, isn't it?</i>

409
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,240
<i>It will also be of great value
to placating the people's heart.</i>

410
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,040
<i>Will it really be like this?</i>

411
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,050
<i>The fatherless Gim Bung Do
is just a bird without wings.</i>

412
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:50,380
<i>Giving him an official position,</i>

413
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,820
<i>as a benevolence by the court,
is also an important act of respect.</i>

414
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,090
<i>Now, there is nothing he
can accomplish on his own.</i>

415
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,960
<i>Please do not worry.</i>

416
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,510
<i>Everything is My Lord's favor.</i>

417
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,680
<i>Someday, I will surely return your favor.</i>

418
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,020
<i>There's no need to mention anything about favor.</i>

419
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,800
<i>Soon, he will certainly harbor hatred in his heart.</i>

420
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,210
<i>He is but a scholar.
How is it that he knows martial arts?</i>

421
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,880
What a really foolish person...

422
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,080
<i>Stop.</i>

423
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,880
<i>Do you not like it?</i>

424
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,250
<i>Then I shall prepare another song to play.</i>

425
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:36,620
<i>From the first time I saw you,
I have always felt that your face looked familiar.</i>

426
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,120
<i>Where is your hometown?</i>

427
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,090
<i>Well, that...</i>

428
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,470
<i>I am just an ordinary gisaeng.
(Gisaeng - female entertainer, prostitute)</i>

429
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,240
<i>How could I have a hometown?</i>

430
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,980
<i>After hearing that,
you have quite the sense of humor.</i>

431
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,150
<i>Unexpectedly familiar-looking,
isn't this trick only used by children?</i>

432
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,490
<i>With you in front of me,
I suddenly feel like a 19 year old.</i>

433
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,690
<i>Come closer and pour me a drink.</i>

434
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,060
<i>Ah, this girl, how dare a gisaeng be shy?</i>

435
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,130
<i>Forgive me.</i>

436
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,200
<i>Because I am in front of such a great
man like you, that is why I'm nervous.</i>

437
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,850
The sin of being older.

438
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,350
I have become foolish.

439
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,690
All you repulsive little brats, how dare you?

440
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,410
Master! Master!

441
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,210
Why are you here?

442
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,090
Yun Wol has... Yun Wol has been captured!
What should we do?

443
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,290
What did you say?

444
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,520
Did you say Yun Wol has been captured?

445
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,330
Lord of Doctrines.

446
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,290
Who did it?

447
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,660
Everyone is searching for you.

448
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,400
That is why she has been captured.

449
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,470
They do not know that you are here.

450
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,500
Who is it?

451
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,000
Is it the Right Prime Minister?

452
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,770
What about the letter?

453
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,400
Pardon?

454
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,770
They are searching for something.

455
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,570
Have they found anything?

456
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,910
I do not know. Isn't it with you?

457
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,780
=Sound of your ringtone, sound of your ringtone.
Come to your senses and answer your phone.=

458
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,280
Hello?

459
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,880
I'm preparing for the photo shoot.

460
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,320
Is Yun Na Jeong there yet?

461
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,060
No, not yet.

462
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,530
Really, why didn't they say anything?

463
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,430
Are they restraining themselves against us?

464
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,700
Hey, it can't be.
How can they be restraining against me?

465
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,100
If Lady Jang is Queen In Hyeon's rival,

466
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,900
you and Yun Na Jeong could be rivals too.

467
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,040
Becoming a star does not
depend on experience alone.

468
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,410
I don't know, don't care.

469
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,610
I just want to manage what I should do, that's all.

470
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,210
I'm so nervous.

471
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,920
Yun Na Jeong is here.

472
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,380
Hey, hey, make a proper greeting.

473
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,350
Tell her she is no joke.

474
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,690
I'm hanging up.

475
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,150
Hello.

476
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,400
Can I sit here?

477
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,330
Pardon? Ah...

478
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,940
I will go over there.

479
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,420
I wanted to give you my greeting.

480
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,480
How do you do?
I am Choe Hui Jin.

481
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,050
I will be Queen In Hyeon.

482
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,620
<i>Miss Hui Jin, over here.</i>

483
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,900
Looks like she's really tired.

484
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,980
<i>Again. Look far away.</i>

485
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,020
<i>Look far away, again.</i>

486
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,250
Richly...

487
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,920
Queen In Hyeon, please go in.

488
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,130
Oh, my wife.

489
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,960
Now, I'm taking it.

490
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,500
Queen In Hyeon, please smile a little.

491
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,770
Okay, it's done.

492
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,600
Queen In Hyeon, lean your head
against King Suk Jong's shoulder.

493
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,640
Yes.

494
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,310
Be a little more natural.

495
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,210
Fine.

496
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,080
My Queen, why are you being so shy?

497
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,820
Come closer.

498
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,090
We're shooting now.

499
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,160
This is the first time I've
been so eager for a filming.

500
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,200
You do know we will be
filming every day, right?

501
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,760
I'll just have to endure it until the 25th.

502
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,830
The 25th?

503
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,370
Once Queen In Hyeon is dethroned,
there's no need to film together.

504
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,910
Mr. Writer, no matter what,
this is "New Lady Jang".

505
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,510
How about shooting a different concept?

506
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,910
Like this, or... like this?

507
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,820
Both of you are done.

508
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,660
Lady Jang, please come over here.

509
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,890
See you later.

510
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,670
Your Lady Highness has arrived?

511
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,910
What is it, really?
Pretending or what?

512
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,580
Both of you, please stand closer.

513
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,620
Because you are rivals, your backs
facing each other should be good.

514
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,520
Queen In Hyeon, please turn
to the other side as well.

515
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,660
Hold on.

516
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,030
So easily becoming a lead actress,
you must be proud.

517
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,800
What?

518
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,710
You wake up and you're already a lead, how nice.

519
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,410
I don't know what you're talking about.

520
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,680
Do you even think or don't you?

521
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,720
If someone treats you especially good,
you should think of the reason.

522
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,650
I'm going to take a shot.
Please don't move.

523
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,630
Can you please explain better?

524
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,100
Suddenly saying such things--

525
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,170
What do you mean by "such things"?
Seeing an idiot like you makes me angry.

526
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,340
Please don't turn your heads and
look at the other with a stare.

527
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,710
Did you greet her?

528
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,050
What did she say?

529
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,780
The start really wasn't good.

530
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,580
Huh? Why?

531
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,620
I think it will be very difficult
for me to work with her.

532
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,990
That's why I said she is restraining against you.

533
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,730
Competing to get the lead role,
how is it possible to have harmony?

534
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,000
This is not restraining.

535
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,530
Then what?

536
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,880
Hello everyone. I am Pak Se Il, the host
of the press conference for "New Lady Jang".

537
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,750
On such a beautiful afternoon,
I am fortunate to have so many reporters.

538
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,790
I feel very honored.

539
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,290
In 10 minutes,
we will officially start the press conference.

540
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,060
Before that, let's have a look at the preparations.

541
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,130
-=New Lady Jang=-

542
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,000
Hello.

543
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,740
Hold on a second.

544
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,420
Don't fall down when you get on stage.

545
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,190
Aren't you very susceptible to falling?

546
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,920
Did you say anything to anyone?

547
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,790
About what?

548
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,590
By chance, did you get involved after the
audition ended? About me getting selected--

549
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:11,060
Didn't you say, Queen In Hyeon is yours?

550
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,700
Originally, the percentage was slightly different.

551
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,130
That is why I helped them make the decision.

552
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,000
No matter what, I still have that much influence.

553
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,710
Who asked you to help? Who?

554
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,840
It is just as you said. If our levels are not
so different, then fans won't bother us.

555
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,050
I will make you more famous than Na Jeong.
Just wait and see.

556
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,220
<i>Mr. Dong Min.</i>

557
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,290
Yes.

558
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,490
Miss Hui Jin, we have to finish preparing.
Please come over quickly.

559
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,830
Don't be nervous.

560
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,970
I'm not nervous.

561
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,200
But you look nervous now.

562
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,140
There are still 10 minutes remaining, right?

563
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,450
Where are you going?

564
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,690
For a walk.
Because I'm too nervous.

565
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,890
When did she become such a coward?

566
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,660
Get a hold of yourself, Choe Hui Jin.

567
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,570
This is a great opportunity that
has finally come after so long.

568
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,500
Think about it later.

569
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,140
Now is not the time to be vexed.

570
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,250
What's this? Why is it suddenly so windy?

571
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,020
Are you injured?

572
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,950
I have unknowingly seen you twice.
Looks like it is really not a dream.

573
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,480
This is fake blood, right?

574
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,620
We're currently shooting, right? Right?

575
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,560
What does shooting mean?

576
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,060
The last time I asked you,
didn't you say I was drunk?

577
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,360
I never understood what that meant.

578
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,970
That's why I've been vexed for so long.

579
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,000
Just like food rots, or a person is crazy.

580
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,470
Is that what it means?

581
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,980
Right, what other meaning does it have?

582
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,910
If it is like that, then you are wrong.
I am not crazy.

583
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,520
Unknowingly in that room,
I should have died, but I am not dead.

584
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,390
I am not dead, nor am I dreaming.
Nor am I drunk, as you said.

585
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,760
So, where is this exactly?

586
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,000
<i>We have already introduced the director.</i>

587
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,930
<i>Now finally, it's time to introduce the cast.</i>

588
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,930
Mr. Han Dong Min, this side.

589
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,510
<i>This drama title is...</i>

590
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,040
Next is Miss Choe Hui Jin.

591
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,580
Why hasn't she come yet?

592
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,410
Where did Miss Choe Hui Jin go?

593
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,580
Just a moment, just a moment.

594
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,750
<i>Introducing to you, Yun Na Jeong.</i>

595
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,760
Hurry and look for Miss Choe Hui Jin.

596
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,300
Yes, j-just wait a moment.

597
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,300
This girl has gone crazy.

598
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,840
Go and look for Miss Choe Hui Jin, hurry.

599
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,770
<i>The preparation time is almost...</i>

600
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,380
<i>Taking King Suk Jong's role is Mr. Han Dong Min.</i>

601
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,690
<i>- Please look here.
- Please look here.</i>

602
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,920
<i>- Over here.
- Here</i>

603
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,230
Next is someone who will disrupt
the two's love line, the final lead role.

604
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:20,570
Giving us a fresh new face...

605
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,180
Please hold on.

606
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,920
- What is this?
- What?

607
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,230
What's wrong with her?

608
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,800
Such a troublemaker.

609
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,940
So, is this person really dead?

610
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,140
Did he really die?

611
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,150
Did I not question you first?

612
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,880
Where exactly is this place?

613
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,910
Do you see now what even
I myself cannot comprehend.

614
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,640
Perhaps, this is something
that happens here every day?

615
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,180
No.

616
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:55,400
-=Next Episode Preview=-

617
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,900
I thought he was just a scholar,
but he has extraordinary skills.

618
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,770
Not just a body, not even a trace was left behind.

619
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,810
The Gim Bung Do I know
has always been like this.

620
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,110
His nature is very despic--

621
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,650
Please do not speak slanderous words.

622
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,880
How many years have passed
since the Joseon Dynasty?

623
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,390
300 years ago.
He's a person from the Joseon Dynasty.

624
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,360
He came here traveling through time.
Not like this.

625
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,790
Are you asking me to believe in such things?

626
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,560
I am actually quickly losing my mind.

627
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,460
He's still being like this.

628
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,900
Why am I not jealous?

629
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:32,640
People like you compared to actors?
Can I still do my lines with you here?

630
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,240
You're really...

631
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,610
I don't even know why I have
to receive so much pain?
