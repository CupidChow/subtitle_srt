1
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,350
<i>I don't need this anymore,
so you can keep it for me.</i>

2
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,170
In order not to lose it,
should I find a safe place to keep it in?

3
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,510
Yes, let's just do it this way.

4
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,910
I better go to the bank tomorrow

5
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,330
What's the matter at this time of the night?

6
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,000
Were you asleep?

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,870
I was lying down to go to sleep, 
since I have to get up for filming 
early in the morning.

8
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,670
You said you usually go to bed late, 
so I thought you'd still be awake.
Sleep then.

9
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,610
It's okay, I am already awake.

10
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,550
Is anything wrong?

11
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,750
I have a question.

12
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,420
What?

13
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,820
The long hand of a watch in the 
9 position represents 45 minutes right?

14
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,490
That's right.

15
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,290
So if you divide 60 minutes into
12 portions, where each portion 
represents 5 minutes,

16
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,230
60 minutes is one hour.

17
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,630
Repeating the 12 hours,
you get 24 hours in a day.

18
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,630
1 minute has 60 seconds.
And 30 minutes is often
expressed as "half."

19
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,630
So if it's 1:30 now,
it's half past one, right?

20
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,770
Right, but do you mean to say you
haven't been able to read a clock
up till now?

21
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,710
I was only making rough guesses
so I felt a need to verify it.

22
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,510
What does Christmas mean?

23
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,650
That's the day when Jesus was born.

24
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,250
Who's Jesus?

25
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,990
Um...how do I say it.
There's something called Christianity.

26
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,720
Christianity?

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
Looks like I'll have to read a book about 
religion too.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,730
And there's something I 
was curious about since last time.

29
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,860
Words aren't written
vertically but horizontally.

30
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,130
And books are flipped
from left to right.

31
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,600
Why did it become like this?

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,070
Is there any special reason?

33
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,200
To me, this way is more awkward.

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,670
Why are you curious about so many
things in the middle of the night?

35
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,740
Aren't you tired? Get some rest.

36
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,010
I have to acclimatize as quickly as possible.

37
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,880
I can't keep doing silly things
that will be a nuisance to you.

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,950
Who said that? Why would it be a nuisance?

39
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,090
Since I came so suddenly without any preparation.

40
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,360
I have so much to learn that I'm worried.

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,830
I don't even know when I
will be able to remember all this.

42
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,500
Even if I do nothing but study, I think 
it will take me several months.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,830
Especially since reading Hangeul is 
still awkward for me.

44
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,970
- Aigoo. This nerd, this nerd. 
- Hanja has changed so much too that I think I'm going
to have to relearn it.
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god. Hanja - Chinese characters)

45
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,300
Is he planning on living in the library and
doing nothing but study every day?

46
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,480
Ah, right, the clothes you bought.

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,240
Yes, yes.

48
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,580
There's something called ties
among them. It seems like 
all working men have them on.

49
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,720
What's the reason?

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,250
You're asking why people wear ties?

51
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,390
There must be a reason, since it looks uncomfortable.

52
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,060
People wear ties just because. 
Does there have to be a special reason?

53
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,600
Just because?

54
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,140
It seems like people wear more practical
clothing here than in the past.

55
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,670
That's why I don't understand this tie.

56
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,610
The purpose of it is unclear.

57
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,810
Ah right, there is one!

58
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,880
There is a purpose for ties.
Want me to tell you?

59
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,010
What's that?

60
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,350
It's a little complicated to explain with words.

61
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,420
I'll come over now to show you.

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,690
You're coming now?

63
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,690
Hello?

64
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,380
Wasn't that quick?

65
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,190
I just moseyed over here, but it didn't 
even take 5 minutes.

66
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,060
The view is really great, isn't it?

67
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,130
The rent here is much more expensive than
my place.

68
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,000
You should know that I put a lot of thought into this.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,870
I'm very satisfied with it.

70
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,800
Of course you're satisfied. I have a very
discerning eye.

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,270
Is it so.

72
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,270
Right. Didn't you ask about the purpose of a tie?

73
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,340
Hearing that, I ran all the way here just
to show you.

74
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,950
I'm really so courteous.

75
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,350
I wasn't that curious...

76
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,820
I might not be clear on other things
but I am very positive regarding this.

77
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,690
Come here.

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,700
About this...

79
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,770
In the old days, usually the wife would tie this for
her husband when he was leaving for work.

80
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,910
So, he would stand like this, and every morning 
his wife would tie it for him.

81
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:05,050
As it was being tied, their eyes would meet
and a feeling would grow.

82
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:13,860
Then. This. 
This is called the purpose of a tie.

83
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,070
You're not even surprised.

84
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,810
Did you ask me on purpose even though
you already knew this?

85
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,940
I feel that after
listening to you,

86
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,280
everything in the world seems
to just exist for kissing.

87
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,950
What kind of a lustful world is this?

88
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,350
Yes, it really does seem that way. I hadn't
realized that.

89
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,090
So, what, do you not like it?

90
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,830
How could I not like it?
It's lustful and very good.

91
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,230
What else should I explain to you? Are you
curious about anything else?

92
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,300
Are you curious about the purpose of that stand
over there? Should I tell you?

93
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,030
I am curious.

94
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,170
To see if you'll come up with another absurd
kissing explanation.

95
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,240
Come and take a look.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,190
Aigoo. Must get up and get ready.

97
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,060
Where did she go?

98
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,460
Choe Hui Jin. Are you down there?

99
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,000
That crazy girl ran off again.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,740
Ugh, this lovey-doviness is so disgusting 
I can't watch.

101
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,010
Don't you have to leave now?

102
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,750
I can stay for 20 more minutes.
It only takes 5 minutes to get back.

103
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,370
What are you smiling at while dozing off?

104
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,910
It's amazing that we can see each other 
within just 5 minutes.

105
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,780
Isn't it amazing?

106
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,580
You used to have to make a round trip across
300 years just for us to meet once.

107
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,180
But now, we're only 5 minutes apart.

108
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,990
I really can't believe it.

109
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,400
The fact that we can see each within 5 minutes...

110
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,470
Let's go on a date tomorrow.

111
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:42,270
Since I finish filming at 3.

112
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,140
You can do some reading
in the morning.

113
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,950
The remaining time is for
you to play with me.

114
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,220
I hate model students the most.

115
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,820
Remember that.

116
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,040
Manager Han wants to treat us lunch
to show his appreciation.

117
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,490
I'm not going.

118
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,910
You are going on a date again?

119
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,980
What do you mean, "again"? We haven't
gone on a proper date yet.

120
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,700
Meeting late at night wasn't a date?

121
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,250
That was because I had something to teach, 
so I just went for a little while.

122
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,470
You must be kidding me.

123
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,450
Anyway, I am going to eat now, goodbye.

124
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,640
Have a good meal. See you
back at home.

125
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,530
Don't hang around in crowded
places and get noticed.

126
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,060
You have to be prudent. Prudent.

127
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,280
Okay, okay.

128
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,890
How did you tie it yourself? It looks great.

129
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,820
As a teacher, you keep teaching me
only weird things.

130
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,230
I had no choice but
to pick it up myself.

131
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,040
Do you want to place
your orders now?

132
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,570
Let me take a look first.

133
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,100
Yes.

134
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,440
I'll help you to order, something that won't 
stir your taste buds too severely.

135
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
I have already placed my order.

136
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
Creamy mushroom fettuccine.

137
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,650
Did you order that because you
know what it is?

138
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,780
I just casually ordered. It's not
like I will die after eating it.

139
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,530
You're regretting not accepting my 
recommendation, aren't you?

140
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,670
You thought it wasn't possible, but you 
look like you are about to die from eating.

141
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,530
Nothing of that sort.
It's delicious.

142
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,270
Why that expression if it's delicious?

143
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,940
It's so delicious that I've lost my soul.

144
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,540
Didn't you say we should go to Florence?

145
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,550
This is a staple food there. How will you
travel if you can't eat it?

146
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,880
That's why I said, it's very delicious.

147
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,760
It's delicious but you're only eating that much?

148
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,490
I am savoring it slowly because
it's so delicious.

149
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,870
Do you want to have this? 
It's not too rich.

150
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,520
One more time?

151
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,550
I think I'm only going to eat this in the future.

152
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,020
Isn't that Choe Hui Jin?

153
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,690
Seems like it.

154
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,550
I guess so.

155
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,490
My filming will end in a month.

156
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,430
We should go to Florence as soon as it ends.

157
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,160
Wouldn't that be great?

158
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,710
You have time and money.
All these are good.

159
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,310
There's just one problem
and that's the passport. 
The passport.

160
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,190
Solving that is going to get pretty complicated.

161
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,320
I'll take care of it, so just wait.

162
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,460
Even if you hadn't mentioned it, 
I was thinking about it.

163
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,990
What book is this?

164
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,530
It's about how to craft one's fake identity.

165
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,340
No...You're going to break the law?

166
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,940
It's not like there are other ways.

167
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,740
I can't live without an identity.

168
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,870
Mmm...

169
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,210
Is that delicious?

170
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,820
Cotton candy?

171
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,550
Looks like you're going to lose again. 
That is exceptionally spicy.

172
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,160
If it's exceptionally spicy, why does everyone look
so happy eating it?

173
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,760
It's so spicy that their souls have left
them. Just like someone here.

174
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,160
Then I'll just get one.

175
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,030
Get us three. I love spicy foods.

176
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,200
The second date will be at Seoul tower.

177
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,110
What's going on?

178
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:22,270
The number you have called does not exist. 
Please check and dial again.

179
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,310
- We need to find a place to live. 
- That will be difficult. Just hurry.

180
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:23,800
The number you have called does not exist. 
Please check and dial again.

181
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,090
So full. I've eaten too much again.

182
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:48,890
Why are you like this? You have to stop
eating so much.

183
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,570
Aigoo!

184
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,970
What is it? Why are you calling me in the
middle of a date?

185
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,180
What? Your box?

186
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:12,650
At the very bottom. That... there's only some bills.

187
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,050
<i>It's not there?</i>

188
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,120
There's nothing that looks like a talisman.

189
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,660
It's a yellow talisman. I put it there.

190
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,860
It's not here. There definitely isn't anything
yellow here.

191
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,090
<i>Please carry this with you.</i>

192
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,560
<i>What is it?</i>

193
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,960
<i>It's a talisman from the temple.
It's a miraculous talisman.</i>

194
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,880
<i>It will protect you.</i>

195
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,430
<i>Just because I have written it, does not mean it will act according to my intentions.</i>

196
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,840
<i>It is filled with your sincerity, but it 
cannot be controlled by your intentions.</i>

197
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,310
<i>Though it belongs to him, it cannot 
be controlled by his intentions either.</i>

198
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,310
<i>Yun Wol returned to the Seryeong Pavilion.</i>

199
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,860
- Where are you running to. 
- You little.

200
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,470
I have a question.

201
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,150
Omo, this good-looking man is taking
notice of me.
(Omo - oh my)

202
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,550
How can I help you?

203
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,350
Where is Yun Wol now?

204
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,260
Are you Yun Wol's customer?

205
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,760
She should be busy right now.

206
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,570
Who are you?

207
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,110
I heard Yun Wol was here.

208
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,380
Really? Where did she go?

209
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,310
I haven't seen Yun Wol since a while ago.
Where did she go?

210
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,850
She went out saying she was going to change 
her gayageum string, but I don't see her around.

211
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,570
Yun Wol.

212
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,470
<i>Where did you go?</i>

213
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,510
<i>I'll pour it for you.</i>

214
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,360
<i>Cheers, Cheers, Cheers!</i>

215
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,020
<i>Who are you?</i>

216
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,390
<i>Just because my master is dead, 
you have no worries now?</i>

217
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,860
<i>Shamelessly coming back here and 
behaving wildly.</i>

218
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:59,930
<i>If not for you, things wouldn't have turned
out this way.</i>

219
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,140
<i>Don't come any closer. I will call people.</i>

220
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,840
<i>Call people.</i>

221
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,340
<i>Go ahead and call for help. Where?</i>

222
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,150
<i>Aren't you afraid of the consequences? You're
being chased by the royal forces. Go back quietly!</i>

223
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,550
<i>Consequences...</i>

224
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,490
<i>The person who should have been afraid of 
consequences... is you, you bitch!</i>

225
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,710
Yun Wol.

226
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,470
Where is the customer with a sword?

227
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:13,980
Pardon?

228
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,680
I asked, where is the customer with a sword?

229
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,480
That's enough. Let's go.

230
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,210
The musical performers will be here in a minute.

231
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,350
I don't feel like it today. Next time will do.

232
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,840
You... You stayed alive?

233
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,120
This is better, I will kill you with my own hands.

234
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,240
Master.

235
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,310
Administrator!

236
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,580
I haven't seen you in a long time.

237
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,910
What on earth is...

238
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
You're still alive?

239
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,790
Yes. I lived.

240
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,520
But...

241
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,200
Yun Wol is dead.

242
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,530
What did you say?

243
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:21,670
I'm in a situation where I can't let myself
get caught. So I wasn't able to bring her 
back here.

244
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,540
I think she would have wanted this to 
be her resting place.

245
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,680
Do you think you could go back to the pavilion 
and take care of Yun Wol's remains?

246
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,220
Yes.

247
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,170
They died last night. We're still looking for their identities.

248
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,310
Who's the culprit?

249
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,910
No one knows, but they said he was asking 
for a gisaeng named Yun Wol.
(Gisaeng - female entertainer, prostitute)

250
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,980
Then, where is that gisaeng Yun Wol?

251
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,650
That... She is already dead, too.

252
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,990
What?

253
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,350
I heard that soldiers are looking for you everywhere.

254
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,880
You have stayed here long enough. 
You had better hurry and leave.

255
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,360
I should be going.

256
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,290
If a person who's supposed to be dead gets 
caught alive, there will be much blood shed
in the Royal Court again.

257
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,630
But I do not know whether I will be able
to leave this place.

258
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,640
Because the talisman has now become like this.

259
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,840
How did the color...

260
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,440
The moment Yun Wol died, it became like this.

261
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,520
<i>Is that delicious?</i>

262
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,720
<i>Cotton candy?</i>

263
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,920
<i>That is exceptionally spicy.</i>

264
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,520
<i>If it's exceptionally spicy, why does 
everyone look so happy eating it?</i>

265
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,410
He will come. He will come.

266
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,400
He'll come.

267
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,450
Looks like it was because of Yun Wol.

268
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,720
<i>I came here suddenly, without any warning.</i>

269
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,050
<i>That person will be looking for me continuously.
What should I do?</i>

270
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,590
<i>Do you think the power of "life after death"
will still work?</i>

271
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,670
Where are you?

272
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,610
I'm sorry that I scared you.

273
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,350
Where are you?

274
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,750
At the park.

275
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,330
The park?

276
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,100
What on earth happened?

277
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,540
Why did you disappear when the talisman was with me?

278
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,280
Where did you go?

279
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,440
Something happened because there 
was a problem with the talisman.

280
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,480
What's the problem?

281
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,540
Surely you didn't keep waiting here for me?

282
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,200
Then where else could I wait? 
You disappeared from here.

283
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:57,780
Are you crying? Why are you crying?

284
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,620
Since I'm being chased, it is not a bad 
idea for me to go far away.

285
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:13,120
Do you think the Great Master will be able
to help you with this matter?

286
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:19,410
Under the same sky in a different time.

287
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:27,810
Our sad love has entangled.

288
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:35,810
I place my earnest heart in the moonlight.

289
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:42,490
So I can shine brightly wherever you are.

290
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:46,830
My love.

291
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:05,340
Under the same sky in a different time.

292
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:12,680
This sad love can never be.

293
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:21,190
I will become your moonlight and shine a light on you.

294
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:28,700
So it will guide your way back to me.

295
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,680
Since I'm being chased, it is not a bad idea to go far away.

296
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,750
Do you think the Great Master will be able
to help you with this matter?

297
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,360
The only thing I can do now is to seek for him.

298
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,490
There's no other way but to find him, 
no matter what.

299
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,230
Please take care of your body.

300
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,380
Darn it. Today we will settle this once and for all.

301
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,720
I'll get you real good for this.

302
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
What exactly are you doing?

303
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,480
Hey. We should have a serious talk.

304
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:03,620
Ever since you started seeing Gim Bung Do, 
I think you've become a little strange.

305
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,960
It was just a few days ago that you were
so excited and happy.

306
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,430
Now, whenever you get a chance you come here,

307
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,430
or just sit in the public park.

308
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,770
Why are you being like that?

309
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,170
Do you really have bipolar disorder?

310
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,690
It is bipolar, you're bipolar.

311
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,310
That rotten bastard...

312
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,320
What did he do to make you like this?

313
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,580
If things continue like this, you're going
to be ruined.

314
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,190
At any rate, I'm going to have to fight him.

315
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,860
When will that bastard come home?

316
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,660
What should I do?

317
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,600
What?

318
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:52,200
I think I won't ever be able to see him again.

319
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,410
You mean Gim Bung Do?

320
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,010
Why can't you see him?

321
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,280
It seems like that was the last time.

322
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,480
You said he went on a business trip.

323
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,550
What do you mean it has ended?

324
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,620
Where did he go exactly?

325
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,090
Did he go to a dangerous country?

326
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,500
How can it...

327
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:25,380
How can that have been the last time?

328
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:39,320
What is this? How is this kind of thing possible?

329
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,460
What's with you? 
Don't be like this.

330
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:56,000
You rotten girl. Why are you like this?

331
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,670
Don't cry. Don't cry. This is why I told
you not to meet him, remember?

332
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,240
-=1 month later=-

333
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,710
You are looking for Master Seon Myeong from 
the Hyeonam temple?

334
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,940
That's right.

335
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,410
Where is he?

336
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,610
What to do? You must have come a long way.

337
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,750
He entered Nirvana last month.

338
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,160
You must have come because of an important matter.

339
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,240
<i>Then where else could I wait?
You disappeared from here.</i>

340
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:03,920
<i>What on earth happened? Why did you
disappear when the talisman was with me?</i>

341
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,190
<i>Where did you go?</i>

342
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,760
When the tailsman was cut into two,

343
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,240
everything went back to square one in that world.

344
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,710
It became a time period in which I had never existed.

345
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:02,110
Except for her, everyone else forgot about me.

346
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,580
So I am very curious.

347
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,990
If I were to burn the talisman, what would happen?

348
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,660
Will she forget me entirely
this time?

349
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,070
There's someone who is waiting for
me with all her heart. But I...

350
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,810
I have no way of returning.

351
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,010
Whether it takes one year or ten,

352
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,220
if there is a way to go to her, I would.

353
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,090
However, there is no way to go there.

354
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
If she were to continue waiting for me sadly,

355
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,300
wouldn't it be better for her to completely
forget about me instead?

356
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,910
If I burn it, will all the memories
disappear entirely?

357
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,000
This is a letter that's written both
to you and to me at the same time.

358
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,540
I might forget that I had written this letter...

359
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,080
Or even this letter itself might disappear.

360
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:49,290
For me or for you, this letter is written for 
whoever may live holding on to the memories.

361
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,100
When I first happened to come into
possession of this talisman,

362
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,510
I was very curious about
its cause and effect.

363
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:09,170
At first, I thought that the
realization of my dream 
was the effect.

364
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:21,050
Shortly after, I thought
meeting you was its effect.

365
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:28,130
Then afterwards, I thought
that beginning a new life
in another world was the effect.

366
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,030
But it's only now
that I came to realize its effects.

367
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:43,900
If the cause was me surviving,
then me losing everything 
was the effect.

368
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,360
My future.

369
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:53,590
My honor.

370
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,110
My values.

371
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,670
My people.

372
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,400
And you, too.

373
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,450
In order to preserve my life, I had to give up an equivalent price.

374
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,580
This only made sense.

375
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,850
That I thought I could keep even one of those
things was my own foolishness.

376
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,930
How much more will I lose
in order to repay the price?

377
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,930
Not being able to see you anymore,

378
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:45,540
I have now realized that even that was
a luxury.

379
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,610
<i>I love you.</i>

380
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:03,690
Memories. Our memories.

381
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,240
Because of you, I'm so thankful to you.

382
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,910
<i>If us becoming lovers is the cause, what will
be the effect?</i>

383
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,580
<i>If us becoming lovers is the cause, what will
be the effect?</i>

384
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,310
<i>If us becoming lovers is the cause, what will
be the effect?</i>

385
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:32,580
My love for you can never be expressed with words.

386
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,520
Though hardships can bring me pains and sorrows.

387
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,860
<i>Our memories.</i>

388
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,090
Though hardships can bring me pains and sorrows.

389
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:41,190
You're always there to protect me with your embracement.

390
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:45,330
<i>Memories. Losing them is the final price
I must pay.</i>

391
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,770
You're always there to protect me with your embracement.

392
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:54,770
Under the same sky in a different time.

393
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,880
Our sad love has entangled.

394
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,010
<i>I do not know what will happen now.</i>

395
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,780
Our sad love has entangled.

396
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,680
I place my earnest heart in the moonlight.

397
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,820
So I can shine brightly wherever you are.

398
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,020
<i>Will we forget each other,</i>

399
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,960
<i>or will we live unable to forget, forever 
in agony?</i>

400
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,120
I place my earnest heart in the moonlight.

401
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:18,130
So I can shine brightly wherever you are.

402
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:18,630
~ <i>My love.</i> ~

403
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,490
Hey, where did you get
drenched in the rain?

404
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,440
Didn't you go on your date?

405
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:38,810
~ <i>Under the same sky in a different time</i> ~

406
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:48,160
This sad love can never be.

407
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:56,470
I will become your moonlight under the dark sky and shine a light on you.

408
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,670
So it will guide you your way back to me.

409
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:02,740
<i>If I have a final wish...</i>

410
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,180
<i>it is to remember you.</i>

411
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,150
<i>In a life without aims, to not even have those
memories would be hell.</i>

412
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,560
<i>And you... as for you...</i>

413
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,230
<i>Even if you should happen to read this letter
someday far in the future,</i>

414
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:34,640
<i>I pray that you will not be able to realize whom it is for.</i>

415
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:52,390
~ <i>My first image of you is flashing across my mind</i> ~

416
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:59,930
~ <i>Thinking that I might not be able to see you again,
my heart is stinging with pain</i> ~

417
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:08,050
~ <i>If time was to repeat itself, and allowed me to see you one more time</i> ~

418
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:15,250
~ <i>"I love you" with all my heart</i> ~

419
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:23,000
~ <i>Will we be able to meet again
one time, for real?</i> ~

420
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:30,600
~ <i>When will this wish come true, really?</i> ~

421
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:38,440
~ <i>From time to time, I saw a glimpse of your shadow when I wandered into nothingness.</i> ~

422
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:46,510
~ <i>So I set off on the road again today.</i> ~

423
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:54,450
~ <i>Tomorrow, will you be someplace? </i> ~

424
00:51:54,450 --> 00:52:01,960
~ <i>Are you not perhaps looking for me too?</i> ~

425
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:09,070
~ <i>I must see you at least one time </i> ~

426
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:17,310
~ <i>We must meet again, one more time</i> ~

427
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:24,800
~ <i>In case you might become reflected
in my tears if I keep on crying</i> ~

428
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:35,240
The tears seem to be coming again today.
