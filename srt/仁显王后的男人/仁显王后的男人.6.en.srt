The criminal has escaped!

00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:25,443
What is this? How did this happen?

8
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:28,783
This sly fellow.

9
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:30,513
How can this happen?

10
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:42,393
Gim Bung Do escaped.

11
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:43,993
What is going on?

12
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:45,333
Be quiet.

13
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,733
-Be quiet. Hurry.
-Let's go together.

14
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:49,463
<i>I don't want to be alone.</i>

15
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:53,734
Hyeongnim, they must think that we
are the ones who helped Gim Bung Do escape.

16
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:56,583
If it were me, I would think the same way too.

17
00:00:55,874 --> 00:00:58,674
What exactly does he want to do, escaping like this?

18
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:01,614
Don't tell me he's afraid of us but not afraid of them?

19
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:04,284
We must certainly catch him, otherwise...

20
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,863
We must catch him!

21
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:08,961
Certainly we will catch him, let's go.

22
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,461
Yes.

23
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,330
You all go search there.

24
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:29,435
The rest, follow me.

25
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:44,896
Where exactly should I go?

26
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:39,629
<i>I'm going to take the picture,
Mr. Lee go a little further.</i>

27
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:40,997
<i>I'm taking it.</i>

28
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,892

We've searched everywhere in Seoul,
but there's no sign of him.

37

How can something like this happen?

38
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,944
He is not just a common
criminal, but a criminal convicted of treason.

39
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:55,094
Before matters get worse, it's better
to report to the higher authorities.

You didn't die?

69
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,284
How did you know I was going to die?

70
00:09:58,284 --> 00:10:00,544
How can I not know?
It was written in the records!

71
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:02,414
You were supposed to die 3 days ago.

72
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:08,294
I escaped. How can I just die
like that feeling wronged?

73
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:12,024
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

74
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:14,424
While on my own, I've been
learning how to use the phone.

75
00:10:15,494 --> 00:10:18,964
It took me 3 full days. That's how hard it was.

76
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:25,554
What is it?

77
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:30,044
Who is it?

78
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,794
I'm asking you who it is.

79
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:36,584
Hold on for a moment.

00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:47,664
=Hello?=

81
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:50,594
I thought we were disconnected.

82
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:51,804
How do you know my phone number?

83
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:53,404
Because I saw it!

84
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,674
I never told it to you.

85
00:10:56,474 --> 00:10:57,944
Can we leave our car here?

86
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:00,744
Get out.

87
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:08,494
They can just call.

88
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:12,784
You remembered it from that time?

89
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:17,194
At the time, I didn't know what it was,
so I just decided to remember it. Useful, wasn't it?

90
00:11:18,664 --> 00:11:22,394
But in the records, it said
that you died because of an illness!

91
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:23,994
I am very healthy now.

92
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:26,664
Then, what was that about? Why did it
say that you died because of an illness?

93
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:32,004
They put poison in my food and tried to assassinate me while I slept. How could I have not fallen ill?

94
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:35,474
There is someone who wants to kill you?

95
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:39,744
My family was killed like that.
It's not a rare matter.

96
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:44,554
Where are you right now?

97
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:48,254
I'm at the airport. I wanted to ask you something.

98
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,094
Identity card? Of course you need it.

99
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,764
If you don't have one, you can't
take a plane or travel on anything.

100
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:00,034
What is it, who is it?

101
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,364
Yun Cheol, Yun Cheol.

102
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:02,434
Yun Cheol, where is he right now?

103
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:03,104
What?

104
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:11,736
Yun Cheol! Over here.

105
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,184
Hi, Hui Jin.

106
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:16,754
Hey, Su Gyeong.

107
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:19,176
Sorry for calling you out so suddenly.

108
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:23,724
I saw Lady Jang's trailer,
you came out so beautifully.

109
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,324
I have always been pretty.

110
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:29,334
But why do you need my identity card?

111
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:34,804
I thought so, they look alike.
They look alike right?

112
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:39,344
Lend it to me for a day.
I won't do anything bad so don't worry.

113
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:42,144
A celebrity wouldn't do anything bad.

114
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:45,214
She's going to do something
bad. Don't lend it to her!

115
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:46,284
No, no.

116
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:48,414
I'll treat you to a meal in the future. Thanks!

117
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:51,084
A meal is unnecessary. Let's take a picture instead!

118
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:53,884
I keep telling people that you are my friend,
but nobody believes me!

119
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:00,294
1, 2, 3. Nice!

120
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:04,434
Today is the first episode, right?

121
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:05,364
I'm anticipating it!

122
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:06,704
Thank you. I'll call you.

123
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:07,764
<i>Okay.</i>

124
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:19,144
Look at the clouds.

125
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:25,284
Doesn't the drama air at 10pm? It is only 3pm now.

126
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:28,354
There are seven more hours to go,
why are you dozing off like that?

127
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:32,224
That university student is still suspicious,
why doesn't he have an identity card?

128
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:34,764
It's not that he doesn't have one, he lost it.

129
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:37,034
If it's lost, he can go
and get a new one.

130
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:38,494
Why use other people's identity cards?

131
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:40,634
Because he doesn't have
time to renew it!

132
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:43,174
He has to come back
to Seoul by tonight.

133
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,374
There you go again...

134
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:49,044
Once you fall for someone,
you get all emotional and excited.

135
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:51,444
After that, you become enslaved
and slowly lose your conscience.

136
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,184
You're doing it again,
do you know?

137
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:55,454
With Han Dong Min, you were
always hanging around him.

138
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:59,454
Then he betrays you, and you
say that you will never do that again.

139
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:01,324
But now you're...

140
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:05,994
What did you say?
There's this buzzing sound, is it because of the pressure?

141
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:14,664
Don't worry, this is the last time.

142
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:16,674
There won't be a reason
to meet him anymore.

143
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:19,204
Really? Who believes you?

144
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:24,014
If you knew, you would realize that
he has an unavoidable personal history.

145
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:25,744
That's why I'm helping him.

146
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:30,284
He has an unavoidable personal
history? Exactly what is that?

147
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,024
My ears can't hear again. What did you say?

148
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,424
I really can't hear you!

149
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:01,554
=The number you have dialed is currently
unavailable, please leave a message...=

150
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:09,014
=The number you have dialed is currently
unavailable, please leave a message...=

151
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:11,834
What is this, seriously?

152
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,614
Why are we wasting so much time?

153
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:15,614
Didn't you say that it would end at 3?

154
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,844
It wasn't easy filming, and I wanted
to ask Hui Jin out to play.

155
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:20,891
Who? Ask who?

156
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:24,851
She's not answering her
phone, what a pity!

157
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:28,201
What do you mean, play?
We're going back once  this ends.

158
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,681
Who's more compatible with me,
Yun Na Jeong or Choe Hui Jin?

159
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,401
Eh? I don't know...

160
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:37,871
I always wanted
a photoshoot with Hui Jin.

161
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,751
Reporter Nuna isn't listening to me.

162
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:45,021
After seeing today's broadcast, she
will definitely change her mind.

163
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:47,641
No taste, has she?

164
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:49,691
He's just joking.

165
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:51,961
Hyeong, why do you always
say that I'm joking?

166
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:57,241
-Mr. Dong Min.
-Yes, I'm coming.

167
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:03,831
See? If Hui Jin was over there,
I'd run over immediately.

168
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:05,511
But that's Yun Na Jeong...

169
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,061
Hey, let's go.

170
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,791
She's a human too.

171
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:18,871
Hi.

172
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:21,731
Hello.

173
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:26,301
He's so naughty.
But that's why people like him.

174
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:29,501
Honesty is Han Dong Min's charm.

175
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:32,841
That's not honesty, it's just random stuff.

176
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:35,771
People might take his jokes seriously.

177
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:37,511
You, don't take him seriously.

178
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:39,511
But he's telling the truth, isn't he?

179
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:51,921
Want to know why
I'm not dating Choe Hui Jin?

180
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:54,151
Not really.

181
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:59,131
I'm waiting for her to be
on the same level as you.

182
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:02,461
Only then will I not be
considered slumming.

183
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:05,451
Looks like you and her will never date.

184
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:09,141
Because something like that will never happen.

185
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:11,701
It won't be long now.

186
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:16,561
Yes, just wait... About 30 years?

187
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:17,891
We're starting!

188
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:20,061
- Yes.
- Yes.

189
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:22,541
30 years?

190
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,991
<i>There are no coincidences in this world.</i>

191
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:41,724
<i>Why did the master
give me the talisman?</i>

192
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:47,401
<i>Is it a way of comforting me
so that I will not regret dying?</i>

193
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,341
<i>Or, is it about the
existence of a better world,</i>

194
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:53,541
<i>allowing me to prepare for such an existence?</i>

195
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,611
<i>Me going there and meeting that lady,</i>

196
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:59,411
<i>was it really accidental? Or inevitable?</i>

197
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:04,621
<i>Buddha tells us that there are
no coincidences in this world.</i>

198
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:07,561
<i>There is only fate.</i>

199
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,981
<i>That "Lady Jang" looks interesting.</i>

200
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,311
<i>Han Dong Min is so handsome!</i>

201
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:31,451
<i>That girl is called Choe Hui Jin?</i>

202
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:35,751
Is she a model?
I don't know her.

203
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:39,091
<i>-The look matches.
-Isn't she pretty?</i>

204
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:58,441
Excuse me, the person who
needs an identity card?

205
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:11,251
Really, what would you do without me?

206
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,251
Just stand here all confused,

207
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,461
or forge people's documents to get an
air ticket, or just find a fishing boat?

208
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:19,531
Buy a forged air ticket or ride a fishing boat?
50-50, right?

209
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:24,201
Why aren't you welcoming me?
I came all the way here for you.

210
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:27,671
Are you playing the role of the Queen?

211
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:28,871
How did you know?

212
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:32,741
I just found out what an actress does.

213
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:35,681
Ah, you saw the trailer!

214
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,551
Now you believe me! I told you I'm Queen In Hyeon!

215
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,227
I'm the one you're risking your life to protect!

216
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,427
Why are you smiling? It's upsetting.

217
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:49,967
Why? Do you think I'm not fit to be the Queen?

218
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,437
No, it's the first time...

219
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:53,167
What?

220
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:56,367
It's the first time
that I find you beautiful.

221
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:09,717
You look better in a hanbok.
(hanbok - korean traditional clothing)

222
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:17,457
Why does that sound more like an insult than a compliment?

223
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,327
The first time finding me beautiful?

224
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:22,797
Then, you used to think
I was ugly?

225
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:24,937
Do I really look that ugly to you?

226
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:29,467
Omo, that's it!!

227
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:32,537
I feel offended! I don't think
I'll be able to help you.

228
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:35,207
But aren't we even now?

229
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:37,077
What do you mean, even?

230
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:40,947
Living here for a while, I have
come to know what 'player' means.

231
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:42,947
I'm not a player.

232
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:46,157
You see me as a Casanova,

233
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:49,487
I see you as ugly?
We're even.

234
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:55,097
People are watching. Go
somewhere else to talk.

235
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:57,367
You know her, right? My friend.

236
00:20:58,697 --> 00:21:00,967
Let's not attract attention here.
Come on.

237
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,637
What does that mean?

238
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:08,707
Never mind.

239
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,317
There are seats for 7pm, do you want them?

240
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:21,657
Yes, two people. And a different flight
for the third one.

241
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:25,927
Two tickets at 7pm, and the third...
What time would you like?

242
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:27,527
Any time will do.

243
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,527
Then is 7:20pm all right?

244
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,937
Yes, right. Make it like that.

245
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:38,207
No. Give me 3 tickets with the same timing,
separated by one seat.

246
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:39,137
Yes.

247
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:43,807
Hey, apart from the ID card,
must we be on the same plane, too?

248
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:46,077
Separate seats will do.

249
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:49,147
What's the real reason we have to go together?

250
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:55,027
This is the first time in his whole life
that he's going on a plane!

251
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,627
Were you not scared, the first time you flew?

252
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:58,627
This is his first time to fly?

253
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:01,427
What did he do all his
life until now?

254
00:22:01,427 --> 00:22:02,897
Just study.

255
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:05,037
Even if he just studied...

256
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:08,767
But does a hanbok suit me better?

257
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:11,597
Like,  I look... Demure?

258
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,827
It's 273 thousand won for 3 people.

259
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:14,867
Okay.

260
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,707
We still have some time, right?

261
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:21,847
Since we're here, let's find a good place to drink coffee.

262
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:40,397
Don't use ancient words with Su Gyeong.

263
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:44,007
Say it like this... that's how it should be.

264
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:44,905
She will think you have
a weird way of speaking.

265
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,365
I know.

266
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:49,895
I have a book about the standard language.

267
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:51,315
Good job.

268
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:52,695
Thank you.

269
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:03,595
Let's go together.

270
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:05,065
Would you like coffee?

271
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:07,065
How about green tea? Green tea is good, right?

272
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:09,465
Hey, you already paid for the tickets.
Are you buying tea, too?

273
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:13,315
Excuse me, why don't you buy the tea?

274
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,875
No, it's fine.

275
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,545
Just let him buy it,
didn't he say he would?

276
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,875
When you return to Seoul,
you'll need money.

277
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,625
Keep it.

278
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:28,485
Two capuccinos and one green tea.

279
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:32,085
Your friend seems not to like me.

280
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:34,895
Don't mind her, she's
always like that.

281
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:47,835
Just by seeing his face,
I can tell he's a loafer.

282
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:51,845
An expert at freeloading.
It's written all over his face.

283
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:03,985
When we first met, I told you, right?

284
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:06,785
That I am my friend's manager.

285
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:12,125
Which means, I am no different from
Hui Jin's parents or relatives.

286
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:14,795
Starting now, tell the truth.

287
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:19,205
If there is one bit of a lie,
I'll immediately investigate you.

288
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:22,135
I know many policemen.

289
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:24,275
Yes.

290
00:24:25,745 --> 00:24:28,815
You said you are a university graduate...

291
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:32,405
Which university did you attend?

292
00:24:32,435 --> 00:24:33,745
Sungkyunkwan.

293
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,285
Sungkyunkwan?

294
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:39,085
Is that true?

295
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:41,565
You said I have to be honest.

296
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:44,765
Where do you live?

297
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:47,165
Bukchon.

298
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:52,765
Bukchon?
The houses there are extremely expensive.

299
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:55,705
By chance, is it a tile-roofed house?

300
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:57,305
Yes, it's a tile-roofed house.

301
00:24:58,775 --> 00:25:02,245
Then, do you live with your parents?

302
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:04,115
No...

303
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:05,985
Where are they?

304
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:07,715
They both passed away.

305
00:25:08,785 --> 00:25:10,115
Both of them?

306
00:25:10,115 --> 00:25:11,585
Both.

307
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:19,465
So if you're a student, how do
you manage your expenses?

308
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:21,865
They left me with some inheritance.

309
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:27,735
Inheritance? How much?

310
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,945
Enough.

311
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:36,215
So what was it your father did?

312
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:37,945
National affairs.

313
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,485
National affairs?

314
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:43,955
National affairs? Is he a public servant? A high ranking public servant?

315
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:50,225
Are your words true?

316
00:25:51,025 --> 00:25:52,365
No lies?

317
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:54,765
No lies.

318
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:59,705
I'll just... Excuse me...

319
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:18,255
Where did Su Gyeong go?

320
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:21,725
Seems like she had some business to attend to.

321
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:23,455
What business?

322
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:26,195
But, Sungkyunkwan still exists?

323
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:29,395
Sungkyunkwan University? It does.

324
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:35,215
I didn't expect Sungkyunkwan and
Bukchon to still exist. That's interesting.

325
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:42,075
A graduate from Sungkyunkwan University.
Good education. A tile-roofed household.

326
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:46,615
If it is so, then his family is certainly rich.

327
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:51,425
His parents have passed away. There's no need to
see an elder, and there's an entire inheritance.

328
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:57,555
He looks good as well. Seeing him this
honest, it doesn't seem like he's a beggar.

329
00:26:57,855 --> 00:27:00,835
What's this? There's nothing
to be doubtful about!

330
00:27:02,135 --> 00:27:06,405
Compared to the trash Hui Jin has
dated before, he's so much better.

331
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:09,523
Rotten girl!

332
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:14,333
Is it that tasty?

333
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:17,533
Coffee? It's addictive.

334
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:21,403
Seems like everybody likes to drink coffee,
so I tasted it once. But, there's nothing great about it.

335
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:25,143
You've only been here for a month. Maybe once
you fall in love with coffee, you won't go back.

336
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:32,613
But why did you come here?

337
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:38,883
Is my question funny?

338
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:48,093
What do you mean, why? Didn't I say that
without an identity card, you can't take the plane?

339
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:50,903
But I didn't mean for you
to come here to meet me.

340
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:54,773
I had a lot of time, that's why.

341
00:27:54,903 --> 00:27:56,773
Aren't you a busy person?

342
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:02,913
I am. But I happened to have time today.

343
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,583
I also sympathize with you.

344
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:11,183
After seeing the history records, I got worried.
Seeing you were going to die a wrongful death.

345
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:17,193
I came all the way here, you should thank me.
Why are you asking so many questions?

346
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:20,393
Obviously you're receiving my help,
yet you're so arrogant.

347
00:28:21,593 --> 00:28:24,003
I'm just asking because
I wanted to know the reason.

348
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:28,803
A master I know told me that
there are no coincidences.

349
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:31,873
The last time we met was
probably because of fate.

350
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:34,013
But this time, it was because I wanted
to see you, and contacted you.

351
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,873
And you also came here
because you wanted to see me.

352
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:38,283
So clearly it is not karma.

353
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:40,553
Because of the talisman that I have with me,

354
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,753
I met you.
That's why you came all the way here.

355
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:47,353
This fate, what incidents it will cause...

356
00:28:47,353 --> 00:28:50,153
And what is the effect of it, aren't you curious?

357
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:54,563
Looks like you're not curious at all.

358
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,503
My head hurts.

359
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:19,653
You disregarding the foam is the cause. Me wiping it, is the effect.

360
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:34,233
I don't know about the rest, but
you certainly are a player.

361
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:35,903
And you say that you're not.

362
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,893
I just wanted to explain.

363
00:29:39,273 --> 00:29:42,343
Explaining things like that is called flirting, you player, you.

364
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:45,313
This feels wrong.

365
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:49,973
You always being like this is the cause.
And me calling you a player is the effect.

366
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:52,383
This is clearly karma.

367
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:54,523
Now do you understand? Karma.

368
00:29:56,523 --> 00:29:58,923
You laugh when you have nothing to say.

369
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:04,163
So,,, You have nothing to say? Cause.
You laugh? Effect.

370
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:06,133
Really...

371
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:17,843
<i>Your Excellency,</i>

372
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:21,773
<i>in a challenge, when
someone throws away their best cards</i>

373
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:23,353
<i>what do you think is the reason?</i>

374
00:30:24,153 --> 00:30:26,923
<i>No matter how you see it,
it is the best card isn't it?</i>

375
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:32,133
<i>What better cards I have, is
what you should be afraid of.
</i>

376
00:30:33,317 --> 00:30:34,577
Cards?

377
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,987
Other cards?

378
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:42,417
<i>Your Excellency, I have come.</i>

379
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:43,857
Come in.

380
00:30:53,877 --> 00:30:58,147
We followed your orders to watch
Yun Wol's movements, but she disappeared.

381
00:30:59,077 --> 00:31:00,367
Disappeared?

382
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:07,617
It's not just Yun Wol alone, Gim Bung Do
has another attendant that he is hiding.

383
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,037
When did this happen?

384
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:20,167
They disappeared when Gim Bung Do
was detained by the military.

385
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,847
What do you want to do in Seoul?

386
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:28,417
I need to settle some things
with the Right Prime Minister.

387
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:31,047
Right Prime Minister? Min Am?

388
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:32,507
Settle what?

389
00:31:32,877 --> 00:31:34,477
Whether he dies or I die.

390
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:39,037
Are you going to kill someone?

391
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:41,557
That can't be.

392
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:45,527
Taking revenge doesn't necessarily mean killing a person.

393
00:31:45,557 --> 00:31:47,537
If it's not by killing, then it's politics.

394
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,827
Is the era now not like that?

395
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:11,187
That's it. Of course
he's conspiring something.

396
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:14,787
But what, exactly?

397
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,677
I heard he lives in Bukchon.

398
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:38,687
A tile-roofed house over there
costs at least a few billion.

399
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:40,457
Go to his house and take a look.

400
00:32:41,077 --> 00:32:43,877
Let's see. Can it be found?

401
00:32:44,017 --> 00:32:46,307
His father is a civil servant,

402
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:47,717
do you know what level?

403
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,867
What?

404
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:54,277
If he's a minister then...
probably a vice minister?

405
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:56,297
Really?

406
00:32:57,527 --> 00:32:58,727
Omo, you're...

407
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:02,467
How come you never once told me this?

408
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:05,807
You, Miss Discreteness!

409
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:07,667
Rotten girl!

410
00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:08,477
It hurts!

411
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:24,697
Ajussi, do you believe that a big plane
like this can fly?
(Ajussi - older man, uncle)

412
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:26,817
I don't believe it.

413
00:33:27,697 --> 00:33:29,257
I can't believe it, either.

414
00:33:29,297 --> 00:33:33,677
It says here it's because of
the force of air.

415
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:37,417
Is that so? I would like to
read that book, too.

416
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:41,267
=Dear passengers, the aircraft is about to take off.=

417
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:45,037
=Please ensure that you have fastened your seat belts.=

418
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:48,257
Ajussi, are you afraid, too?

419
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,357
You think I'm afraid?

420
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:55,087
If I start crying, pretend that you don't see it.

421
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:01,147
<i>Cards?</i>

422
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:04,707
A new card... a new card...

423
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:09,247
He has a new card...

424
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,827
What is it?

425
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:09,817
Seriously, if I argue I will
also turn into a crazy person.

426
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:13,090
I must make sure he writes an
autobiography book before he dies.

427
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:14,041
What?

428
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:19,231
He is the first human to fly, ever.

429
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:20,951
His name must be recorded down.

430
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:38,851
Would you like something to drink?

431
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:40,311
Yes, coffee.

432
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:45,271
Thank you!

433
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:49,281
Anything else,sir?

434
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:52,011
Anything?

435
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:53,151
Of course, sir!

436
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:54,551
Anything that we have!

437
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,621
Then, I want a first class seat.

438
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:00,421
Excuse me?

439
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:02,441
I would like a first class seat.

440
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:07,881
Our deepest apologies, we also would like to give
you the best comfort on the plane...

441
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:09,411
However, it has been fully booked.

442
00:36:09,491 --> 00:36:11,351
Didn't you say anything is possible?

443
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,661
Miss, you sure talk big.

444
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:15,301
He is kidding.

445
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:17,171
He's just a little upset.

446
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,481
Then, would you like a beer, sir?

447
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:29,091
What can we do? It's my fault,
I mismatched the schedule.

448
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:30,441
I'm sorry.

449
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:34,761
I haven't sat here in three years! Does this make any sense?

450
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:37,031
The flight is 50 minutes. Not 10 hours, right?!

451
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:40,671
Will you only be comfortable
in a first class seat?

452
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:42,891
This is not to my liking...

453
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,431
It's so hard to please you.

454
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:48,711
Na Jeong-sshi is also here and she's fine!

455
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,101
Na Jeong is Na Jeong!

456
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:24,211
Haven't I seen this guy somewhere before?

457
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:26,301
<i>You... who are you?</i>

458
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:27,439
<i>What are you doing?</i>

459
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:29,159
<i>Why are you hiding here?</i>

460
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:30,709
<i>I'm asking what you're doing.</i>

461
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,259
Hyeong, Hyeong!

462
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,279
Take a look at him.

463
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,789
That fellow seems to be on this flight.

464
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:40,769
Who?

465
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:44,959
The one who ran away from the hospital.
With the hat! Hat!

466
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,659
Psycho stalker.

467
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,389
What?

468
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:48,719
Quick, quick!

469
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:02,919
Isn't it?

470
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,759
Yes, the same guy.

471
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:05,979
Right?

472
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:08,879
Ah, I thought so!

473
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,629
But... Miss Hui Jin is on this flight, too.

474
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:12,719
What?

475
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:19,969
Oh, she is.

476
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,469
But what is she doing here?

477
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:24,789
Don't know. But isn't the guy stalking her?

478
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,639
Hey, we need to tell Miss Hui Jin.
She might not even have noticed.

479
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,779
Wait, if you tell Hui Jin, that punk
would sense that he's been found out..

480
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:36,749
Ah, yes.

481
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,779
Then what should we do?

482
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:43,069
Anyway, we're flying in a plane here,
he can't escape.

483
00:38:44,957 --> 00:38:45,907
Excuse me.

484
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,647
Yes, do you need...

485
00:38:48,697 --> 00:38:49,647
Squat!

486
00:38:57,907 --> 00:38:59,397
What is he doing?

487
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:33,117
<i>What are you doing?</i>

488
00:39:33,277 --> 00:39:35,037
<i>Why are you hiding here?</i>

489
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:36,607
<i>I'm asking what you're doing.</i>

490
00:39:48,757 --> 00:39:51,357
Punk, now that you saw me,
what are you going to do?

491
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:53,367
Are you going to jump down from here or what?

492
00:39:57,697 --> 00:39:59,127
We contacted the airport police.

493
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,907
They will rush over immediately
once the aircraft lands.

494
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:05,657
He runs like a ghost, so you must
certainly be fast to catch him.

495
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:07,727
Yes, please don't worry.

496
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:11,817
Ai...

497
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:21,307
Wait, wait. Where is that punk going?

498
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,447
Isn't he approaching Hui Jin?

499
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:27,527
Hey, hey. Don't make a move yet.

500
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:30,097
Let go, let go! This is urgent.

501
00:40:34,937 --> 00:40:38,417
I'm sorry, but I think it's
best if I disappear for a while.

502
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,427
Is there a place where I can hide in here?

503
00:40:42,277 --> 00:40:44,587
There's a rest room at the back. What's wrong?

504
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:46,837
Let's go. We need to go there right now.

505
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,117
What if he does something bad?

506
00:40:48,177 --> 00:40:50,187
Even so, where can he run?

507
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:52,027
Now is the right timing!

508
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:54,257
Just leave it to the
police, stay out of it!

509
00:40:54,317 --> 00:40:55,257
Let go!

510
00:41:02,197 --> 00:41:03,177
No!

511
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,227
Aigoo...
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)

512
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:06,607
Hey, hey!

513
00:41:06,737 --> 00:41:08,707
Hey!

514
00:41:23,977 --> 00:41:27,027
Hold on, don't cause a disturbance, just use words!

515
00:41:27,047 --> 00:41:28,577
Please help, help.

516
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:31,277
Wait! Catch him! Catch him! Arrest him!

517
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:33,637
Catch him! Catch him!

518
00:41:37,317 --> 00:41:39,157
It's all right, everyone please calm down.

519
00:41:39,187 --> 00:41:40,427
It's nothing.

520
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:43,057
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

521
00:41:43,387 --> 00:41:45,157
Oppa, what are you doing here?

522
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:47,817
You should be grateful.
If I wasn't on the same flight,

523
00:41:47,867 --> 00:41:49,287
you would've been harassed by the stalker.

524
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:52,137
Who's the stalker?

525
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:55,267
That punk, him.

526
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:58,407
<i>It's Han Dong Min!</i>

527
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:03,687
<i>Isn't that Han Dong Min?</i>

528
00:42:03,747 --> 00:42:05,347
It's Han Dong Min!

529
00:42:06,547 --> 00:42:07,087
Celebrities?

530
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:08,547
It's Han Dong Min and Choe Hui Jin!

531
00:42:09,087 --> 00:42:09,967
<i>Omo, really?</i>

532
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:11,567
Please, let me explain the situation.

533
00:42:11,617 --> 00:42:14,157
We suspected that this passenger
was causing a slight disturbance,

534
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:18,477
however we are taking control
of the situation, so please do not worry.

535
00:42:19,627 --> 00:42:20,167
So...

536
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:21,167
Hold on!

537
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:23,087
Can I do the explanation?

538
00:42:23,297 --> 00:42:24,047
What?

539
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:25,947
Hey... Hey...

540
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:28,847
Don't expose yourself, do you hear me?

541
00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:30,877
Don't!

542
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:32,957
Hello. I'm actor Han Dong Min.

543
00:42:33,047 --> 00:42:34,997
Wow!

544
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:38,207
Many were frightened, am I right?

545
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:40,507
Sorry for causing a disturbance.

546
00:42:40,647 --> 00:42:46,347
In fact, there are actors from the new drama
series, New Lady Jang on this flight.

547
00:42:46,387 --> 00:42:49,997
Me, Miss Yun Na Jeong and Miss Choe Hui Jin.

548
00:42:52,127 --> 00:43:00,817
I was lucky enough to spot a person stalking Choe Hui Jin.

549
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:04,227
That is the reason for the disturbance here.

550
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:05,967
Everyone understands, right?

551
00:43:06,007 --> 00:43:08,197
<i>What a good example!</i>

552
00:43:08,277 --> 00:43:10,337
<i>-So handsome!
-I love you!</i>

553
00:43:13,747 --> 00:43:15,877
I love you all as well!

554
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:17,737
You're just like a bodyguard!

555
00:43:17,757 --> 00:43:19,417
Dong Min oppa is really great!

556
00:43:19,437 --> 00:43:20,847
You're great, too!

557
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,787
Then, please, continue.

558
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:30,537
Upon landing, the suspect will be handed to the police.

559
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:33,807
Let's all calm down, now. Please enjoy the rest of the flight.

560
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,008
Take him away.

561
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:39,468
<i>You're dead.</i>

562
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:43,478
Police?

563
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:45,268
This was the stalker from before?

564
00:43:45,348 --> 00:43:46,778
Why didn't you say anything?

565
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:49,178
If the police arrests him, we'll be in big trouble.

566
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:51,658
Wait a moment.

567
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:56,308
Why call the police?

568
00:43:56,688 --> 00:43:58,958
What? Of course...

569
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:04,828
This person is not a stalker.

570
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,828
He's someone I know.

571
00:44:09,238 --> 00:44:10,018
What?

572
00:44:11,508 --> 00:44:13,368
What is she saying?

573
00:44:15,508 --> 00:44:17,508
Miss Hui Jin, what do you mean by that?

574
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:23,248
He is not a stalker. He boarded the plane with me.

575
00:44:23,648 --> 00:44:26,048
I bought the tickets. We came together.

576
00:44:26,988 --> 00:44:29,308
So don't call the police.

577
00:44:29,328 --> 00:44:30,048
Hey.

578
00:44:30,058 --> 00:44:32,508
Don't say anything more. Just let it be.

579
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:33,868
You bought the tickets?

580
00:44:34,058 --> 00:44:34,938
Why?

581
00:44:35,928 --> 00:44:41,478
Because he's my boyfriend.

582
00:44:55,678 --> 00:44:58,458
Just now... what did you...

583
00:44:58,748 --> 00:45:01,668
He isn't stalking me. We came together.

584
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:05,798
It was settled using my card.
You can confirm it if you want to know.

585
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,408
We sat separately for fear
that there might be rumors.

586
00:45:09,028 --> 00:45:10,458
You've got a rough idea now, don't you?

587
00:45:10,898 --> 00:45:14,328
So contact the police at once and tell
them it's just a misunderstanding.

588
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:20,218
Under these circumstances, we're the victims.
If you let us explain to the police,

589
00:45:20,638 --> 00:45:23,308
I won't let you off for invading our privacy.

590
00:45:41,998 --> 00:45:44,358
<i>What is this big reversal?</i>

591
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,828
It's extremely funny.

592
00:45:45,898 --> 00:45:49,368
This is a scoop. Han Dong Min
just became a complete joke.

593
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:52,838
Ah, it's completely different from a minute ago.

594
00:45:53,368 --> 00:45:54,348
What's this?

595
00:45:54,438 --> 00:45:56,308
Even beating up people's lovers?

596
00:45:56,708 --> 00:46:00,308
Aigoo, fool.

597
00:46:09,658 --> 00:46:13,658
I'm not very smart, so why don't you tell me..

598
00:46:15,528 --> 00:46:23,538
..if we become lovers, what will become of us?

599
00:46:41,658 --> 00:46:44,238
-=Next Episode Preview=-

600
00:46:44,298 --> 00:46:49,278
<i>From the moment you step off this plane,
you will probably become a national hero?</i>

601
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:51,568
<i>Hey, what does this punk do?</i>

602
00:46:51,828 --> 00:46:54,098
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

603
00:46:54,298 --> 00:46:57,918
-After saving you, you're being meddlesome, seriously.
-What is meddlesome?

604
00:46:57,968 --> 00:47:03,238
Someone who's of a very far different type
compared to Mr. Han Dong Min. Well then...

605
00:47:03,788 --> 00:47:05,978
Wow, so happy.

606
00:47:05,978 --> 00:47:08,868
<i>Suffering all this... Thank you.</i>

607
00:47:09,048 --> 00:47:12,828
<i>If My Lord is able to
withstand it, so will I.</i>

608
00:47:13,048 --> 00:47:16,428
<i>Because of him that matters turned
out this way. He just withdraws?</i>

609
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:17,788
<i>Because I'm a busy person.</i>

610
00:47:17,788 --> 00:47:20,788
Kill him... immediately.

611
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:23,168
<i>I have the power.</i>

612
00:47:24,078 --> 00:47:26,328
<i>Have you been doing well?</i>
