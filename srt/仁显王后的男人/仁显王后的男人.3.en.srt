1
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:34,454
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

2
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:36,003
<i>(Previously on Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

3
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,401
<i>How did it go?</i>

4
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,881
<i>There was a problem.</i>

5
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,716
<i>There was a problem?</i>

6
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:45,161
<i>Today's incident was planned
by Minister Min and the queen.</i>

7
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:47,661
<i>We will protect you until the very end,
Your Highness.</i>

8
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:49,481
<i>Keep it safe.</i>

9
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,340
<i>Keep this on your body.</i>

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,215
<i>It's a talisman.</i>

11
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,015
<i>I had a confidential letter
for the king.</i>

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,439
<i>Please allow me to see him.</i>

13
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,875
<i>However, you must keep it a secret.</i>

14
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:04,561
<i>Why don't you meet with him quietly
in the Hongmoongwan study?</i>

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,816
<i>I put my sword into his throat.</i>

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,013
<i>He disappeared into thin air.</i>

17
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,100
<i>Where is he?</i>

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,349
<i>Excuse me.</i>

19
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:17,150
<i>Are you not an actor in this drama?</i>

20
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,992
<i>Why are you so angry?</i>

21
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:23,001
<i>What? You ran into Han Dong Min?</i>

22
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:25,795
<i>What? You took of your clothes?</i>

23
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:27,733
<i>He came into the audition!</i>

24
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,075
<i>What? He's playing King Sukjong!</i>

25
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:31,534
<i>Damn it.</i>

26
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:34,861
<i>Should we date again?</i>

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,269
<i>Where is this place?</i>

28
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,099
<i>What?</i>

29
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:44,292
<i>Am I dead right now or am I dreaming?</i>

30
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:57,688
Then, is this man dead?

31
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,472
He's really dead?

32
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:03,719
I asked you first. Where is this place?

33
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:29,842
Yes, Mother.

34
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:32,021
You really don't need to worry.

35
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,852
They say it's just stress.

36
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:36,770
She had been stressed for a few days
because of the press conference.

37
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,781
Yes, yes. I'll call once she wakes up.

38
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:45,055
Are you awake?

39
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:49,129
Why are you so weak, girl?

40
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,905
What am I supposed to do with you?

41
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,036
- What about that guy?
- Huh?

42
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:55,919
What happened to that man
with the sword?

43
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,913
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:04,051
Gosh! How can you get sick
on your debut stage?

45
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,867
If you faint over something like that

46
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,682
what are you planning
to do in the future?

47
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:09,842
That's not why I fainted.

48
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:10,853
What?

49
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:14,213
- There was a man.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:17,192
There was a man dressed in clothes
from the Joseon era.

51
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,352
He appeared riding on a horse
with a sword this big.

52
00:03:21,352 --> 00:03:22,842
Then he killed a man.

53
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,882
All this blood
splattered onto my clothes.

54
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:28,390
Then he died.

55
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,212
He definitely died, but suddenly
he dried up and became mummified.

56
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,465
A person became a mummy!

57
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,662
It didn't even take ten seconds.

58
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:38,872
Then suddenly...

59
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:41,562
only the bones were left.

60
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:46,211
It turned to dust
and started to disperse.

61
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,664
Did you have a dream?

62
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:53,230
You must have had a dream.

63
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,200
You fainted from low blood pressure
right after talking to me.

64
00:03:58,536 --> 00:03:59,747
Choi Hee Jin!

65
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,091
- It's Choi Hee Jin.
- Choi Hee Jin!

66
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,847
- Hee Jin!
- Are you okay?

67
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:08,013
<i>We all went looking for you, found you,
and brought you to the hospital.</i>

68
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,241
No.

69
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,022
What do you mean, no?

70
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:15,866
No! Something happened
in between that time.

71
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:19,466
Hey! Are you saying
that in less than ten minutes

72
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:22,860
a man on a horse appeared
and killed another man?

73
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,100
Then the dead man became a mummy,
then flew away into dust?

74
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,733
Why are you saying such nonsense?

75
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:32,072
Just call your mother.
She's totally worried.

76
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,584
Here. Call her.

77
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:38,377
It was really just a dream?

78
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,101
This is so upsetting.

79
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,995
It was so hard
to get this dress sponsored.

80
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:46,463
You couldn't even get one picture
of yourself in it.

81
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,146
You're driving me insane,
you nervous thing.

82
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:51,365
Gosh!

83
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,463
Yes, Section Chief.

84
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:59,843
Yes, I'm in the hospital
because something came up.

85
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:01,132
Pardon me?

86
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,480
It was just a dream?

87
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:09,050
It didn't seem like a dream.

88
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:26,516
It's not there.

89
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:32,543
Then it was really a dream?

90
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,966
That makes no sense.

91
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,249
I thought she had gone to the restroom,
but it was really serious.

92
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,846
She really passed out?

93
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:45,514
Yes, I'm telling you she did.

94
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,600
They went looking for her and she was
passed out on the ground.

95
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,278
They called an ambulance and took her
to the hospital.

96
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:53,730
She's not the type to faint from nerves.

97
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,790
She even entered the Miss Korea pageant.

98
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,800
- Is Na Jung not seeing anyone?
- What?

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,411
She must still like me.

100
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,942
She's not as cool as I expected.

101
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:16,442
Please, I'm begging you.

102
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,096
Han Dong Min, please just quietly film
the drama this time.

103
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:25,425
Whether it's Jang Heebin or In Hyun,
let them live their lives.

104
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:28,822
Yes, I want to leave them alone,
but they keep starting it.

105
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,829
I'm sure that Na Jung is behind it.

106
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:33,540
Wait now.

107
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,800
Hello.

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,668
Who else would it be? It's Dong Min.

109
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,843
How is Hee Jin?

110
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:47,927
Why would you come? Don't come.

111
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:49,668
Yoon Na Jung?

112
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:51,550
Oh! How did you know?

113
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,396
It seemed like she was really
being hard on Hee Jin.

114
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:56,500
Really?

115
00:06:57,404 --> 00:07:00,540
Of course she was. What did she say?

116
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,598
I don't know the details.

117
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,067
Well, she was in a very bad mood,
though that's not why she fainted.

118
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,947
That could be why she fainted.

119
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:11,165
Stage fright doesn't suit her.

120
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,761
That's true,
but I don't think that's why.

121
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,052
You can assume that's why.
It is because of that.

122
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:17,276
No, but...

123
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:20,447
I think I can picture it.
Okay, tell her I'll visit tomorrow.

124
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:24,814
I think it's better you don't come.
Hello? Hello?

125
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:26,959
This punk has no manners at all.

126
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,048
Hurry up. We have to go.

127
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,122
Chun Soo, all the reporters
will be at the dinner, right?

128
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,182
Yes.

129
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,389
Why?

130
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,831
I was going help her get noticed at
the press conference.

131
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:42,651
That got ruined.

132
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,711
Instead, I'll make Choi Hee Jin ranked
number one on the search lists.

133
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:48,142
What now? What are you planning?

134
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:52,540
<i>She is the one who gave me
a bouquet of flowers.</i>

135
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,209
What are you doing?

136
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:08,781
I can't find my cell phone.
Have you seen it?

137
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:15,278
Oh, it's really not here.
I must have lost it.

138
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,379
You can't have anyone grab it up.

139
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:20,802
You have to protect your privacy.
Did you have any weird pictures?

140
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:23,132
I don't have weird pictures.

141
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,281
What is this?

142
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,385
- What is it?
- What is that?

143
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:34,235
Which side is the front?

144
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:35,596
Here, here.

145
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,636
What is this? What does it mean?

146
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:42,134
Are you asking because you think
I would know?

147
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:43,216
No.

148
00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:45,808
This isn't mine,
so why is it in my purse?

149
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:52,052
Ah! All of your belongings fell out of
your bag when you passed out.

150
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:54,119
The crew members grabbed up everything.

151
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,167
They must've brought something else too.

152
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,767
Oh! Your cell phone must be there.
Try calling.

153
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:34,885
- <i>The customer is unable to take your...</i>
- Not picking up.

154
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:38,255
Then I guess no one took it.
That's a relief.

155
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:42,188
Oh yeah! We had connected our phones
to track each other.

156
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:43,385
Oh yeah!

157
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,336
- It's working.
- Where is it?

158
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,565
It's inside the Gyeongbok Palace.

159
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:54,416
You can go look for it tomorrow.

160
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:58,174
I lost it outside,
so why is it inside the palace?

161
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:00,735
That's because
this isn't totally precise.

162
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:02,292
I'm sure it's around there somewhere.

163
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,720
No...

164
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:53,306
- It's Choi Hee Jin.
- Choi Hee Jin!

165
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:55,501
Over here.

166
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,889
Hurry.

167
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,620
I think she needs to go to the hospital.

168
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:54,009
<i>Minister Min, I've brought her.</i>

169
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:00,058
You may leave.

170
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,701
Kim Boong Do was chased by my men
and he was able to escape.

171
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,214
Taking this incident into account

172
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:14,644
I have determined that he is a much
more skilled man than I had thought.

173
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:19,187
However, after hearing about today,
I feel he is not a brave man.

174
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:22,576
What do you think?

175
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,770
The Kim Boong Do that I know
has always been this way.

176
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,548
He is lowly and pathetic.

177
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:31,998
That is why he made no effort to come
from the borders while his family died.

178
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:36,827
It was a royal command to stay at the
borders no matter what happened.

179
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:40,794
Then what is his reason
for not coming for you?

180
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:46,034
If a man has been intimate
with a woman for years

181
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,971
should he not take some action?

182
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:49,288
What do you mean, intimate?

183
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:50,917
Be careful what you say!

184
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,754
He was the husband of the lady
that I served.

185
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:59,385
It is because of his late wife
that I wished to help him.

186
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:01,538
I am nothing but a servant maid.

187
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:06,365
How could someone who wastes his time
on a lowly servant be a great man?

188
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:14,235
Now I see,
you alone are in love with him.

189
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:19,835
Are you saying it is okay for you to die
for the man you love?

190
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:27,226
You are the best gisaeng in all of
Hanyang, and this is all you amount to?

191
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,505
A servant girl is willing to sacrifice
her life.

192
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:41,405
The master is on the run.

193
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:44,166
That is why the Western faction
is in this state.

194
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:48,378
Reinstate the deposed queen?
Are you all insane?

195
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:49,813
Take this wench out of here!

196
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:51,192
I'm losing my appetite to drink.

197
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,288
- Have you found him?
- He is gone.

198
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:03,817
Are you saying Kim Boong Do is gone
or Jong Soo is gone?

199
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,166
They are both gone.

200
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,735
If they raised their swords,
one of them must have died.

201
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:11,385
There is no trace of them,
let alone a body.

202
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:14,527
Don't you think it is Jong Soo
who has died?

203
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,827
He probably killed him
and buried him somewhere.

204
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:19,995
Buried him?

205
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:21,767
I underestimated him
because he was a scholar.

206
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:24,100
He is no ordinary man.

207
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:58,993
<i>Shi Do Tong Rae.</i>

208
00:14:58,993 --> 00:15:03,354
<i>This means that time passes,
but the location is the same.</i>

209
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:06,727
<i>If I go left, I will likely see
Jagyeongjeon Palace.</i>

210
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,350
<i>If I go straight, the Gyotaejeon Palace.</i>

211
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:11,865
<i>Gangnyeongjeon Palace.</i>

212
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:15,422
<i>Sajeongjeon Palace.</i>

213
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:19,331
<i>Once I pass this place,
Geunjeongjeon Palace.</i>

214
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:23,272
<i>Wouldn't my place still be here?</i>

215
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:25,611
<i>Then how many years have passed?</i>

216
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:51,062
Aren't we doing the Geunjeongjeon scene
in the afternoon?

217
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,410
What are you talking about?
It's the third one, dummy.

218
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,591
The Geunjeongjeon filming is third?

219
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:57,528
My schedule doesn't say that.

220
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,730
It got all switched around
because of Queen In Hyun.

221
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,480
Queen In Hyun got admitted
to the hospital.

222
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,717
You're in the middle of filming, right?

223
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,888
What is this "filming"?

224
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:22,259
The Geunjeongjeon filming is third?

225
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,392
It got all switched around
because of Queen In Hyun.

226
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,342
<i>Queen In Hyun got admitted
to the hospital.</i>

227
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:28,136
I'm Queen In Hyun.

228
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:30,857
I'm the Queen In Hyun.

229
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,238
Queen In Hyun.

230
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,347
Hey, Han Dong Min! Wake up.
We have no time.

231
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,086
Hurry. You have to go. There's no time.

232
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:55,268
- Okay.
- Seriously?

233
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:56,690
Hurry. Go.

234
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:15,354
Oh? Where did my clothes go?

235
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:16,864
Have you seen my clothes?

236
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:19,214
- No.
- It was just there.

237
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:20,623
Where did it go?

238
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:22,276
I put them right here.

239
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:25,165
Oh, what about my bag?

240
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:26,603
- What?
- What?

241
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:29,357
My bag was right here. Where did it go?

242
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:55,916
<i>Unfortunately, Choi Hee Jin
who plays Queen In Hyun</i>

243
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,468
<i>was ill and couldn't be here.</i>

244
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:01,450
<i>In that time, Han Dong Min who plays
Sukjong has already got another woman...</i>

245
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,654
Look at them. Look at them.

246
00:20:03,654 --> 00:20:06,714
You two are already having
such a friendly conversation.

247
00:20:06,714 --> 00:20:08,387
You didn't even hear my question.

248
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:13,299
I guess I was busy trying to seduce him
while Queen In Hyun was away.

249
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,970
- Oh my.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

250
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:19,116
Have you already been won over?

251
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:23,147
I was almost swayed a little,
but I shouldn't do that already, right?

252
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:30,221
<i>Yes, if you do not want to lose him
to Jang Heebin...</i>

253
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:33,070
What a joke you all are.

254
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:40,669
Hey, look at that. Look.

255
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:43,539
They are in full couple-mode
now that you're not there.

256
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:46,671
Oh! What a relief.

257
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:50,028
I was worried that they'd couple him
up with me.

258
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:52,220
Goodness.

259
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:57,480
I was thinking about dropping by the set.

260
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Why?

261
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,116
Just thought I should go by
with some food or something.

262
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:03,546
I feel guilty towards the crew.

263
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:07,352
- Why are you so thoughtless?
- What?

264
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:09,568
Why would you go
and have people think you missed work

265
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,786
when you're not even sick?

266
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,736
You're right.

267
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:17,544
The articles are already out that you
fainted from low blood pressure.

268
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,387
It's best for you to just stay put.

269
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:24,074
The truth is not important
in this industry.

270
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,443
It's what people think is the truth
that is important.

271
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:30,535
Oh, you're right.

272
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:35,037
Wow, Jo Soo Kyung. I like that saying.

273
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:38,678
Write it down, write it down.
You should write down cool things I say.

274
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:39,948
I really should write it down.

275
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,666
I'm going to use it for interviews later.

276
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:43,950
I'm so full.

277
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:49,215
Hey, I'm going to gain weight
because you're not eating.

278
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:01,306
<i>This is Yoon Na Jung.</i>

279
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,546
Yeah. Is truth important?

280
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:13,526
What's important is that people
think you're the nation's fairy.

281
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:16,469
<i>Here's Han Dong Min
playing the role of Sukjong.</i>

282
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:25,053
<i>There was a commotion
involving a horse in Seoul.</i>

283
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,103
<i>Reporter Park Shi Hoon with the story.</i>

284
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:29,454
<i>This is a cafe in Samcheong-dong,
where many people come to sightsee.</i>

285
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:34,797
<i>Yesterday afternoon, a horse appeared,
blocked the streets, and caused a stir.</i>

286
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:37,674
<i>The horse caused a disturbance
for an hour.</i>

287
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:41,209
<i>It was finally caught by rescue workers
and the police.</i>

288
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:44,650
<i>We interviewed one of the witnesses
from yesterday.</i>

289
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,855
- <i>What happened yesterday?</i>
- That...

290
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:50,501
- That...
- <i>It appeared suddenly and shocked us.</i>

291
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:53,846
<i>Experts believe the saddle on the horse
is from the mid-Joseon era.</i>

292
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:55,881
<i>They are looking into runaway horses
from historical film-shoots.</i>

293
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:58,691
That's the horse. It really is!

294
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:01,398
<i>I am Park Shi Hoon with CJM News.</i>

295
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:03,239
So, it wasn't a dream?

296
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:06,189
It wasn't a dream.

297
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:12,152
I'm sure that he has my cell phone too.

298
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,453
Give me your phone.

299
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:24,791
- Why do you need my phone?
- Hurry, hurry.

300
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,830
Your car keys too.

301
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,097
What? Why?

302
00:23:27,123 --> 00:23:29,615
I just need to press this
to find my phone?

303
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:31,396
Yes, that's right.

304
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:33,913
Hey, I'll go find your phone.

305
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,582
Where are you going?

306
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,240
No. I have to find it.

307
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,817
I have to meet that man.
I'm dying of curiosity.

308
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,760
What man?

309
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,319
The man who's good at sword-fighting.

310
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,143
Hey, Choi...

311
00:23:50,523 --> 00:23:52,599
What is she talking about?

312
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:04,824
Red is my cell phone,
and blue is this one.

313
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:13,150
Oh yeah.
I can't be seen by my coworkers.

314
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,595
I think I'm almost there.

315
00:24:47,692 --> 00:24:48,984
Is he walking?

316
00:24:56,573 --> 00:24:58,329
Where is he going?

317
00:24:58,329 --> 00:24:59,628
He's coming this way.

318
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,019
I'm happy to see you.
I'm truly happy to see you.

319
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,060
I thought it would be hard to find you.
I did not realize we'd meet so easily.

320
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:35,433
Are you staff?
You're a staff member of our team?

321
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,422
What is staff?

322
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,761
Did you call this staff?

323
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,709
Let's leave and talk.

324
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:50,025
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

325
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:01,518
Who are you? Tell me now.

326
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,432
You shocked me so much that I fainted.
I couldn't sleep all night.

327
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,861
Why do you have that around your neck?

328
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:10,667
Oh, so are you
on the special effects team?

329
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,777
So, was all of that special effects?

330
00:26:14,777 --> 00:26:18,096
The mummy, dead person, and the blood.
Was that all special effects?

331
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:22,896
Hey, answer me please.

332
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:25,497
You should explain things to me
since you gave me a shock.

333
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:27,916
- Believe what you'd like.
- What?

334
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:30,582
It would be a problem if you passed
out because of me again.

335
00:26:30,582 --> 00:26:32,419
Believe whatever puts you at ease.

336
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,128
What are you saying?
You're confusing me even more.

337
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:37,378
It's because I do not know anything.

338
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:39,727
I wish you would help me understand.

339
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:42,807
Seriously, what are you saying?

340
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:48,536
Why are they coming here? Get in for now.

341
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:53,936
I think one, two,
and three are very different.

342
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,607
I said get in.

343
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:04,825
I don't know how to open it.

344
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,310
What did you say?

345
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:13,328
Get in now. The director can't see me.

346
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:19,518
Put on your seat belt.

347
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:23,078
I said put on your seat belt.

348
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:24,500
You'll have to do it for me.

349
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:27,532
- What?
- I don't know how to do it.

350
00:27:29,202 --> 00:27:33,362
Are you asking me to put it on for you
with my own hands?

351
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,893
Are you hitting on me, or what?

352
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:37,534
Seriously, what's with you!

353
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,823
Why are you laughing?

354
00:27:40,823 --> 00:27:43,289
I'm not trying to make you angry,
and I'm sorry.

355
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:45,198
However, I do not understand your words
at all.

356
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:51,020
Why don't you understand Korean?
It's not like you're stupid.

357
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,853
I'm no different than a stupid person.

358
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:56,042
Treat me like a stupid person,
and please help me with this.

359
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,203
I see why you got angry at me
for asking you to do this.

360
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:28,961
Isn't that Choi Hee Jin?

361
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,461
I'm sure she's at the hospital.
Why would she be here?

362
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:39,536
I suppose so.

363
00:28:55,845 --> 00:28:57,536
Where are we going?

364
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,736
That place has too many eyes,
so we can't be there.

365
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:02,445
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.

366
00:29:02,445 --> 00:29:05,926
I do not have time to talk.
I waited a long time for you.

367
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:08,388
- Why is that?
- You have something of mine.

368
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:09,537
What?

369
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:12,076
- A yellow envelope.
- Yellow envelope?

370
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:14,086
Oh, the paper with the Hanja characters.

371
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,265
Yes. Do you have it?

372
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:16,906
It was in my purse.

373
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:17,906
Where is it?

374
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:20,205
It's not here right now.
It's at the hospital.

375
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:22,128
Where is that?

376
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,553
It's not far. Just over there.

377
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:27,450
Someone's life depends on it.
Please hurry.

378
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,633
Life? Whose life?

379
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,290
Gosh, that guy...

380
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:41,537
You cut me off, you punk!
Drive properly!

381
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,625
I almost hit his car.

382
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:52,845
What is it?

383
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:54,749
Haven't you seen a person drive before?

384
00:29:55,684 --> 00:29:57,934
Is this called driving?

385
00:29:57,934 --> 00:30:00,079
"Is this called driving?"

386
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:02,470
What is the meaning
behind that question?

387
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,328
You're not asking
because you really don't know.

388
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:06,009
I asked because I don't know.

389
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:26,089
"I was so foolish and missed my timing."

390
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:29,101
"You should blame this
on my foolishness."

391
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,090
Is the schedule not out yet?

392
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,971
The schedule is completely messed up
because of Choi Hee Jin.

393
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:39,318
It's still not up yet.

394
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:41,638
Really?

395
00:30:45,078 --> 00:30:47,723
Hello? Yes, President.

396
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:49,903
What do you mean? What!

397
00:30:49,903 --> 00:30:51,743
Search ranking number one?

398
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:52,993
Hold on.

399
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,590
Hey! What is it?

400
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:08,558
Oh? Why is my name there?

401
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:09,628
I'll check first.

402
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:14,167
- Did you fight with Choi Hee Jin?
- What?

403
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,397
There's an article in the news.

404
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,942
Isn't this you?

405
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:23,461
Rookie actress B suffers verbal abuse.
Hospitalized by star actress A.

406
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:30,324
Unbecoming of her status as a Hallyu star

407
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:33,791
actress A has been harshly trying to
control rookie actress B.

408
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,021
Their characters are rivals in their
current drama.

409
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:41,701
Actress A verbally abused B with harsh
words before the press conference.

410
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:44,943
Actress B was so traumatized that she
was taken to the hospital.

411
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,509
Actress B was unable to take part in
the press conference.

412
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,089
Actress A's plans to keep B in check
have succeeded for now.

413
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:59,626
It's clearly you
to anyone who reads this.

414
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,992
Na Jung, did you really do that?

415
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:05,041
Of course you didn't.

416
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,684
You didn't even have time to meet her.

417
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,673
I know who did this.

418
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,134
Seriously, that little...

419
00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:26,692
I see her blood pressure is up.

420
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:28,183
Who told you to mess with me?

421
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:30,452
No. I have no interest in you.

422
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:22,401
This is kind of strange.
Am I on a hidden camera show?

423
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:25,660
You have that look like you don't
understand again.

424
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,410
If you are acting, you could win an
Academy Award.

425
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:30,980
I really did not understand.

426
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:33,979
Come on out.

427
00:34:04,645 --> 00:34:06,491
I'll ask you just one thing.

428
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:09,380
How many years have passed since the
Joseon Hyeonjong era?

429
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,721
Hyeonjong?

430
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:13,742
Hyeonjong was before Sukjong.

431
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:16,958
I think over 300 years.

432
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:18,798
Did you say 300 years?

433
00:34:18,798 --> 00:34:20,786
It's probably been about 300 years.

434
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:23,177
Our script is set in 1690.

435
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:27,860
300 years, you say.

436
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:44,278
Get in. It's the thirteenth floor.

437
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:19,911
It's your first time on this, right?

438
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:21,442
It is my first time.

439
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:25,125
The car and cell phone too?

440
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,237
Car?

441
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:32,230
Car must be the fast thing we rode
in just now.

442
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,405
Cell phone.

443
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:35,496
What is that?

444
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,407
Is it that thing in your hand?

445
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:42,088
You do not need to ask.
Everything is a first time for me.

446
00:35:46,557 --> 00:35:47,806
So, you are alive.

447
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:52,096
You're not a dream, or a ghost.

448
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:53,706
You're not on the special effects team.

449
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:56,463
Who are you? Who, exactly, are you?

450
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,318
I'm a Kim from Cheongpoong.

451
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:03,155
The 17th generation to Cheongro.

452
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:05,197
Officer in the Hongmoongwan.
I'm Kim Boong Do.

453
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:11,014
I know it is not an answer you want.

454
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:13,277
I cannot believe it either.

455
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:16,614
I believe I've come to a world
300 years in the future.

456
00:36:27,094 --> 00:36:28,594
Should we not exit?

457
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,644
So, to summarize...

458
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:41,967
you are a person from 300 years ago
in Joseon during Sukjong's reign.

459
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:45,684
You came here through a talisman
that is like a time machine.

460
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:47,195
Then you ended up here.

461
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:48,387
Isn't that right?

462
00:36:50,398 --> 00:36:52,704
Are you telling me
I'm supposed to believe that?

463
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:54,711
You're a really funny person.

464
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:57,181
I understand that you are very confused.

465
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,672
I am about to go insane, as well.

466
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:01,021
Who do you think is having a harder time?

467
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:04,858
If all of this is true...
that would be you.

468
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:06,282
Thank you for understanding.

469
00:37:08,552 --> 00:37:12,003
No, no! I don't believe it.
You could be crazy and saying this.

470
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:13,496
How can I believe it?

471
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:15,076
You're dressed so well.

472
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:18,144
Yet, you insist you're from
the Joseon era. I can't believe you.

473
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:19,630
Is this being dressed well?

474
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,898
You're not just dressed well.
You look super trendy.

475
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:25,539
Look at that fake expression.

476
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:28,585
Are you going to say you didn't
understand again? Nonsense!

477
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:33,280
You don't have to believe me.
I have trouble believing it too.

478
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,914
Please give me the envelope.
Then you will have your answer.

479
00:37:38,074 --> 00:37:42,356
I can't believe it, or not believe it.
How is this happening to me?

480
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:45,474
Am I crazy and going insane?
I must just be so stressed out.

481
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:49,166
Is this how mental patients
slowly lose their minds?

482
00:37:53,257 --> 00:37:56,666
- Are you okay?
- Ouch. It hurts.

483
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,376
Where did my purse go? That's strange.

484
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:00,987
Did you happen to lose it?

485
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,253
No. I didn't take it out of this room.

486
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:37,114
It's not even a UFO,
but a freaking time machine.

487
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,126
I did like The Terminator
when I was young

488
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:41,139
but that is just a movie.

489
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:43,737
Soo Kyung, have you seen my purse?

490
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:03,210
What brings you by?

491
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:06,240
I came to see you because you're ill.

492
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,088
They said you went into exhaustion
over taking a few pictures.

493
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:13,492
But, you look fine to me.

494
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:18,458
- Well...
- I am here to visit you in the hospital.

495
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,028
I couldn't come empty-handed.

496
00:39:25,284 --> 00:39:26,713
Why are you doing this?

497
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:28,978
You said I threatened you.

498
00:39:28,978 --> 00:39:31,079
That wasn't even threatening.

499
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,173
It seems like you don't know what real
threatening and verbal abuse is.

500
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:35,391
So, I came to show you.

501
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:37,871
Seriously, what are you doing!

502
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,067
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

503
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,659
Why are you doing this?

504
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,809
You said I threatened you.

505
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,987
That wasn't even threatening.

506
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:53,132
It seems like you don't know what real
threatening and verbal abuse is.

507
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:54,291
So, I came to show you.

508
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,429
Seriously, what are you doing!

509
00:39:58,382 --> 00:40:01,382
Hey. You call yourself an actress.

510
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:04,036
I have to look at you
and say lines with you?

511
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:08,402
Faking a fainting spell,
and these rumors.

512
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:10,782
Who the hell do you think you are?

513
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:13,266
Aren't you being too much?

514
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:15,769
- What did you say?
- What?

515
00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:19,541
You fainted because you were traumatized
by my threats?

516
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21,219
I never said anything like that.

517
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:24,407
If you never said anything like that,
why would there be articles?

518
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:27,108
Articles? What articles?

519
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:31,387
Oh, I'm sure
you didn't tell them yourself.

520
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,407
You probably don't even know
any reporters.

521
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:36,418
You probably went running
to Han Dong Min.

522
00:40:36,418 --> 00:40:38,282
You told him you fainted because of me.

523
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:40,045
I never said that to him.

524
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:41,186
You say you didn't?

525
00:40:41,186 --> 00:40:43,565
Han Dong Min and I are not close enough
to talk like that.

526
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:46,146
Gosh! Seriously, you...

527
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:50,429
Oh! Oh my! Who is this?

528
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:52,715
Oh, oh! What is this?

529
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:06,166
Can you lock this?

530
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,306
You turn it.

531
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,130
You really don't even know
how to lock a door?

532
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,431
I just learned.

533
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:32,737
What was that?

534
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,896
Are you Yoon Na Jung, by any chance?

535
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,552
Ah, you're in the same drama
as Choi Hee Jin, right?

536
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,090
You must have come to visit.

537
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,152
Well, yes.

538
00:41:51,152 --> 00:41:54,103
Please take good care of Hee Jin.

539
00:41:54,103 --> 00:41:55,431
Of course.

540
00:42:07,153 --> 00:42:08,331
I think she's gone.

541
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:13,639
How could you
jump out of there like that?

542
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,331
I don't even know who you are.

543
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:19,639
How am I supposed to explain who you are
to Yoon Na Jung?

544
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:26,800
I'm sorry to get involved,
but I couldn't watch you get hit.

545
00:42:32,456 --> 00:42:33,860
You're bleeding.

546
00:42:40,418 --> 00:42:41,532
Are you all right?

547
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:45,744
This is really so absurd.

548
00:42:45,744 --> 00:42:49,083
Why do things keep happening to me
without me knowing what's going on?

549
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:55,014
I don't understand you at all either.

550
00:42:57,655 --> 00:43:00,614
"Sa Yoo Geub Ji Bool Baek Ja Ro Dae
Gwan Ji Ok Ja Dae Myung Hwan Yi"

551
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,824
"Moo Jo Geub Yi Sok Gi Boon."
That is a saying.

552
00:43:05,163 --> 00:43:08,913
There are some things in life that you
cannot resolve quickly.

553
00:43:08,913 --> 00:43:12,344
Let yourself be at peace and leave it.
It will resolve itself.

554
00:43:12,344 --> 00:43:14,355
Do not get upset so easily.

555
00:43:16,784 --> 00:43:19,367
Do you really know
what you're talking about?

556
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:21,342
You can't even open a car door.

557
00:43:22,244 --> 00:43:23,800
The works of Confucius
from a thousand years ago

558
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,744
were still applicable in my time.

559
00:43:25,744 --> 00:43:27,567
How different could it be now
from 300 years ago.

560
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:28,677
People are still the same.

561
00:43:34,123 --> 00:43:37,894
Now that I've found this,
I'll change and go.

562
00:43:37,894 --> 00:43:40,143
I think I'd be stupid
to go back looking like this.

563
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,978
Na Jung.

564
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,217
I said we should call first.
Why didn't you wait?

565
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:02,675
What's wrong with your face?

566
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:05,487
You didn't create a problem, did you?

567
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:07,117
- I did.
- What!

568
00:44:09,978 --> 00:44:13,298
Someone was in the room.
He saw it all. What should I do?

569
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:15,797
What did he see?

570
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:18,740
I was a bit...

571
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:23,079
Na Jung, why are you being like this?

572
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:24,396
It was a man.

573
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:26,918
I just don't know who it was.

574
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:29,039
Can you go up and find out who it was?

575
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:35,248
What was that thing you said earlier?

576
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:36,322
What?

577
00:44:37,335 --> 00:44:40,795
"Sa Yoo Geub Ji..." that thing.

578
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:42,148
I want to write it down.

579
00:44:42,148 --> 00:44:46,126
I like to write down good lines
to use for interviews.

580
00:44:48,043 --> 00:44:50,032
Do you have a name?

581
00:44:50,032 --> 00:44:52,394
Who doesn't have a name?

582
00:44:52,394 --> 00:44:54,130
I'm Choi Hee Jin.

583
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,309
Choi Hee Jin.

584
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,690
Then why did you say you were
Queen In Hyun?

585
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,929
Queen In Hyun?

586
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,759
Ah, that's just my role.

587
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:06,280
That was the role I am playing.

588
00:45:08,061 --> 00:45:09,099
Role.

589
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:14,559
I am an actress.

590
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,539
So, I am playing the role
of Queen In Hyun.

591
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:19,619
You don't know again. Goodness sakes.

592
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:38,038
No one is here right now,
so come on out.

593
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:41,436
If someone comes in here again,
I won't be able to handle it.

594
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:44,335
I won't be going out that way,
so do not worry.

595
00:45:44,335 --> 00:45:45,735
What is he saying?

596
00:45:45,735 --> 00:45:49,215
There is no way out there.
Is he really dumb?

597
00:45:49,215 --> 00:45:51,061
Come on out.

598
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:52,710
Time, road, communication, call.

599
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,974
You're dressed, right?

600
00:45:53,974 --> 00:45:55,619
I'm coming in.

601
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,811
Space, need, rescue... man.

602
00:46:29,025 --> 00:46:31,873
<i>He showed up in the place he
disappeared before.</i>

603
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,036
<i>Is he going to pop up somewhere?</i>

604
00:46:34,036 --> 00:46:36,907
<i>What does one do when he wants to
share their joy?</i>

605
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:39,657
<i>You're a player over there too,
aren't you?</i>

606
00:46:40,858 --> 00:46:42,248
<i>Who are you?</i>

607
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:45,072
<i>Why are you hiding here?</i>

608
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:46,456
<i>I asked you who you are!</i>

609
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,728
<i>Why do you keep appearing in front of me?</i>

610
00:46:50,728 --> 00:46:54,771
<i>You're saying... this is how people say
goodbye in this place?</i>
