1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,870
What are you saying?

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,400
He isn't stalking. We came together.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,470
It was settled using my card.
You can confirm it if you want to know.

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,140
We sat apart so as not to be spotted.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,740
Do you understand?

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,350
So, call the police at once and tell them that it was a misunderstanding.

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,020
If you get the police involved, the two of us will be the victims.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,090
I will not let you go for
invading people's private matters.

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,570
-What is this big reversal?
-Hilarious.

10
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,180
This is the truth, Han dong Min ha become a complete joke!

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,060
Ah, it's completely different from a minute ago.

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,520
What's this?
Even beating up people's lovers?

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,550
Aigoo, fool.

14
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,810
Then again, you should
know your limitations.

15
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,010
Thinking that you're able
to grasp the situation

16
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,480
then ending up being laughed at.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Didn't I warn you?

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,550
You help fight for her
role and help publicized her.

19
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,160
You go all out.
But you don't know what's going on behind your back.

20
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,540
Why don't you just stop?

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,960
You fell into a hole. Well, you dug it yourself.

22
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:59,700
How sweet... She spends her one day off
on a romantic getaway.

23
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,670
Hey...

24
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,240
You know, the guy's quite handsome.

25
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,780
What does he do?

26
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,790
Do you want some water?
It's hot here, right?

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,990
OK, forget it.

28
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,100
Ah, it's seriously funny.

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,870
I'm sorry but this is just too funny, right?

30
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,690
Superstar Han Dong Min,
mixed up in an absurdity like this?

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,350
When we land, you might become
the nation's top celebrity.

32
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,600
How long is this going to last?

33
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,770
Until we get off.

34
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,570
Don't look, you'll get your picture taken.

35
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,110
Looks like your friend was right.

36
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,510
About what?

37
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,780
About you being impulsive.
She warned me about it before.

38
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,980
You're not very grateful, are you?

39
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,850
You almost got arrested.
I helped you, but you still...

40
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,050
Thank you!

41
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,190
I'm very grateful, but the way
you helped me was quite daring.

42
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,790
That was all I could think of.
What should I have done instead?

43
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,600
Well, you could have thought
about consequences.

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,470
But I'm stupid. I did tell you
that I'm quite stupid, didn't I?

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,340
I could have just disappeared,
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

46
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,340
No need to get angry.

47
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,280
After saving you, you're being meddlesome, seriously.

48
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,280
What's meddlesome?

49
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,020
It sounds reproachful.

50
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,260
Looks like it wasn't a lie. Even Su Gyeong
had no idea either.

51
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,990
She said she just followed along
to meet an acquaintance.

52
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,130
You are not in the mood to
go back to the company, right?

53
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,930
- Hey, let's go home.
- Yes.

54
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,470
But you should at least
have some dignity, seriously.

55
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,410
Didn't I tell you earlier on
not to make an appearance!

56
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,850
- Stop for a minute.
- What?

57
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,280
They haven't left yet.

58
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,880
Go and talk with her.

59
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,690
Let's just go, I'm going to
meet Su Gyeong later on.

60
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,560
You want to just go
with me shamed like this?

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,420
You're really inconsiderate.

62
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,360
We must reconcile, only then will we
be able to put all the pieces together.

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,770
Ah, is... Is that so?

64
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,240
Get going and grab hold of that punk. Hurry!

65
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,910
It would be better to ride a taxi.

66
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,910
Will it be all right? Things won't
get blown out of proportion, right?

67
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,780
After the trouble made by Han Dong Min,
being seen together may not be wise.

68
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,780
Miss Hui Jin!

69
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,720
Come on!

70
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,590
Miss Hui Jin, hold on a
minute! Let's have a talk!

71
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,250
Quick, get in!

72
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,450
It's Han Dong Min.

73
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,790
Where is it? Where?

74
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,520
<i>Where? Really?</i>

75
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,390
It's really Han Dong Min.

76
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,600
<i>It really is.</i>

77
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,730
Being chased is probably your fate.

78
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,930
Chased by royal guards over there,
and by lunatics over here.

79
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,070
Is it all right to just leave like this?

80
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,540
What should I do?

81
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,610
I will do as I see fit.

82
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,210
Anyways, it is my life.
You take care of yourself.

83
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,080
Ai, really...

84
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,950
Wait, wait, wait.

85
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,040
Take care, don't die again.

86
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,820
Ajussi, please get going.

87
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,300
That... No, don't... really.

88
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,370
Ah, I said let's have a talk!

89
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,780
Omo, I didn't hear you!
He has already left.

90
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,310
Then can't you ask
him to turn around?

91
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,580
<i>It's Han Dong Min. Wow...</i>

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,920
Make him come back,
I didn't get to say goodbye.

93
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,660
He probably doesn't want to meet
the person who beat him.

94
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,590
Good point.

95
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,430
<i>Hurry and take it. Quick.</i>

96
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,550
What does this punk do, that he slips
off right away when we meet him?

97
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,820
Does he not have confidence or what?

98
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,890
But come to think of it...
Isn't something funny here?

99
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,630
If he's her lover, why did he
dress up like that in the hospital?

100
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,030
If saying he's not a psycho stalker...

101
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,630
Could he be an actor? An extra,
or something like that?

102
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,900
That's it, that's right!

103
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,370
Our team's extra.

104
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,970
Afraid of being exposed, he escaped.

105
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,250
So now, does this mean that I
have been defeated by an extra?

106
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,390
Choe Hui Jin...

107
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,390
Are you deliberately trying to
embarrass me?

108
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,660
You must be shocked, right?
I was shocked as well.

109
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,730
I couldn't even imagine that we
would end up on the same plane.

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,270
The "stalker" incident at the hospital
was unfortunate, really.

111
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,540
I didn't expect you to suddenly visit.

112
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,410
With the nurses there,
I couldn't say that he was my lover.

113
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,750
In fact, it was me who let
him secretly slip away.

114
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,680
Hey, you--

115
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,150
But how is it possible that
we met on the plane?

116
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,350
It's really interesting. Ha.ha.ha.

117
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,220
are you using me,now?

118
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,820
I even helped you get the role...

119
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,560
I was afraid you would think
that way, which is why I called.

120
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,500
I clearly told you since the
beginning not to treat me that way.

121
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,900
I've been emphasizing that all the time. But you
don't seem to get my meaning, do you?

122
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,300
You've changed a lot.

123
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,240
How are you going to handle this relationship?
Shamelessly announcing it in public.

124
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,570
It's because I've learnt it from somebody.

125
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,040
Being with someone arrogant,
I soon became arrogant as well.

126
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,510
See you at the set!

127
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,110
Hey, what does this punk do?

128
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,920
My boyfriend?

129
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,520
He's a scholar, a learned person.

130
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,390
Someone who's a very different type
compared to Mr. Han Dong Min. Well then...

131
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:03,060
Hey, that... Hello? Hello? Hello?

132
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,270
Hahahaha.

133
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:15,210
Wow, so happy. Showing off
like that, how refreshing.

134
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,140
Is this the time for you
to be happy right now?

135
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,610
A new actress detonating a scandal bomb.

136
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,090
It's all right. Seeing Han Dong Min being played,
it feels like 3 years of grievance has all gone away.

137
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,690
In order to see Han Dong Min
confused, you're exploding, right?

138
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,760
Seriously, who do you think you are?

139
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,630
Not all the people on the plane
would go on the internet, right?

140
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,040
Just some rumors
will be fine right?

141
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,900
Aigoo. Wait and see,

142
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,770
see what's going to happen.

143
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,980
By tomorrow morning, probably even
the crew won't be able to enter.

144
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
Because of the disturbance
caused by reporters...

145
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,530
Disturbance?

146
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,380
If you talk about disturbance then?
Aigoo, we'll just think about that then.

147
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,790
Tomorrow, a new sun will rise.

148
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,780
You've got to be kidding.

149
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,130
But, what happened to Gim Bung Do?

150
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,330
Because of him that matters turned
out this way. He just withdraws?

151
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,530
It's really funny, seriously.

152
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,870
That time he called, it wasn't just to
borrow an identity card, was it?

153
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,940
He's a very busy person.

154
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,810
How busy could he be? Saving him...

155
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,480
It's not like it's something
that involves life or death.

156
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,010
It does involve life or death.

157
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,210
<i>Aigoo.
(Aigoo - oh my god)</i>

158
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,280
How can a student have matters
that involve life or death?

159
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,620
Take a look at this.

160
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,690
This is already uploaded on
the internet, what should we do?

161
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,160
Already?

162
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,700
The photos came out well.

163
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,170
Hey, hey, hey!

164
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,170
Starting today, I'm not going
to be your manager anymore!

165
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,970
Go look for another manager!

166
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,910
Look at her, she can't be saved.

167
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,120
How can I transfer this to my phone?

168
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,180
<i>Aigoo.
(Aigoo - oh my god)</i>

169
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,190
Since we don't have a
photo of us together.

170
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,720
She must've gone completely crazy.

171
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,670
Who's there?

172
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,270
Lord of Doctrines?

173
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,080
Have you been well?

174
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,010
Weren't you  banished, sir?

175
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,080
I heard that you went to Jeju.

176
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,550
I'm here to see Her Majesty, open the door.

177
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,290
Why are you here?

178
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,290
Why are you here?
-=Queen In Hyeon=-

179
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:46,960
Did you escape?
-=Queen In Hyeon=-

180
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,360
Did you escape?

181
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
There's not much time,
I can't explain carefully.

182
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,700
Something is going to
happen before daylight.

183
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,180
What is it?

184
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,510
What has failed previously, will succeed this time.

185
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,720
<i>How did you know to
come at this late hour?</i>

186
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,260
<i>Tonight's incident is directly
related to Lord Min Am.</i>

187
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,860
<i>This is the secret order to assassinate
Your Majesty, handwritten by Min Am.</i>

188
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,060
<i>There's no time to waste</i>

189
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,330
<i>before they make a move.
I must enter the palace </i>

190
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,530
<i>and relay this to His Majesty.</i>

191
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,470
They will make a move today.

192
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,340
They still want to...

193
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,480
Please don't be alarmed no
matter what happens outside.

194
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,410
Also, my coming here is a secret.

195
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,420
I'm alone here, who can I tell?

196
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Even if I say something
no one would believe me.

197
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,630
I hope that you will
not tell His Majesty either.

198
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,430
What can I tell His Majesty
when I can hardly meet him?

199
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:05,570
You might be able
to see His Majesty tonight.

200
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,370
What does that mean?

201
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,710
Tonight, I want every guard to come
out and vacate all the doors.

202
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,050
Pardon?

203
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,510
What are you saying?

204
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,180
Didn't you say that something is going to
happen here and we are to guard this place?

205
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,050
If you want to stay
alive then listen to me.

206
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,060
But first, we must hide in the surroundings
in order to protect Her Majesty.

207
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,260
Tonight, someone will definitely come here.

208
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,270
Why do you want to go to the
North Palace at this hour?

209
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,480
Ah, there is someone I need to meet.

210
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,680
At the palace?

211
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,280
During this hour?

212
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,690
By any chance, is that a sword?

213
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,090
It's a wooden sword for practice.

214
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,820
Ah, is that so?

215
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,830
I thought it was...

216
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,860
Your Majesty,

217
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,400
it is already past midnight.

218
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,670
Please go to sleep.

219
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,670
No matter how much
I read it never finishes.

220
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,740
how can there be so much resentment?

221
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,140
There's no empathy and just
a mouth full of disputes.

222
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,150
Your Majesty, you must
take care of your body.

223
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Who is it?

224
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,040
Where is it?

225
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,780
Grab him!

226
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,650
What's going on?

227
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Are you all right Your Majesty?

228
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,720
What is that?

229
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
It looks like a letter.

230
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,730
Take it down immediately.

231
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,400
<i>Your servant who does not wish to be named
is writing to you to inform you, Your Majesty.</i>

232
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,940
<i>There will be a gathering at
Right Prime Minister's house tonight.</i>

233
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,360
<i>Present there will be Prime Minister Gwon Dae Un,
Left Prime Minister Mun Nae Seon
and Right Prime Minister Min Am.</i>

234
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,030
<i>Your servant has heard them conspiring for
an assassination. Thus I write this letter.</i>

235
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,760
What?

236
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,570
They want to harm the former queen?

237
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,010
Your Excellency,

238
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:41,330
this lady's Gayageum playing is
much better than Yun Wol isn't it?

239
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,930
I feel good after listening.

240
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,470
Is there still no news
about that presumptous girl?

241
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,140
It was because you were too lenient.

242
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,010
Unknowingly you got betrayed
because of your kindness.

243
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,620
Could've just killed her at
that time to pay the price.

244
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,500
Where are you going, My Lord?
I am about to sing a song.

245
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,630
Because of drinking alcohol I forgotten
that I have orders to be given out.

246
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,640
Please wait a moment.

247
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,210
Who touched it? I didn't even order...

248
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,450
All this while I've left you unharmed.

249
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,520
Who, who... Who are you?

250
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,260
How did you get here?

251
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,990
How dare...

252
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,730
Please sit down.

253
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,530
I've prepared the writing ink.

254
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,330
You should be in Jeju, you punk.

255
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't tell me...

256
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,410
you escaped?

257
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,140
I have no other option and
things just turn out that way.

258
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,410
Looks like you have
really lost your mind.

259
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,010
Even if you escaped what's the
use of saving your own life...

260
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,150
Are you saying that you ran
all the way here from Jeju?

261
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,620
That's right.

262
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,890
Why? Is it hard to believe?

263
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,890
I only took half a month
just to return here from Jeju.

264
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,160
That is impossible.

265
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
When was the time you escaped?

266
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,230
Didn't I say I came all the way from Jeju?

267
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,170
Fellows mixing poision into
my food awaiting to...

268
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,370
carry out the order to kill.

269
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,040
Please sit down.

270
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,320
Starting now, do not leave
out a single word I say.

271
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,920
This will be an order under
Right Prime Minister Min Am's name.

272
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,660
More than a month ago, due to
Gim Bung Do's meddling, our plan failed.
Tonight, it will finally be carried out.

273
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,800
Your instructions when you get
to the former queen's residence:
Eliminate the former queen.

274
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,540
Why are you startled?

275
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:46,280
It is of the same content as the
letter that I had snatched from you.

276
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,480
Is it not to remove the head
and to dethrone the queen?

277
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,350
Is it not easy?

278
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,420
Just following that and re-writing
it over again will do.

279
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,430
<i>Your servant who does not wish to be named
is writing to you to inform you, Your Majesty.</i>

280
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:11,100
<i>Because I am unable to watch helplessly
the safety of the royal family at jeopardy.</i>

281
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,300
<i>I only hope to preserve
the safety of the queen.</i>

282
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,370
<i>There's not much time left,
action must be taken at once.</i>

283
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,110
Your Majesty,

284
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,510
The criminal still hasn't been captured.

285
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,720
He disappeared just like the wind.

286
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,250
That fellow wrote what kind of letter...

287
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:37,660
<i>On another note, Your Majesty's official,
Hong Nae Gwan is one of Jang Hui Jae's people.</i>

288
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,870
<i>He will be in fear if he knows
the criminal could not be captured.</i>

289
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,730
Your Majesty?

290
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,270
Call the Military Commander
to come and see me.

291
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,540
Now, at once!

292
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,890
Where exactly is the minister at?

293
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,490
Quick, go look for him.

294
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,760
Yes, My Lord.

295
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,830
Your Excellency!

296
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,630
The Lords are looking for you.

297
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,500
Come in.

298
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,980
Why are you here?

299
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,980
Your Excellency?

300
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,260
What is this?

301
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,600
Give this to Ja Su.

302
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,800
Yes.

303
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,410
At once, he should be
at the banquet pavillion.

304
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,150
Yes.

305
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,700
His Excellency personally gave it?

306
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,630
Yes.

307
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,430
He said to deliver it at once.

308
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,370
There was no signs yesterday.

309
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,370
I got it.

310
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,840
Yes.

311
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,940
Call the kids here.

312
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,850
There's things to be done.

313
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,590
Now, write another piece
with the same content.

314
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,460
This is for Jang Hui Jae to read.

315
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,460
This is for Jang Hui Jae to read.
-=Jang Hui Jae, Lady Jang's younger brother=-

316
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:48,790
-=Jang Hui Jae, Lady Jang's younger brother=-

317
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,860
Are you planning to even
frame the queen, how dare you?

318
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,930
It should be you who should be
blamed for framing the queen.

319
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,940
I'm talking about 5 years ago.

320
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,610
<i>The queen, my father...</i>

321
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,880
<i>What is this? My Lady...</i>

322
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,950
My mother...

323
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,160
Father-in-law.

324
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,110
Wife.

325
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,690
The one who killed them isn't it you?

326
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,170
Don't you feel wronged at all?

327
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,500
Even if it doesn't happen today, I will
still report the event of your rebellion.

328
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,970
-=The event of rebellion : Min Am's stubborn instigation
to depose the queen from reinstatement and plotting
schemes with the western faction which caused
the event of the Gabsul Hwanguk.=-

329
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,840
-=The event of rebellion : Min Am's stubborn instigation
to depose the queen from reinstatement and plotting
schemes with the western faction which caused
the event of the Gabsul Hwanguk.=-

330
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,370
How did you know such--

331
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,710
I must have guessed correctly
what is inside your head.

332
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,310
And there's another thing
that I can predict is...

333
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,710
that plan will definitely fail.

334
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,380
So there's no need to bewilder me.

335
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,990
I've only been able to surpass
you earlier by a few days only.

336
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,790
I've told you before,
I'm holding the better card.

337
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,080
Go on, write.

338
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,780
There's no one.

339
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,980
Not even one person?

340
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,680
Even the gateskeeper is not
around, somehow it feels strange.

341
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,720
Could it be a trap?

342
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,940
It is a trap! Retreat!

343
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,140
Which one is the head?

344
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,810
Two people have escaped,
seems like it's one of them.

345
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,960
Has everyone been suppressed?

346
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,160
Yes.

347
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,110
What exactly has happened?

348
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,110
What is the Palace Guard doing here?

349
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,120
Your... Your Majesty.

350
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Are you unharmed?

351
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Your Majesty, how could you...

352
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:30,140
Forgive me. All this while,
how difficult it must have been for you.

353
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,480
I had no idea you would encounter
something like this.

354
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,430
The king came here unexpectedly.

355
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,830
We fell into a trap.

356
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,900
In case there are any mistakes, I will kill everybody involved.
Do you understand?

357
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,710
Yes. But without evidence, we
won't be found out.

358
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,980
Wasn't the order destroyed, too?

359
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,320
All that is left is to keep this safe
and send it to Jang Hui Jae.

360
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,320
It will serve
as definite evidence.

361
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,000
Now, this is all that
needs to be done.

362
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,270
You can just wait comfortably
for your fate to come.

363
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,460
Open the door!

364
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,750
What's wrong?

365
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,990
Quickly open the door!
It's a royal order!

366
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,560
Royal order? Yes...

367
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,840
What are you doing?

368
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,180
Search thoroughly. Not even one should
be left out, arrest all at once!

369
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,380
-Yes!
-Yes!

370
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,650
What are you doing?

371
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Let go of me!

372
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,130
Right Prime Minister, Min Am.
Please come out to receive the royal order.

373
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,200
Please come out now.

374
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,480
What are you doing?

375
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,880
Come out immediately to receive the royal order!

376
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:06,030
The place of your
exile will be at Jeju.

377
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,500
The place where I,

378
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,900
had poison in my food.

379
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,300
Moreover, where I did not know not when
a sword would come flying at me.

380
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,440
But if you come, I would welcome you.

381
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,780
Do you think you are able to just
slip away from here cleanly?

382
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,180
You, who have escaped exile, will not be
able to avoid getting beheaded.

383
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,920
What are you saying? I have
not left my banishment even once.

384
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,250
What?

385
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,190
I will go and wait for you first.

386
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,010
Arrest him.

387
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,080
Yes, yes.

388
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,080
Right Prime Minister Min Am, you are arrested
for plotting the assasination of the queen.

389
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,820
This is a royal order.

390
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:05,560
Other than me, there is
another criminal here. Catch him.

391
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,890
What did you say?

392
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:12,630
The criminal who escaped his banishment,
Gim Bung Do is behind the screens.

393
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,110
There is no one.

394
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,910
That... that... that's impossible.

395
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,180
He was with me all along.

396
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,780
What are you talking about?

397
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,250
That person should now be in Jeju.

398
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,170
Take him away!

399
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

400
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:47,860
Regarding the masterminds behind these
schemes, there is now accurate evidence.

401
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,130
I must certainly punish all of them severely.

402
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,070
Guilty of leading the conspiracy,
Prime Minister, Gwon Dae Un,

403
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,070
Left Prime Minister, Mun Nae Seon,
Right Prime Minister Min Am,

404
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,670
will all be banished to Jeju.

405
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:03,610
Upon this event, Lady's Jang's younger brother, Jang Hui Jae
and Official Hong Nae Gwan are to be interrogated.

406
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,620
Also the queen who has
suffered threats of disposal,

407
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,350
that cannot be ignored,

408
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,690
is to be immediately reinstated in the
palace and to be strictly guarded.

409
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,230
Also, the incident at the office
of Special Advisers earlier on,

410
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,230
Officer Gim Bung Do is to
receive Sin Gu and Bok Gwan.

411
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,900
Officer Gim Bung Do is to
receive Sin Gu and Bok Gwan.
-=Sin Gu - To be relieved and regain innocence.
Bok Gwan - To be reinstated to official position.=-

412
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,330
Yun Wol!

413
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,630
Why did you come out here?

414
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,700
Didn't you know I came especially to see you?

415
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,170
Sir?

416
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,840
Have you been well?

417
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,190
I heard it was the Right Prime Minister who was
behind the crimes.

418
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,150
Is it true, sir?

419
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,840
Seems like it is.

420
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:59,820
It's hard to believe, sir. How could he
hide his crimes so well?

421
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,350
But... Why did you come here, sir...

422
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,070
Because of the good fortune your talisman gave me.

423
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,210
Sir?

424
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,080
Don't ask more. There's no way
I can explain it in detail.

425
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,210
I wanted to tell you the
news so I rushed here.

426
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,480
But you already knew all about it. A pity.

427
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,220
No, sir, it's not like that.

428
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,560
Even Her Majesty the queen's blessing
is not able to presever a life like yours.

429
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,760
When I you free of worry, sir,

430
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,120
it makes me feel happy to be living.

431
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,500
Going through all these
all this time, thank you.

432
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,510
My Lord is able to
withstand it, then so will I.

433
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,710
Without you, I could have given up.

434
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,050
The royal order means
I will be returning to Hanyang.

435
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,590
You should also pack your
things and return home.

436
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,860
Does that mean you are going to Jeju, sir?

437
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
Before that, there's a place I need to go to.

438
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,870
A place to go, sir? Isn't time pressing?

439
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:13,270
It wasn't easy returning. What would you
do if you get caught?

440
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,070
There's another benefactor
that I didn't get to thank.

441
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,340
A benefactor, sir?

442
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:36,230
This seems real, like it isn't acting.

443
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,360
He's probably feeling ashamed
and didn't get enough sleep.

444
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,500
The dark circles are all coming out.

445
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,140
I saw the video from the plane on YouTube.

446
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,500
It's really disappointing.

447
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,970
The moment Han Dong Min
makes a fool out of himself,

448
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,520
when Choe Hui Jin admits she was with
her boyfriend...

449
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,170
A complete reversal.

450
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,370
Delete this.

451
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,240
You saw it too right?

452
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,380
Watch it, it's totally a scoop.

453
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,290
Han Dong Min is a complete disappointment.

454
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,670
Omo, it's Miss Hui Jin.

455
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,320
Hello! Everyone must be very busy.
Here's some snacks.

456
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,060
Omo, we'll eat it well.

457
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,530
Wait in the lobby.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

458
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,060
Yes. Good work!

459
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,270
But... he's very good looking.

460
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,190
Eh?

461
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,880
Your boyfriend. He's my type.

462
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,780
-=Queen In Hyeon, Choe Hui Jin's notorious two-timing=-

463
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,670
-=Two-timing. Violence.=-

464
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,510
-=Scandal rumours increase=-

465
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,850
Don't you have filming today?

466
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,520
There's a scene at night, a palace scene.

467
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,130
I'm sorry.

468
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,800
Things have got this noisy.

469
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,070
All kinds of scandal is spreading around.

470
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,330
And they're saying that the 3 people are
in a love triangle.

471
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:28,200
Also about your boyfriend getting
hit and being sent to the hospital.

472
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,810
And that you're preparing to sue.

473
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,740
It's absolutely not like that.

474
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,880
He's not injured at all. And what's that about suing...

475
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,350
Suk Jong did get violent.

476
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,220
Queen In Hyeon is two-timing...

477
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,290
What do we do if the image is like this?

478
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,090
With two people like this,

479
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,620
our drama is in danger.

480
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm sorry.

481
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,690
I do feel Dong Min went overboard,

482
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,970
but the two of you should come to
an understanding and settle this.

483
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,100
We're all in the same boat, aren't we?

484
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,040
How about settling it tomorrow?

485
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,820
So, according to Dong Min oppa,

486
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,070
you met at the airport the day before.

487
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:15,570
And, taking a photo of the two guys shaking hands
as a sign of reconcilation would have settled it?

488
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,390
Your friend should have stayed,
why did you send him away?

489
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,330
I told you he had urgent matters.

490
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,330
Well, meeting today will have to  do.

491
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,460
Let's have lunch together. Give him a call.

492
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,300
I already said he's busy.

493
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,800
The director did say the first episode
had very high ratings

494
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,140
If the ratings fall now, it will be your fault.

495
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:41,340
What you say is all right, but my friend
has circumstances, you know.

496
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,410
I'm just saying to eat together.
What circumstances exactly?

497
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,920
How busy is he?

498
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,820
Even Presidents eat. Who is this guy?

499
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,930
-Give me.
-What?

500
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,090
What's the number of Gim Bung Do's cell phone?

501
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,360
If you're embarrassed, I will do it.

502
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,270
Give it to me now.

503
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,960
He doesn't have a cell phone.

504
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,850
He doesn't have a cell phone?

505
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,170
Then, home phone number?

506
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,100
There's none.

507
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,510
Then, e-mail?

508
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,580
He doesn't have an e-mail either.

509
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,650
No cell phone and no e-mail.

510
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,720
Then how did you keep in contact until now?

511
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,920
By public phone.

512
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,730
I'm going crazy here.

513
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,860
I'll just make a lunch reservation.

514
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,270
You contact him and bring him over.

515
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,000
I told you I can't.

516
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,210
There's no way to contact him.

517
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,610
Are you really dating him or not?

518
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,940
Is this a one-sided love?

519
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,000
Miss Hui Jin, the director wants to
confirm with you about moving lines.

520
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,840
Yes. I'll be right there.

521
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,590
Yes.

522
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,960
Try to think of another solution.

523
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,590
If necessary, I will just do an interview.

524
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,850
This brat.

525
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,010
Does not having a cell phone make any sense?

526
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,420
It's not like he's the President's son.
Why can't he be reached?

527
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,820
I clearly saw his call.

528
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,160
Hello?

529
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,240
Let's go out and have lunch.

530
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,980
Forget it, we'll eat at home.

531
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,180
Come out quickly!

532
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,250
I already said forget it.

533
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,920
At this point in time, is it wise to
go out and attract attention?

534
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,450
We just got a call, you punk.
Hui Jin wants to see you.

535
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,190
Where did she go to?

536
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,040
Miss Hui Jin.

537
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,040
Yes.

538
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,880
Su Gyeong asked me to pass this on to you.

539
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,770
What?

540
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,010
Why didn't she contact me?

541
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,810
She said that your cell phone was with her.

542
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,620
What? Why did she...

543
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,990
She said you should go to the  CheongDam-dong
restaurant at 1pm. By taxi.

544
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,210
What? CheongDam-dong?

545
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,550
I have to go in for filming now.

546
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,620
Looks like the director has changed
the schedule. The lunch break is 2 hours.

547
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,420
What? Why would the director?

548
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,490
Didn't you make a lunch appointment
with Mr. Dong Min? That is what I heard.

549
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,960
What?

550
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,760
This rotten girl just simply...

551
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,980
Madam, you are with...?

552
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,530
Yes, that--

553
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,710
It must be Mr. Han Dong Min, right?

554
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,080
Yes.

555
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,680
This way, please.

556
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,380
Where's Su Gyeong?

557
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,540
What are the two of them doing there?

558
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,080
They're preparing to snap a photo.

559
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,080
Han Dong Min reconciling with Choe Hui Jin's boyfriend.

560
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,880
Nothing happened between them.

561
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,420
Anyway to improve my image,
you have to cooperate.

562
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,420
You should be thanking me, really.

563
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,030
This is called healing someone after making them sick.

564
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,300
I never imagined it would be this troublesome.

565
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,370
You underestimated my popularity.

566
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,380
What are we supposed to do?

567
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,440
She asked me to do this...

568
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,470
Once that punk comes,

569
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,780
we will greet each other
like brothers, respectfully.

570
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:23,520
After that I will give my
blessing to the two of you.

571
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,960
That punk will show that he
is fine from head to toe.

572
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,730
But, you know, he can't come.

573
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:41,670
I clearly said that there is
just no way he will come,

574
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,540
but it seems Su Gyeong didn't hear it.

575
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,410
I'm sorry.

576
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:48,480
What are you saying?

577
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,640
Have you still not finished taking your revenge on me?

578
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,750
It's not that, he really can't come.

579
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,630
He wants to clear up misunderstandings, too,

580
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,890
but his situation just does not
allow coming here.

581
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,630
Try to understand.

582
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:16,510
What, what?

583
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,640
What is it about that punk
that he can't make it?

584
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,510
He isn't coming.

585
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,780
No, no, no. He's coming.

586
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,520
No, he's coming.

587
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Hui Jin said he's not coming, what's going on?

588
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,720
Give it to me.

589
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,990
Oppa, I've already informed
him of the time and place.

590
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,860
He will come.
Just wait a little while.

591
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,860
Really? All right, then.

592
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,600
He's coming. Su Gyeong has informed
him about the time and place.

593
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,330
What do you mean?

594
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,540
Here he is.

595
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,010
Here he is.

596
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,010
Didn't you say he is your boyfriend?

597
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,550
You guys don't even communicate?

598
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,750
I'm sorry I'm late.

599
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:14,220
It's all right. Thank you for coming.

600
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,190
First of all, let's place our
order before talking.

601
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,270
Just playing along will do?

602
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,470
What is this, really?

603
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,480
I was debating on how to return your favor.

604
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,410
I heard that I could help.
So I came.

605
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,820
Your friend told me to
play the role of a good lover.

606
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,090
I do not really know what to do,

607
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,960
but I will still try my best.

608
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,440
Where did you learn this?

609
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,640
This pure innocence comes out a
hundred times in comic scenes.

610
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,580
Bang, and you appear out of nowhere!

611
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,450
It's totally corny.

612
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,850
What does "corny" mean?

613
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,920
Are you reproaching me again?

614
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,790
It's a compliment.

615
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,800
If you want to succeed in
the role of my lover,

616
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,800
then just continue with the corny stuff.

617
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I totally like anything corny.

618
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,520
-=Next Episode Preview=-

619
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,110
Why this huge sum of money?
You don't even put it in a wallet?

620
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,360
Go outside?

621
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,400
What's this?

622
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,550
This is my feeling of spending
a whole day with Gim Bung Do.

623
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,650
How about poisoning Queen In Hyeon?

624
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,300
I think it would be cool.

625
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,440
If I die, I must certainly
have that fellow die, too.

626
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,150
What's with the talisman?

627
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,230
What should I do that would
be "corny" to Choe Hui Jin?
