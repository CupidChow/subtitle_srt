1
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,370
You're up so early?

2
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,090
Are you not tired after staying up all night?

3
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,880
I couldn't sleep.
I'm going shopping, we have nothing to eat.

4
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,520
Hey, we're not done talking yet.

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,610
About what?

6
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,850
Gim Bung Do... Just who is that guy?

7
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,760
Flying for the first time, doesn't have any ID,
doesn't know how to drive...

8
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,250
Has no cell phone...

9
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,460
Has no idea of public transport fares.

10
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,470
But in his pocket, he carries checks
worth tens of millions!

11
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,740
Isn't it very strange?

12
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,580
Yes, it's strange.

13
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,280
What does he do really?

14
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,080
Tell me the truth, stop beating around the bush.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,950
Didn't I tell you before?

16
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,680
When?

17
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,890
Don't you remember?

18
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,490
He is a person from 300 years ago.

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,610
It's true.

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,630
It's true. But you still won't believe.

21
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,850
<i>Let's meet in a month.</i>

22
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,050
<i>But do you have any reason
to come here anymore?</i>

23
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,390
<i>My lover is here. Isn't that a reason?</i>

24
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:30,950
Oh?

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,010
What is this?

26
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,000
Omo, you're awake?

27
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,540
You can't get up so hastily!

28
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,100
Doesn't your head hurt?

29
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,420
I was in a car accident, right?

30
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,730
I hit a street lamp?

31
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,730
Yes. It could have been a lot worse.

32
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,070
Fortunately, you just had a slight concussion and a few scratches.

33
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,670
You need to stay in the hospital for observation
and a few days' rest.

34
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,670
I have to rest ?

35
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,210
But I have filming tomorrow!

36
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,080
You won't be able to
participate right away.

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,880
Oh, that can't be.

38
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,450
Is there anyone around?
My manager...

39
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,490
Your manager is handling your admittance right now.

40
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,360
The doctor will be here to see you immediately.
Just lie down and wait for a moment.

41
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,030
Should have been more attentive...

42
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,550
Hello?

43
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,780
- Where are you?
- You're awake? Are you okay?

44
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,400
I'm fine.

45
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,450
How's the car?

46
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,460
Is the car the problem right now?

47
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,930
Where is it?

48
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,930
It was taken to be repaired, of course

49
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,460
It'll take a week or so,
it wasn't anything too serious.

50
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,330
That's a relief!

51
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,740
Because I feel sorry...

52
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,200
What are you sorry for?

53
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,610
I feel sorry towards the
person who bought the car.

54
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,070
I already got into an
accident on the first day.

55
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,540
The person who bought it?

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,940
But what happened to me?

57
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,350
You dozed off, didn't you?

58
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,280
Right?

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,870
I didn't doze off. I suddenly felt
dizzy and I couldn't see a thing!

60
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,750
What?

61
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,690
All I saw was like waves.
I couldn't make anything out.

62
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,690
I thought I was going to die.

63
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,360
Aigoo, doze or no doze,

64
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,100
you should have been more careful.

65
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,770
But this is not all bad.

66
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,500
Since you're here, let's take this
opportunity to do a full checkup,

67
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,570
They can free up some time in your schedule.

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,310
But it's my fault again.
I wasn't careful and got into an accident.

69
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,980
Wouldn't it be too embarrassing
to say that I need to rest?

70
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,310
What do you mean, 'again'?

71
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,920
This is my second time in the hospital.
What will people think about me?

72
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,320
Second time?

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,920
When was the last time you were in the hospital?

74
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,640
What?

75
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,790
Just stay here and rest up.

76
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,590
We're always staying up late shooting and pulling
all nighters just to accommodate Yun Na Jeong.

77
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,130
I will tell the director properly.

78
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,330
What are you saying?

79
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,800
I've already caused too much trouble; the press
conference and the airplane scandal!

80
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,740
So much trouble.
If I stay here again I might just get fired.

81
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,410
What?

82
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm playing Queen In Hyeon, you know.
They might decide to kill her off.

83
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,080
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
What do you mean, 'what are you talking about?'?

85
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,880
What?

86
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,890
How can I help you?

87
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,220
I have to do the paperwork now.
Let's talk again when I come up.

88
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,290
What's wrong with her?

89
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,830
She's even more clueless than I.

90
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,240
You're awake.

91
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,410
Are you okay?

92
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,040
How come you're here?

93
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,910
Hey, Miss Hui Jin is awake!

94
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,510
Han Dong Min is here, too?

95
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,840
What is it, now?

96
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,980
How did you know I was here?

97
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,580
Why did you come?

98
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,450
You fool...

99
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,790
Oh?

100
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,120
Why do you make people worry about you?

101
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,990
Hold on...

102
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,130
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

103
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,130
What are you doing?

104
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,870
Don't do that! People will misunderstand if they see us.

105
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,880
Why are you like this?

106
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,340
The rumors have been stopped,

107
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,890
all three of us have sat down for reconciliation.
Why are you being like this?

108
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,610
I already have a boyfriend.

109
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,950
Please stop doing things that
will make people misunderstand.

110
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,550
Can't you just be cool about it?

111
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,550
What happened to Han Dong Min the player?

112
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,300
You have a boyfriend?

113
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,700
Why are you asking? You even met him!

114
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,440
I met him?

115
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,310
Your boyfriend?

116
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,780
I did?

117
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,110
What's wrong with this guy?

118
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,180
Wh... What?

119
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,190
What are you two doing?

120
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,530
Nothing, really.

121
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,460
Here. I'll get you something  to drink
and be right back.

122
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,270
OK, I get it. Why don't you just relax and lie down, first?

123
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,750
Excuse me, the doctor
in charge of Miss Hui Jin?

124
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,820
He is coming,
he was called just now.

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,430
Please make him come quickly.
Miss Hui Jin seems a bit strange.

126
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,800
Sorry?

127
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,820
What was that about 'a slight concussion'?
Isn't her injury very serious?

128
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,090
Let go already. I'll lie down.

129
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,500
What are you doing? I said let go.

130
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,170
Okay.

131
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,630
Sorry.

132
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,900
I won't touch you, all right?

133
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,850
Ermm... Doesn't your head hurt?

134
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,910
It's fine.

135
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,450
I'm grateful that you came to see me.
But I feel burdened.

136
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,590
Other people will think it's strange, too.

137
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,130
Stopping the scandal wasn't easy. If things
become noisy again, what about our drama ?

138
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,730
Scandal?

139
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,200
What scandal?

140
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,200
The ridiculous love triangle.

141
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,000
I was part of the the problem, but...

142
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,940
I am worried about you.

143
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,780
You're a Hallyu star...
(Hallyu - the Korean wave)

144
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,500
Should you be hunting down people
who you think are stalking some actress?

145
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,620
So, who is this boyfriend that you are talking about?

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,950
Okay, okay, I know. But...

147
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,490
It's just that  I can't recall his name.

148
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,230
What's his name?

149
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,590
Gim Bung Do.

150
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,170
Gim Bung Do.

151
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,570
I see...

152
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,740
So, what does he do?

153
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,410
Didn't I say he's a graduate student?

154
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,140
Why do you ask? You should know.

155
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,950
Ah... Yes. That's right,

156
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,410
Graduate student.

157
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:21,290
So, your boyfriend is Gim Bung Do, a graduate student.
So that's how it is...

158
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,830
Miss Choe Hui Jin?

159
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,830
Yes.

160
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,830
Wait a second. Let's talk.

161
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,170
What's wrong?

162
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,770
Please have a good rest.

163
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,450
What is this? Really...

164
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,250
Something funny here.

165
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,450
Why isn't she coming?

166
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,980
My man?

167
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,530
What's this?

168
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,410
What is it?

169
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,140
Aren't you calling me?

170
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,630
-=My man.=-

171
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,090
I'll be right back.

172
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,100
Who's playing jokes here?

173
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,700
Han Dong Min, it's not like there was a real stalker,
how could you... With people's relationship...

174
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,140
-=Han Dong Min. Edit. Favorites. Send Message.=-

175
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,340
<i>Han Dong Min? What is this? Not cool at all.
-=Han Dong Min. Edit. Favorites. Send Message.=-</i>

176
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,880
<i>Han Dong Min? What is this? Not cool at all.</i>

177
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,080
<i>I'm changing it.</i>

178
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,970
<i>What are you changing it to?</i>

179
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,560
<i>So childish. I can't stand it.</i>

180
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,230
<i>Childishness has always been my charm.</i>

181
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,360
<i>Didn't you know?</i>

182
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,440
<i>- I'm going to change it.
- If you change it, it will be the end of you!</i>

183
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,570
<i>Here.</i>

184
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,450
<i>I love you baby.</i>

185
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,110
<i>What is this?</i>

186
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,850
What is this?

187
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
There is nothing out of the ordinary
in the examination results.

188
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,050
The symptoms might be momentary.

189
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,750
Let us see if they  persist.
Then she might need to see a psychiatrist.

190
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,270
This is really  worrisome.

191
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,260
What should we do?

192
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,990
Why did you call?

193
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,640
Hui Jin.

194
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
Hey.

195
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,110
Ah... Hold on a second.

196
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,440
Hold on...

197
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,120
What do you mean, hold on?

198
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,770
Don't touch me!

199
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,550
Please... Just let me be.

200
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,280
Where are you going?

201
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,220
Miss Choe Hui Jin?

202
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,500
What is going on here?

203
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,170
Hey. What's wrong?

204
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,180
Hui Jin. Are you okay?

205
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,580
<i>Miss Hui Jin.</i>

206
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,720
<i>Miss Choe Hui Jin, I'm the doctor in charge.</i>

207
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,880
<i>Please open the door.</i>

208
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm all right, please, just let me be.
I'm a little confused right now.

209
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,390
Don't mind me. Just five minutes.

210
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,000
Hey. What happened, you brat?

211
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,440
Just be quiet.

212
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,930
I'll get someone to unlock the door. Please wait a moment.

213
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,100
Impossible. How can I have
called this guy so often?

214
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,020
But...

215
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,960
<i>Aigoo, stop calling and get some sleep.</i>

216
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,030
<i>You see him every day on the set,
what is there still to talk about?</i>

217
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,830
There's so much, you have no idea.

218
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,040
Aigoo. I can't take this anymore.

219
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:06,040
Impossible. Impossible!

220
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,540
<i>Hello everyone, I'm Han Dong Min.</i>

221
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,950
<i>This is my girlfriend,</i>

222
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,690
<i>Choe Hui Jin.</i>

223
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,760
This can't be...

224
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:02,100
Impossible... How could this happen?

225
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,770
I don't have memories like this.
Why do I remember them?

226
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,540
What should I do?

227
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,400
<i>Hui Jin.</i>

228
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,920
<i>Hui Jin, what are you doing?</i>

229
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,790
Gim Bung Do.

230
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,060
<i>Choe Hui Jin.</i>

231
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,130
What should I do?

232
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,340
<i>Hui Jin.</i>

233
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,880
Choe Hui Jin.

234
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,520
<i>Is it Su Gyeong?</i>

235
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,680
Yes, it's me.

236
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,420
Hey. Open the door and talk to me.

237
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,490
Please ask everyone to leave.

238
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,760
I'll try and convince her.
Please just go out for a moment.

239
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,570
I'm going crazy here

240
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,840
Who is this Gim Bung Do?

241
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,170
Gim Bung Do?

242
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,640
She says that's her boyfriend.

243
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,710
Not me. Do you know him?

244
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,910
No. This is the first time I hear the name.

245
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,320
It makes no sense.

246
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,080
What? Gim Bung Do?

247
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,090
What kind of a name is that?

248
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm a cotton swab. Seriously...

249
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,490
Let's just go out first. Come on.

250
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,760
Hui Jin, they left.

251
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,370
Hey. Open the door.

252
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,980
What's wrong with you?

253
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,720
Everything is a mess.

254
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,790
What is this?

255
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,060
What happened to me?

256
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,330
What mess are you talking about?

257
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,060
Am I going out with Han Dong Min?

258
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,270
Is he really my boyfriend?

259
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,510
Why are you asking?

260
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,400
You really don't know?

261
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,280
There are even photos on the Intenet
of us on a date. Are they true?

262
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,150
You were on a date. Of course there are photos.

263
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,960
You don't know Gim Bung Do, either?

264
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,480
Gim Bung Do... Who is he?

265
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,570
We met him on Jeju. The three of us...

266
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,840
And at the library.

267
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,290
First, you didn't approve of him, but
then you warmed up to him, later.

268
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,950
And you were together all day yesterday.

269
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,510
Didn't you teach him how to drive?
And didn't you buy the car together?

270
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,520
Car?

271
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,210
We bought a car?

272
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,760
It was a present for me.

273
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,850
You mean your car?

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,730
Your car was bought with the money from your CF.
You bought it yourself, right?

275
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,140
You bought it.
We went together, you and I.

276
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,940
That's impossible.

277
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,150
Don't you remember?

278
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:42,890
I remember...

279
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,730
You remember?

280
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,830
Then there's no problem, is there?

281
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,760
Why did you ask if you knew?

282
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,030
Tenth, hand over.

283
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,910
Please accept this as repayment
for your kindness to me.

284
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,650
But what is this?

285
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,850
What?

286
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,260
Gim Bung Do gave me the car.

287
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,930
Gim Bung Do, who is he? Who?

288
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,330
You really do not know who Gim Bung Do is?

289
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,930
Does this makes any sense?

290
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,890
It's not just me who saw him,

291
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,170
you've seen him, too. Even Dong Min.

292
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,640
Everyone on that airplane saw him.

293
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,280
It was on the news that he was my boyfriend.

294
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,080
The whole country knew Gim Bung Do was my boyfriend.

295
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,690
But now, nobody remembers it.

296
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,240
There's nothing on the Internet, either.

297
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,680
There were so many photos of us.

298
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,500
But now there are none.

299
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,420
Are you sure it wasn't a dream?

300
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,200
Wh-what?

301
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,310
You must be confused by dreams
you had when you were sleeping.

302
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,040
That's impossible.

303
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,250
How could a dream feel so real?

304
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,720
I remember every single conversation.

305
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
It wasn't just one or two days. It was a month.

306
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,990
Everything we did together, I remember it all.

307
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,520
You slept all day today.

308
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,130
You may have had a very, very long dream.

309
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,600
Hey, I thought had amnesia or something.
You frightened me.

310
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,940
Do you know how many people you've scared?

311
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,680
Dong Min oppa is really despairing.

312
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,950
It was just a dream. A dream!

313
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,280
A dream?

314
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:05,446
-=Royal Investigation Bureau=-

315
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:22,800
<i>Your Excellency.</i>

316
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:28,166
What about the guards?

317
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:29,645
I bribed them to get in, sir.

318
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:30,945
Have you found out anything?

319
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:31,745
I have, sir.

320
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,484
It was as you said, Your Excellency.

321
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:38,681
People are saying that Gim Bung Do disappeared.

322
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:44,289
The day that you met him, sir, the guards
were looking for him all over Jeju.

323
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:50,426
He suddenly reappeared again.
But he clearly was gone for 3 days, sir.

324
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:51,755
Is that so?

325
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:54,962
But how could he travel from Hanyang
to Jeju in just a few days?

326
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:58,831
Even if he could magically
shrink distances, it is still impossible.

327
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,499
Did you find out anything about what he did?

328
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:06,037
They say he cannot remember anything
about the last two months.

329
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:07,896
He lost his memory?

330
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:10,034
Is he pretending?

331
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:14,172
I was suspicious, too,
but it seems to be the truth, sir.

332
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:16,171
On the day he was leaving...

333
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,308
<i>So if what you say is true.
I've managed to avoid hundreds of arrows?</i>

334
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:26,247
<i>I can disappear whenever
and wherever I wish.</i>

335
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:28,504
<i>I can travel to eight
different districts in a day?</i>

336
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,843
With this ability, I could conquer the world.

337
00:23:31,904 --> 00:23:34,411
But why am I a mere  Officer
at the Office of Special Advisers?

338
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:38,291
Sir, I am not the only person who saw it.

339
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,807
You can ask Yun Wol, sir.
Perhaps you'll believe her words.

340
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,417
Talisman!

341
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:47,045
Do you know what can
be done with the talisman, sir?

342
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:48,115
Talisman?

343
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,983
<i>Please carry this with you, sir.</i>

344
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:52,322
<i>What is it?</i>

345
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:56,719
<i>It's a talisman from the temple.
It's a miraculous talisman.</i>

346
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,859
<i>It will protect you, sir.</i>

347
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:01,697
Are you talking about the
talisman Yun Wol gave me?

348
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:02,616
Yes, sir.

349
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:05,624
You were carrying the talisman
every time you disappeared.

350
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:07,304
You even told me,

351
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:08,593
"There's nothing as uncanny as this."

352
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:11,002
Where is that talisman now?

353
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:12,332
I don't have it, sir.

354
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,351
How would I know its whereabouts?

355
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,709
Aigoo, I didn't see it while
packing your things, sir.

356
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,478
Talisman...

357
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,803
He doesn't seem to remember anything.

358
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:31,071
So he really doesn't know anything?

359
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:46,684
Si. Do. Tong. Rae. Gan. Pil. Gu. In.

360
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:55,219
Is this the talisman that
they were talking about?

361
00:24:55,348 --> 00:24:56,607
It should be.

362
00:24:56,818 --> 00:25:00,536
He was holding it when he suddenly appeared in the woods.

363
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:04,284
Loss of memory...

364
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:07,352
Talisman...

365
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:09,362
We have not been able to learn more, sir.

366
00:25:09,362 --> 00:25:11,221
The king ordered the royal guards to protect him
until he reaches Hanyang.

367
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:12,830
There was no way to approach him, sir.

368
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,358
How long do you think the king will keep me alive?

369
00:25:15,358 --> 00:25:18,027
He lets me live now, but he'll kill me soon enough.

370
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:20,295
The wind will certainly carry
the stench of blood.

371
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:23,095
Gim Bung Do is about to arrive in Hanyang.

372
00:25:23,095 --> 00:25:24,964
We will surely find the truth.

373
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,136
Hello?

374
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:40,445
Yes, Oppa.

375
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:42,074
I'm at home.

376
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,944
Hui Jin's at the hospital.

377
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:46,212
Is the psychiatric treatment still going on?

378
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,211
What? Is there anything
else that she can't accept?

379
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:50,739
Why is it not right  to be dating me?

380
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:51,940
It's not like that.

381
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:53,677
She's accepting it...

382
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,347
it's just that, occasionally, she will go back and forth.

383
00:25:57,946 --> 00:26:00,345
Today's session might be the last.

384
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:02,883
Don't be like this.

385
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:05,152
It's only because she was in the accident.

386
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:07,150
All right, I'm hanging up.

387
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,819
Coffee.

388
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:12,889
Will Miss Hui Jin be filming today?

389
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:15,686
Hyung. I am really speechless.

390
00:26:15,686 --> 00:26:19,025
Why do I have to compete with a guy from her dream?

391
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:22,362
Because there is this guy from a dream,
she is emotionally unprepared for me.

392
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:25,290
So I should give her time?
Does this make any sense?

393
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,760
I understand you 100%.

394
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,499
All this while, I couldn't understand
your relationships with girls,

395
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:32,627
but this time, you have my full support.

396
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:35,296
You must be really angry...

397
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:39,164
It's a side-effect of the accident,
how can I be angry?

398
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,303
But what kind of punk is this person?

399
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:43,702
I can't enter Hui Jin's head to meet him.

400
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,900
He should have some substance at
least, so I could teach him a lesson.

401
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,239
A guy from a dream?

402
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,839
Gim Bung Do?

403
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,167
She did say she's sorry about it.

404
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,436
There is nothing you can
do but wait and see.

405
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:54,436
I really...

406
00:26:57,044 --> 00:26:58,243
Too hot!

407
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,174
Did you think it would be cold?

408
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:01,043
You should tell me if it is hot!

409
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:06,780
This is organized very well.

410
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:12,786
I did it like you said.  Put all the memories
into order and wrote them down.

411
00:27:12,786 --> 00:27:16,785
Can you differentiate
between reality and dream now?

412
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:21,322
Well... Not completely.

413
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:25,590
The confusion starts at the drama's
press conference, doesn't it?

414
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,390
Yes.

415
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,726
I'm sure that I met that person
while the cast was being presented.

416
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:32,257
Everyone thought I fainted
and ruined the presscon.

417
00:27:33,326 --> 00:27:35,195
But that's not what happened really.

418
00:27:36,264 --> 00:27:39,732
<i>Next, introducing Choe Hui Jin.</i>

419
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,328
<i>I was fine and attended the presscon, no problem.</i>

420
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:54,134
<i>Han Dong Min clearly directed attention to me.</i>

421
00:27:56,403 --> 00:27:58,672
<i>What are you doing while
we're in the middle of work?</i>

422
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:06,377
<i>On the set, he kneeled and
begged me to start over with him.</i>

423
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:07,837
Why are you being like this?

424
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:09,576
<i>I am sorry.</i>

425
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:11,305
<i>Give me another chance.</i>

426
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:15,153
<i>Shouldn't you give me a chance, at least?</i>

427
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:17,182
You're so ungenerous.

428
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:19,181
<i>You see how serious I am, don't you?</i>

429
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:21,980
<i>Aren't you Queen In Hyeon?</i>

430
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,317
<i>Queen In Hyeon was chased out
because of Suk Jong's new concubine,</i>

431
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:26,917
<i>but she still forgave him.</i>

432
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:30,786
<i>People's deeds are a hundred times well deserved,
In the future, you'll get a chance to appear in movies.</i>

433
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:32,923
<i>You must be out of your mind.</i>

434
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:35,643
<i>Choe Hui Jin.</i>

435
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,321
<i>You're so tacky.</i>

436
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,320
<i>Don't you know I'm very persistent?</i>

437
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,328
<i>You should've known it already
when you got the role in this drama.</i>

438
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:46,826
<i>You're mine.</i>

439
00:28:47,597 --> 00:28:49,465
<i>He was so stubborn</i>

440
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:53,064
<i>that I finally accepted him.</i>

441
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,269
<i>While the drama was shooting,</i>

442
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,538
<i>I appeared in a Commercial Film.</i>

443
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:07,335
<i>With the money I earned, I bought a car.</i>

444
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:10,803
<i>It was not a present
from Gim Bung Do.</i>

445
00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:12,943
<i>This was sent by Mr. Han Dong Min.</i>

446
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,341
<i>Wow, how many stalks are there?</i>

447
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,539
Smell it.

448
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:21,738
A wonderful fragrance, isn't it?

449
00:29:21,738 --> 00:29:25,346
<i>All this time, Han Dong Min
has treated me well,</i>

450
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,875
<i>ten times better than before. </i>

451
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,144
That is what is real, isn't it?

452
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:34,952
Yes, that is the reality that makes South Korea's
women so envious.

453
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:38,818
I'm not really sure about it,

454
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,089
but the memories of this reality are
slowly coming back.

455
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:43,487
It is strange,

456
00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:45,626
but... Doctor...

457
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:46,686
Yes?

458
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:48,694
Why is this obviously the reality,

459
00:29:48,694 --> 00:29:50,694
but the dream is much more clear?

460
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:53,221
You said I'm remembering a dream...

461
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,427
But every single word that this person
said is so very clear to me.

462
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:02,427
And the feelings that I felt...

463
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:08,294
I can recall them distinctly,
at any time.

464
00:30:10,302 --> 00:30:12,031
Can a dream be like this?

465
00:30:12,831 --> 00:30:16,039
Didn't I say that you were too drawn into it?

466
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,639
If you are too drawn into the Joseon character,

467
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:19,237
you may well feel that things of Joseon,

468
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:22,037
are closer to you than the
people around you in reality.

469
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:24,834
It is a very common
phenomenon that happens to actors.

470
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:28,303
So you are saying that I got
drawn into the role to that extent?

471
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:30,171
Into Queen In Hyeon?

472
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:34,041
Then I must be a great actress.

473
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,648
Now that you are able to
differentiate between reality and dream,

474
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:41,646
there is nothing to
worry about anymore.

475
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:44,445
Don't get too caught up in work,

476
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:45,654
and get some rest.

477
00:30:45,654 --> 00:30:47,653
Meet up with friends and family.

478
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:50,981
Keep some distance between you and the
character. Then there shouldn't be any problems.

479
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:52,450
Yes, well...

480
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,360
Yes.

481
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:09,291
Please come in.

482
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:11,561
Doctor...

483
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:15,028
Is there anything else
that you wanted to say?

484
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:16,298
Come in.

485
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:23,834
Actually, I...

486
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:30,370
I promised the man in the dream
that we would have a date.

487
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,239
Of course, I made the promise in the dream.

488
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:38,776
The promise was to meet in a park at 2PM.
Today.

489
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:40,504
And so?

490
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:43,713
I'm thinking of going there.

491
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:47,712
If I do, does it mean I still have
to continue with the treatment?

492
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,181
Go and have a look.

493
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:50,380
Go and have a look, you say?

494
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,517
It will be helpful for you to confirm,
personally, whether it is reality or not.

495
00:31:55,986 --> 00:31:57,846
So that is how it is...

496
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:03,052
So you are sure that he
will definitely not appear?

497
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:04,522
That's why you're letting me go?

498
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,990
Isn't it just a dream?

499
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,590
Yes, it is.

500
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:13,328
But why do I feel that
he will really turn up?

501
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:16,257
Just go and see for yourself.

502
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:18,264
Yeah... I understand.

503
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:20,923
I won't go. Honestly, I don't even have the time.

504
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:23,592
Bye.

505
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,270
We're almost there, My Lord.

506
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,466
Since this is Hanyang, sir, please don't
go around saying that you have cut your hair.

507
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:38,133
If that news spreads, all kinds of rumors are sure to start.

508
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:41,072
You seem to be more concerned about
my nobleman's image than I am myself.

509
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:43,470
What's the big deal
of cutting one's hair?

510
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,621
You're always like this, sir.

511
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,009
Sometimes, it's like I was wiser than you.

512
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,808
When we were at Jeju, I was the one who was
quick with ways when crossing the borders.

513
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:54,275
You're not just a nobleman, sir,
you are a high-ranking official.

514
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:55,215
You know what I'm saying, right? Sir?

515
00:32:55,215 --> 00:32:58,285
In other words, your physique
comes from your parents, physique...

516
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:03,882
Anyway, your hair, really...
It must always be a secret, sir.

517
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,819
I can see home, now.

518
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:28,827
My Lord,

519
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:33,625
should I prepare the table
or the bath water first?

520
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,495
I will just wash and
then prepare to enter the palace.

521
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:36,833
Prepare my hat and clothes.

522
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:39,232
You want to enter the palace immediately, sir?

523
00:33:39,232 --> 00:33:40,831
Yes, go and prepare everything.

524
00:33:40,831 --> 00:33:42,700
I understand, sir.

525
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,238
But where did it go?

526
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:45,899
Sir?

527
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:49,367
The sword, the one Father used.

528
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:53,375
It was kept in a case, and
later locked up in the cupboard.

529
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,303
Why?

530
00:33:54,844 --> 00:33:57,373
It suddenly went missing, sir.

531
00:33:57,773 --> 00:33:59,111
The sword disappeared?

532
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:02,711
That was one of Master's relics.

533
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:06,848
We were so shocked.
And you weren't around, sir.

534
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:09,646
No matter how much we looked for it,
it was not to be found.

535
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:14,313
We thought that someone had stolen it.
We searched everywhere, sir.

536
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:18,452
But a few days later,
it was found right here.

537
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:20,851
So you are saying that someone took it,
kept it for a while, and then returned it?

538
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,320
I do not know, sir.

539
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,457
But I was uneasy, and hid the sword in a good place.

540
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:28,585
Should I bring it here, sir?

541
00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:29,656
Later.

542
00:34:29,656 --> 00:34:31,254
Very good, sir.

543
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:52,632
<i>With the exception of myself,</i>

544
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,972
<i>I try not to change the fate
of others as much as possible.</i>

545
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:59,170
<i>But now that things are
settled I feel relieved.</i>

546
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:00,500
-=Man plans, but the success of it depends on God.=-

547
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,438
<i>It feels like man proposes, and God disposes.
-=Man plans, but the success of it depends on God.=-</i>

548
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:04,107
<i>It feels like man proposes, and God disposes.
-=Man plans, but the success of it depends on God.=-</i>

549
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:10,244
Man proposes... God disposes?

550
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:15,042
This is weird...

551
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:17,181
It's the first time I have heard words like that.

552
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,778
How can a person in my dream appear
to be more higher in standard than me?

553
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:23,716
<i>Let's meet in a month.</i>

554
00:35:24,386 --> 00:35:27,985
<i>It should take around a month to
settle everything and return to Hanyang.</i>

555
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:30,653
<i>Once I return home, I will
come and look for you.</i>

556
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:33,852
<i>But do you have any reason
to come here anymore?</i>

557
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,589
<i>My lover is here. Isn't that a reason?</i>

558
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,988
<i>Didn't I say that I would
try my best to be your lover?
</i>

559
00:35:44,397 --> 00:35:49,194
<i>I thought it was just for today.</i>

560
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:51,592
<i>Do you remember what
you asked me before?</i>

561
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:53,992
<i>You asked if our meeting was karma.</i>

562
00:35:55,331 --> 00:35:57,869
<i>I've been thinking for several days</i>

563
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:59,998
<i>and still can't figure out how this will end.</i>

564
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:03,865
<i>Until I know the answer,
I will keep looking for you.</i>

565
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:23,205
If he really appears,
what are you doing to do?

566
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,038
My Lord,

567
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:34,308
here is your attire.

568
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:37,776
It suddenly rained, sir. It's a bit wet.

569
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:40,045
Do you want me to re-iron it?

570
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:43,384
It's all right. The road will be wet, in any case.

571
00:37:46,852 --> 00:37:49,380
But why are you dressed like that?

572
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,519
Aren't you Yun Wol, the gisaeng that I know?

573
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,918
I almost couldn't recognize you.

574
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:55,786
I've been waiting here, sir,

575
00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:57,656
not sure whether it would be
shameless to stay.

576
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:01,654
But can a lowly gisaeng continue to live here?

577
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:06,590
So I thought of  becoming a slave girl again.
And I am comfortable in these clothes, sir.

578
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,328
Choose. I will let you have your wish fulfilled.

579
00:38:13,398 --> 00:38:16,466
Haven't you played the gayageum ever since
you were young?

580
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:21,003
If you wish be a gisaeng,
there's no need for you to remain here.

581
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:24,731
However, if you don't want it anymore,

582
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,669
just stay here.

583
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:32,607
But I can't allow you to be a slave girl.

584
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:35,406
Are you not a highly reputable gisaeng of Hanyang?

585
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:40,604
Are you saying you want to make me your wife?

586
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:45,280
Out of all the solutions, isn't that one?

587
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,417
It cannot be, sir.

588
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:56,885
Could there be a world that does not have all these boundaries
that cannot be passed?

589
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:58,883
I should like a solution like that,

590
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:00,882
but I cannot bring it about.

591
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,519
I hope I am able to repay you.

592
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,658
I hope I can protect you for the rest of your life.

593
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:10,658
This is all I wanted to say.

594
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:12,127
My Lord, you are saying,

595
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:16,654
there could be a better world
for a person like me?

596
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,193
You would bring me there, sir?

597
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:24,529
If there is such a world, please take me there.

598
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:30,796
I know you think of me as your family, sir,

599
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,196
but to become a wife,

600
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:36,803
and not see the wind and the rain...

601
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:43,340
It doesn't suit me, sir.

602
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,807
If I had hoped to live a life like that,
I would have never become a gisaeng.

603
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:55,214
Did I hurt your self-esteem?

604
00:39:55,214 --> 00:39:57,082
No, sir.

605
00:39:58,012 --> 00:39:59,211
I'm sorry.

606
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:01,750
Sir, it's not like that.

607
00:40:07,886 --> 00:40:10,156
But didn't you hear?

608
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:11,215
I've lost my memory,

609
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:14,423
so I do not know where it is.
The place I said was a good world.

610
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:16,952
If I knew, I would take you there right away.

611
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:24,428
If that is so, then you've
not met that woman yet?

612
00:40:24,428 --> 00:40:25,758
Woman?

613
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:30,026
A woman you had to repay, sir.

614
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,362
That is why you went back there, wasn't it?

615
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:33,791
<i>Excuse me.</i>

616
00:41:42,058 --> 00:41:44,865
Aren't you Miss Choe Hui Jin, the actress?

617
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:46,065
No.

618
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:48,733
You look like her, though.

619
00:41:48,733 --> 00:41:51,262
I hear that a lot. But I'm not her.

620
00:42:29,952 --> 00:42:32,080
It has only been over 30 minutes.

621
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:55,029
<i>A woman you had to repay.</i>

622
00:42:56,098 --> 00:42:58,626
<i>That is why you went back there again.</i>

623
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:14,938
You wanted to see me, sir?

624
00:43:15,607 --> 00:43:17,607
I may have to
really look for the talisman.

625
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:18,436
Talisman, sir?

626
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:22,404
I sent a letter to the governor of Jeju.

627
00:43:22,404 --> 00:43:24,413
If the talisman is found there, they will send it to me.

628
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:29,610
Perhaps it could have fallen
somewhere here. Search for it.

629
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,349
Mobilize everyone here and start searching.

630
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:32,549
Yes, sir.

631
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,548
Another thing,

632
00:43:36,017 --> 00:43:39,485
have I perhaps mentioned a woman?

633
00:43:39,485 --> 00:43:42,414
A woman? Who?

634
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:45,751
A woman who helped me in the past.

635
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,350
No.

636
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:52,688
Do you have a hidden woman somewhere, sir?

637
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:55,657
Is that why Yun Wol is crying?

638
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:56,895
Crying?

639
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:57,595
Mmm...

640
00:43:57,755 --> 00:44:02,022
I saw her crying. She made believe it was rain water...

641
00:44:02,022 --> 00:44:04,692
Are you really hiding a woman somewhere, sir?

642
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,359
No. I just may have done something absurd.

643
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,028
What is "absurd", sir?

644
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:12,836
What?

645
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:16,836
Didn't you just say "absurd"?

646
00:44:17,235 --> 00:44:18,963
What does it mean, sir?

647
00:44:18,963 --> 00:44:23,101
I can't think of how to write it in Hanja,
it'a the first time I hear it.
(Hanja - chinese characters)

648
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,309
I don't know either. What does it mean?

649
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:32,293
Eh?

650
00:45:29,095 --> 00:45:30,045
You...

651
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:34,436
Aren't you going a bit too far?

652
00:45:35,906 --> 00:45:37,236
How did you know to come here?

653
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:41,507
I called your doctor, and she said you
went to meet the man in your dream.

654
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:47,246
I was going to just leave, but it rained.

655
00:45:49,657 --> 00:45:52,058
You're really making me feel miserable.

656
00:45:52,058 --> 00:45:53,658
Hey, I'm Han Dong Min.

657
00:45:53,658 --> 00:45:56,999
There's not a single girl who would
ignore me in this world, you know?

658
00:45:56,999 --> 00:46:00,729
How can you make me compete with
someone you met in a dream?

659
00:46:01,669 --> 00:46:02,870
You have a point there.

660
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,540
What's wrong with me recently
that I'm doing this absurd stuff?

661
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,671
So you do know that you're being absurd?

662
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:11,681
Come out.

663
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:18,752
Look, you still feel awkward about me?

664
00:46:18,752 --> 00:46:20,351
Really, you are...

665
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:25,962
Absurd...

666
00:46:28,764 --> 00:46:31,164
I'm saying things that I don't understand myself.

667
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,573
Yes, I must have gone to some strange place.

668
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:35,174
So you must, sir.

669
00:46:35,174 --> 00:46:37,444
Why would I be saying meaningless stuff?

670
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,844
Before I return from the palace,
search the whole house.

671
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:45,986
But My Lord...

672
00:46:45,986 --> 00:46:46,915
It's raining this heavily,

673
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:49,186
wouldn't it be better enter the palace a little later?

674
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:50,656
There's no time.

675
00:46:50,656 --> 00:46:53,596
I have to see Queen In Hyeon, too,
so we have to set off immediately.

676
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:56,668
Who is Queen In Hyeon, sir?

677
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:00,267
I just said Queen In Hyeon, didn't I?

678
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,808
Yes, sir. But...

679
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:05,468
Isn't this "Queen" the word used
for someone who is dead?

680
00:47:05,468 --> 00:47:09,078
So you want to go to her burial grounds, sir?
In this heavy rain?

681
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:14,550
But our Queen is not called "Queen In Hyeon".

682
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,620
Who is Queen In Hyeon?

683
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,689
You are the one who said it, sir,

684
00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:21,360
why are you asking me? How would I know?

685
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,231
That's right.

686
00:47:23,631 --> 00:47:25,761
I must have eaten the wrong medicine.

687
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:28,702
What does "eaten the wrong medicine" mean, sir?

688
00:47:30,171 --> 00:47:32,572
Didn't you just say "eaten the wrong medicine"?

689
00:47:35,101 --> 00:47:37,772
Isn't someone who has gone crazy
said to have eaten the wrong medicine?

690
00:47:38,443 --> 00:47:41,513
It's the first time I hear this, sir.

691
00:47:45,924 --> 00:47:47,224
My Lord...

692
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:51,654
It's not because it's tasty, don't worry.

693
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:55,266
Be careful when talking in the palace.

694
00:47:55,266 --> 00:47:57,135
You just find that talisman.

695
00:47:58,196 --> 00:48:02,206
It really seems like I've forgotten
something important.

696
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:09,007
Really, you...

697
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,300
Queen In Hyeon?

698
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,840
Queen In Hyeon?

699
00:48:55,503 --> 00:49:01,163
