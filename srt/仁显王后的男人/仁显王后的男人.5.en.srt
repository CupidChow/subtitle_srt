1
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:09,645
<i>Who are you?</i>

2
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:11,375
<i>Who are you?</i>

3
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:15,075
<i>I think I have arrived
to a world 300 years later.</i>

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,985
<i>You came here with this amulet.</i>

5
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,185
<i>Is this right?</i>

6
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:24,995
<i>Ah, this is seriously...</i>

7
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:29,075
<i>I'm speechless, seriously.</i>

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,865
<i>Not knowing anything, why do
I have to encounter so much?</i>

9
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:39,275
<i>Every time I am facing a life or death
situation, time will pass. Is this what it means?</i>

10
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:41,545
<i>Really, why do you keep
appearing in front of me?</i>

11
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:44,875
<i>I'm looking for a book.
A chronicle.</i>

12
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,025
<i>That should be in the library.</i>

13
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:50,345
<i>What do you do if you want to share
your happiness with somebody?</i>

14
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:53,415
<i>You're also a player over there, right?</i>

15
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,955
<i>Is this the greeting you used
when you leave in this world?</i>

16
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,525
Now do you understand?
I'm just abiding the customs.

17
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:32,795
Is this the greeting you use
when you leave in this world?

18
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:34,715
Yes.

19
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,465
With any one and any where?

20
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:40,805
This is for you to remember.

21
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,335
Since we are here, I'll take you
to the park so come out.

22
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,135
Did you really like it?

23
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:53,975
Do you want to cause trouble?

24
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:55,245
Choe Hui Jin!

25
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,225
What are you doing here?

26
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:04,555
Why are you here then?

27
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:06,825
What are you doing leaving
your friend without saying your location?

28
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:17,105
Get out of the way.

29
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,805
How do you do?

30
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:31,915
I am Hui Jin's friend, stylist
and manager, Jo Su Gyeong.

31
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,785
It is my first time
meeting you, you are?

32
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,535
If you're not going to
shake hands then I will.

33
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:46,735
Let's go.

34
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:48,735
I'll give you a lift.

35
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,605
That's really...

36
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:51,535
Please get in.

37
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:54,875
I can go on my own.

38
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,145
He said he could go
on his own. Don't bother.

39
00:02:57,145 --> 00:03:00,215
Didn't you say that you
would send him to the park?

40
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:06,355
I heard everything you said. Since you've
already said it, you should keep your promise.

41
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:08,225
Please get in.

42
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:11,695
I won't pressure you,
please get in.

43
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,695
This has always been my car.

44
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:17,565
No.

45
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,895
Sit in front.

46
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:26,775
I'll drive. You go and sit behind.

47
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:35,185
Don't say anything to her,
she has good foresight.

48
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,465
Family name?

49
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:48,665
Gim Bung Do.

50
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:53,335
But why are you going
to the park at this time?

51
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:57,065
For an exercise. Why are you
asking about people's private matters?

52
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:59,605
Am I asking you? Why are
you the one answering?

53
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:02,645
It's an answer, anyway it's no big deal who answers.

54
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,145
But, what kind of relationship
do you have with Hui Jin?

55
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,065
I've never once heard of you before.

56
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,725
History!

57
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,645
He is helping me
with my history studies.

58
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:14,785
-History studies?
-Yes.

59
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:17,045
In order to prepare for the drama,
because my history knowledge is inadequate.

60
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:19,185
What do you do for living?

61
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:20,925
A social studies university student.

62
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:24,655
He looks like
he's in the arts field.

63
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:25,855
He's a university student?

64
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:27,595
What about you? Do you
look like you're a stylist?

65
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:29,325
How can you judge
just based on looks?

66
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:30,795
But...

67
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:35,465
You have an image that is
really close to Hui Jin's ideal man.

68
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,405
What are you saying
all of a sudden?

69
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:39,335
Please be careful.

70
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:42,275
While studying, she may come up with
excuses just to entangle herself around you.

71
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:48,685
Entangle? What does that mean?

72
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:50,285
It means you should be
careful with your lips.

73
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:53,885
This child is a little impulsive.

74
00:04:56,685 --> 00:04:59,625
Are you crazy? Why are
you talking nonsense?

75
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,365
It was a joke.

76
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:03,365
Why are you getting mad?

77
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:06,295
Now you're saying this is a joke?

78
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:08,435
Saying these in front
of the teacher, really...

79
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:10,435
Someone is finding it interesting.

80
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,045
People are taking it as a joke and you're
the only one who is taking it seriously.

81
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,345
It was nice meeting you,
please walk safely.

82
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:40,015
Is the parting greeting
always normally like this?

83
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:42,415
What? What do you mean?

84
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:43,885
Not this but another.

85
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,215
What is the other?

86
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:46,415
Not shaking hands?

87
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:48,425
Ah, this. Goodbye.

88
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:53,895
So normally it's either this or
this kind of parting greeting?

89
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,365
Then...

90
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,035
Take care.

91
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:11,245
Please walk carefully.

92
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,325
You!

93
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:31,535
What?

94
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:35,265
You, don't you have something to tell me?

95
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,335
Who is he?

96
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:38,335
He is my history teacher.

97
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:41,805
Why are you exaggerating the
first time you meet people?

98
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:43,545
This is exaggerating?

99
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,085
The hospital is starting to get very noisy.

100
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:50,615
So why are you suddenly
showing up at the library?

101
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:51,685
Where did you meet each other?

102
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:56,485
Didn't I say I've met him at the library several
times and he's helping me in learning history?

103
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,895
Once the lesson ends we will have no
reason to meet anymore, let's just go.

104
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:04,495
Just up to this point, I'm really telling the truth.

105
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:07,435
By saying up until here, do you
think I would go easy on you?

106
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:09,005
Go easy on what?

107
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:13,575
I'm your manager, I have to
seriously manage your scandals.

108
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:15,045
Now you have to
organize In Hyeon's man.

109
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:17,445
Now you're... how... what...

110
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,715
Stop exploiting others, just hurry and go!

111
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:22,645
I'm keeping my eye on you.

112
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:33,995
How come there's nothing?

113
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,125
Didn't you say you were a scholar?

114
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:45,475
Lady Jang died, and you're ecstatic.

115
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:48,805
Then he should be at least an official.

116
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,675
Why wasn't it recorded?

117
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:55,885
Could he really be a psycho stalker?

118
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:01,085
That means I've done that sort
of thing to a psycho stalker.

119
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:02,935
What did you say?

120
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:04,065
Nothing.

121
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:06,145
Practicing my lines.

122
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:08,695
Why am I sweating so much?

123
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:11,035
Like a beggar.

124
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:13,515
<i>Then what is the conclusion?</i>

125
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:15,905
<i>Am I being chased by an ancestor?</i>

126
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:18,835
<i>or by a psycho stalker?</i>

127
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:22,715
<i>Despite the conclusion, it is
still considered a misfortune.</i>

128
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,565
<i>What is all this?</i>

129
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,955
It's Han Dong Min.

130
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:30,755
Tell him I'm sleeping.

131
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:34,655
Hello?

132
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:36,125
Yes.

133
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:40,125
The stalker wasn't caught.
We got scared and went home.

134
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,595
Yes, Hui Jin is sleeping.

135
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,883
Hey, did Hui Jin go to the library?

136
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:44,953
What?

137
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:47,283
How did you know about the library?

138
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:49,093
There are photos uploaded on the internet.

139
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,813
On the internet?

140
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,343
That fast?

141
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:56,993
She went to look for some
information. Now she's at home.

142
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,683
But how come the stalker
has not been caught yet?

143
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:01,806
What?

144
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,696
How could he have escaped
from the bathroom?

145
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:06,296
Not caught?

146
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,436
It's because someone was bewildered
by that woman's eyes that he got away.

147
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:12,176
Ah that's really not it.

148
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,906
I got it, see you tomorrow.

149
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:17,166
Han Dong Min, my eyes
were really opened wide.

150
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,376
Don't keep saying that
it was my mistake!

151
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:23,646
Leaving the nurse at the front,
someone was really guarding well.

152
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,586
Just by seeing a female,
is it that hard to have self-control?

153
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,526
This is the funniest joke
I've heard this year.

154
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,256
What about you? What about you?
What about you?

155
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:36,196
Forget it. However, it's really strange.

156
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:37,396
Didn't you see it too?

157
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:39,666
The shower door in the
bathroom was left like that.

158
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,466
But how is it possible that
he escaped quietly from there?

159
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,206
That punk.

160
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:47,946
If he were sent to the police
then I would be heroic, right?

161
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:52,616
I can do anything. But as a tough guy,
having the image of a tough guy is not enough.

162
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:55,546
Just at that moment and
it would've been perfect.

163
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:57,286
What a waste.

164
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:01,956
It's so bitter!

165
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:03,686
How is it so fast that
there are photos already?

166
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,496
Nowadays, there's no secret in this world.

167
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:08,896
So you should be careful.

168
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:12,366
Don't have pictures taken
together with that teacher!

169
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,866
One that can cause a scandal.

170
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:14,766
There's none.

171
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:17,056
Just books...

172
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:25,716
Before the broadcast, don't get involved
with issues regarding Yun Na Jeong's words.

173
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:29,026
If there's another scandal about
you again, you're dead meat.

174
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,786
Be careful.

175
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:38,046
Inside an elevator, is
there a CCTV?

176
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,666
Probably, why?

177
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:46,976
What is it?

178
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:51,406
What should I do? I only
thought of cameras but not CCTV.

179
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:07,556
The guard room should
be still open right?

180
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:08,296
What?

181
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,626
There's no relationship of any sort, right?

182
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,896
Having no relationship and yet you kissed him
in the elevator and got caught by a CCTV?

183
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,626
There's no relationship of any sort.

184
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:20,096
That was just some confusion.

185
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,366
Having no relationship is
even more funny,

186
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:24,506
might as well have
a bit of a relationship?

187
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:26,906
Does being confused make any sense?

188
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:28,676
So embarrassing!

189
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:32,646
Hey, about that. This person
will unknowingly  disappear.

190
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:34,116
It is also possible that
he won't come anymore.

191
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:36,246
How can you just trust someone that quickly?

192
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,116
In the beginning I didn't know it would turn out like this.

193
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:39,316
You don't watch action films?

194
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:40,916
In the movies, even if there's
tons of bombs exploding,

195
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,256
the lead actors will do
what they're supposed to--

196
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:43,586
That's in movies!

197
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:46,656
Seriously...

198
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:52,396
True. It's in movies.

199
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:55,866
Stolen by a thief?

200
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,246
Yes.

201
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:01,676
My friend is a bit of a muddlehead.

202
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:05,376
Somehow it seems like it was
stolen inside the elevator.

203
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:08,286
Since it's very important,

204
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:10,666
please allow us to confirm it.

205
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:14,556
You'll have to report to the police first,
so we can get the police's authorization.

206
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:18,696
Yes, of course. The procedure
is normally like that.

207
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:26,166
Honestly, that brat could
possibly be my boyfriend.

208
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:34,446
If we report it to the police, I don't know
what would happen to our relationship.

209
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:38,846
Although I'm suspicious, but
there isn't really any evidence.

210
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:44,186
Pretty Agassi, why did you
meet with such a strange fellow?

211
00:12:44,186 --> 00:12:45,486
That is why...

212
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:50,456
Even if we were to report him,
at least let us confirm it.

213
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,856
What time was it?

214
00:12:53,796 --> 00:12:56,066
This evening, around 7 o'clock.

215
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,396
7 o'clock?

216
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:02,556
Aigoo. During that time the elevator's camera
wasn't working, there's no captured image.

217
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:03,986
What?

218
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:08,196
Take a look, nothing comes out right?

219
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:12,566
We've called people to come fix it tomorrow.
Looks like there's no image captured after 6 onwards.

220
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:15,646
Really, what a pity.

221
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:18,056
Should have gotten hold of evidence.

222
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:21,856
What exactly was stolen?
You should first report it to the police.

223
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:24,736
I think that needs
to be reconsidered again.

224
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:27,389
Ajussi, please have this.
(Ajussi - uncle, older man)

225
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,659
We're sorry to have troubled
you, so we bought this.

226
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,469
There's even this...

227
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,019
My father is also
a guard at Mokpo.

228
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:38,869
Looking at Ajussi, it
doesn't feel like we're strangers.

229
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,469
Is that so?

230
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:46,349
Isn't it annoying having weird
people around in public buildings?

231
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,019
It's not that. Having to
work staying up all night,

232
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,819
because of drunkards wanting to cause
trouble is what gives people a headache.

233
00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:01,429
Always complaining about the country,
they might as well complain to the president.

234
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,939
What abilities does a common guard have?

235
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,229
Yes, that's right.

236
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:08,559
Like I said, there are a lot of
these kind of thugs around.

237
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:28,789
<i>You can't stand over there.</i>

238
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,929
The camera will capture it.
Go hide at the back.

239
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,669
Can't you hear me?

240
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:42,939
Isn't it the time when no one
can come in, how did you...

241
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,749
You can't just come in even
though there's no one around.

242
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:58,219
Even if you don't see anybody anywhere,
there are still cameras monitoring.

243
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:03,819
That machine is monitoring everything.

244
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,939
Then, even me being here too...

245
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,299
When you were coming up here it recorded it all.

246
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:12,499
You should thank me that I came up first.
If this was reported to the police,

247
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,499
they would have come and immediately arrested you.

248
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:19,169
I thought that I made good preparations before
coming, unknowingly I'm doing foolish things again.

249
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,969
Why does this world have no blind spots?

250
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:24,909
Are you thinking that it's still the
same as 300 years ago right now?

251
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:29,449
Just hiding over at that side will do.

252
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:34,389
Go through here and
you won't get discovered.

253
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:38,789
I know now. But why are you here?

254
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:39,729
That...

255
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:45,329
Thinking about it, I came
here all because of you.

256
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:49,549
Because of you I've been here and
there sorting things the whole day.

257
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:52,669
Because I didn't want to trouble
you that's why I came here at this hour.

258
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:58,809
But why is it that I'm seeing you
again when I'm here at this time?

259
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,149
Looks like our meeting is
not accidental but inevitable.

260
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:06,149
There must be a
reason why we met.

261
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:13,479
Don't say such words
in a serious atmosphere.

262
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:16,699
Even so, you're still a player.

263
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:20,669
Since earlier on you kept saying
that I'm a player. What is that exactly?

264
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:24,071
What did you come to see?

265
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:29,441
I've known the important part already.
Now I'm not curious about my life anymore.

266
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:33,841
Because of the Gabsul event,
your heart is soaring high?

267
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:37,711
What are you going to become?
A judge? Don't tell me, a minister?

268
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:39,581
Although I don't know
what I will be,

269
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,911
I am anticipating
for the moment.

270
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:45,051
Earlier on I was searching for
an unknown person in history.

271
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:45,991
Is that so?

272
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,191
Well, nothing much.

273
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,111
It can't be like this.

274
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:51,401
Please don't anticipate too much.

275
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:53,591
I'm sure you've seen wrongly.

276
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:02,801
Hello?

277
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:05,741
Where are you? I thought
you were in the car.

278
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:08,941
My stomach really hurts so badly,
I had to go to the washroom.

279
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,411
Wait awhile for me.

280
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:12,681
I'm really defeated by you.

281
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:24,821
I came with that friend earlier on,
I have to get going.

282
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,831
Ah, go quickly.

283
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,101
Or else she will be suspicious.

284
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,701
Please understand.

285
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,531
I've said it already, I'm
famous so a lot of men--

286
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:38,441
No, not suspicious of me.
Seems more like she's suspicious of you.

287
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:39,411
What did you say?

288
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:43,381
Your passion towards
me has caught her attention.

289
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:46,981
Are you talking about our
parting earlier on?

290
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:49,521
Of course there are other
methods of saying goodbye.

291
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:52,321
There's shaking of hands.
This too and also,

292
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,051
what I taught you.

293
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:56,461
It's all the same, they're used frequently.

294
00:17:56,461 --> 00:18:02,061
But what I taught you is
the most formal way of greeting.

295
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:05,401
I'm teaching it to you in order to get you
accustomed to the greetings here.

296
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:07,471
Do you understand?

297
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:12,341
Do you not believe me now?
Trust my words.

298
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:13,941
I trust you,

299
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:15,811
You really trust me?

300
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:19,281
I trust you. If not,
who else can I trust?

301
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:22,351
You're a teacher that
teaches me from one to ten.

302
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:28,091
<i>Choe Hui Jin, are you in there?</i>

303
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,891
Don't get discovered. Be
careful on your way back.

304
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:37,561
I will see to it,
you don't have to worry.

305
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,271
What are you doing?

306
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:19,211
Over here you won't get
discovered by that, right?

307
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,611
It shouldn't be.

308
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:41,231
Didn't you allow me to get accustomed to
saying goodbye? I'm complying to it.

309
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:49,591
But back where I live,
this is only done among lovers.

310
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:53,411
It's a bit strange that it is
applied as a goodbye here.

311
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,011
But I have an unconditional trust
towards your instructions.

312
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:07,691
Go quickly.

313
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,791
You asked what a player is right?

314
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:17,273
People who do these kinds of
things, are called players.

315
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,813
You're just like a player.

316
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,683
<i>Hey, Choe Hui Jin.
Are you in here?</i>

317
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:32,623
Didn't you say you went to
the washroom, why are you here?

318
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:35,163
I lost my way, so...

319
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,423
Does that make sense?

320
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:38,763
Doesn't it?

321
00:20:38,763 --> 00:20:41,703
I'm bad at directions,
let's go.

322
00:20:56,913 --> 00:21:02,253
What a relief. Like I've said,
Choe Hui Jin's luck is really good.

323
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:05,453
How could it be a coincidence
that the cameras aren't working.

324
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,523
I'm really going to
investigate that fellow.

325
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:14,793
Just recruit her already.

326
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:21,603
Nobleman in the past are certainly
lame and completely prejudiced.

327
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:22,803
What?

328
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:28,543
Thinking about it, back then they had
lots of wives and there's also Gisaengs.

329
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:32,413
They understand women better than men
nowadays, there's no reason to not understand.

330
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:33,483
What are you saying?

331
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:37,883
If I see a writer, I'm going
to have a good talk with them.

332
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:40,283
They probably wouldn't understand either.

333
00:21:48,693 --> 00:21:53,903
<i>Year of Gabsul, 11th day of the 3rd month.
Officer Gim Bung Do met with the
Right Deputy Prime Minister to talk.</i>

334
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:57,773
This is today's date.

335
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:05,113
Year of Gabsul 11th day of the 3rd month,
tomorrow is the day it will take place.

336
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:09,263
Half a month ago a body was found
at the Office of Special Advisers.

337
00:22:10,723 --> 00:22:16,053
<i>Half a month ago the body of a criminal
was found at the Office of Special Advisers,
who was discovered by Gim Bung Do.</i>

338
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:19,663
<i>He was immediately arrested for interrogations.</i>

339
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:33,943
<i>Might as well just push
all the blame on him.</i>

340
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:38,343
<i>Who dares to use a
sword in the palace?</i>

341
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:40,483
<i>This is clearly a conspiracy.</i>

342
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:42,613
<i>No matter who asks, don't tell
them that you saw me tonight.</i>

343
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:44,883
<i>That is the only way you will
both live. Do you understand?</i>

344
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,223
<i>Yes.</i>

345
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:49,153
Was it them who spread it?

346
00:22:57,433 --> 00:23:02,103
<i>Year of Gabsul, 15th day of the 3rd month.
When Gim Bung Do was interrogated,
the King said...
</i>

347
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:05,413
<i>This is certainly a conspiracy.</i>

348
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:10,383
<i>Gim Bung Do is to be stripped of his official duties,
and interrogated by torture. </i>

349
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:18,263
March 16th...

350
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:19,993
March 17th...

351
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,643
March 18th...

352
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:25,323
19th, 20th...

353
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:28,933
March 21st...

354
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:46,523
<i>An official from Jeju wrote
a letter reporting to the members,</i>

355
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:51,133
"Traitor Gim Bung Do who reached Jeju
the next day on the 24th of March,

356
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:53,373
<i>suddenly fell ill and died."</i>

357
00:24:05,123 --> 00:24:07,263
<i>Suddenly fell ill and died.</i>

358
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:10,633
<i>Suddenly fell ill and died.</i>

359
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,603
<i>Welcome--</i>

360
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:13,803
<i>Please sit, sit.</i>

361
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:17,673
<i>What is the difference between escaping
his own acts and dying because of illness?</i>

362
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:20,603
<i>I can't be assured that because of
the talisman, I can live.</i>

363
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:23,943
<i>Even if I'm able to survive,
what changes will happen later?</i>

364
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:24,743
<i>No.</i>

365
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:28,483
<i>The fact that I died because
of an illness, is it the truth?</i>

366
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:31,423
<i>Yeo Un ah, two bowls of soup.</i>

367
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:32,353
<i>Quickly bring it out.</i>

368
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:33,823
<i>-Yes.
-What are you doing?</i>

369
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:39,023
Today we'll avoid first,
and not enter the palace.

370
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:43,693
If it keeps on going on like this, we'll get
hunted and things will get worse.

371
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:48,103
First confirm with what's written in
the records, whether it is completely true.

372
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:50,103
What did you say?

373
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:55,173
If I was arrested as a criminal, both
you and Yun Wol will be in great danger.

374
00:24:56,113 --> 00:24:57,713
Why would I?

375
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:00,243
Didn't you said that everything
is going to change smoothly?

376
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,713
I must first sort the
people by my side.

377
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:06,253
You must first bring Yun Wol
and leave for Hanyang.

378
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:23,203
I heard that you came.

379
00:25:29,343 --> 00:25:31,613
Yun Wol left at dawn

380
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:35,613
I have matters to inform you
that's why I've been waiting here.

381
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:40,023
Now it is all right.

382
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:46,823
Leaving me to the matters of yesterday,
what significance does it have?

383
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:52,563
All I want is to be with you,
sitting like this facing each other.

384
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:57,643
My heart is moved till there
is no words left to be said.

385
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:02,313
Please forgive my boldness.

386
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:04,443
Seeing you, my heart is...

387
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,853
Cry to your heart's content.

388
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:15,253
I will accept your tears.

389
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:20,263
Your Majesty.

390
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:27,403
Okay!

391
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:29,933
Very good.

392
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,603
The tone of voice is
good as well. Keep it up.

393
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:33,483
Yes.

394
00:26:33,543 --> 00:26:36,473
<i>Slightly turning inside wouldn't
be bad idea as well.</i>

395
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:39,943
<i>Bring that over.</i>

396
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:41,553
<i>Move to the left a little.</i>

397
00:26:41,553 --> 00:26:42,613
Let go!

398
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:43,553
Quickly.

399
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:45,233
What's wrong?

400
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:47,993
Really... I think I'm starting to patronize you.

401
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:53,323
Bed scene. Bed scene. Bed scene.

402
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:54,533
Bed scene?

403
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:55,513
Okay.

404
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,733
Really...

405
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:02,273
<i>Gung Mi, come and change the line.</i>

406
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,473
Seems like they're having fun.

407
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:08,273
You've improved a lot.

408
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:10,013
What are you doing?

409
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:12,373
Why are you glaring at me?

410
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:15,483
How could you be
disrespectful, My Queen.

411
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:18,823
I have always been disrespectful.

412
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:22,153
That stalker didn't turn up?

413
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:24,023
You don't have to worry about it.

414
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:27,093
If he dares try and
come near my wife,

415
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:31,093
I will beat him a
hundred times then...

416
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:34,703
I will drown him underwater.

417
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:38,503
-=CMS drama series. New, Lady Jang=-
-=Queen In Hyeon, Choe Hui Jin's waiting room.=-

418
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:40,303
I'm curious how the pictures
will end up looking like.

419
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:42,443
It must come out
prettier than Lady Jang's.

420
00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:46,313
Hold on, when will it
come out after editing?

421
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:47,163
Su Gyeong.

422
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:50,453
How many days has it been
already since I started filming?

423
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:52,183
It has probably been more than half a month...

424
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:53,123
Already?

425
00:27:56,053 --> 00:28:00,593
Confusing other people's life
and just disappearing like that.

426
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:06,063
Team Leader Yu.

427
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:07,933
Yes, it's me.

428
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,203
Yes, about the edited version...

429
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:13,573
Should I have left
him with my phone number?

430
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:15,013
Even if I did, so what?

431
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:17,143
He's an idiot who doesn't
even know what a phone is.

432
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:19,413
She's in here.

433
00:28:19,543 --> 00:28:20,743
Miss Choe Hui Jin?

434
00:28:21,153 --> 00:28:22,573
Writer Gim is here.

435
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:24,883
How do you do, seonsaengnim?

436
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:26,083
Hello!

437
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,703
- Hello.
- Hello.

438
00:28:27,823 --> 00:28:29,823
I came from the filming set.

439
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,970
Very beautiful, it fits you.

440
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,380
Thank you.

441
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,220
Really. I have been observing
Miss Hui Jin earlier on,

442
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,460
your tone of voice
seems very good.

443
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,350
If you continue on like
this, it's going to go well.

444
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,340
Thank you.

445
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,670
Is that true?

446
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Of course, I have been vouching
for you since the beginning.

447
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,230
Is there anything that you don't understand
or find it difficult while looking at the scripts?

448
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,420
So far...

449
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,040
Right, there is something
I want to ask you about.

450
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,050
What is it?

451
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:10,710
Perhaps do you know if during the Gabsul event,
was there any officer called Gim Bung Do?

452
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,660
Gim Bung Do?

453
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,120
That's not someone I know of.

454
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,590
That's not someone who is in
the scripts, but why are you asking?

455
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,990
It's nothing. Just that while I was
studying for the drama...

456
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,790
I accidentally came across such person
so that's why I'm just a little curious.

457
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,660
Hold on, let me look
it up on the internet.

458
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,600
Hold on!

459
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,000
You can just find it
in the records.

460
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You can find the
records on the internet?

461
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,540
Of course, the world has
become convenient recently.

462
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,870
Having this will fix it all.

463
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,740
Hold on!

464
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,940
Is that true?

465
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,080
Not knowing this and
even went to the library.

466
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,280
You went to the library?

467
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,480
Omo, Miss Hui Jin.
People will get touched.

468
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,220
Nowadays are there any female actresses who
go to the library just to study about history?

469
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,090
This is my first time
coming across this, really.

470
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,160
I like you so much I must
certainly find it for you.

471
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,830
Hold on, what was the name again?

472
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,830
Gim Bung Do.

473
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,840
Gim Bung Do? All right,
just wait a moment.

474
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,170
Gim... Bung... Do.

475
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,110
It's out, come take a look.

476
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,440
It's out?

477
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,180
Take a look at this

478
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,460
October 1686, Champion
of the Scholars examination.

479
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,050
Looks like he wasn't lying.

480
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:25,320
In 1692, he was appointed as an
officer for the Office of Special Advisers.

481
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,720
1694, he was involved in a conspiracy
and was questioned by torture.

482
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,120
What?

483
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,330
Who in here is Gim Bung Do?

484
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,340
What is it?

485
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,540
Without explaining the reason,
all of a sudden...

486
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,940
I am asking who in
here is Gim Bung Do?

487
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,140
I am Gim Bung Do.

488
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
-Arrest him!
-Yes!

489
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,220
What's going on? How could you come
in direspectfully and arrest an official?

490
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,820
A witness testified saying that half a month ago
a dead body was found here and it is related to him.

491
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,490
His arrest is a royal order.

492
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,030
<i>-How is this possible?
-Does this make sense?</i>

493
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,420
<i>He was then stripped of his official
duties and exiled to Jeju.</i>

494
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,880
What?

495
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,850
Before, I have cherished you
because of your talents,

496
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,450
is this how you return my favor?

497
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,660
This is clearly a conspiracy!

498
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,190
Gim Bung Do is to be stripped of his official duties,
and to be interrogated by torture.

499
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,010
After being exiled, he
died because of illness.

500
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,800
What?

501
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,150
<i>During Suk Jong's reign, the Minister of
Personnel was Gim Seon Yeong's son.</i>

502
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,590
Which means when the state was in a mess,
the Western faction was in decline.

503
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,370
<i>Really...</i>

504
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,560
It'd still be fine even if we wait till the time
when Queen In Hyeon retake the throne.

505
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,170
How can they just die
before that time? Seriously...

506
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,970
If you were born in May 1667,
and died in March 1694...

507
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,510
Omo, his days were
gone at the age of 27.

508
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,580
At the age of 27?

509
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,480
Don't tell me he's
27 years old now.

510
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,290
It's March now.

511
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,620
<i>What?</i>

512
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Nothing.

513
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,560
Is it because of the incident that just ended?

514
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,900
It has been said clearly that time...

515
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,230
<i>Have a look.</i>

516
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,240
<i>My name is written here,</i>

517
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,090
<i>Gim Bung Do.</i>

518
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,780
<i>This is my name.</i>

519
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,110
<i>Year of the Gabsul, 11th day of the
3rd month, is the day today where I live.</i>

520
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,650
He said that day
was March 11th.

521
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,650
Then what day is it today?

522
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,850
Two weeks has passed so...

523
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,650
Tomorrow?

524
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,470
He's going to die tomorrow?

525
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
<i>Queen In Hyeon, please be
on standby and get ready.</i>

526
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,130
What's your name?

527
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,650
It's Yeo Jin.

528
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,140
How far is this place from the sea?

529
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,410
Walking northwards is enough.

530
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,870
I understand, you may leave.

531
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,950
You have to eat now
so I can take it back.

532
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,220
I understand. Go outside and wait.

533
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,590
Is there any news of Gim Bung Do?

534
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,310
He should be reaching Jeju shortly.

535
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,380
No matter how late, it's still a matter of today or tomorrow.

536
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,780
Wouldn't it be better if he
were to die in pain here?

537
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,390
However...

538
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:25,590
Isn't it strange that he couldn't be
found when he was being hunted?

539
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:32,800
What else is there to say when the
evidence is coming out one by one?

540
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,200
His Majesty, who cherishes him so much,
has no other alternatives but to give up.

541
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,010
That's right.

542
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:43,610
Exempting the death penalty also
shows His Majesty's loyalty.

543
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:48,150
His life cannot be preserved.

544
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:54,555
<i>Your Excellency, in a challenge, when
someone throws away their best cards,</i>

545
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:56,295
<i>what do you think the reason is?</i>

546
00:35:56,295 --> 00:35:59,095
<i>No matter how you see it,
it is the best card isn't it?</i>

547
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:03,765
<i>What better cards I have is
what you should be afraid of.
</i>

548
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:11,905
If he is a fellow who gives up that
easily he wouldn't be saying those words.

549
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:15,245
Surely there is something suspicious.

550
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:19,245
Ignore what's mysterious,
his life is about to end.

551
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:23,515
Furthermore, was he not
banished far away to Jeju?

552
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,525
What is bothering you?

553
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:28,055
Far away Jeju.

554
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:31,795
That's right, the far away Jeju.

555
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:33,105
Jeju.

556
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:39,905
The far away Jeju is
what worries me more.

557
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:42,175
What happens there,

558
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:46,855
we only get to hear the
news after 2 weeks.

559
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:53,125
He must be waiting for an opportunity.

560
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,265
Wanting to plot something quietly.

561
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:42,475
Is he awake?

562
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:43,405
I don't know.

563
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:45,275
There's no movements.

564
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:46,615
Why don't you go inside and see?

565
00:37:56,225 --> 00:37:57,825
Why do you look so shocked?

566
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:00,225
It's nothing.

567
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:13,835
There was no one to talk to,
I am asking because of boredom.

568
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:15,575
What do you think
I look like now?

569
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:17,305
Do I look healthy?

570
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:18,115
Sorry?

571
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:19,845
Yes.

572
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:23,585
Then tell me what you think.

573
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:25,985
Me being like this thinking of the
other half day that I may probably die,

574
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:27,985
what illness would be good?

575
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:30,255
Pardon?

576
00:38:30,495 --> 00:38:31,835
Should I consume poison?

577
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,705
Right, how about arsenic poison?

578
00:38:59,195 --> 00:39:00,255
Yes.

579
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,215
He knows everything.

580
00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:07,195
Even knowing that he will die today.

581
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:10,135
I thought my heart
was going to explode.

582
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:12,935
Should we just kill him directly, Hyeongnim?
(Hyeongnim - respected old brother)

583
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,275
He knows everything already.

584
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:34,295
<i>The moment I was
supposed to die,</i>

585
00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:37,765
<i>my life was preserved
because of master's talisman.</i>

586
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:41,875
<i>As I've already said, you're
experiencing something mystical.</i>

587
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:46,015
<i>But when I escape the crimes
of death, I will face death again.</i>

588
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:54,015
<i>If I use the talisman again
before dying and live again,</i>

589
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,825
<i>what will the outcome be like?</i>

590
00:39:57,355 --> 00:40:00,295
<i>Will I be able to live a
sheltered life until I'm old?</i>

591
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:02,565
<i>Or will I inevitably die? </i>

592
00:40:02,565 --> 00:40:07,625
<i>What does that mean? How is it
that you know when you will die?</i>

593
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:24,025
<i>At first I thought that it was
something incomprehensible,</i>

594
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,855
<i>and now there are just
too many questions.</i>

595
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:30,785
<i>Why did the master
give me this talisman?</i>

596
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:33,525
<i>Hoping that all things
will eventually be achieved.</i>

597
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:36,065
<i>Is it a way of comforting me
so that I will not regret dying?</i>

598
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:42,605
<i>Otherwise, is it about the existence of a better
world, allowing me to prepare for such existence?</i>

599
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:48,345
<i>Me going there and meeting that lady,
is it really accidental or inevitable?</i>

600
00:42:13,855 --> 00:42:16,555
Can you sign your
name for me?

601
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:17,351
Sure.

602
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:21,221
You look better in person.

603
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:22,721
Thank you.

604
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,401
I'm already starting to get nervous.

605
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:34,041
Should we have just gone home?

606
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:36,471
I wanted to see the premiere
together with the staff.

607
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:40,071
The waiting time is so long.

608
00:42:42,881 --> 00:42:44,341
I'm fine.

609
00:42:45,551 --> 00:42:47,811
Hey, why do you look so dispirited?

610
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:52,351
Finally, today is the premiere.
Choe Hui Jin's debut as a lead actress.

611
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,361
- Did something happened?
- Yes.

612
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:01,831
There is? What happened?

613
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:03,661
I can't say it.

614
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:04,671
Why?

615
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:07,831
If I told you, you would
say that I'm crazy.

616
00:43:07,831 --> 00:43:12,371
No, it is also possible that you'll
pull me to see a psychiatrist.

617
00:43:12,371 --> 00:43:14,051
I can't.

618
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:17,841
What is this? What is it?

619
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:19,451
I won't force you to
see a psychiatrist.

620
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,191
Say it.

621
00:43:22,951 --> 00:43:23,881
Really...

622
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:26,951
Why do you have so little trust in me?

623
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:28,951
What is it?

624
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:32,421
Choe Hui Jin...

625
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:35,231
Someone I know has died.

626
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:37,406
Who is it?

627
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,876
Why? When?

628
00:43:38,876 --> 00:43:41,016
Because he was a
criminal 300 years ago.

629
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:45,416
That is why I'm very sad.

630
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:46,126
What?

631
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:51,956
You think that I'm crazy now right?

632
00:43:53,026 --> 00:43:57,296
I'm crying because of a person who died
300 years ago. It seems ridiculous right?

633
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,506
Honestly, it is a bit ridiculous.

634
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,576
Stop crying.

635
00:44:11,046 --> 00:44:12,246
A call came in.

636
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:13,446
Who is it?

637
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:15,446
There's only a number.

638
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:16,916
064 is from where?

639
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:18,916
No idea.

640
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:20,116
Then just leave it...

641
00:44:21,586 --> 00:44:23,856
Others will think that there's
a problem with the broadcast.

642
00:44:23,856 --> 00:44:25,196
Stop crying.

643
00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:28,666
This brat is probably really dead.

644
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:34,666
What should I do? He died 3 days
ago and there's been no news since!

645
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:44,546
Hey, you can't contact a person
from 300 years ago who died 3 days ago.
What is this about?

646
00:44:44,546 --> 00:44:47,216
Are you talking about
a bible story? This...

647
00:44:47,216 --> 00:44:48,686
is it about Jesus' resurrection?

648
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,286
No matter how you put it,
I really have no luck with men.

649
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:58,956
Attracting me slightly, if he's not a
playboy then he is immortal. Really...

650
00:44:58,956 --> 00:45:00,026
What is this?

651
00:45:02,426 --> 00:45:03,166
Oh God...

652
00:45:03,626 --> 00:45:06,716
Please say something that makes sense.

653
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:12,706
Again?

654
00:45:12,706 --> 00:45:14,136
Excuse me...

655
00:45:14,836 --> 00:45:16,846
The area code 064, where is it from?

656
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:19,376
If it's 064, wouldn't that be from Jeju?

657
00:45:19,376 --> 00:45:20,656
Jeju Island?

658
00:45:21,116 --> 00:45:22,846
Do you know someone from Jeju?

659
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:24,316
Jeju Island?

660
00:45:24,316 --> 00:45:25,386
Do you want me to take it?

661
00:45:25,386 --> 00:45:27,656
If it's a travel agency...

662
00:45:27,656 --> 00:45:28,876
Give it to me.

663
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:32,456
Hello? Hello?

664
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:33,656
=Have you been well?=

665
00:45:36,326 --> 00:45:38,066
You're alive?

666
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:39,536
You didn't die?

667
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,136
How did you know I was going to die?

668
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:43,406
How can I not know?
It was written in the book.

669
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:45,136
You were supposed to die 3 days ago.

670
00:45:46,336 --> 00:45:47,936
I escaped.

671
00:45:47,936 --> 00:45:49,806
How can I just die
like that feeling wronged?

672
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:53,946
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

673
00:45:53,946 --> 00:45:56,486
While on my own, I've been
learning how to use the phone.

674
00:45:57,416 --> 00:46:00,886
=It took me 3 full days. That's how hard it was.=

675
00:46:22,526 --> 00:46:24,526
-=Next Episode Preview=-

676
00:46:24,526 --> 00:46:26,526
The criminal has escaped.

677
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:31,256
You're alive?
You didn't die?

678
00:46:31,276 --> 00:46:35,376
No, it's the first time
that I find you beautiful.

679
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:41,336
Disregarding the foam, resulting
in me wiping it. This is karma.

680
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:45,986
I have a book about
the standard language.

681
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:47,296
Good job.

682
00:46:47,316 --> 00:46:48,726
Thank you.

683
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,406
That person is not a stalker.

684
00:47:02,036 --> 00:47:04,486
He's my boyfriend.
