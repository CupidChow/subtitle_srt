1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,350
Si. Do. Tong. Rae.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,180
Gan. Pil. Gu. In.

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,110
This must be a joke.

4
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,980
Did you come as well?

5
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,720
Where were you staying?

6
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,120
Let's go.

7
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,650
-=Right Prime Minister Min Am and Officer
Gim Bung Do we're called over together.=-

8
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,620
I heard His Majesty is looking for me.

9
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,090
Yes, Your Excellency.

10
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,160
You may go inside.

11
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,290
That person came.

12
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,450
Yes.

13
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,700
That person?

14
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,300
His Majesty and Gim Bung Do are together.

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,640
What were you doing before that person
requested to see His Majesty?

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,040
Weren't you sure that he would come
to find you before entering the palace?

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,510
It was you who said you
had plans, Your Excellency.

18
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,980
How dare you actually blame me?

19
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,590
<i>Your Majesty...</i>

20
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,930
Do you know what they're talking about?

21
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,400
I only know that he holds a letter in his hands.

22
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,870
Then, are you saying this will be my last?

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,680
The Queen is very worried.

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,690
The Inner Court will not be affected.

25
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,810
Announce me.

26
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,740
Your Majesty, the Right Deputy
Prime Minister has arrived.

27
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,880
<i>Let him in.</i>

28
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,780
What are you standing there for?

29
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,630
Come in, Right Deputy Minister.

30
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,720
Bung Do, whom we have been painstakingly
trying to find, has finally come.

31
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,240
He suddenly appeared and showed me this.

32
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,650
The Minister's hometown is Yeo Heung, right?
.

33
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,580
The Minister's hometown is Yeo Heung, right?
-=Yeo Heung, the current Gyeonggi-Do capital=-

34
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,450
-=Yeo Heung, the current Gyeonggi-Do capital=-

35
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,070
That is correct.

36
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,010
Officer Bung Do went to
Yeo Heung before entering the palace.

37
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,680
Though he's responsible for
interfering with public affairs,

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,620
he still wrote such a beautiful poem.

39
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,080
Say, what should we do?

40
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,890
You should also take a look, Right Prime Minister.

41
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,090
Yes.

42
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,980
It really is a good piece of work, is it not?

43
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,450
What do you think about the description?

44
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,190
The scholar's literary talent
is well rounded, is it not?

45
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,860
It is a poem that matches his reputation.

46
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,060
It is as though my hometown is before me.

47
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,180
You are overpraising me, My Lord.

48
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,480
She's not here?

49
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,760
Yun Wol.

50
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,500
Where is she?

51
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,480
Yun Wol.

52
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,000
Is that Yun Wol?

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Yun Wol, Yun Wol.

54
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,120
Yun Wol, Yun Wol.

55
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,190
Are you all right? Are you unharmed?

56
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,290
How come you are here?

57
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,620
I don't know either.
It's my lord who told me to come here.

58
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,790
He said he'd free you.

59
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,270
In the end, between the former
queen and the servant girl,

60
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,880
you have actually chosen the servant girl.

61
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,820
I really feel sorry for the former queen.

62
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,090
For such an extremely rare opportunity,

63
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,420
just because of your personal feelings,

64
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,560
it is wasted like that.

65
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
You are really pitiful.

66
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,830
Just like now, you are to wait obediently

67
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,960
and maybe you'll be able to live on.

68
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,430
You exchanged the former queen's life
for the life of a servant girl.

69
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,370
You also used your life in exchange for hers.

70
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,180
A smile?

71
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,910
You still dare to smile?

72
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,250
Your Excellency, on a battlefield,

73
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,990
if one were to throw out a card
that everyone thought was good,

74
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,120
why would that be?

75
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,320
What?

76
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,060
Is it possible that one
has an even better card?

77
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,860
What you should be feeling afraid of

78
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,000
is the card that I have in my hand.

79
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,340
It may be hard to imagine,

80
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,210
but think over it for a bit.

81
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,400
<i>My Lord!</i>

82
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,810
Where's Yun Wol?

83
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,560
I took her back to the temple.

84
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,030
She should be fine since there
are many people looking after her.

85
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,290
Do not worry.

86
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,700
How is she?

87
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,370
She has gotten thinner,
but she is not wounded.

88
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,240
Well done.
You have to come somewhere with me.

89
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,380
Where?

90
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,750
You're saying it was Han Dong Min who
decided who'll play Queen In Hyeon?

91
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,150
No, just in case something happens,

92
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,960
as her manager, I should know about it.

93
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,560
Do I look like a wall decoration?

94
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,700
If we just listened to the main actors,

95
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,030
what would you need a director for?

96
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,370
That's not what I meant.

97
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,700
What you said is right.

98
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,900
I know that you don't mean that, Director.

99
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,840
It's just that Hui Jin is a bit worried.

100
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,380
Miss Choe Hui Jin,
does she have so little self-confidence?

101
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,780
How can we shoot the drama this way?

102
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,180
That's why I said.

103
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,050
She has been a nameless actress for too long.

104
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,120
She lost her confidence.

105
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,590
Just let her play her role.

106
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,260
No matter what the scandal,

107
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,130
if she acts well, there will be no problem.

108
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,990
Yes, of course. I understand.

109
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,400
So, I'll see you tomorrow.

110
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,470
Wait. There's no problem with
tomorrow's shooting, right?

111
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,400
Yes, yes.

112
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm very sorry to have made you worry.

113
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,270
You've worked hard, Director.
You've worked hard.

114
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,410
Really? Did the Director say so?

115
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,480
Is casting a child's game?

116
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,620
Sure, Dong Min oppa could have recommended you,
(Oppa - older brother, boyfriend)

117
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,950
but if you did not have the talent,

118
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,750
would they have chosen you?

119
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,950
Yun Na Jeong only wanted to stress
you out and exaggerated the news.

120
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,560
Just to pressure you.

121
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,920
Do you get it?

122
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,730
Then that's fine.

123
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,060
She actually dared to do something to you.

124
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,130
As if people don't know she's Lady Jang.

125
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,930
She's started doing things that
Lady Jang would do. Really...

126
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,540
I'm going to meet Yun Na Jeong's manager now.

127
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,940
I will go and teach her a lesson.

128
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,810
I feel at ease having a manager like you.

129
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,150
You figured that out now?

130
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,750
But who was that?

131
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,020
What?

132
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,150
The one who gave Yun Na Jeong a lesson.

133
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,560
They say it was a nurse.

134
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,360
=What kind of nurse bothers about this kind of thing?=

135
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,830
=He even treated the national fairy like that.=

136
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,030
Maybe he saw me being beaten helplessly

137
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,500
and pitied me.

138
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,970
There's no need to explain it to Yun Na Jeong.

139
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,170
Of course.

140
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,640
We'll cause her to faint.

141
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Let's see if she still dares
to bully you in the future.

142
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,370
That's a good idea.

143
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,780
You really have a nice manager.

144
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,110
Do you know?

145
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,050
I know.

146
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,650
Right, who would believe this?

147
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,790
I also can't believe it,
even though I saw it with my own eyes.

148
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,660
If I keep saying this,
they'll think I'm crazy.

149
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,170
But how did he disappear?

150
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,020
It's not magic.

151
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,820
Wait...

152
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,220
Last time he came out from
the place he disappeared.

153
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,090
Don't tell me he'll suddenly appear again?

154
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,490
It couldn't be...

155
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,740
I'm going crazy!

156
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
She said she'll forget it.

157
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,740
She said she absolutely won't tell it to anyone,

158
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,210
and not to make us worried.

159
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,650
Who was that person?

160
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,060
It must have been a reporter.

161
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,980
Reporter! Which reporter?

162
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,220
Don't know. She didn't say.

163
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,890
But she promised she wouldn't report this matter.

164
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,880
So, Nuna,
(Nuna - older sister)

165
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,620
don't cause any more trouble.

166
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,030
See what happened?
You let people know your weakness.

167
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,630
Luckily, Miss Hui Jin was kind
enough not to say a thing.

168
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,800
Hey, shut up.

169
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,830
Go and buy me a coffee.

170
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,320
How did things get so mysterious?

171
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,520
Moreover, who exactly is the victim here?

172
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,400
My Lord... What exactly...

173
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,530
What exactly do you want to do?

174
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,220
It should be nearby.

175
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,740
Yun Wol must be waiting for you.

176
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,080
Are you not going to see her?

177
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,610
She went through so many hardships for you.

178
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,530
Are you going to pretend that you don't know?

179
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,020
Why are you telling me this?

180
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,020
You're the one who fully devoted yourself to her.

181
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,020
Anyway, it's too late for anything now.

182
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,620
When I sent her away,

183
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,880
she didn't even glance back.

184
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,390
What devotion?

185
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,590
Feed it to the dogs!

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,930
If you were really thinking of me,

187
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,070
before she became a gisaeng,
(Gisaeng - female entertainer, prostitute)

188
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,870
you should have made her marry me.

189
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,870
I really blame you, My Lord.

190
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,100
If she doesn't like you, what can I do, you rascal?

191
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,920
I really do not know.

192
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,880
I do not know what you are thinking.

193
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,350
Now, at this time, here, wh-wh-

194
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,950
What exactly do you want to do here?

195
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,020
Yes?

196
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,940
<i>Gan. Pil. Gu. In.</i>

197
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,200
<i>The opening of time that
infallibly saves a person.</i>

198
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,480
<i>Every time I am facing a life or death
situation, time will pass. Is this what it means?</i>

199
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,410
It's always like this every time.

200
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,480
If that is the case...

201
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,900
Han Dong.

202
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,620
Take the bow and stand over there.

203
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,490
Can you see me clearly?

204
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,430
Now listen carefully to what I say.

205
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,960
- Aim at me with that bow.
- What?

206
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,430
It won't work if you don't aim precisely.

207
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,900
You must hit the target with just one arrow.

208
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,570
You must accurately aim at my heart.

209
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,910
My Lord, what are you saying right now?

210
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,240
I am having you do this because
I know what I am doing. Hurry.

211
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,560
- My Lord--
- Hurry!

212
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,840
I can't... I... I can't!

213
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,200
It's been very hard for you lately,
so you seem to be a bit confused.

214
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,540
I will not be wounded by your arrow, so do not worry.

215
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,810
I will avoid it before it hits me.

216
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,610
Avoid it before it hits you?

217
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,750
My Lord, you also know you're
tired because of lack of food.

218
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,020
I know it too.

219
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,150
But this isn't something anyone can do.

220
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,620
Don't be like this, really.

221
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,960
It will be useless if you shoot mindlessly.
Concentrate.

222
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,500
I said I can't!

223
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,120
Do I really have to kill you
to make you understand?

224
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,720
My Lord, why are you being like this?

225
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,260
If you don't want to die, pick up the bow.

226
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,270
There is no time. Hurry.

227
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,280
If you still haven't shot when I've count to three,
I'll aim at your throat this time.

228
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,480
1. 2. 3!

229
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:50,850
So this is what life after death is like.
.

230
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,910
So this is what life after death is like.
-=Life after death. When you die, you come to life.=-

231
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,200
-=Life after death. When you die, you come to life.=-

232
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,390
Choe Hui Jin.

233
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,670
Where did she go?

234
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,750
Hui Jin's not here. Go ask the nurses where she is.

235
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,150
What?

236
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,750
Hey, you said we'd come with the director.

237
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,020
I bought it for nothing.

238
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,220
Put the umbrella down.

239
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,690
Are you going somewhere?

240
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,760
It's pouring outside.

241
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,710
Hello?

242
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,520
=Hyeong, they said that Hui Jin went out with a friend.=
(Hyeong - older brother)

243
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,850
Then she'll be back soon. I got it.

244
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Should I go looking for her?

245
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,970
I got you, you rascal.

246
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,850
You... Who are you?

247
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,720
What are you doing?

248
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,790
Why were you hiding?
What were you doing?

249
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,460
You punk, are you a stalker?

250
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,930
You're really a psycho.

251
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,540
You are so dead.

252
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,670
This punk... You...

253
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,820
This...

254
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:48,620
Punk.

255
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,580
Mr. Han Dong Min.

256
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,320
Hello.

257
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,760
How exactly are you all doing
your job as a receptionist?

258
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,770
You don't even know that a psycho came in.

259
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,900
- What?
- A psycho?

260
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,100
Call the guards here.

261
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,970
He's definitely an insane stalker.

262
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,170
How can it be?

263
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,380
There's only one entrance.
No one passed by here.

264
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:12,910
What to do?

265
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,580
Yes, it's me.

266
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,250
Where are you?

267
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,320
It's not an easy thing to determine the position.

268
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,830
What is it?
Why are they in front of my room?

269
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,850
Where have you been?

270
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,170
Did something happen?

271
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,170
It's a good thing you went out.

272
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,780
There's a psycho stalker hiding in the bathroom.
You didn't know, right?

273
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,650
A major mishap almost happened.

274
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,450
A psycho stalker?

275
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,120
There are a lot of obsessed fans. Be careful.

276
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,530
What kind of obsessed fan could I have?

277
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,400
It's impossible not to notice this type of clothing.

278
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,270
I was constantly monitoring the security cameras,
but I didn't see him at all.

279
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,270
That's really strange.

280
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,140
If you want to come out, just say it.

281
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,610
Why aren't you talking?

282
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,550
I'm saying, it's not the first time
I've seen someone like you.

283
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,880
If you're not speaking,
we'll send you to the police station.

284
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,760
If you don't want to be embarrassed
in front of the whole nation, you better say it.

285
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,480
Oh, you're here.

286
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,290
You... What are you doing here?

287
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,360
Why are you here?
You're always butting into other people's business.

288
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,770
What would you have done if I wasn't here?

289
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,570
Sneaking in while you weren't here.
Waiting for an opportunity, this perverted punk.

290
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,970
You said you fainted because of some strange man.
It's him, right?

291
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,780
Now I understand it.

292
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,580
With this kind of appearance, of course you'd faint.

293
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,580
That's really...

294
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,190
I'll disinfect where you got hurt.

295
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,860
It really hurts.

296
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,460
Hey... it burns.

297
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,800
Hui Jin, I got hurt because of that guy... Look.

298
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,530
He was very brave.

299
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,940
Is that so?

300
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,010
He's not speaking. Let's call the police.

301
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,940
Even if we are going to follow the hospital policies,
we'll also have to report this matter to the police.

302
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,210
If the reporters find out,
it will be very troublesome.

303
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,550
He's not just some die hard fan. He's a pervert.

304
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,020
Look at his clothes.

305
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,690
Hui Jin is doing a historical drama,
so he is dressed like that to match her.

306
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,290
Did you see the mantle?

307
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,020
Calm down a bit. Let's ask a lawyer first.

308
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,570
Why are you going in?
Please don't go in.

309
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,970
I need to get something.

310
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,440
Then let's go together.

311
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,200
I need my underwear and that thing, so...

312
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:36,940
Well, he can't get out.
I closed the door very tightly.

313
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,050
Is that so? I'll be at ease.

314
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,120
Right.

315
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,140
Why did you come again?

316
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,880
It seems to be fate.
You always appear during embarrassing situations.

317
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,960
Embarrassing?

318
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,150
I'm the one who's embarrassed because of you.
What are you saying?

319
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,420
Did you get blamed by that violent
woman again because of me?

320
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,620
Violent woman?

321
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,360
It's not like that.

322
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,560
That's already settled.

323
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,900
That is really fortunate. I was worried.

324
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,240
But really, why do you keep
appearing in front of me?

325
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,640
This time, I came to see you.

326
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,870
Me?

327
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,370
I need your help.

328
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,110
Why do you need my help?

329
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,380
You are the only one I know in this world.

330
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,580
Also, are you not a good person?

331
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,180
You will help me.

332
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,920
Omo, whoever said I'm a good person?
(Omo - oh my)

333
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,460
This person really does whatever he wants.

334
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,730
You're talking to me even right now.

335
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,770
Isn't it the compassion that you have from
the fate that we share that causes you
to be unable to turn a blind eye to me?

336
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,740
Do you read a lot of books?
You really know how to talk.

337
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,610
Indeed, I do read a lot of books.

338
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,950
What kind of help do you need?

339
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,680
Will you help me?

340
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,880
What is it?

341
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,150
I'm looking for a book.
A chronicle.

342
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,220
Chronicle?

343
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,620
Do you mean Chronicles of the Joseon Dynasty?

344
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,760
Yes. Do you know it?

345
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,960
Of course.

346
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,900
Chronicles. That should be in the library.

347
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,760
Is it a very difficult task?

348
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,840
If it is difficult, then it is no matter.

349
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,800
Help me get that envelope.

350
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,720
What exactly is this?
It's the same the last time too.

351
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,790
It's something that allows me
to appear and then go back.

352
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,330
You use this to return to the past?

353
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,330
I came here by risking my life. It's very troublesome,
but I don't have any other choice.

354
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,470
I have to get out of this difficult situation first.

355
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,070
You came here by risking your life?

356
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,070
It's very easy to leave,
but it's not so easy to come.

357
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,960
If you head north from this hospital, there's a park.

358
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,890
Can you find that place?

359
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,900
If you can find it, I'll help you.

360
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,260
My Lord, My Lord.

361
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,190
My Lord.

362
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,070
What exactly happened?
Where did you go?

363
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,670
How can I be so fortunate?

364
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,870
What?

365
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,340
With only this, I can go across the world.

366
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,740
You can still laugh at a time like this?

367
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,350
I even wet my pants. See?

368
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,280
You did something you shouldn't have to me,
yet you can still laugh even now?

369
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,950
We will talk about this later.
Let's go first, we don't have much time.

370
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,890
What?

371
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,160
What is the place north from here?

372
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,000
<i>If you go north for about 4 kilometers from here,
you'll find the park.</i>

373
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,340
<i>Four kilometers is?</i>

374
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,200
<i>Right, the unit of measurement is not the same.</i>

375
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,410
<i>Wait a moment.</i>

376
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,810
<i>It is similar to 10 ri.
(A Korean ri is about 393 meters)</i>

377
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,750
You must go for 10 ri in the northern direction.

378
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,550
The celebrities will probably be very afraid.

379
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,890
Things like this happen a lot, right?

380
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,090
They do.

381
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,830
For Miss Hui Jin too, there have been perverts
and stalkers ever since the beginning.

382
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,030
It's also hard for them to be
celebrities if they don't have guts.

383
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,160
It really is like that.

384
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,770
Celebrities...

385
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,570
I've arrived.

386
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,900
Yes, yes. He's inside, inside. Take a look.

387
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,770
He's wearing a hanbok and-- Oh!
(Hanbok - traditional Korean clothing)

388
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,240
Where is he?

389
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,110
Omo, where did he go?

390
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,310
We were guarding outside...

391
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,630
If we're going to the north, it's in that direction.

392
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,630
Let's go.

393
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,330
- Hello?
- =What's this?=

394
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,660
I heard that a stalker appeared.
What is all this about?

395
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,330
It seems like it. I'm not very sure.

396
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,000
What? The stalker escaped?

397
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,870
Omo, what should we do?

398
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,210
Where are you?

399
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,610
=Where did you run off to at this time?=

400
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,010
It's so noisy right now.
I'm going to the cafe in front.

401
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,280
I want to rehearse my lines.

402
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,220
Yes, I'll be back early.

403
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,440
Come what? How could he possibly come?

404
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,520
Is he really a psycho stalker?

405
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,720
I've been deceived.
Why did he come to my place?

406
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,790
I'm so easily deceived.
What will you do, Choe Hui Jin?

407
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,060
I'm so worried about you.

408
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,750
I know how to open the door now.

409
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,360
The sky was clear over there,
but it is raining over here.

410
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,900
Why are you lying down?
Are you not feeling well?

411
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,310
It's so late. I thought you wouldn't come.

412
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,310
A horse is not as fast as this.

413
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,440
Also the roads are not as easy
to travel on as the ones here.

414
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,990
Where are these clothes from?

415
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,790
Whenever I am here, I become a thief.

416
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,860
If this keeps going on,
you'll really be arrested by the police.

417
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,400
Do police and constable have the same meaning?

418
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
That's right. You adapt quickly.

419
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
This is my only merit.

420
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,210
I can do this now too.

421
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,810
Now it should accelerate, right?

422
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,090
Though I didn't say it that day, I was really scared.

423
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,890
Is that so?

424
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,160
You got scared just by that?

425
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,970
How about by this much?

426
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,640
It seems you were truly scared.

427
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,910
Why did you stick your tongue out?

428
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,520
Don't you know this?

429
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,780
I'm laughing at you.

430
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,280
Where can I find information
about the Joseon Dynasty?

431
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,570
About the Joseon Dynasty?

432
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,430
Yes.

433
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,940
-=Level 3, left resource room=-
-=86 History of Joseon=-

434
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,740
86.

435
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,630
Let's go.

436
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,380
It's on the 3rd floor.
Let's use the elevator.

437
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,180
Such a big place must have a lot of books.

438
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,380
Anyone can read them, isn't that so?

439
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,920
There is more than one or two of this type of library.

440
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,590
If I could, I would really spend my lifetime here.

441
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,330
I didn't know time would pass like this.

442
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,590
You sure seem smart.

443
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,200
There are so many things to enjoy,
but you insist on spending time in a library?

444
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,270
=Please come in.=

445
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,680
It's on the 3rd floor, right?

446
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,140
How do you know Arabic numbers?

447
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,010
The last time we were
going to the 13th floor.

448
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,610
<i>Come in.</i>

449
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,220
<i>We're going to the 13th floor.</i>

450
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,350
Didn't you press the combination of these two?

451
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:00,890
Then this should be 1, this is 3
and the one in the middle is 2.

452
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,890
According to the order, the remaining
ones are 4, 5, 6, 7. Is that right?

453
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,960
You really do adapt very quickly.

454
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,830
Didn't I say that this is my only merit?

455
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,570
You must be very intelligent.

456
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,500
Were there National Civil Service Exams or something?

457
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,110
I placed first.

458
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,180
I don't like people who are good at learning.

459
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:23,710
=We have arrived on the 3rd floor.=

460
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,380
What is your occupation, Miss?

461
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,980
Didn't I say I'm an actress?

462
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,350
Actress?

463
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,320
You may not know,
but I'm a person who has gained some fame.

464
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,060
I may become even more famous in the future.

465
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
What is your reason for becoming famous?

466
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,800
Because I'm pretty.

467
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,440
First of all, you have to be pretty to be an actress.

468
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,310
What's with that expression?

469
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,810
Miss, are you considered a beauty here?

470
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,010
You're saying strange things!

471
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,080
Then, are you saying that I'm not beautiful?

472
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,420
I even won in a beauty contest.

473
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,870
Is that so?

474
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,720
"Is that so"?

475
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,230
Oh God. I'm speechless...

476
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,040
Being able to see this with
my eyes, it is remarkable.

477
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,450
What are you curious about?

478
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,180
When Joseon was destroyed, maybe?

479
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,320
Didn't you said that it was destroyed
about roughly a 100 years ago?

480
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,520
I will not investigate the history after my death.

481
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,790
That is not something that
I can bear on my own.

482
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,590
So, then?

483
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,060
I just want to know of the era that I'm
living in and the reason that I'm alive.

484
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,330
Reason for living, what is that?

485
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,070
Abolish the disposal of the Queen,

486
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:59,140
return Her Majesty to her rightful throne,
and search for my family's honor.

487
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,480
Perhaps are you now
talking about Lady Jang?

488
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,640
Jang Ok Jeong.

489
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,810
Do you know the Jang Clan?

490
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,820
Is there a person who
doesn't know Lady Jang?

491
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,680
She's the most famous woman in history.

492
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,220
Her name is mentioned in
history for such a long time?

493
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,690
What is the reason?

494
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,160
Isn't it an eventful history?

495
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,690
From a palace maid to a crowned queen.
After that, she was exiled and poisoned to death.

496
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,360
Poisoned?

497
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,900
Poisoned to death.

498
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,310
<i>Suk Jong's 20th year, 10th day of the 4th month.
-=1694, the year Gapsul Hwanguk occurred=-
(Gapsul Hwanguk - the name of the event
in which Queen In Hyeon was reinstated)</i>

499
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,320
<i>Queen Jang was demoted to the rank of hui bin.
(Hui bin - royal noble consort)</i>

500
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,650
<i>The disposal of the queen was
abolished and she was later reinstated,</i>

501
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,990
<i>following an immediate royal decree
which was carried out.</i>

502
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
<i>Drink the poison.</i>

503
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,330
<i>Suk Jong's 20th year,
8th day of the 7th month.</i>

504
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:02,000
<i>Min Am was sentenced
to death by poisoning.</i>

505
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,480
<i>Suk Jong's 27th year,
8th day of the 10th month.</i>

506
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,680
<i>Lady Jang of the Jang Clan charged
with jealousy and attempted murder
was sentenced to death by poisoning.</i>

507
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,270
I studied this recently because of the drama.

508
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,870
Queen In Hyeon was reinstated, followed by
the Southern Faction being completely removed.

509
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:39,140
Welcoming the flourishing period
of the Western Faction.

510
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,480
In other words, you are from the Western Faction.

511
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,220
I hope this is not a dream.

512
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,680
I already said that it wasn't a dream.

513
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,360
It seems all of this will happen
few months later, is that so?

514
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,430
Right now it seems completely impossible.

515
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,760
You seem to be very happy.

516
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,900
It sounds good.
Will getting a government post be easier now?

517
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,770
Is a government post important?

518
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:10,770
Over the past 5 years, for me, there has not
been even a day that my heart has been at ease.

519
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,780
What do the people here do at times like this?

520
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,450
What?

521
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,250
What do you do if you want to share
your happiness with somebody?

522
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,450
Happiness?

523
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,920
Well, something like a hug.

524
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,250
In this time?

525
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:26,790
Of course.

526
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:27,990
Even among men and women as well?

527
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,590
Why does that matter?

528
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,330
It's a very nice world.

529
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,820
At times like this if you have no one to share
your happiness with, wouldn't you feel lonely?

530
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,320
Thank you for being by my side.

531
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,860
Have I made a mistake?

532
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,730
You said it does not matter, did you not?

533
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,670
You're also a player over there, right?

534
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,470
What is a "player"?

535
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,420
Why do I feel as if I've been captivated?
This attraction is so strange.

536
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,550
It's going to be tough this way, seriously.

-=1694, Suk Jong's 20th year=-

538

<i>Year of the Gapsul, 10th day of the 3rd month.</i>

539
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,030
<i>Right Prime Minister Min Am and Officer
Gim Bung Do we're called over together.</i>

540
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,180
How long are you going
to keep looking at it?

541
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,740
I have to leave.

542
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,780
Have a look.

543
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,730
My name is written here.

544
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,300
Gim Bung Do. This is my name.

545
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:08,390
Year of the Gapsul, 10th day of the
3rd month, is the current day where I live.

546
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,590
Year of the Gapsul, 10th of the 3rd month?

547
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,000
Hey, isn't that Choe Hui Jin?

548
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,880
The model?

549
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,600
Right.

550
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,230
Yes, right. Queen In Hyeon!

551
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,470
Let's go, hurry.

552
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,700
Hurry.

553
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,290
Why were you whispering?

554
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,890
Because I'm famous.

555
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,220
Didn't you listen earlier?
I'm famous because I'm pretty.

556
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,830
I can't get captured in a photo with others.

557
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,560
Excuse me, hello.

558
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,400
Could you give us your autograph?

559
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:52,950
- Me too.
- Me too.

560
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,670
Okay.

561
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,600
I've been your fan ever since you
were a model. Can you sign, please?

562
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,040
Yes.

563
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,010
They said you were sick in the news.
Why are you here?

564
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,870
Do you really have a bad
relationship with Yun Na Jeong?

565
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,340
Sorry?

566
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,080
<i>Wow, it's Choe Hui Jin!</i>

567
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,750
- Can you sign your name?
- Can I take a photo?

568
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,090
- I'm sorry about that...
- Just one photo...

569
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,160
Wow, so pretty!

570
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,050
Could you please not take photos?

571
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
What is going on?

572
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,900
How come she's leaving?

573
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,310
I think I'm able to grasp
this situation completely.

574
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,380
I'm sorry.
It was because of the chaos out there.

575
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,450
I already said you're a player, seriously.

576
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,390
What does "player" mean, exactly?

577
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,910
I didn't know you were so famous.

578
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,610
I'm sorry causing you trouble.

579
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,780
It won't be even more troublesome
because of me, will it?

580
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:56,690
Maybe it will, if everybody knows
that I'm staying with a stalker.

581
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,170
There's no need to take me to the park.

582
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,370
I will leave by myself.

583
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,050
Are you going to disappear now?

584
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,610
Now?

585
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,180
I know where this place is.
I can figure out what to do myself now.

586
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,420
For everything, I'm really grateful.

587
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,730
Si. Do. Tong. Rae.

588
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,780
Gan. Pil.

589
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,400
What's wrong?

590
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:46,010
Well... What kind of gentleman
behaves so ungentlemanly?

591
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,820
You should bid farewell
properly before you leave, right?

592
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,690
Is there such an etiquette here?

593
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,550
Of course there is.

594
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,890
Got it? I'm only teaching you the proper etiquette.

595
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,180
Is this the greeting you use
when you leave in this world?

596
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,140
Yes.

597
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,630
With anyone and anywhere?

598
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,860
This is for you to remember.

599
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,340
Since we are here, I'll take you
to the park, so come out.

-=Next Episode Preview=-

601
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,330
Where were you?

602
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,570
This is the first time seeing you.
What's your name?

603
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,630
I will handle her.

604
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:07,280
Don't say anything.
She's very perceptive.

605
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,700
Thanks to you, I've become a Taoist.

606
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,500
A person like that,
how could he be an idiot?

607
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,990
You don't have any type of relationship with him?

608
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,910
If you don't have any type of relationship,
would you kiss in the elevator and be
caught on the security camera?

609
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,340
First of all, go and seek shelter.

610
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,480
Take Yun Wol and leave Hanyang.

611
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,080
I am Gim Bung Do.

612
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,820
Arrest him!

613
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,690
What is it?

614
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,960
A person I know has died.
