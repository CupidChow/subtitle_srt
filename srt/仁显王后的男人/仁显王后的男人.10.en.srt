1
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,086
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

2
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:25,405
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:28,370
Official Kim
from the Hongmoongwan is here.

4
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,620
<i>Send him in.</i>

5
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,100
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:52,838
Your subject, Kim Boong Do,
is here to greet you.

7
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,326
Have you been well?

8
00:00:57,277 --> 00:00:59,357
Why do you look so unwell?

9
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,534
Are you trying to show me
how much you have suffered?

10
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:05,882
Is that why you have shown up
with such poor complexion?

11
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:12,903
Your subject has not suffered at all.

12
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:15,102
Please do not worry.

13
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:19,352
Official Kim has lost his memory
due to illness, Your Majesty.

14
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:22,373
That was not a rumor?

15
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:25,332
You truly lost your memories?

16
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:27,793
I apologize.

17
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,885
However, I cannot remember the past
two months.

18
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,316
That is quite unfortunate for you.

19
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:38,093
But, it is fortunate for me.

20
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:41,515
I wondered how I would console you
once you returned.

21
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:44,403
I even considered pretending to be ill
and avoiding you.

22
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,036
It was a great source of conflict.

23
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,058
You have suffered a great deal.

24
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:56,536
While you were on the brink of death,
everything has returned to normal.

25
00:01:56,536 --> 00:02:00,277
Now, how shall I repay my debt to you?

26
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:02,585
There is no need to say such a thing,
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:07,796
So, I am considering doing some
matchmaking to repay you.

28
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:13,289
I have heard that your third daughter
is a rare beauty, Prime Minister.

29
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,186
What do you think, Minister?

30
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:19,316
I will do as you wish, Your Majesty.

31
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:23,887
- Your Majesty...
- I am doing it to repay you.

32
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:26,106
So, she must be a rare beauty.

33
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:32,079
Do not make me wrong Boong Do again.

34
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:42,306
<i>The king summoned Kim Boong Do
who had returned from exile.</i>

35
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:46,706
<i>He told him he must marry the
Prime Minister's third daughter?</i>

36
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:52,393
The Prime Minister responded that
his daughter was not a rare beauty.

37
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:58,045
She was the most beautiful
of his four daughters.

38
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:01,447
The king was very happy to hear that.

39
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:09,911
Americano or cappuccino?

40
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:10,992
Cappuccino.

41
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:15,716
Why is scene 15 taking so long?

42
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,274
We'll be waiting all day.

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,539
- What is that?
- What?

44
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,729
You're in a bad mood again.

45
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:24,748
No, I'm not.

46
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,121
You are in a bad mood.

47
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:27,810
You're picking on me again.

48
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:30,543
- What are you looking at?
- Give it back.

49
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,685
Are people making mean comments?

50
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:34,044
What is this?

51
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:37,828
Are you still looking at this?

52
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:42,444
You're done with the psychiatrist,
so why don't you stop now?

53
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:44,856
Can't I even read the chronicles
to study?

54
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,149
You're not doing it to study.

55
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:52,722
You're always searching the name
Kim Boong Do, or whatever it is.

56
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:54,612
Look at this, Kim Boong Do.

57
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:58,151
What is it? What did you find today?

58
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,216
What did this Kim Boong Do do now?

59
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:04,177
What does it say
that you look like you want to die?

60
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:08,399
Sukjong is playing matchmaker.

61
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:11,603
What?

62
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:13,862
With the Prime Minister's daughter.

63
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:16,045
A rare beauty?

64
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,067
He'll probably marry
since the king is telling him to.

65
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,581
It's treason if he doesn't.

66
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:22,560
I knew this would happen
as soon he entered the palace!

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,081
He's probably secretly excited.

68
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,014
He'd move on up if he's the
Prime Minister's son-in-law.

69
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:27,904
Hey!

70
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:32,084
I know, I know. It's all a dream.

71
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:35,550
I'm talking about my dream,
so don't send me to a psychiatrist again.

72
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,925
Anyway, I still get angry even if it's
just a dream.

73
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:41,995
Can't I get emotional over fiction?

74
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:45,057
People get emotional over TV dramas
even though they know it's not real.

75
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:46,956
That's how it is for me.

76
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:48,976
So, don't look at me like that.

77
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:52,439
Okay, well...

78
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:58,115
I know that it's not real.

79
00:04:58,115 --> 00:04:59,607
All right.

80
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:06,574
So, did Kim Boong Do marry
the Prime Minister's daughter?

81
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:10,367
It doesn't say what happened.
There's no record.

82
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:14,889
Then I guess they couldn't get married.

83
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,149
He must not have been able to forget you,
so he lived alone.

84
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:23,668
The chronicles wouldn't have records
of people's personal marriages.

85
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:27,627
How would I know if they married or not?

86
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:36,528
I told you I know it's a dream.

87
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:39,877
It really doesn't seem like you know.

88
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,470
I know. I know so very well.

89
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,776
I am a very realistic person, okay? Okay.

90
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,930
We'll be starting scene 17.
Standby.

91
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,946
Okay.

92
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,144
Hurry out.

93
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:06,396
Traitor!

94
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:20,598
Her Majesty, the queen, has arrived.

95
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,387
It has been a long time.

96
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:32,930
I heard that you had been injured.

97
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,901
I have recovered.
Please do not worry.

98
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,699
That is a relief.

99
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,680
Are they not very persistent?

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,029
How could they go all the way to Jeju
and attack you?

101
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:46,692
I sincerely congratulate you.

102
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:50,697
Seeing you here in this palace,
I feel that it was worth it.

103
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:52,928
It is all thanks to your efforts.

104
00:06:54,377 --> 00:06:58,617
I was in a faraway place,
and did not do anything.

105
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,288
I can only express my apologies.

106
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:04,997
Everyone is happy, so I feel relieved.

107
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:07,776
When I think about Lady Jang
and how she must feel

108
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:09,730
I cannot sleep peacefully.

109
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:15,137
Also, so many people
were hurt because of me.

110
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:18,879
It is the consequence for trying to
change the way things should be.

111
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,661
She has returned to her original place,
so do not fret about it.

112
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,410
This is a joyful event
for all the citizens.

113
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,230
Leave us for a moment.

114
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,920
Pardon?

115
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:35,654
Yes.

116
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:49,663
I have been waiting for you.

117
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:52,680
What can I do for you?

118
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,721
It is about that night.

119
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:58,372
I was so startled and trembling.

120
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:01,172
Even now when I think about it,
I cannot fall asleep.

121
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:04,884
I can't tell the king about it,
so I have been very nervous.

122
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:08,045
I worried that harm might come your way.

123
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,841
Have I brought up something
that I should have kept quiet?

124
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:18,298
Your Majesty, what do you mean
by what you said?

125
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:22,226
His Majesty has arrived.

126
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:25,708
It was my mistake.
I will not bring it up again.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,728
I am afraid the king may find out.

128
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,783
Your Majesty.

129
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:40,034
I did not know
you were meeting Boong Do.

130
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:42,099
What were you two discussing?

131
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,179
I heard that he was on the brink of
death, so I wished to console him.

132
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:51,076
That's why I have decided to match him
to a wife. Have you heard?

133
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:52,342
Is that so?

134
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:56,104
What do you think of a marriage to
the Prime Minister's third daughter?

135
00:08:56,104 --> 00:09:00,394
He was very proud
of how beautiful she is.

136
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,903
<i>Why are you not answering?</i>

137
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,265
Were you not planning
on getting married?

138
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,472
I...

139
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,969
am not in a rush to do so.

140
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:28,592
You are not in a rush?

141
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:31,231
If your father were alive,
would he not want this?

142
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,326
I do not think you should push,
Your Majesty.

143
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:36,225
He is still not fully recovered.

144
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,567
Is that right?

145
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,456
Was I being impatient again?

146
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,785
Today is his first day
back in the palace.

147
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:46,182
I will do as you say, my Queen.

148
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:50,312
I promised I would listen to you now,
Queen.

149
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,342
Are you looking carefully?

150
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:58,451
You won't be able to see it.
Go look inside.

151
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:00,172
You can do it. Go on in.

152
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:03,152
Hey! I already looked in there.
It's not in there.

153
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:05,363
Go out there and look.
Go outside.

154
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:08,297
You need to look thoroughly.

155
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:13,282
The talisman is so small.
It's very hard to spot.

156
00:10:17,224 --> 00:10:19,254
Have you returned, my lord?

157
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:22,307
Have you found it?

158
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:23,802
No, we have not.

159
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:27,544
We've looked everywhere, and the inner
house, but I'm sure it's not there.

160
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,034
Have you sent someone
to Hwaeomsa Temple?

161
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:33,884
Yes, but the monk will not be back
for half a month.

162
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:36,624
I better send someone to Jeju.

163
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:38,073
Pick someone to send on an errand.

164
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:41,023
All the way to Jeju?
That will take a very long time.

165
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,375
There is no other way.

166
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,842
And let me ask you one thing.

167
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,653
I know this makes no sense.

168
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,163
What makes no sense?

169
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,990
Who would go around
dressed up as Queen In Hyun?

170
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,996
What?

171
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,201
If there's anyone dressed up as
the queen, it would be Queen In Hyun.

172
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,493
What if it is not Queen In Hyun?

173
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:04,212
Huh? What do you mean it is not?

174
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:07,437
Who would dare to go around
dressed as the queen?

175
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:10,450
You could get dragged away for that.
You're asking to be killed.

176
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,750
It is not possible.

177
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:15,475
You know this already,
so why would you ask me?

178
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,461
I only asked
hoping that it would not be true.

179
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:22,542
What are you talking about?

180
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,583
Han Dong.

181
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:27,541
What have I been doing all this time?

182
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,650
- What?
- What have I been doing?

183
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,681
Have I truly lost it?

184
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:37,326
You said you had never heard this
phrase before, right?

185
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:41,047
I must have truly lost it.

186
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:45,725
My lord, you seem tired.
Would you like some honey water?

187
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:46,793
I'm fine.

188
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,075
I feel like he needs some medication.

189
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:07,250
<i>It is about that night.</i>

190
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,634
I was so startled and trembling.

191
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:12,668
<i>Even now when I think about it,
I cannot fall asleep.</i>

192
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:16,801
<i>I can't tell the king about it,
so I have been very nervous.</i>

193
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,812
<i>I worried that harm might come your way.</i>

194
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:23,392
<i>Have I brought up something
that I should have kept quiet?</i>

195
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:28,432
How could such a thing happen?

196
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,546
Hee Jin!

197
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,836
We need to empty our fridge when we
film out of the city next time.

198
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:03,956
It's all rotten.

199
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:04,961
Where are you going?

200
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:06,402
I'll go buy some groceries.

201
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:09,462
I'm tired of seaweed and rice.
We have time now, so let's cook.

202
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:10,504
What should we cook?

203
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:12,898
- Whatever you want.
- Okay.

204
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,621
It's me! It's me!

205
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,350
It's just me!

206
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:19,681
I thought it was a robber.

207
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,780
Oh, you had earphones on.

208
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,471
Gosh, I was more shocked.

209
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:29,706
When did you get here?

210
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:30,817
Now.

211
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,429
I was told to buy dinner.

212
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,528
Let's eat out here. The weather is nice.

213
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,541
Okay.

214
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:42,259
Wait.

215
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:47,909
Are you sure you got scared because you
really thought it was a robber?

216
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:53,231
I think you screamed
knowing that it was me.

217
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:55,241
- Right?
- No, I didn't.

218
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:56,831
I don't think so.

219
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:00,042
You ran away even after you saw me.

220
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:01,783
No way.

221
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:04,292
I don't think so.

222
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,979
See. Why? Are you going to run again?

223
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,822
Why would I?

224
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:10,952
You better not run.

225
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,250
Someone will see. It's wide open here.

226
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,854
People will take pictures.

227
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:30,475
Are you going to continue avoiding
my eyes? Look at me.

228
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:32,535
I am looking at you.

229
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:34,311
You're not looking.

230
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,716
I am looking... at your stomach.

231
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:37,719
What the heck.

232
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,755
What are you doing?

233
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,495
Look me in the eye.

234
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:46,456
Oh, this makes me cringe.

235
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,408
What's wrong if a couple
looks at each other?

236
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,950
What's with the hands?

237
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,182
Do you want to lose them?

238
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:10,087
What's this now?

239
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:12,657
What? Are you going
to give me a knee-kick?

240
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:14,629
Hey.

241
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,940
Is it normal to knee-kick
your boyfriend for kissing you?

242
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,427
Even you think it's funny, right?

243
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,275
It's not that...

244
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:29,339
We're finally back to normal.

245
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,466
I had to wait a month to kiss you.

246
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:37,461
Hey, you just kissed your boyfriend.

247
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:39,544
Why do you look like you just ate poison?

248
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:42,275
I do?

249
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:47,274
Should we do it once more?

250
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:50,538
This time intensely,
so that we're out of breath?

251
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,825
Ouch!

252
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:57,595
You ruined the mood.

253
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,734
What did you buy?

254
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:06,674
Wow! There's so much food.

255
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:09,458
Did you bring wine?

256
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:11,173
Cabernet Sauvignon.

257
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,571
Shiraz and Pinot Noir.

258
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:14,785
A 30 year.

259
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,507
Okay, I'll open it.

260
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:19,961
How much
is something like this in Korea?

261
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,921
You just need to drink it.

262
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,540
I need to use the bathroom.

263
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:30,765
Hurry back.

264
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:47,576
Hey. Hurry up.

265
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,730
What is it? Is something wrong?

266
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:54,561
I need to break up with him.

267
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:55,809
What!

268
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,182
This isn't right.
I can't keep dating like this.

269
00:17:58,182 --> 00:17:59,681
I'm going to break up with him.

270
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:00,972
You must be crazy.

271
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:03,708
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

272
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,813
What?

273
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:07,317
What is the matter with you?

274
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:08,842
Are you in your right mind?

275
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:11,595
You want to suddenly break up
with a guy over dinner?

276
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:16,453
Then what am I supposed to do?
I feel awkward whenever he comes near me.

277
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,451
I know in my brain
that he's my boyfriend.

278
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:22,853
I know he is, but...

279
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:29,153
I can't do it.
It's better to tell him quickly.

280
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:30,222
This isn't right.

281
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,811
Stand right there.

282
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:34,806
Stay there.

283
00:18:46,454 --> 00:18:49,382
I prepared this
because of how you've been behaving.

284
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:52,394
Before you head out, sign this.

285
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:54,265
What is this?

286
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:56,766
<i>(Termination of Contract)</i>

287
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,827
I want to quit being your manager.

288
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:01,820
I'm not kidding. I really mean it.

289
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,877
Hey.

290
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,682
I really can't do this.

291
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:08,679
I completely give up on you.

292
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:09,689
I surrender.

293
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,848
I'll just live a frugal life
while working some part-time jobs.

294
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:17,598
Making you into a star or whatever,
I give up on all of that.

295
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,833
It won't happen for you.

296
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,532
It can't happen for you.

297
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:25,230
You won't take the opportunities you get
and kick away your blessings.

298
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,818
You won't get it.

299
00:19:26,818 --> 00:19:28,720
I just realized that.

300
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,067
I give up on all of it.

301
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:33,483
Sign it now and let's part ways.

302
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:35,685
I don't want to take care
of what happens to you after.

303
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,951
Are you really going to be this way?

304
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:41,619
Did I push you into dating Han Dong Min?

305
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:43,012
Did I do that?

306
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,508
It was you.

307
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:48,343
It was you who said you could forgive
him, and decided to date him.

308
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:50,272
The rumors have spread
everywhere already.

309
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,061
Thanks to that, you've become famous.
You even got commercial deals.

310
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:56,222
You've been invited to the award
ceremony together as a couple.

311
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:58,673
Now, you want to break up?

312
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,512
Everyone would think you used him
and dumped him.

313
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:05,144
If you break up like that,
you'd have a million anti-fans.

314
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:06,757
You want me to stop them all?

315
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:09,679
I can't do it.

316
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,390
I don't have the confidence to do it,
and I don't even understand.

317
00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:16,787
I'd rather you really cheated on him.

318
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:21,369
I'll try to understand if you cheat
with a man named Kim Boong Do.

319
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:22,880
But, what is this?

320
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,365
You're going to date a man in reality
over a man in historical chronicles?

321
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:30,188
Not even just any man,
but Han Dong Min and now, of all times!

322
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,049
What is this? I told you to sign it.

323
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:43,922
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,106
So, you know to be sorry?

325
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:54,096
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:58,505
But, no matter how much
I think about it...

327
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,983
No matter how much I think about it,
it doesn't feel like a dream to me.

328
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:08,354
Everyone tells me it's a dream though.

329
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:12,493
Or they tell me I have psychological
issues.

330
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:20,010
I'll try harder.

331
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,325
Hey.

332
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:28,096
If he was a man that was really here,
why would I do this to you?

333
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:33,146
If you have a man that you like,
I would definitely be on your side, okay?

334
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,156
I know.

335
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,388
What's going on?

336
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:41,465
30 years aged.

337
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:44,082
Yes, we'll be right out.

338
00:21:53,753 --> 00:21:54,782
Hey.

339
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:58,163
You haven't seen your dress for tomorrow,
have you?

340
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,397
It's no joke.

341
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:05,041
We got offers from so many sponsors
that I had trouble choosing one.

342
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:06,970
Really?

343
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:14,201
Hey, we advanced at high-speed.

344
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,950
We only have good things for you
in the future.

345
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,321
What's the problem?

346
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:23,491
Has anything worked out this well
for you in your life before?

347
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:27,671
It's going so well that this seems
like the dream.

348
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,758
It's not a dream.

349
00:22:31,352 --> 00:22:33,011
This is reality.

350
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:37,135
Let's go!

351
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,730
Okay? Come on!

352
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:42,951
Yeah!

353
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:47,183
Harder. Yeah!

354
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:49,583
Let's go!

355
00:24:41,755 --> 00:24:44,605
<i>Who is Queen In Hyun?</i>

356
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:46,657
Did I say Queen In Hyun?

357
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,461
Queen In Hyun...

358
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:57,987
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

359
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:06,353
My lord.

360
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:12,663
How did you know to come out?

361
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:15,018
Where are you off to so late?

362
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:16,614
I am going to Hwaeomsa Temple.

363
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:18,846
I think the monk should be back now.

364
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:20,605
Is this about the talisman?

365
00:25:21,497 --> 00:25:25,739
Everything has worked out well,
so why are you looking for it?

366
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:30,118
Even if you cannot remember the past,
hasn't it worked out with no issues?

367
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:34,315
It is because I feel like the memories
are ones I cannot live without.

368
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:40,983
I feel that the talisman will take you
further from the world.

369
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:42,393
I am worried.

370
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:46,174
Since everything has worked out, I wish
you would no longer search for it.

371
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:50,737
I understand what you mean.

372
00:25:50,737 --> 00:25:52,787
However,
I'm remembering some things

373
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,836
that amount
to taking my own life if true.

374
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:57,175
So, I cannot do nothing.

375
00:25:57,752 --> 00:26:00,471
What do you mean
by taking your own life?

376
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:04,506
I am not that courageous.

377
00:26:04,506 --> 00:26:07,653
I need to confirm that I did not
break a law.

378
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:08,769
Do not worry.

379
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:13,084
You should head back in.
It is still dangerous out here.

380
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,455
It has been a long time.

381
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,161
What brings you here so late?

382
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:33,279
I heard that you had been reinstated
to your position.

383
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,199
I should have come to see you,
but I felt too shameless to do so.

384
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,823
Are you here about the talisman?

385
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:41,964
I was very curious, as well.

386
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:44,311
Did I tell you something about
the talisman?

387
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,613
Have you forgotten?

388
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:48,374
You came to see me before being exiled
to come ask me many things.

389
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:55,544
I should have come to see you earlier.

390
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:58,644
I feel much better now that I've heard
everything.

391
00:26:59,855 --> 00:27:02,394
Then, about Queen In Hyun...

392
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:03,847
Queen In Hyun, you say?

393
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:06,748
You did not mention her to me.

394
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:10,203
You did speak of a woman to me
many times.

395
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:13,260
A fairy in this dream utopia.

396
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,807
A fairy?

397
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,606
A fairy?

398
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,564
I did meet a woman.

399
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:24,419
I couldn't have possibly met a fairy.

400
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,700
It can't be.

401
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,167
If that is what a fairy looks like,
that is not utopia at all.

402
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:32,682
Did I really say such a thing?

403
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:35,203
You said that you met her several times.

404
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:39,824
You did not know if it was coincidence
or fate.

405
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:42,538
However, you have lost your talisman.

406
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:46,080
Will you be unable to go to that
utopia now?

407
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,489
I was hoping to follow you and
take a look.

408
00:27:49,912 --> 00:27:52,840
I was curious about this fairy
that does not look like a fairy.

409
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:02,617
Teacher.

410
00:28:03,903 --> 00:28:06,042
Forgive me.

411
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,397
What do you mean?

412
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:39,019
How could this happen?
Who are they?

413
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,388
I apologize. It seems they followed me.

414
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,334
Who is your master?

415
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:50,332
He said you must die to live.

416
00:28:50,332 --> 00:28:53,182
That's the way to disappear.

417
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:56,476
You must die to live.

418
00:28:57,457 --> 00:28:59,586
That is the way you explained it to me.

419
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:02,076
You lived because you died.

420
00:29:03,387 --> 00:29:04,977
You live because you died.

421
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,349
That is what you said.

422
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:11,157
So, dying to live is the way.

423
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:13,679
Die to live...

424
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,263
Are you sure about that?

425
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:29,141
I am sure about it.
I heard it with my own ears.

426
00:29:48,968 --> 00:29:50,854
It was not true.

427
00:29:51,775 --> 00:29:54,494
I told you not to make reports
you cannot be sure about.

428
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:02,155
Which one of you is Ja Soo?

429
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:13,221
Look who it is.

430
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,281
I wondered who it was.
You are a very bold fellow.

431
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:22,213
The world has changed now.

432
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,173
You are fearless to be in the city.

433
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:26,846
You must know
the royal guards are after you.

434
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:31,040
I am only here
because I have work left to do.

435
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,909
Work?

436
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:35,585
You serve someone
who was plotting treason.

437
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,215
Is your work to kill me?

438
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:40,965
What purpose would it serve to kill me?

439
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:47,038
If my goal was to kill you,
I would've done so in Jeju.

440
00:30:58,646 --> 00:31:01,275
Aren't you looking for this?

441
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:06,344
You created a plot of treason and
got Minister Min arrested with this.

442
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,219
Now, you do not even remember
how you did it.

443
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:11,682
You could not find it.

444
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:15,467
You never imagined
that I would have this.

445
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,928
How did you get your hands on it?

446
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:21,343
Pity... the owner of the talisman
is in this state.

447
00:31:21,343 --> 00:31:23,517
I can't find out anything
by threatening you.

448
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:26,792
I wanted to find out
any information that you had.

449
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:29,171
I want to know
how to activate this magical power.

450
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:32,797
The moment you figure it out,
I want to know.

451
00:31:34,982 --> 00:31:37,576
I didn't think a monk in the mountains
had any connection.

452
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:41,249
So, did you find out anything from
that monk?

453
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:44,396
Have you heard of,
"you must die to live"?

454
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:52,902
I have tested it out already,
and it is complete nonsense.

455
00:31:52,902 --> 00:31:57,757
Either you lied to the monk,
or the monk lied to you.

456
00:31:58,263 --> 00:32:00,285
Either way,
dying to live is not the way.

457
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,913
No, that's not it...

458
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,849
There is something I did not hear.

459
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,720
I will end up hearing it anyway.

460
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:23,138
Even if you kill him,
you will be left.

461
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:25,766
Even if you die, the monk will be left.

462
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,077
You have just returned.
You don't want to die, do you?

463
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:34,212
I do not want to kill a government
official and alert the palace.

464
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:37,977
Tell me what you have heard
and go home quietly.

465
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:39,531
That would be best for us both.

466
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,440
<i>Queen In Hyun... Queen In Hyun.</i>

467
00:32:49,882 --> 00:32:53,630
<i>Is it something worth risking my
life to find out?</i>

468
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,784
You said there was a woman
you owed for saving you.

469
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:58,726
You said that you met her several times.

470
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,695
It is about that night.

471
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:08,576
<i>Worth risking my life to confirm.</i>

472
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:10,590
If you do not tell me now...

473
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:15,075
I will kill you and go after the monk.

474
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:18,708
Have it your way then.
I don't care who I hear it from.

475
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:29,023
It is...

476
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,174
It is?

477
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:38,259
From what I heard,
to use that talisman...

478
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,768
you must read the characters first.

479
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:45,227
Read?

480
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:47,404
The eight characters here?

481
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,248
No! You can't!

482
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:16,211
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

483
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:28,998
You must die to live is right.

484
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:32,240
He chose to die on purpose.

485
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,333
What are you talking about?
Before, it did not...

486
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:39,706
If what you say is true, whoever has
that talisman can be immortal.

487
00:34:40,255 --> 00:34:42,076
Then it is a very dangerous item.

488
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:44,166
However, the talisman
is like a loyal dog.

489
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,425
A loyal dog?

490
00:34:45,425 --> 00:34:47,460
It will not work for anyone except
its owner.

491
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,271
It was given to you by Yoon Wol,
was it not?

492
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:53,159
It is of no use when held by others.

493
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:36,215
Queen In Hyun.

494
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,795
<i>It meant he must die in order to live.</i>

495
00:36:39,795 --> 00:36:43,476
It is a useless talisman until he dies.

496
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:56,458
If only he can use the talisman,
then we must get rid of it.

497
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,838
They headed in this direction,
so they should be in this area.

498
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,077
Get out of here.

499
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:20,351
I heard that you're
presenting with Han Dong Min.

500
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:21,967
Ah, yes.

501
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:24,648
Are you officially announcing
that you're a couple?

502
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:27,898
Oh, I guess you are.

503
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:31,463
No, the organizers requested it.

504
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:33,083
That was not the intent at all.

505
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:36,085
I'm sure the organizers did it
with that in mind though.

506
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:37,403
There's Jang Heebin too.

507
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:39,443
So, why would it have to be you two
as a couple?

508
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:44,614
Anyway, I like it.
I'm a supporter of you two.

509
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,885
Oh! What a relief.

510
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:50,032
Did you hem it?

511
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:52,489
It'll fit perfectly. Don't worry.

512
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:55,516
Okay. Close your eyes for a second.

513
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:01,900
Isn't that your phone?

514
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,791
It's probably my mom.
Can you pick up for me?

515
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:06,922
It's not your mom.

516
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,771
Hello?

517
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:13,592
Yes, this is Choi Hee Jin's phone.
She's unable to...

518
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:16,903
What?

519
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:20,041
Yes, I'm her friend Jo Soo Kyung.
Who is this?

520
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:22,750
What?

521
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,795
Who is it?

522
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:26,460
It's just work stuff.

523
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:34,034
Hello.

524
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:36,684
Who did you say this was?

525
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:40,525
Kim Boong Do?

526
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:43,967
It's been a long time.

527
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,197
I think I heard wrong.

528
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:47,585
Who is this?

529
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:51,699
Kim Boong Do...

530
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:16,215
What... what is this?

531
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:17,887
What is this, Kim Boong Do?

532
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:20,268
Oh!

533
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,467
Hello?

534
00:39:33,657 --> 00:39:34,670
Yes.

535
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:39,074
But... is this really Kim Boong Do?

536
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:45,012
No, I don't really know you.

537
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:46,893
Where are you calling from right now?

538
00:39:48,494 --> 00:39:49,684
The park?

539
00:39:53,414 --> 00:39:57,695
By any chance, is it the park you
promised to meet Hee Jin at?

540
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,414
Hold on.

541
00:40:18,592 --> 00:40:19,764
Excuse me...

542
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:25,869
Hee Jin is unable to come to the phone
right now.

543
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:31,387
I will tell her to call you back
right away.

544
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:33,548
Yes, right away.

545
00:41:00,206 --> 00:41:01,335
What is this?

546
00:41:03,092 --> 00:41:04,454
He's from a dream.

547
00:41:04,454 --> 00:41:06,617
Why would Kim Boong Do from her
dream show up?

548
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:10,711
Is the guy Hee Jin talked about real?

549
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:14,762
Then it wasn't a dream.

550
00:41:14,762 --> 00:41:16,447
So, it wasn't a dream?

551
00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:22,315
But... this just doesn't make any sense.

552
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:27,615
Should I tell her? Huh?

553
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:29,898
She's finally back to normal.
I shouldn't tell her.

554
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:32,686
Gosh! What am I supposed to do?

555
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,398
I'm going to go crazy.

556
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,668
Hee Jin. Hold on.

557
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:48,425
Why did the call take so long?

558
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:56,443
Don't pick up if you see that number.

559
00:41:56,443 --> 00:41:58,666
- Why?
- They want you to model nude.

560
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,690
What?

561
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,239
They're total losers.

562
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:04,643
Don't you ever pick up.

563
00:42:04,643 --> 00:42:07,331
What the heck. Okay.

564
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:08,847
What nudes?

565
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:14,655
Why are you looking at me like that?

566
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,355
Huh? What?

567
00:42:16,355 --> 00:42:20,144
Why are you looking at me like... this?

568
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,751
Hey, I was trying out my impression
of Lee Kyung Kyu.

569
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:25,963
How is it? Do I look like him?

570
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:31,490
I'm so thirsty.

571
00:43:08,012 --> 00:43:10,739
<i>I'm Queen In Hyun.</i>

572
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:21,811
<i>You're a playboy over there too,
aren't you?</i>

573
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:43,652
It's that number again.

574
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:45,425
Don't pick up.

575
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:47,672
What's with them and nudes?

576
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:50,335
Get in, get in. Hurry.

577
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:23,594
Dong Min is on this side.
You better slide over.

578
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,105
Okay.

579
00:44:28,855 --> 00:44:31,016
Give me your phone now.
I'll hold onto it.

580
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:32,016
Why?

581
00:44:32,016 --> 00:44:34,454
It's live and I don't trust you.
You might make a mistake.

582
00:44:36,014 --> 00:44:39,204
Hey, do you really think I'd pick up
the phone during a live show?

583
00:44:39,204 --> 00:44:41,855
Yes, you would totally do that.

584
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,724
I was texting someone.

585
00:44:49,704 --> 00:44:52,094
I think it's drawn on too thick.

586
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:55,949
You look pretty to me.

587
00:45:02,815 --> 00:45:06,755
Wow! Unbelievable.

588
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:08,905
You look good today, Choi Hee Jin.

589
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:11,730
The car is wide.
Why are you stuck to me?

590
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,253
Hey. How about we announce that we're
a couple at the ceremony today?

591
00:45:16,253 --> 00:45:17,322
What?

592
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:20,681
We can't come all the way here
just to present an award.

593
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:23,293
I hate being a sideshow to the winners.

594
00:45:25,043 --> 00:45:27,313
You're kidding, right?

595
00:45:27,313 --> 00:45:28,389
No, I'm not.

596
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:31,583
You're really doing it?

597
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:33,893
Don't do it. Just follow the script.

598
00:45:34,893 --> 00:45:36,804
We're going to get going now.

599
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:42,438
Seriously, don't do it.
You'll ruin the live show.

600
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:45,248
Hey, I'm the prince of ad-libs.

601
00:45:45,248 --> 00:45:46,568
Why would I ruin it?

602
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:49,347
I would liven up the dreary mood.

603
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:51,969
I'm serious. Don't do it.

604
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:55,007
You'll be at the top of all the internet
search lists when it's over.

605
00:46:08,568 --> 00:46:10,844
Oh, there's a lot of people.

606
00:46:10,844 --> 00:46:13,240
Don't do it. I really, really mean it.

607
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,351
I'll see.

608
00:46:23,315 --> 00:46:26,007
<i>Yes, Han Dong Min has arrived.</i>

609
00:46:26,007 --> 00:46:28,079
<i>His partner is...</i>

610
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:35,358
<i>Ah, it is his partner in his drama.
Choi Hee Jin has arrived with him.</i>

611
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,164
<i>Wow! Sukjong and Queen In Hyun.</i>

612
00:46:38,164 --> 00:46:40,579
<i>It's a king and queen's arrival.</i>

613
00:47:59,762 --> 00:48:02,195
<i>We must be destined to fight whenever
we meet.</i>

614
00:48:05,224 --> 00:48:08,447
<i>I want to be clear about this.
I didn't mean to startle you.</i>

615
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,789
<i>Do I seem like a crazy woman?</i>

616
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:11,804
<i>Yes.</i>

617
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:13,623
<i>You saw everything already
and now you leave?</i>

618
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:16,208
<i>I saw everything already,
so that's why I'm leaving.</i>

619
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:20,411
<i>You're unexpectedly very childish.
Do you know that?</i>

620
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:22,947
<i>I only pressed it to see what it does.</i>

621
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:27,222
<i>Can I take responsibility for you?</i>
