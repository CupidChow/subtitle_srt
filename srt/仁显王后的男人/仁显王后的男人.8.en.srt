1
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,050
What is this, really?

2
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,180
I was debating on how to return your favor.

3
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,520
I heard that I could help.

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,190
So I came.

5
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,590
Your friend told me to
play the role of a good lover.

6
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,660
I do not really know what to do,

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,400
but I will still try my best.

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,810
Where did you learn this?

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,880
This pure innocence comes out a
hundred times in comic scenes.

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,490
Surprise, and you appear out of nowhere!
It's really so corny.

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,030
What does 'corny' mean?

12
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,800
Are you scolding me again?

13
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,570
It's a compliment.

14
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,370
If you want to succeed in
the role of my lover,

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,770
then just continue the corny stuff.

16
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,780
I totally like anything corny.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,360
Where are you going? Hey,
you have to get changed first!

18
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,900
We don't have much time.

19
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,400
Come over in 5 minutes.

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,880
Did the reconciliation go
well, Your Majesty?

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,750
Hey, buy me a drink once we finish.

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Buy you what?

23
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,360
I'm speechless. You lose face somewhere
and you come to me for comfort?

24
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,890
Two people are in a relationship,

25
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,360
and they left you out?

26
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,560
Don't go straight home, understand?

27
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,370
Ah, Mr. Han Dong Min, is yesterday's matter settled?

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,110
Yes, Director. Please do not worry.

29
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,310
That's right, Director...

30
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,580
I have an extremely good idea.

31
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,920
How about poisoning Queen In Hyeon to death?

32
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,120
I think it would be completely amazing!

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,930
It was not me who proposed it,
Director. Please do not misunderstand.

34
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,600
It is my idea. What do you think?

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,530
Why kill Queen In Hyeon?

36
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,470
Because I'm sick and tired of her.

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,540
Sick and tired, wanting to kill your ex-wife...

38
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,870
That's a psycho, not a king.

39
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,410
But Suk Jong is a psycho, right?

40
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,810
How many times has he changed his mind
about his two wives?

41
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,480
He dumps one, and lives well with the other.

42
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,080
The ex-wife kills the new wife, do you think this is right?

43
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,690
Director! Director!

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,030
Hey, you're not allowed to go home straight.
You must certainly treat me!

45
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,770
I'm sorry. Sorry I'm  late.

46
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,230
I heard things were talked through.

47
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,000
What? Ah, yes.

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,140
Sorry for worrying everyone.

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Why isn't she picking up?

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,790
After tricking people like that,
where did you go?

51
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,800
This... Please take this.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,940
What is it?

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,000
You know Pak Jun Ho sunbae who is playing
Jang Hui Jae was taken to the hospital, right?

54
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,870
So the script was changed.

55
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,540
This came from the writers today.

56
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,670
Can't he be discharged soon?

57
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,340
No, it could even take a month.

58
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,880
What's going to happen now?

59
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,760
Why are there so many changes?

60
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,030
Mr. Director, I have to ask you
about the script.

61
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,170
What about it?

62
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,950
It's not only that Jang Hui Jae's
scenes have been cut down,

63
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,430
my scenes have changed a lot, too.

64
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,330
I would like to know why there
were so many changes.

65
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,770
What was changed?

66
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,440
The latter part of Gabsul Hwanguk...

67
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,840
Wasn't it changed once already?

68
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,240
Originally Min Am bribed
someone called Ha Min Hwan,

69
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,110
in order to betray Suk Jong.
But Suk Jong found out.

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,190
Ha Min Hwan?

71
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,260
Who is Ha Min Hwan?

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,060
Sorry?

73
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,820
The Gabsul Hanguk was originally
about Min Am's henchmen,

74
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,780
who betrayed him by passing
his letter to the king.

75
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,450
No, it's not like that.

76
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,310
No?

77
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,400
Was there a change? Anything strange?

78
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,010
No. Only Jang Hui Jae's
parts were modified.

79
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,940
I'm really sure about this.

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,100
Because I was interested...

81
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,050
I memorized it.

82
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,020
Maybe you were mistaken?

83
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,950
No, the script is weird...

84
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,830
<i>What do you want to do in Seoul?</i>

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
<i>I need to conclude some things
with the Right Prime Minister.</i>

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,040
<i>Right Prime Minister? Min Am?
What conclusion?</i>

87
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:32,570
What?

88
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,910
Ah, it's nothing. I must have been confused.

89
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,650
I'm very sorry...
Everyone, please enjoy your meal!

90
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,460
1694, year of Gabsul on the night
of the 27th of the 3rd month.

91
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,670
Min Am's henchmen took advantage
of the dark and entered the palace.

92
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,000
And passed Min Am's letter
to Suk Jong by shooting an arrow.

93
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,610
The letter revealed a conspiracy plotted
by Min Am with Jang Hui Jae,

94
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,140
The plan was to stop Queen In Hyeon's
reinstatement by assassinating her.

95
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,210
That night, Suk Jong sent the
Palace Guards to investigate.

96
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,750
The assassins attacking the Queen's
residence were killed.

97
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,220
Queen In Hyeon was saved.

98
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,290
It's unbelievable, how could...

99
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,630
In the morning, Suk Jong gave out an order.

100
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,630
Min Am, as well as the
Prime Minister, Gwon Dae Un,

101
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,570
and Left Prime Minister, Mun Na Seon,
were all exiled.

102
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,910
Results of investigations showed that at the event
that happened in the Office of Special Advisers,

103
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,850
was also conspired by Min Am.

104
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,390
Gim Bung Do and his family were relieved
of his banishment and regained his official status.

105
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,390
Aigoo... You're studying very seriously.

106
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,660
Yes, when I, too, was a new actor,

107
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,930
I read history books for films like this.

108
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,070
And when it was a hospital drama,
I read books about medicine.

109
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,070
But, after a few years...

110
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,010
What's the use? All you need to do is
to memorize your lines.

111
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,950
Thank you very much, sir.

112
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,810
Hello?

113
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,750
Where are you?

114
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,690
The cafe. You have been calling a lot.

115
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,360
What exactly are you two doing?

116
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,030
We have things to talk about,
you just work hard at your drama.

117
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,590
Talk about what? Isn't
it enough that he came?

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,410
What else is there to discuss?

119
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,830
Never mind. Just work hard out there.

120
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,830
Get him on the phone.

121
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,090
Why?

122
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,440
You really don't listen, do you?

123
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,970
I am your employer.

124
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,660
Rotten girl.

125
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,780
Really frustrating...

126
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,860
Hello? What are you doing over there?
Say you're busy and leave.

127
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,400
She's going to say weird things again.

128
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,530
I don't mind.

129
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,330
I feel like in a swamp here.

130
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,300
Swamped by people who love to meddle
in other people's businesses.

131
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,330
I'm here because I need your friend.

132
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,970
Why do you need her?

133
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,540
It's a secret.

134
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,440
What? A secret?

135
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,810
Let's meet later.

136
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,990
Hold on, hold on.

137
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,210
I just checked.

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,940
They changed the script.
The part dealing with the Gabsul.

139
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,760
You saw it?

140
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,700
Was it really you?

141
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,890
The unknown person who
shot the arrow with the letter...

142
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,180
That person and me, it's our secret.

143
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,890
I must save my own life,

144
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,430
but if I change the fate of others,

145
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,200
I worry about what will happen next.

146
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,040
So with the exception of myself,

147
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,110
I try not to change the fate of others as
much as possible.

148
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,560
But now that things are
settled I feel relieved.

149
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,210
It feels like man proposes, and God disposes.

150
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,210
-=Man plans but the success of it depends on God.=-

151
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,450
Isn't it so?

152
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,240
Ah, maybe you don't understand.

153
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,780
It means...

154
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,530
Are you making fun of me now?

155
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,070
What about you, obviously you don't
understand when I'm reproaching you.

156
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,630
I never made fun of you.

157
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,320
I just reproached myself.

158
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,570
But...

159
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,980
The change of history...

160
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,680
No one realizes there was a change, you know?

161
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,740
I seem the only one to know

162
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,200
what the Gabsul incident originally was like.

163
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,960
Correct. I think only the two of us know.

164
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,170
Why don't other people know?

165
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,060
I'm not quite sure, either.

166
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,850
Let's talk about it later.

167
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,130
How can you say such a thing?

168
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,710
Miss Choe Hui Jin, I'm sorry I'm late.

169
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,450
OK.

170
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,850
First of all, I would like to thank you.

171
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,190
But what needs to be asked
must be asked, right?

172
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,980
The reporters are asking,
and I have no idea about things.

173
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,200
I can't say anything.

174
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,260
There is a lot that I need to understand.

175
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,730
Exactly why don't you have a cell phone?

176
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,140
Because I have no use for one.

177
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,210
But why do you have no use for one?

178
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,240
Is there no way to call you?

179
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,480
Basically, there's no way.

180
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,180
Why?

181
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,070
I know very few people over here.

182
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,070
Apart from lady... No,
apart from Choe Hui Jin.

183
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,490
Didn't you say you live in Bukchon?

184
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,220
Why wouldn't you know anyone in Seoul?

185
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,290
I'm rarely at home.

186
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,850
Don't you live here?

187
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,560
No, I don't live here.

188
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,960
Then where do you live? Overseas?

189
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,630
Weren't you supposed to study at a university?
What about classes?

190
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,860
Sorry, I don't have much time.
Can I ask you a question as well?

191
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,660
What about?

192
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,630
What does Miss Choe Hui Jin
need the most right now?

193
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,030
Need the most? Why do you ask?

194
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,390
I want to give it to her.

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,320
You want to give her a present?

196
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,660
Hui Jin... She was so happy
that you were able to come here.

197
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,890
Do you realize how little self-respect she has?

198
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,100
It's not about self-respect,

199
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,070
She just has a kind heart.

200
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,400
Just having a meal together can't
count as returning a favor.

201
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,980
So you know that, at least.

202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,190
So what should I get her?
Please?

203
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,600
First of all, what's your budget?.

204
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,290
My budget?

205
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,020
What she needs is not just one or two little things.

206
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,160
And the prices are a lot.

207
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,520
So first... How much are you willing to spend?

208
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,980
Then, I might have some ideas.

209
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,850
Rather than that, what does she need the most?

210
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,500
What she needs most, is extremely expensive.

211
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,210
Never mind the price.

212
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,460
Why the pretense?

213
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,800
How can you not mind, when you're a student?

214
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,370
What Hui Jin needs now is extremely, extremely expensive,

215
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,080
I'm saying this out of concern for  you.

216
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,190
Would this be enough?

217
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,220
I already told you just a few
hundred thousand won't...

218
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,270
Are these 1-million-won checks?

219
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,390
I was told one can buy a lot with this.

220
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,730
Can't one?

221
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,340
No it's not that...
Why this big sum of money?

222
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,580
You don't even put it in a wallet?

223
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,500
You just casually...

224
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,550
Wallet?

225
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,600
I was too busy to get one.

226
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,690
I have another question.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,440
What does 'corny' mean?

228
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,910
Corny, you say?

229
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,250
What could I do that Choe Hui Jin
would regard as 'corny'?

230
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,330
A,strange question, right?

231
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,090
But I'm not joking.

232
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,780
I'm asking you quite seriously.

233
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,760
I am wondering what Choe Hui Jin needs the most,

234
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Also, I would like to do something 'corny' for her.

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,370
I hope you can advise me.

236
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,730
So night can turn into day, just like that.

237
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,970
I don't know what's what, anymore.

238
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,550
I heard all his properties are gone.

239
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,940
That's the Right Prime Minister, isn't it?

240
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,020
<i>He must've thought that his offspring
would be able to enjoy his wealth.</i>

241
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,280
Sir,

242
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,000
forgive me I was not
able to gather close.

243
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,320
Investigate all of Gim Bung Do's
past whereabouts.

244
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,900
Did you say Gim Bung Do?

245
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,440
That fellow planned all this.

246
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,240
He entered my room and then disappeared like smoke in the air.

247
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,690
Pardon?

248
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,280
I'm not mistaken.

249
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,860
Find out what trick he used, no matter what.

250
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,080
If I die, I must certainly
have that fellow die, too.

251
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:49,400
I'm afraid to say this, but
Her Majesty the Queen

252
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,810
has personally sewn
His Majesty the King's clothes and bedding.

253
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,670
Isn't that the work of the palace ladies?

254
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,800
It was because I wanted to do it personally, madam.

255
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,540
So, please do not accuse her.

256
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,470
You can't be like this, my dear Queen.
Didn't I tell you before?

257
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,460
Please forgive me, madam.

258
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,090
Okay.

259
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,800
Please, kindly wait a moment.
Just a moment.

260
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,360
<i>Su Yeong, bring the apple juice over.</i>

261
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,910
Yes.

262
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,390
Excuse me, may I know what time it is?

263
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,170
I'ts 9:30pm.

264
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,320
Where did those two go?
What are they doing?

265
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,360
All right, we're done here.

266
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,170
Let's change location and shoot Scene 18.

267
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,730
Come on!

268
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,350
Just now, what were you trying to say?

269
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,050
This... this...

270
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,630
What do you mean?

271
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,440
This is how I feel after spending
a whole day with Gim Bung Do.

272
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,570
Don't know what word to use
to describe it.

273
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,450
So I mimed it.

274
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,630
How can an actor not
understand what I mean?

275
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,310
What?

276
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,890
A manager like me dealing
with problems like this,

277
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,210
I don't know how to express it.

278
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,620
I don't know whether it's
a good thing, or something that I envy,

279
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,140
or something that worries me.

280
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,720
To stop you or to encourage you...

281
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,110
Get going. Your boyfriend is waiting for you.

282
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,270
He came here?

283
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,990
Where is he?

284
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,550
First, insert.

285
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,150
Second, press button.

286
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,190
Third, change gear.

287
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,080
Fourth, step on.

288
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Fifth, stop.

289
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,910
Sixth, open.

290
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,810
What... are you driving? Are you crazy?

291
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,460
Seventh, change.

292
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,990
Eighth, press down.

293
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,030
Where did the car come from and how come
you're driving? Do you want to die?

294
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,330
Ninth, take out.

295
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,680
Tenth, hand over.

296
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,830
Please take it, as a
reward for saving my life.

297
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,630
Isn't this car something you have
wanted all your life?

298
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,170
I heard that you had to sell your previous car
to get money for living expenses.

299
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,640
I used shorthand methods to learn driving. It's
much easier than riding a horse.

300
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,120
If you have time, why don't you give it a try?

301
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,720
Why are you being like this?

302
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,060
Why do you always do things like this,
like straight out of a manhwa?

303
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,210
Your friend said that if I did
something this corny, you would love it.

304
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
But you don't?

305
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,890
What are you saying? All this cheesiness
is giving me a cold sweat.

306
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,820
Then, it's a success.

307
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,920
You stole this, didn't you? Completely crazy...

308
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,720
How could I? I'm not a thief.

309
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,790
Not a thief? You steal clothes everyday.

310
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,130
With clothes, I have no choice.

311
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:28,940
I really wanted to give you something more.
But this was far more expensive than I thought.

312
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,540
This took all the money I had.

313
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,010
Where did you get the money from?

314
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,880
I sold my father's relic.

315
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,430
<i>This... This belonged to our great ancestor,
Yi Seong Gye..</i>

316
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:58,700
<i>That's right. It was bestowed through many generations.</i>

317
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,440
<i>But how did you manage to keep a
sword from the Joseon era so well?</i>

318
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,980
<i>It was well-protected.
What is it worth?</i>

319
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:15,920
I do feel deceived somehow. This relic
from the Joseon era is very valuable.

320
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,050
But then I bought this car
and the money is gone now.

321
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,060
Whether it's now or then,
the merchants have their tricks.

322
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,530
You sold your father's relic
just to give this to me?

323
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,460
Yes, I did.

324
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,670
Are you really giving it to me?

325
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,870
Well, I can't take it with me, either.

326
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,810
According to my understanding, you
are not normally a hesitant person.

327
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,550
What?

328
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,290
Then what kind of person am I?
According to your understanding?

329
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,620
Someone shameless, but charming.

330
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,160
Ah, but you don't understand what 'shameless' means.

331
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,030
Arrogant and stubborn, right?

332
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,830
I know 'shameless'. Who wouldn't know?
Do you think I'm that ignorant?

333
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,240
Are you insulting me or what?

334
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,710
So... Arrogant, stubborn and charming?

335
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,510
I sincerely think that you are charming.

336
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,520
If I die, then so does my family line.

337
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,050
if my father was still alive, there is no doubt
that he would repay your kindness as well.

338
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,720
You must know that a gratitude
heart is far greater than this.

339
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:39,200
Well, since you've already agreed that I'm shameless
and very charming, it's settled.

340
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,540
Why? Am I too thick-faced
to be charming?

341
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,340
Yes.

342
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,810
Can I really get in?

343
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,680
As you please, Owner.

344
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,230
Wait!

345
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,190
The skirt's too long.

346
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,710
You're acting as the Queen,
so I'll give you a bit of advice...

347
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:27,650
No matter what kind of palaquin the Queen sits in,
she never loses her manners.

348
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:33,790
I'm like this because I'm hasty. You think
Queen In Hyeon is any different?

349
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,740
The engine sounds great.

350
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,210
Since you're filming, don't go out.
That's what your friend said.

351
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,880
I'll just take a spin here.
Don't worry.

352
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,220
Don't feel proud just because
you drove from there to here.

353
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,350
That's not regarded as driving.

354
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,150
This is what we call driving.

355
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,540
Do you like it?

356
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,710
Why? Is there a problem?

357
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,580
Now you're scamming me, aren't you?

358
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,320
Since the beginning, you planned to
approach me and then scam me, right?

359
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,520
You're a con artist.  You deceive people.
Right?

360
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,860
All this talk about a time machine
or something like that.

361
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,930
No, maybe the lies started out as a joke.

362
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,130
But the lies got bigger and bigger,

363
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,740
until they got way out of hand.

364
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,670
Initially you were after money,
but suddenly you became my boyfriend.

365
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,750
So you thought you'd give me this car and
then leave, is that your plan?

366
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,080
Be honest, you're a swindler, aren't you?

367
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,150
Oh God, how could there be a time machine?

368
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,090
I'm too naive. That's
why I'm so easily deceived.

369
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,290
I don't know how you could change
the information on the internet,

370
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,830
but it's still deceiving. A lie, isn't it?

371
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,570
What would you do, if everything was a lie?

372
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,040
Would you hand me to the police?

373
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,130
Of course I would hand you to the police, then,
after you had served your sentence...

374
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,720
you would really go out with me.

375
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,800
How I wish that you were scamming me.

376
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,340
Think about it, it's not easy
to meet someone you like.

377
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,080
Even if you don't understand why,
you are able to really communicate.

378
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,550
Even if the other  person is a swindler
who deserves to die,

379
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:32,290
it is still better than someone from another era altogether.

380
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,030
You're a swindler, aren't you? A real pro.

381
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,770
Everything was a lie, right?

382
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,450
Yes, a lie.

383
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,050
Liar.

384
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,930
Get in.

385
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,480
Don't you have to hurry inside?

386
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,350
I'll explain another use of a car.

387
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:37,020
A car's main use is transportation.
But that's not the only use.

388
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,630
Look carefully.

389
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,310
Get my point?

390
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:09,990
That's right.
A car sometimes is for this kind of use.

391
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,790
Remember it.

392
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Really... I knew it, you must've
fallen for my charming kiss.

393
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:29,110
<i>{\a6} I've imagined and missed you,
the you who is in my dreams. ~</i>

394
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:36,350
<i>{\a6}~ Keeping a lovely secret like you. ~</i>

395
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:42,670
<i>{\a6}~ You've entered my tiny heart, my tiny star. ~</i>

396
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:50,320
<i>{\a6}~ Making me nervous as you're standing in front of me. ~</i>

397
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,680
<i>{\a6}~ Just as how I've imagined you. ~</i>

398
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,210
<i>{\a6}~ You appear only in my dreams. ~</i>

399
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,560
<i>{\a6}~ Just meeting you like this, ~</i>

400
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,260
<i>{\a6}~ why does my heart flutter like this? ~</i>

401
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,450
<i>{\a6}~ Even with the cold breeze, ~</i>

402
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,130
<i>{\a6}~ you make me feel warm. ~</i>

403
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,340
<i>{\a6}~ Just like this, the two of us, ~</i>

404
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,500
<i>{\a6}~ my love, you and me forever. ~</i>

405
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,500
<i>Choe Hui Jin! Queen In Hyeon!
</i>

406
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,770
<i>{\a6}~ Even if time comes and goes,
my love remains. ~</i>

407
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:38,340
<i>{\a6}~ Only by looking at you,
I grow closer and closer. ~</i>

408
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,400
<i>{\a6}~ You've entered my tiny heart, my tiny star. ~</i>

409
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,820
<i>I told you it can't be seen from outside.
</i>

410
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:52,110
<i> {\a6}~ Making me nervous as you're standing in front of me. ~</i>

411
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,940
I feel like selling the relic wasn't so bad after all.

412
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,470
<i>{\a6}~ Just as how I've imagined you. ~</i>

413
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,000
<i>{\a6}~ You appear only in my dreams. ~</i>

414
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
<i>{\a6}~ Just meeting you like this, ~</i>

415
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
<i>You should get going.
</i>

416
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,050
<i>{\a6}~ why does my heart flutter like this? ~</i>

417
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,390
<i>{\a6}~ Just as how I've imagined you. ~</i>

418
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,920
<i>{\a6}~ You appear only in my dreams. ~</i>

419
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,270
<i>{\a6}~ Just meeting you like this... ~</i>

420
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,590
Starting from now, where and what
are you going to go and do?

421
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,790
I'll return to Jeju
and go back to my official position.

422
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,130
The reinstatement order would require some time.

423
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,600
In the mean time, isn't it
wiser to stay put in the prison?

424
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,140
And once you're released?

425
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,070
When that time comes, I'll return
to my home in Hanyang.

426
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,740
And re-enter the palace to continue my work.

427
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,480
Just returning to my
previous daily life.

428
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,610
Returning to your daily life means
you're going to get married too?

429
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,520
You said you
don't have a wife.

430
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,150
Wasn't the ancestral line important in that era?

431
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,490
Then that means you need to get married.

432
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,760
You will find a young lady...

433
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Let's meet in a month.

434
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,100
It should take around a month to
settle everything and return to Hanyang.

435
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,040
Once I return home, I will
come and look for you.

436
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,640
But do you have any reason
to come here anymore?

437
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,780
My lover is here. Isn't that a reason?

438
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,310
Didn't I say that I would
try my best to be your lover?

439
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,990
I thought that was just for today.

440
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,790
Do you remember what
you asked me before?

441
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,260
You asked if our meeting
was karma.

442
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,340
<i>I'm not a smart person,,
so can you tell me...</i>

443
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:56,280
<i>If we become lovers... How
will it end?</i>

444
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,760
I've been thinking for several days and
still can't figure it out.

445
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,890
Until I know the answer,
I will keep looking for you.

446
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,830
Of course, only if you agree,

447
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:22,440
and I do not misunderstand with whom, where
and when you do the parting greeting with.

448
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,220
You're up so early?

449
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,310
Are you not tired after staying up all night?

450
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,420
I couldn't sleep.

451
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,820
I'm going shopping,
we have nothing to eat.

452
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,560
Hey, we're not done talking yet.

453
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,090
About what?

454
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,170
Gim Bung Do... Just who is that guy?

455
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,570
Flying for the first time,

456
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,440
doesn't have any ID,

457
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,780
doesn't know how to drive...

458
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,910
Has no cell phone...

459
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,180
Has no idea of public transport fares.

460
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,450
But in his pocket, he carries cheques
worth tens of millions.

461
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,720
Isn't it very strange?

462
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,990
Yes, it's strange.

463
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,260
What does he do really?

464
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:45,070
Tell me the truth, stop beating around the bush.

465
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,070
Didn't I tell you before?

466
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,420
When?

467
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,600
Don't you remember?

468
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,340
He is a person from 300 years ago.

469
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,420
It's true.

470
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,020
It's true. But you still won't believe.

471
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,620
Hello!

472
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,910
Aigoo, you're not filming today?

473
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,490
No, I'm resting today.

474
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,230
The drama is really interesting.

475
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,960
But when will you appear again?

476
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,300
I only saw you for a moment in the first episode.
That was all.

477
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,240
Some of the cast changes next week.
Don't miss it.

478
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,910
Of course, I'm looking forward to it.

479
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,180
You must be successful
and buy a new house.

480
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,250
How can an actress reside
in this crummy  neighbourhood?

481
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,920
Young people nowadays, what do you call them?

482
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,850
Oh right, they will fall
off the apartment buildings.

483
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,930
I do not have money.

484
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,990
My paycheck is not nearly enough.

485
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,590
How can there be such a thing...

486
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,790
If you sell that car, you will
make enough to move house.

487
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,460
That's not my car,
I'm just borrowing it.

488
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,060
The owner is someone else?

489
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,180
Yes.

490
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,600
He's not always here, so I'm helping to look after it.

491
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:00,210
I thought once you appear on
dramas it would be different.

492
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,260
Thank you for your hard work.

493
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,480
Okay.

494
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,310
<i>Are we going to meet
in one month exactly?</i>

495
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,850
<i>Let's spend the whole day together.
Have a real date.</i>

496
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,520
<i>What is a 'date'?</i>

497
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,190
<i>This guy doesn't even know what a date is,</i>

498
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,790
<i>what am I going to do?</i>

499
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,060
<i>I will explain it to you the day we meet.
Look forward to it.</i>

500
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,470
Si. Do. Tong. Rae.

501
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,450
Gan. Pil. Gu. In.

502
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,260
My Lord.

503
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,260
You're going to get better.

504
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,730
Don't worry.

505
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,460
You're going to be all right.

506
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,010
<i>Has he not yet woken up?</i>

507
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,280
<i>His wound has gotten better
but he's still not conscious yet.</i>

508
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,690
This is really depressing.

509
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,390
Is he trying to persecute me to death?

510
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,730
Making me this anxious.

511
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,250
He is not going to die.

512
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,310
He will not be irresponsible
and just abandon everyone.

513
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,250
He has already been found,
where else can he go?

514
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,320
You're awake?

515
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,840
Is anyone out there?

516
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,720
He's awake!

517
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,240
Call the physician over quickly.

518
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,360
Yes.

519
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,460
How do you feel?

520
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,930
You've been unconcious for more than
10 days, do you know how worried we were?

521
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,070
Where is this place?

522
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,800
It's an official's residence.

523
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,400
Official's residence?

524
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,410
I'm Minister Seok Hui Yeon.

525
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,340
Forgive me for having to greet you like this.

526
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,820
If you're a minister, then this place is?

527
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,620
This is the province of Jeju.

528
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,950
Jeju...

529
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,890
Your criminal charges have been revoked.

530
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,960
Your reinstatement order arrived here a few days ago.

531
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,230
Up until now you were unconscious, so we couldn't reply.

532
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,560
He was afraid you would feel abandoned,

533
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:58,210
and has been very dedicated.

534
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,510
I'm sorry. What you just
said, what does it mean?

535
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,580
I ask  because I cannot understand.

536
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:18,050
Why am I in Jeju, and why the reinstatement order?

537
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,190
You're asking why you came to Jeju?

538
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,730
It's because you were sentenced
to be exiled here.

539
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,200
But now, you have been cleared of all charges
and shall regain your official status.

540
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:41,140
<i>As regards the incident at the office
of Special Advisers,</i>

541
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,910
<i>Officer Gim Bung Do is to
receive Sin Gu and Bok Gwan.</i>

542
00:43:55,830 --> 00:44:00,500
My Lord, aigoo... My Lord.

543
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,270
Finally, hope has returned to the world.

544
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:07,840
I thought you were going to die, do
you know how sad I have been?

545
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,170
Why do you always make people worry?

546
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,980
How did you get here?

547
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,380
I wanted to accompany you back,
so I made haste.

548
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,590
Who would've thought that you were
roaming around stabbed and wounded?

549
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:29,190
I heard that venomous Min Am sent an assassin here.

550
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,400
We went to assassinate him that night.

551
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,730
At first he got away,

552
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,800
but we followed his tracks
in order to kill him off.

553
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,340
We thought that we were close
to getting rid of him.

554
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,210
But, suddenly, he disappeared without a trace.

555
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,340
After that, we ransacked all his rooms.

556
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,350
So did he royal guards.

557
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,550
But he was nowhere to be found.

558
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,910
On the fourth day, he disappeared, too.

559
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:15,480
-Catch him! Hurry!
-Yes!

560
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:20,040
Luckily, the guards on patrol
discovered you. It was such a relief.

561
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,640
They even captured that fellow.

562
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,450
He was an assassin sent by the Southern faction.

563
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,920
So, the gods do not close their eyes.

564
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,520
You were not annihilated, sir.

565
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,860
They say Min Am
will also be sent here.

566
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,200
After all that he has done,

567
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,000
he just gets sent here.

568
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,940
But my heart is all at peace.

569
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,610
Sorry, I didn't expect things
to turn out like this.

570
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,610
His Excellency's plight has turned out this way...

571
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,560
Is everything over now?

572
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,360
Do you have anything else to report?

573
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,960
It may not be important, but...

574
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,890
What is it?

575
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,960
When I got there it was all over,
only this was left behind.

576
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:28,780
<i>It is a talisman carried by Gim Bung Do.</i>

577
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,520
A talisman? He carries a talisman?

578
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,520
You shouldn't stay like this, should
I get you something to eat?

579
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,130
Can you eat?

580
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,460
Han Dong...

581
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,130
What day is it today?

582
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,330
Today? The 30th of April.

583
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,070
The 30th of April.

584
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,690
What's the matter, sir?

585
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,540
March 1st is the last day I remember.

586
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,740
Sir?

587
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,950
Two months.

588
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,020
I cannot remember what happened in the past two months.

589
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,490
What... what are you saying, sir?

590
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,690
What can't you remember?

591
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,290
Why?

592
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,090
What's wrong, sir?

593
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,030
What memories?

594
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,040
Si. Do. Tong. Rae.

595
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,380
What exactly don't you remember, sir?

596
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,510
I don't remember anything at all.

597
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,520
Pardon?

598
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,250
My last memory is of two months ago.

599
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,520
I was stabbed at the Office of Special Advisers.

600
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:53,260
What exactly happened then?

601
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,140
Gil. Gu. In.

602
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:17,960
-=Next Episode Preview=-

603
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,250
This is my girlfriend Choe Hui Jin.

604
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,220
Is Han Dong Min really my boyfriend?

605
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:29,220
Why do you make people worry about you!

606
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:33,220
The man in my memory, Gim Bung Do.

607
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,200
Do you not know Gim Bung Do, either?

608
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,380
Who is Gim Bung Do?

609
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,140
Are you saying you want to make me your wife?

610
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,300
It was just a dream.

611
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,280
Dream!

612
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:53,220
Nothing makes sense, what is this?

613
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,730
Queen In Hyeon...
