00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:15,000
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

2
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,600
It is I, Yoon Wol, my lord.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,899
Come in.

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,000
Did you go to
Hwaeomsa Temple?

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, sire.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,399
You don't look well.
Did something happen?

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,798
Is there something you wish to tell me?

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,899
Do you... truly intend
to leave this place, sire?

9
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:54,899
Will you truly cast everything and
everyone aside to go to that woman?

10
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,298
Things have finally
gotten so much better.

11
00:00:57,298 --> 00:01:00,200
You've finally gotten the chance
to uphold your parents' will!

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,298
How can such a wise man as
yourself consider doing that, sire?

13
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:06,900
This isn't the result I'd had in mind

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,599
when I'd accepted the
talisman from the monk.

15
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:13,599
I gave you that talisman
for the sake of your safety.

16
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,799
I didn't give it to you so that you'd

17
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,799
throw away everything you have
for the sake of a woman.

18
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,299
And the talisman...
the talisman...

19
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,000
will grow angry if it is corrupted
with other intentions!

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,900
How could you come to such a decision?

21
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:35,000
It is the first time that
I have seen you this angry.

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,200
I wasn't prepared to hear all this
from you, so I am a bit overwhelmed.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's address one matter
at a time, shall we?

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,200
First, did you say that the talisman
would be getting angry?

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,599
What do you mean by that?

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,799
<i>(The Most Beautiful Woman On Earth)</i>

27
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,300
<i>(Playboy)</i>

28
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:12,800
All right, then.

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's have "Playboy" call "The Most
Beautiful Woman On Earth."

30
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:25,800
Hello, Mr. Playboy?

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,199
Have you been well?

32
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:33,699
All right, that covers our cellphones.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,500
All right.

34
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,400
You're up?

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,300
Let's have breakfast.
I haven't eaten yet.

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,300
What? I didn't buy this
with my own money.

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,598
It's that person's money.
You saw how much money he has.

38
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,300
I'm just shopping for him.
Like a personal shopper, if you will.

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Wow, you're an amazing actress.

40
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,000
You've managed to portray such a variety
of emotions just by tutting at me.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Annoyance, anger, disapproval.

42
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,400
You're really quite something.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,500
Ugh, you're so ridiculous.

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Oh yeah. Let's stop by the realtor's
office before we go to the set.

45
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,000
- Why?
- To look into some apartments.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,598
Somewhere south of Namsan,
with a great view.

47
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't believe the ridiculous things
he's making you do!

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,098
He should find his own place to live in.
Why is he making you do it for him?

49
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,300
He doesn't exactly have
great taste, you see.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,699
So why are you bothering to date a guy
who can't even find his own place?

51
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,400
Because he has tons of money.

52
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,598
See? He has what you love most: money.
So why are you so displeased?

53
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,000
You said that the most important
thing about a guy is having money.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,900
Hey, he might even have more
money than Han Dong Min.

55
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,500
He said that he doesn't even know
how big his inheritance is!

56
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,699
You said if someone doesn't know their
inheritance, they're truly rich.

57
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:56,400
Ugh.

58
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm going to take one of these as a
service fee for doing all this shopping.

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,598
This much is like spare change
for a guy like him, after all.

60
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:05,400
Let's go eat something yummy!
I'll buy!

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,800
Wow, seriously?

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,500
Ugh!

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,699
Are you happy?

64
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,300
Han Dong Min sprayed water on you.

65
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,400
You lost all of your commercial deals.

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
You get treated terribly on set.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,199
And now you're a target
because of your scandal!

68
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,899
Are you still happy, despite all this?

69
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,000
Are you happy? Huh?

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,540
Totally!

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,199
Fine, you wench.
At least you're happy.

72
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,000
I mean, we can't have everything be
terrible, right? At least you're happy.

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,300
Yeah, great job.

74
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,300
Love may not be able to
buy food, but money sure can.

75
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,800
He has money, at the very least.
That makes it a little better.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,250
<i>There was something that the monk
told me when I received the talisman.</i>

77
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,300
Who is that child?
It seems she's been here every day.

78
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,199
She's a gisaeng.
And quite a refined one, at that.

79
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,899
A gisaeng, eh?

80
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:36,000
What could she want so dearly
that she is praying so ardently?

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,899
She is quite a faithful woman.

82
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,199
What is it that you
wish for so dearly?

83
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,199
Gisaengs are not too
different from monks, in a way.

84
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,600
They're both people who've cut themselves
off from the rest of the world.

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
However, what is it that you
wish for so deeply

86
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,899
that you spend every night here,
without fail?

87
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,000
You seem to be quite a faithful
person, so I wish to help you.

88
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,399
This person is quite compassionate,
and is destined for great things.

89
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,000
What is it that you're praying for
regarding this person?

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,399
For his peace and happiness.

91
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,199
How unfortunate.

92
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,699
He will go through endless hardships.

93
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:47,300
And to be frank, it will be hard for
him to remain living in this world.

94
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,300
T-then... what can I do?

95
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,300
A talisman can bring one
fortune or misfortune.

96
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,399
So you must be careful when handling it.

97
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,500
Despite the fact that this
talisman was written by me

98
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,899
and contains your pure intentions,
and has been written for that man

99
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,800
this does not necessarily mean it will
work as any one of us we wish for it to.

100
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,699
If it is defiled with impure intentions

101
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:22,800
it could actually end up
becoming quite angry.

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,000
He said that it could
become full of wrath.

103
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,000
The reason why the
monk wrote the talisman

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,399
and the reason why I gave it to you
was to protect your life from danger.

105
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,300
But if you will be using it to go to
that place of your own volition, sire...

106
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,000
that wasn't the purpose for
which the talisman was created.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,100
This surely qualifies as the "other
intentions" that the monk mentioned.

108
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:53,300
I've never once wished for anything less
than your complete happiness, sire.

109
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,500
However, I've never once considered
that your happiness...

110
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,199
may entail disappearing from us forever.

111
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:08,800
What is it?

112
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,199
I am from the Bureau of
Royal Investigators, sir.

113
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,199
Where is the one that
they call Sir Kim Boong Do?

114
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,500
What is it?

115
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,600
Sir Yoon from the Royal
Investigators sent this missive, sir.

116
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,000
<i>We've created a poster of the one called
Ja Soo as per your description</i>

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
<i>and we've investigated all of the places
where the others have appeared.</i>

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,500
<i>However, we haven't found anything
conclusive, so we ask for your aid.</i>

119
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,200
<i>Furthermore, this isn't an official
report but something happened last night.</i>

120
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:38,700
Something happened?

121
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,798
<i>A few nights prior, the queen
visited her ailing mother.</i>

122
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:43,700
<i>But last night...</i>

123
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,600
Who goes there?

124
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,500
An enemy!
An enemy has appeared!

125
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:58,399
Those who are outside inquire
about your state of being.

126
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,600
Everything is fine.

127
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,399
But what is going on, exactly?

128
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,000
<i>Thankfully, everyone is safe.</i>

129
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,000
How could something like this
still be happening?

130
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,200
The rebels were
definitely behind this incident!

131
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,100
Call forth the royal forces
to track down the rebels

132
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
and summon the prisoners once more
and interrogate them

133
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,000
to extract more information
regarding any other suspicious activity!

134
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,200
His Majesty is quite upset,
which is why he wished to see you.

135
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,000
You are the only one who knows what the
rebels' leader looks like, after all.

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,100
But why would those people
do such a risky thing?

137
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,200
I'm not sure, sire.

138
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Perhaps they're acting irrationally
now that they're at their wit's end.

139
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:42,700
I went by your description, but I'm
not sure if this looks like him.

140
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,298
It's not bad, but his lip area is wrong.

141
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:48,798
Is that right, sir?

142
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:51,100
Could you give us more of
a detailed description, then?

143
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,000
It'd be so simple if we
could just take a photo.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Pardon?

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,899
What did you just say?

146
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,298
It's nothing.

147
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,000
Did they say that the man who targeted
the queen's home looks similar to him?

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,700
We've only seen him from the back.

149
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,600
Despite that, he didn't seem
to be the same man.

150
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,000
He was taller than as described here,
and he was dressed like a nobleman.

151
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:14,700
Dressed like a nobleman, eh?

152
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:19,000
Arrows!

153
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,100
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

154
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:29,200
Arrows!

155
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Catch them! They're on the roof!

156
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,298
Scholar!
What of the scholar?

157
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:57,000
Didn't you see, sir?
He disappeared!

158
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,700
- What?
- I saw it too!

159
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,500
He suddenly disappeared before
the arrow could hit him!

160
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,798
That's right!
He disappeared into thin air, like smoke!

161
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:07,700
That's ludicrous! Go and search.
He must be here somewhere!

162
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,000
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

163
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:21,000
- What's with that guy?
- Look at his getup!

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,200
- He's handsome!
- Wow!

165
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,700
- Wow, he looks so cool!
- He's so tall!

166
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,399
<i>They attempted such a dangerous
thing in broad daylight</i>

167
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,000
<i>and in front of the Bureau of
Royal Investigators' men.</i>

168
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,000
Attackers!

169
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
<i>That was a trap, without a doubt.</i>

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,500
<i>It must be someone who knows
of the talisman and how it functions.</i>

171
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,700
<i>It must be Ja Soo.</i>

172
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,798
<i>And I'm sure that Minister Min
is involved in all this somehow.</i>

173
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,000
<i>It must be Minister Min's plan.</i>

174
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,798
If you just give me the
command to do so, sir

175
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:18,000
even if I must forfeit
my life in the process

176
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,200
I'll sneak into Kim Boong Do's home
and steal that talisman and kill him

177
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,298
- as long as you wish for it.
- No.

178
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:27,000
No.

179
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:35,700
They say that one lives when they try to
die, and one dies when trying to live.

180
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,000
Pardon?

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,200
If he's turned the tables
with just a single talisman

182
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,500
he could very well have that talisman
lead to his own downfall, too.

183
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,000
<i>However, he didn't seem
to be the same man.</i>

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,399
He was taller than as described here,
and he was dressed like a nobleman.

185
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,200
Dressed like a nobleman, eh?

186
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,798
We know the fact that he has been
to the queen's home.

187
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:17,298
And it's clear that he stopped by there
before visiting my home on that day

188
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:19,899
so we must find a way to prove this.

189
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes, sir.

190
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,798
However, we have
corroborating evidence now

191
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:26,298
so we can just recreate
the events from that night.

192
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,899
Recreate them?

193
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,399
What do you think our prideful king

194
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,000
would find harder to forgive
than anything?

195
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,200
Something that would make him
want to kill both Kim Boong Do

196
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,399
and the queen, whom he trusts,
with his bare hands?

197
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,500
<i>Repulsive rumors.</i>

198
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,200
Repulsive rumors.

199
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,000
<i>I'm not sure if you'll
be able to read this.</i>

200
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,700
<i>Mr. Kim Boong Do!</i>

201
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,700
<i>Stop stealing from others from now on
and equip yourself properly!</i>

202
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,298
<i>From the Most Beautiful Woman On Earth.</i>

203
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,098
Yes, hello.
Where are you headed?

204
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,598
To the library, please.

205
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:23,500
The library, huh?
Which one?

206
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:27,700
Excuse me, sir!
Which library?

207
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,000
The closest one to here.

208
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,000
The closest one, eh?

209
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,900
That would be the Public Library.
Shall I take you there, then?

210
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,798
- Yes.
- All right.

211
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,200
Aw, man.

212
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Excuse me, sir.
You see, there's quite a bit of traffic.

213
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,098
Could you get off here?

214
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:58,598
The library is only 50 meters away.

215
00:17:58,598 --> 00:18:01,798
Excuse me, sir?
Sir!

216
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,598
Excuse me, sir-- oh!

217
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:08,900
Damn it!
Mister! Mister!

218
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,798
Oh, damn it!
Hey, Mister!

219
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,298
That is the business of the
ladies-in-waiting, Your Highness.

220
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:17,798
It is not something that you
should concern yourself with.

221
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,500
What?

222
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,700
How could you accuse me
of jealousy, Your Highness?

223
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,000
How could you say that

224
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,298
when I merely disciplined that concubine
for disobeying me, lying about being ill?

225
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:32,400
That's enough!

226
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,500
Do not concern yourself with
Heebin's matters any longer.

227
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,700
What are they doing over there?

228
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,298
Why is the production assistant
wearing the king's robe?

229
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:43,298
Well, Han Dong Min said he doesn't want
to shoot anything with Choi Hee Jin.

230
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,798
So they're shooting separately.

231
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, that's so Han Dong Min.
It's so, so typical of him.

232
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,700
That is the business of the
ladies-in-waiting, Your Highness.

233
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,400
- It is not something that you--
- Cut!

234
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
Let's continue this after a break.

235
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:10,798
Queen.

236
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:12,798
You sure are amazing.

237
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,798
How could you cheat on
the king, of all people?

238
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:18,400
You've even one-upped me.

239
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,298
You're truly the best.

240
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Geez, I'm so concerned about
what the others are thinking!

241
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,798
How are you going to manage to film
anything properly, like this?

242
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,000
And just how long is Han Dong Min
going to be so damn difficult?

243
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
Damn it.

244
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,598
Maybe I should meet him again.

245
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:54,000
Why?
So he can treat you like crap again?

246
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,598
He sprayed you with water
and threw a pillow at you.

247
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:57,700
You've done more than enough.
What more are you willing to take?

248
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,000
If anything, I'll just get on
my knees and beg.

249
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,098
Why would you go so far as to beg?

250
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:04,598
It's not like you two
were engaged or married!

251
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:06,700
And it's not like he's
never done that before himself!

252
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,400
At first, I felt bad, too.

253
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,200
But after seeing how he's acting now,
I don't even feel bad at all.

254
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,298
What a joke!

255
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,598
Why did I get so many calls?

256
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:20,098
Huh?

257
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:22,200
<i>(Playboy)
(Playboy)</i>

258
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,500
I wonder when he got here? Hah.

259
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
So he saw that I put a
phone there for him, huh?

260
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,000
Hello?
When did you get here?

261
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,298
- You said that you'd be a while--
<i>- Are you the "Beauty?"</i>

262
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:37,298
Pardon?

263
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:39,000
<i>Are you the supposed "Most
Beautiful Woman in the World?"</i>

264
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,500
Oh, um, yes.
But who are you?

265
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,000
A taxi?

266
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,900
What?

267
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
And where is that?

268
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,798
<i>(Emergency Medical Care Center)</i>

269
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
Hey, wait for me!

270
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:05,000
Um... um, excuse me!

271
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,400
The emergency patient that came in.
The one that passed out in a cab.

272
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,200
Are you his guardian?

273
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,298
Are you Ms. Choi Hee Jin,
by any chance?

274
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm his guardian.
She just tagged along, is all.

275
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,798
It's me.
I'm his guardian.

276
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:19,000
Where is he?

277
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,598
Where is he?

278
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:23,000
He's in the operating room right now.

279
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,500
Oh, just a moment.

280
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,798
<i>(Consent Form)</i>

281
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:28,000
Could you sign the form, please?

282
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,500
He was in critical condition, so we
had to operate on him without consent.

283
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,098
Thank you.

284
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:39,400
So this happened inside of your cab?

285
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,000
He seemed fine at first, but
then he wouldn't respond to me.

286
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,200
So I turned around to see that he
was bleeding, and had passed out!

287
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,598
Man, do you know how surprised I was?

288
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:51,298
I thought that he'd die
in my car, then and there!

289
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:52,298
And then?

290
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:55,000
And then, I opened his wallet.

291
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,298
And he had money, but no ID!

292
00:21:58,298 --> 00:22:02,000
So I used his phone, and
he only had one contact registered.

293
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,298
Someone named "The Most
Beautiful Woman on Earth?"

294
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:05,798
So, I...

295
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,700
Wait a second.

296
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,298
Are you that "Most Beautiful
Woman on Earth?"

297
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:15,700
What? Well, um,
that is...

298
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,298
- that was just a joke.
- Oh.

299
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:19,298
So, what happened next?

300
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:23,000
So I kept calling and calling!
But nobody would pick up!

301
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Man!

302
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,200
I thought I was going to go insane!

303
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,000
Man, I'm so upset.

304
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:30,298
<i>(Surgery in Progress)</i>

305
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:33,200
<i>The entire city is in an uproar, sire!</i>

306
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,400
Is that right?

307
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,598
Yes!

308
00:22:35,598 --> 00:22:39,000
There were more than just a handful
of people who saw him disappear!

309
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,200
And he's nowhere to be found!

310
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,200
How could something like
that possibly happen?

311
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,000
That's quite fascinating.

312
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,798
I heard from an eyewitness

313
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:50,500
that he truly did disappear
in a blink of an eye!

314
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,798
Even though he was struck by two arrows!

315
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:54,298
Just disappeared, like that!

316
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm sure word of this has
reached the palace too, then.

317
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
But of course, sire!

318
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,900
It seems a problem arose after the Royal
Investigators had asked him for help.

319
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,298
But if this information is revealed later
on, after having been kept a secret

320
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:07,798
they could all end up
getting severely punished!

321
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:12,500
Of course.
Of course it must be reported.

322
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,598
He disappeared like smoke?
What do you mean by that?

323
00:23:16,598 --> 00:23:19,000
It'd be in your best interest
to tell the truth.

324
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,598
How dare you spread such a ludicrous
rumor, in a place such as this?

325
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:24,098
My deepest apologies, Your Highness!

326
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:27,700
But there were dozens of citizens
and soldiers who saw this happen.

327
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,000
Where is Boong Do now?

328
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,098
He has yet to be found.

329
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:35,798
I informed my men and searched
around the entire area

330
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:37,700
and we even searched all the places
where he may have gone.

331
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,798
But not even his servants know
where he might be.

332
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,000
He was struck by two arrows

333
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,500
so he should have left bloodstains
or footprints behind

334
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,000
despite where he went.

335
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,298
But there is nothing.

336
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:55,200
Perhaps he was
abducted by the assailants?

337
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,000
That doesn't seem to be
the case either, sire.

338
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,700
We interrogated those
we managed to capture

339
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,298
but they seemed to be just as surprised
as we were regarding his disappearance.

340
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,298
Are you implying that Boong Do
is using some sort of witchcraft, then?

341
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:14,000
Where has Boong Do gone?

342
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,400
Mr. Patient!

343
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,798
- Hurry!
- Move!

344
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,500
Can you see me?

345
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:54,000
Excuse me!
He's awake now!

346
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,298
Can you see me?

347
00:24:57,298 --> 00:24:59,000
Can you hear my voice?

348
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:02,598
What?

349
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:07,098
Can you confirm...

350
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:09,000
What are you talking about?

351
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,598
Huh?
Confirm what?

352
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,000
The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty.

353
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:24,298
Oh... oh no!

354
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:25,798
Excuse me!

355
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,798
Could you step outside for a bit?

356
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:46,700
You need to head back.
It's time for your shoot.

357
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:53,200
People are really going to notice
if you stay here like this!

358
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,400
It was shocking enough that you broke up
with Han Dong Min after cheating on him.

359
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,700
But if people find out that
the man you cheated on him with

360
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,200
was brought to the hospital
while bleeding out

361
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,400
the entire country will
be gossiping about you!

362
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Just how far are you willing to go?

363
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:09,200
I told you, I'll protect him!

364
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
They said that he won't die!

365
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,000
All right.
I'll go.

366
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:21,798
Also, I may really love money.

367
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:24,400
But having a lot of
money isn't everything.

368
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,700
I mean, what good reason would a student
have for being struck by an arrow?

369
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:31,000
See? Look!

370
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,598
Is he really a graduate student?

371
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,200
He isn't, is he?

372
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,098
You want me to go and ask his school?

373
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:44,200
Also, why doesn't he know
anyone besides you?

374
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,598
I can accept the argument
that he may not have any parents.

375
00:26:46,598 --> 00:26:48,500
But he doesn't have any
siblings or friends?

376
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,400
What am I supposed to tell the police?

377
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,200
Who is that Kim Boong Do, really?

378
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,000
This is the updated script
with the 32nd revision.

379
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
An updated script?

380
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,298
There were a couple of scenes
put in and taken out.

381
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,700
Please take a careful look at it.

382
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,900
All right.

383
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:24,900
What is this?

384
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,098
No way!

385
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,900
What in the world is this?

386
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,700
Damn that son of a--

387
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:42,298
Oh my gosh!

388
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:44,500
What do you want?

389
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,298
Aren't you being way too immature?

390
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,298
What?

391
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:49,298
I get that you're angry at me

392
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:50,500
but you should separate
personal and professional matters!

393
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,798
How could you make them
rewrite the script in this manner?

394
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,298
If you want to get angry,
get angry at me!

395
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,700
Why do you keep on
trying to ruin the drama?

396
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,500
What in the world
are you talking about?

397
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,700
This drama isn't a
complete work of fiction.

398
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,400
It's based on real people!

399
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,598
So how could you try and change history
just because you don't like it?

400
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:09,298
Does being a Hallyu star
give you that much privilege?

401
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:11,798
Does it make you feel good
to kill off a perfectly innocent person?

402
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,798
What the hell are you saying?

403
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:16,500
What are you accusing me of?

404
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,798
Are you mad about the fact that
Queen In Hyun's death

405
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:19,700
was moved up a couple of episodes?

406
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,298
How the hell am I supposed to
know why they moved it up?

407
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:22,598
I guess the writer didn't want to
write the character anymore!

408
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:24,000
Her death getting
moved up isn't the issue!

409
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,798
The issue is with the fact that
the way she dies makes no sense!

410
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:27,500
What do you mean, it makes no sense?

411
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,000
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

412
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,298
Queen In Hyun never died like that!

413
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:35,500
How are we supposed to kill
Queen In Hyun off, then?

414
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,200
Are we just supposed to
kill her off nicely, with a disease?

415
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,298
What did you say?

416
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:42,500
I really have no idea what
you're trying to say, here.

417
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,798
Are you drunk?

418
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:50,900
You need to check...

419
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,400
Check what?

420
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,500
Huh? What do I need to check?

421
00:28:56,598 --> 00:28:58,500
The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty.

422
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,700
I was just going to
let this slide, but you...

423
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,098
are you really trying
to start something with me?

424
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,798
Hey.

425
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,400
Hey, what are you doing?
This conversation isn't over!

426
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,298
Um... er...

427
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:18,400
Geez, why did you do that?
Why are you always fighting with her?

428
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,000
I tell you every day
not to fight with her!

429
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,400
Ugh, this pisses me off so much!

430
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,298
This pisses me off!

431
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,598
<i>(Queen In Hyun)</i>

432
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

433
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,500
Oh, you're awake!

434
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900
Can you see me?

435
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,400
Can you hear me?

436
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,098
Where... is this place?

437
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:19,000
We moved you to the regular patients'
room yesterday since you got much better.

438
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,400
Just a moment.
Let me call the doctor.

439
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:40,798
<i>Oh my!
He's awake?</i>

440
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,200
<i>When did he get up?</i>

441
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,798
Looks like you're much better now,
seeing as you're smiling.

442
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:25,400
You would've been in big
trouble without a phone!

443
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,900
You wouldn't even gotten
operated on since you have no ID

444
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,500
and nobody would've known if you
ended up bleeding to death somewhere!

445
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,798
Isn't my intuition amazing?

446
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,298
I felt like I had to get you
a phone first.

447
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,298
How many days have passed?

448
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,200
Ten days.

449
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,098
Ten days?

450
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,798
Oh, they said that you could
eat something once you awoke.

451
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:53,200
Want me to get you some water?

452
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,900
No, before that,
I need to read some books.

453
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,000
You're talking about
the Annals, right?

454
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
How did you know?

455
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
So you can't remember, huh?

456
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,298
You told me before.

457
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,598
You said you needed to check
the Annals, so I searched it up for you.

458
00:32:07,598 --> 00:32:09,400
I was wondering what had changed.

459
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,000
Well? Is there anything
that has changed?

460
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,400
No. Nothing at all.

461
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:18,298
Just one thing changed.

462
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:21,000
It now says that Lord Kim Boong Do
was shot by arrows on the street

463
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
and disappeared.

464
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,298
And his whereabouts
were never discovered.

465
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:31,298
That's what it said.
Really.

466
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:34,500
And it said that he was never
seen again after that day.

467
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:41,000
So I thought, "oh, so this is
how he'll come to live here."

468
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,000
Anything else?

469
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,200
No.

470
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,298
Everything else remained the same.

471
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:54,700
Did you think that you were some
sort of super important figure?

472
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,598
Did you think that the entire world would
change just because you disappeared?

473
00:32:57,598 --> 00:32:59,900
Here, they call that
"being conceited."

474
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,798
In other words, having an inflated ego.
Commit that to your memory, okay?

475
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:04,500
"Being conceited."

476
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:13,400
Oh, you're finally awake?

477
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,900
Yes, he woke up not too long ago.

478
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,400
Let me see how you're doing.

479
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,700
Please lie down.

480
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,500
All right.
Slowly, slowly.

481
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Let's take a look here.

482
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,500
Okay.

483
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,500
Let's see.

484
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,000
You didn't speak with Soo Kyung?

485
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,298
Oh, really?

486
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:53,400
She's at the hospital with me.
I'm sure you can reach her by phone now.

487
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,000
Excuse me...

488
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,400
Yes, please try calling her.

489
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:01,000
How is he?

490
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,700
We have to run more tests on him.

491
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,500
We'll have to do a full frontal
scan of him to know for sure.

492
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,000
Also, regarding the patient's identity...

493
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Yes?

494
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
He's awake now, so we
have to contact the police.

495
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,699
Oh, I see.
The police?

496
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,699
That's right.

497
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,300
Could you come to the
office with me, please?

498
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,400
We have some paperwork
that needs to be taken care of.

499
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,199
Oh, of course.

500
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,099
We'll be escorting you...
to the examination room...

501
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,099
Huh?

502
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:48,300
W-where did he go?

503
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,199
Oh my!
What's going on?

504
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,000
Huh?
Where are you going?

505
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,699
Where are you going, sir?
You shouldn't be moving!

506
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,000
You need to be examined.
Please come with us.

507
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,599
Geez.
Seriously.

508
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,000
What a crazy bastard!

509
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, did you get a call
from the section chief?

510
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,199
I told them to call you.

511
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,900
Hey, what's going on?

512
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
Huh?

513
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,000
Where did Kim Boong Do go?

514
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,599
Oh, I'm sure he's being examined now.

515
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,800
They said they were going to run
some tests on him when he awoke.

516
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,199
And he woke up not too long ago.

517
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,900
What do you mean, examination?
He just ran away!

518
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,000
Huh?
What did you say?

519
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,199
He ran off with his
wallet and his phone!

520
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,800
I saw him with my own two eyes!

521
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,599
Why would he run away?

522
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,699
I thought he had a lot of money.

523
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:15,000
So surely he wouldn't run away
to skimp out on the hospital bill.

524
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,400
Wow. He seems weirder
and weirder by the day.

546
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,800
<i>Due to the rumor becoming widespread,
many requested for it to be investigated.</i>

547
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,000
<i>The king's wrath finally
overtook him...</i>

548
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,500
<i>and he ordered for a thorough

<i>On June 3rd...</i>

550
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,199
<i>the king visited the queen, and inquired
about the truth behind those rumors.</i>

551
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,699
<i>However, the queen did not reply.</i>

552
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:17,599
<i>And due to this, the king grew
even more enraged.</i>

553
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,699
<i>On June 20th...</i>

554
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:28,400
The entire truth regarding the queen's
disgraceful behavior has come to light.

555
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,000
Not only did she commit adultery
with a man who used witchcraft

556
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,599
and caused chaos to
ripple throughout the land

557
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:36,400
she also deceived me to reclaim
her position as queen!

558
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,300
Therefore, she has committed treason
and has put the royal family at risk!

559
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,800
Therefore, I order that she lose
her title as queen once more

560
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,500
and for the incident from last April
be re-investigated!

561
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,400
So release Minister Min and the
other prisoners related to this incident.

562
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,300
<i>On July 2nd...</i>

563
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,800
It's only fair that the criminal
Kim Boong Do be punished as well.

564
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,300
However, as we are unable to
find him, it cannot be helped.

565
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,800
As this is the punishment for those who
have plotted against the royal family

566
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,400
have the criminal beheaded.

567
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,199
And as for Kim Boong Do, find and unearth
his corpse and have it beheaded.

568
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,000
<i>On July 25th...</i>

569
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:24,800
<i>The criminal Queen In Hyun,
who was stripped of her title...</i>

570
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:28,400

<i>(Call from: The Most Beautiful

572
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,199
They said that he's not in the hospital.

573
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,199
Where could he have gone?

574
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,400
I'm sure he's at the library.

575
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,000
The library?
Why would a patient go to the library?

576
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,500
Man, I have no idea which
library he's at! What do I do?

577
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:18,300
<i>The talisman...</i>

578
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,300
may make you more distant
from the world, I fear.

579
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,000
And because of that, I am concerned.

580
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,500
Everything has been resolved now

581
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,900
so I hope that you won't
search for it any longer.

582
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:36,699
Worry not, Your Highness.

583
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:39,699
We will protect you until the very end.

584
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:52,400
He definitely said that the talisman
could become full of wrath.

585
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,599
The reason why the
monk wrote the talisman

586
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,699
and the reason why I gave it to you
was to protect your life from danger.

587
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:02,199
But if you will be using it to go to
that place of your own volition, sire...

588
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:06,699
that wasn't the purpose for
which the talisman was created.

589
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,500
This surely qualifies as the "other
intentions" that the monk mentioned.

00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,800
Why are you there?

597
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,599
I came here to find the talisman.

598
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,000
Where is it?

599
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,500
What are you talking about?

600
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,400
You have it, don't you?

601
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,099
No, I don't have it.
I burned it.

602
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:09,400
Burned it, you say?

603
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,599
I burned it because I thought you
may act like this when you awoke.

604
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:16,000
There's no time.
Where is it?

605
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,300
I told you,
I burned it!

606
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,000
You read the Annals, right?

607
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And you saw what happened, didn't you?

608
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,800
All of that happened
because I burned the talisman.

609
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,199
And Queen In Hyun was beheaded, too.

610
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:30,699
And you'd be beheaded too,
if you returned.

611
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:32,599
So how could I just sit and
watch, knowing that?

612
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,300
So that's why I burned it.

613
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,000
You know me. I'm a stupid and
simpleminded person.

614
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,900
That was the only method
I could think of.

615
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,800
I'm sorry I didn't tell you beforehand,
but it couldn't be helped.

616
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:51,500
You won't be able to return to Joseon
anymore, even if you want to.

617
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,900
You're always trying to deceive me,
when you're no good at lying.

618
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,500
I'm telling you, I'm not lying!

619
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:02,800
Do not be angry about
what I am about to say now.

620
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,599
I don't care for stupid people.

621
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:12,699
You say that you're stupid, and yet
I know it's only that you're ignorant.

622
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:14,599
I don't believe that you're stupid.

623
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:16,199
<i>What did you just say?</i>

624
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,199
When the talisman was torn
in two, I lost my memories.

625
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,599
And you had to go through
the same experiences twice.

626
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:30,599
Something like that happened
when it was merely torn in two

627
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,300
so what do you think will happen
if the talisman is burned up?

628
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:38,800
Do you really think that
nothing would happen?

629
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,900
Perhaps we wouldn't be able to
recognize each other, forever.

630
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:51,699
Who knows? We may walk past each
other without recognizing one another.

631
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,500
You're aware of that fact, so there's
no way you could've just burned it.

632
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,900
I'm sure that you've
hidden it somewhere instead.

633
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:24,199
Thank you for overestimating like that,
but I really am quite stupid.

634
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,800
I'm really, really stupid! I was known as
the school idiot when I was a student!

635
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,300
I had the worst grades among
everyone at my school!

636
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,300
I found it.

637
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,599
You're not stupid.

638
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,400
It's true that you must have a bit lazy
when it came to schoolwork, though.

639
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,800
Don't go back!
Just wait for me for a bit!

640
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,300
Don't go.

641
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,800
Don't you dare go!
I'll never see you again if you do!

642
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,500
Don't go, you jerk!

643
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:59,699
I just managed to save
you from the brink of death!

644
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:01,699
Are you really going
to do this to me now?

645
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,400
You said you'd take
responsibility for me.

646
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,599
You said you'd take responsibility!

647
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,599
How could you just go and lie to me
like that, you son of a bitch?

648
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:19,500
I said don't go!

649
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,400
Could you hear me out for just a moment?

650
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,199
I did promise you that I'd
take responsibility for you

651
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:37,500
but I made up my mind five years
ago to protect the queen, with my life.

652
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,000
But...

653
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:46,500
to have it go down in the history books
that she was beheaded to protect me...

654
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,199
I don't think I'd be able to live
a good life here, knowing that.

655
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,500
Furthermore, I was taught to
not live my life that way.

656
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,199
Therefore...

657
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:03,300
I'm going to take responsibility
for everything.

658
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,699
I can do that.

659
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:12,699
I'll definitely resolve this
and return to you.

660
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,400
<i>Open the door, now!</i>

661
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,099
<i>Open the doors for them
before you all are taken away as well.</i>

662
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,400
<i>You must place all the blame on him.</i>

663
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:34,300
<i>What's the matter?</i>

664
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,300
<i>Have Kim Boong Do hold the talisman,
and shoot him with arrows!</i>

665
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:45,000
<i>What good is it to have
the title of Royal Vassal</i>

666
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,699
<i>when he's dead and gone?</i>

667
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:49,800
<i>He was struck by three arrows, and died.</i>
