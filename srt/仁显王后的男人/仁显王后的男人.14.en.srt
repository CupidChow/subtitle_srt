1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,000
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

2
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,799
- Oh!
- Isn't that him?

3
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,900
It is him!

4
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,000
- That's him!
- Oh!

5
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,400
- He's appeared again!
- It's him!

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
- Ugh!
- Don't you fear the gods?

7
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,200
My goodness!

8
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,000
My Lord!

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,700
Where have you been, My Lord?

10
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,299
Something came up.
Draw me a bath.

11
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,000
My Lord! There's a warrant out
for your arrest, sir!

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,299
Are you aware of that?

13
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,299
Isn't that blood?

14
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:51,799
Yes. I asked him if he
wanted me to call a doctor

15
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,000
but he refused.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,400
What should we do?

17
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,400
It's Yoon Wol, My Lord.
I'm coming in.

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,099
You're ever-changing.

19
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,500
You barged in here even though
I hadn't answered you yet.

20
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,400
Weren't you struck by an arrow, My Lord?

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
How could you send the doctor away?

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,699
I'm mostly better now.

23
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,000
What do you mean, you've gotten better?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,300
It's barely been a couple days now!
How could you possibly be better already?

25
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,500
First, we need to get you treated--

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
That world is beyond your
level of comprehension.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
I am not severely wounded, so worry not.

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,599
For what reason did you return, My Lord?

29
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,800
I came to deeply regret not taking
your advice more to heart.

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,699
I do believe that the talisman has become
angry due to my misuse of it

31
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,300
so I have to make everything right now.

32
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Please leave.

33
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,199
Open the gates!

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,300
We know that Kim Boong Do
is hiding out here!

35
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,599
Weren't you planning
to leave this place anyway?

36
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,500
So for what reason
did you return to the past?

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,000
You say that you'll testify, prove your
innocence, and maintain your honor

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,300
but what good is your honor?

39
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,900
Please, leave this place.

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,300
I may leave when the time comes,
but I must do what I must.

41
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,500
Can you not feel the
tension in the city?

42
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,000
The capital is overflowing with rumors of
the king planning to behead the queen!

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,699
Even the queen will face that sort
of fate, so surely you, My Lord...

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,199
The citizens are filled with rage.

45
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,000
You cannot escape this situation!

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Please, leave!

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,599
Didn't you get angry last time
when I said I'd be leaving?

48
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,500
I was jealous.

49
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,000
I...

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,500
had harbored foolish
feelings in my heart.

51
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,699
I told you that I wished for nothing
but your happiness, My Lord.

52
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:57,800
But the truth was that I'd hoped that
you'd always remain by my side, it seems.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,800
The officials are here, My Lord!
What are we to do?

54
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,300
Open the gates for them before
all of you are taken away as well.

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
Yes, My Lord.

56
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,399
My Lord!

57
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,000
<i>The situation looks quite grim,
Your Highness.</i>

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,800
There is nothing we can do now.

59
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,000
You must place the blame
for everything on that man.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,199
You must tell them that young man
came to you multiple times

61
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,000
and dared to try and harass you

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,199
but that you firmly sent him away.

63
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,600
That'd be for the best.

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,899
I cannot say such a thing.

65
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,500
When you all left me
and were in hiding...

66
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,699
he was the only one who risked
his life to save me.

67
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,800
Saying that he tried to harass me
would be dishonorable.

68
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Your Highness.

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I cannot say the words that
you people wish to hear me utter

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
so do not foster any false hopes.

71
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
If the king refuses to believe me
and decides to punish me

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
I'd rather accept that punishment.

73
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,899
How could you say such a thing?

74
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,500
<i>- Your Highness.</i>
- What is it?

75
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,800
They say that Sir Kim of Hongmoongwan
is currently meeting with the king.

76
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I, Kim Boong Do, have heard of your
summons just now, and have come.

77
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,899
Just now, eh?

78
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,300
My deepest apologies, Your Highness.

79
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,300
I was struck by arrows and
escaped, but fell unconscious

80
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,699
and I just awoke today.

81
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,300
You fell unconscious after
being struck by the arrows?

82
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,000
So where have you been
all this time, then?

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,399
My deepest apologies, Your Highness.

84
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,399
I do remember
getting struck by the arrows

85
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,000
but I'd already been in the captivity of
people unbeknownst to me when I'd awoke.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,199
I risked my life to escape, and
just barely managed to get home.

87
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,399
So you were kidnapped, eh?

88
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,699
But after getting to the city

89
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,600
I heard people saying that I disappeared
by using some ungodly talisman.

90
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,699
Furthermore, I heard rumors accusing me
of doing all sorts of ludicrous things

91
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,300
and was quite shocked.

92
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:33,399
I swear to you, Your Highness,
that all of that was a machination

93
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,100
by those who had kidnapped me.

94
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
It is true that I have
a talisman with me

95
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,199
but it is a generic one written by
a monk to help me rest at ease.

96
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,800
How could something like that
possess any sort of ungodly power?

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,699
Such claims are no better
than the old wives' tales

98
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,899
exchanged by those who
frequent the temple.

99
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,500
And regarding that one
rumor circling the city

100
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,800
which is too loathsome
for me to even say aloud...

101
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,300
I believe that the only ones who'd
believe such a ludicrous rumor

102
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,300
are those who harbor ill will
toward the royal family.

103
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,800
How could such a thing ever be true?

104
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,699
How do you explain the
testimonies of those who claimed

105
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,300
to have seen you in the Queen's
chambers while she was exiled, then?

106
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,699
And what say you regarding the fact that
you'd also mysteriously disappeared

107
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,000
from your hut on Jeju
Island at that time, as well?

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,100
And furthermore, when you said that you'd
gone to your hometown, but hadn't

109
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,500
it was around the same time that
people claimed to have seen

110
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,199
someone just like you in the
Queen's private quarters!

111
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,800
What say you regarding that?

112
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:49,199
Is this not your attempt to confuse me
with your cunning words, once more?

113
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,399
That is all a part of the
traitors' plot, Your Highness!

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,300
The traitors' plot?

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,399
Are you implying that Min Am, who
is currently jailed, planned all this

116
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,399
and is framing you for all of this?

117
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:14,399
"A dead Zhuge scares away
a living Zhongda," eh?

118
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,300
But that is the truth, Your Highness.

119
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,100
If what you are saying is true

120
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,199
Min Am, who has been cut off
from the rest of the world

121
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,600
must immediately be sentenced to death
by dismemberment for treason!

122
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,000
What are all of your thoughts
regarding this matter?

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,100
I cannot trust either Min Am
or Kim Boong Do

124
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,500
so whose words should I trust?

125
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Do none of you have an opinion
regarding this matter?

126
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Shall I decide what to do, then?

127
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,200
Drag Min Am out from
the cells, immediately!

128
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm sure that a royal decree pardoning
you will be passed in a few days.

129
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,299
You must have suffered quite a bit
up until now, sire.

130
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:59,399
It's not completely over yet, so we
can't rest at ease just yet.

131
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,000
It might as well be over, though, sir.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,299
I'm sure the only thing that the
king is deliberating upon now

133
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:07,600
is how the queen will be executed,
based on his character.

134
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,100
What else will be left for
him to do after that, then?

135
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,399
He'll have to release her
political opponents, of course.

136
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,700
It's been a mere month since
she reclaimed her position.

137
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,000
Just a month.

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,799
Given that, this will
surely go down in history.

139
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,399
Come out.

140
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,799
What's going on?

141
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,600
The king has ordered you
to come to the palace.

142
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,399
The king wants him?
Why, all of a sudden?

143
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,399
The king says he wants to cross-examine
both you and Sir Kim Boong Do.

144
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,000
Kim Boong Do?

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,200
So that man has been captured, then?
Where?

146
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,500
He came to see the king
of his own accord.

147
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,000
I direct this question to Min Am.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Kim Boong Do stated that the incident
in which he was struck by arrows

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,799
as well as the scandalous rumors
about him and his talisman

150
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,899
were all a part of your plan.

151
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,299
Is that true?

152
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,399
Those are nothing but lies,
Your Highness!

153
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,899
In my current state,
I am completely immobilized.

154
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,399
So how could I have planned
all of those things?

155
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,399
Is that right?

156
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,000
I also heard while I was in jail
that he'd disappeared into thin air!

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,399
Kim Boong Do claims his disappearance
was due to your men kidnapping him.

158
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,299
Kidnapping?
Of course not!

159
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,299
I heard that he disappeared before
countless citizens' eyes!

160
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,299
So how could I have possibly
gotten him kidnapped?

161
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,299
This has nothing to do with me
in the slightest, Your Highness!

162
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,399
I also do believe that the
kidnapping claim is far-fetched.

163
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,000
It seems like nothing but a weak,
baseless excuse to me.

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Your Highness!

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,200
How could you believe that a mere
talisman could hold magical powers

166
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,299
and yet call a kidnapping
"far-fetched?"

167
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,600
If you were to acknowledge
the veracity of this rumor

168
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,799
this land will be plagued with
superstitious rumors--

169
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,500
There is no need to draw this out!

170
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,100
Prove your innocence through your death!

171
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:32,799
Ever since five years ago,
up until what happened today

172
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,399
you conspired with others around you

173
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
and insulted me and expressed
contempt toward me, to no end

174
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,799
and tried to put me under your thumbs!

175
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,000
And I've become quite
disillusioned toward both of you.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,799
Therefore, I have no intention of
siding with either one of you.

177
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,700
I did treasure you once, but
I won't forgive you for this incident

178
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,799
even if you pay the ultimate
price with your life.

179
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,799
And even if you are innocent

180
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,899
you must take responsibility
no matter what

181
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:03,500
for causing chaos among the citizens
and dishonoring the royal family's name!

182
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,899
Shoot arrows at Kim Boong Do!

183
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,799
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness.

184
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,200
Since we only have testimonies
and no decisive evidence

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
this is the only way to know the truth.

186
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,399
Your Highness, please calm yourself
and give this more thought.

187
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,500
After you've heard the opinions
of your cabinet, you can--

188
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,700
Your opinions be damned!

189
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,600
Do you think I'm unaware
of the fact that you will try

190
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,700
to talk me into sparing him
with your damned opinions?

191
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,299
I'll squander my entire life, listening
to all the opinions you all have!

192
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,799
What are you doing?
I told you to raise your bow!

193
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,700
I will promise you this
in front of everyone who is here.

194
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,700
If you are still struck by the arrow
and die by it while holding onto this

195
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,500
I will believe that everything
was a part of Min Am's plot

196
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,000
and I will punish him accordingly.

197
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,299
However, if you do disappear

198
00:12:56,299 --> 00:13:01,399
you will have saved your own life
but prove that all the rumors are true

199
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,299
so you will never be able to
set foot in Joseon ever again.

200
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:08,649
And everyone with ties to you
will pay the price in your stead!

201
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,600
Give Kim Boong Do the talisman
and shoot arrows at him!

202
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,299
What are you doing?

203
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,200
Raise your bows!

204
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,399
What a peculiar feeling this is.

205
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,299
I never thought things
would end up in this way.

206
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
This surely isn't the best-
case scenario I had in mind

207
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,700
but I do think that this isn't
the absolute worst-case scenario.

208
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,700
There's no other way I'd be able to
put an end to the feud between us.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,299
You bastard...
did you, by any chance...

210
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,799
Did you truly think that I would've
handed over the real talisman?

211
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,399
Let us die together.

212
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,500
The road to the afterlife won't
be lonely for either one of us

213
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,600
and I don't think it'll be half-bad.

214
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,299
Shoot him!

215
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,899
Raise your bows!

216
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,600
Shoot him!

217
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,600
Yes!
Well, that can't be helped.

218
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,200
It's fine.

219
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,600
Yes, yes, yes.
See you next time, yes.

220
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Damn it, this pisses me the hell off!

221
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,399
Hey, Han Dong Min's people even
canceled a photoshoot with us!

222
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,200
Aren't they going too far, here?
Why do they keep targeting us with work?

223
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,000
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

224
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,399
Was I...

225
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:48,000
was I deceived by that
man's schemes once more?

226
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,399
Bring him to my royal doctor!
What are you all doing?

227
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,500
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

228
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,500
Hey, I said let's go eat before we go.

229
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,100
You don't want to?

230
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,600
Can you stop the car for a second?

231
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,000
Why?

232
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,299
I don't feel too good.

233
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,299
What's the matter?
Do you have indigestion?

234
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:22,500
You didn't even eat anything
this morning, though.

235
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,599
Want me to go and buy some medicine?

236
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,099
- Soo Kyung.
- Yeah?

237
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,200
Can you look up something for me again?

238
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,299
- Look up something?
- I can't bear to look myself.

239
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:33,900
Sure, but look up what?

240
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:41,400
The 20th year of Sukjong's
reign in Joseon, June 5th.

241
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
This is what you want me to read for you?

242
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,799
"Sir Kim Boong Do, who'd concealed
himself, appeared once more--"

243
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,599
Huh? Kim Boong Do?

244
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,700
Hey, he has the same name
as that other guy!

245
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799
"Sir Kim Boong Do appeared
and claimed his innocence"

246
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,000
"and claimed that everything was
a part of Min Am's plan."

247
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,400
"At this, the king claimed that Sir Kim
was trying to dishonor his court"

248
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,799
"and told him to be shot by arrows
to prove his innocence."

249
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,000
"The king called his soldiers and had
him shot by arrows in front of everyone."

250
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,700
"He died on the spot due to having been
struck by three arrows."

251
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,299
When I'd examined him, he'd
already breathed his last breath

252
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:27,400
and I couldn't save him,
Your Highness.

253
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,200
Thanks to you, I sentenced
my closest friend to death

254
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,799
and was filled with doubt once more!

255
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,799
Do you really think that
I will spare you after this?

256
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,799
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

257
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,400
You cannot do this, Your Highness!

258
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,000
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

259
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,799
This man must be sentenced to death!

260
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,000
All of you, go back to my audience hall!

261
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:13,500
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

262
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,799
"The king was filled with sorrow
and sentenced Min Am to death."

263
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,500
"And all those involved with him
were ordered to leave the country."

264
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,907
Want me to keep reading?

265
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,299
Hey!

266
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,299
Yes, Section Chief?

267
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,900
Oh my.
Oh, really?

268
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,299
Oh, I didn't know that
the time had been changed.

269
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,599
Oh, yes.
We'll be right there.

270
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,599
Yes.

271
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,000
Damn it, when did they
change the time?

272
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,200
Man, I don't think
we'll have any time to eat.

273
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,799
What should we do?
Want to stop by a pharmacy?

274
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,099
Are you really indigested?

275
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,700
Hey, Hee Jin!
What's wrong?

276
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,200
Hey! Oh my gosh!
Hey!

277
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,500
Whoa!

278
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,000
Whoa!

279
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,000
- Careful.
- Ow!

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,500
- Watch your step.
- Ow!

281
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,200
This way!
This way!

282
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,000
Which part hurts the most?

283
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,700
My leg.
My leg.

284
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,000
- Your leg?
- Ow!

285
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,799
Wait, no.
My hip.

286
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,299
Excuse me,
where were you hurt?

287
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:04,500
What part of your body hurts?

288
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,799
Please tell us what
part of your body hurts.

289
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,200
Can you hear me?

290
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,299
Um, please say something.

291
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,000
The doctor will only be able to
diagnose you if you say something.

292
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:22,500
Why are you crying?
Where does it hurt?

293
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,200
Ms. Choi Hee Jin.
Ms. Choi Hee Jin?

294
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,400
Hey, what's wrong?

295
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,500
Hey, what's wrong?
Why are you crying?

296
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Take a good look at her to
figure out why she's in pain!

297
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,000
What will we do now that the last
of this family's bloodline is gone?

298
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,400
And what are we going to do
about the family's servants?

299
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Aren't there other issues, as well?

300
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,299
Well, I'm sure that this home
will slowly fall into disrepair, too.

301
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,700
Your Highness.
I worry for your health.

302
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,900
<i>(Queen In Hyun's Man)</i>

303
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,799
Hey.

304
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,200
Han Dong Min!

305
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,000
What?

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,599
Ms. Hee Jin got into an accident.
Shouldn't you go visit her?

307
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,599
An accident?

308
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,500
Both her and Ms. Soo Kyung
have been hospitalized.

309
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,000
Well, how badly hurt is she?

310
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,599
Ms. Soo Kyung needs to keep a cast on
and needs to stay there for a month.

311
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,400
And Ms. Hee Jin...

312
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,700
doesn't seem to be too badly hurt.
But still, she's been hospitalized.

313
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,799
I did feel bad enough as it is, since
we canceled the photoshoot on them.

314
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,000
But she got into an accident
pretty much right after I called her.

315
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,500
I feel so bad.

316
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,700
Why should you feel bad about anything?
You're being so ridiculous.

317
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
Are you out of your mind?

318
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Aren't you the crazy one, here?

319
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,299
You're really not going to go, even
though she got into an accident?

320
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,599
I'll go by myself if I have to.
If you're not going to go.

321
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:27,400
They said they're in suite 1003.
That's that way.

322
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, there's Ms. Soo Kyung.

323
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,500
Just look at her.

324
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,799
We're here, Ms. Soo Kyung.

325
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,000
Are you badly hurt?

326
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,099
Well, you know, I just--

327
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:39,900
No, no, no, no,
prop your leg back up.

328
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,400
Oh man.

329
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
Did you sprain it, or break it?

330
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,799
- It's broken, but it'll heal soon.
- Oh.

331
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:21,599
Hey.

332
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,700
Why are you crying?

333
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,799
Are you in that much pain?

334
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,900
Here, be careful.
Here you are.

335
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,299
Hey!

336
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,799
When did you come in here?

337
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:42,799
Oh, Hee Jin is sleeping.
Just leave her alone.

338
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,799
Huh?

339
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Um, sure.

340
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,799
Where is she hurt, exactly?

341
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,700
Just here and there and everywhere.

342
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,099
She's fine. I'm the one
who almost died, here.

343
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,700
Man, I'm relieved that
you weren't more severely hurt!

344
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,299
Here, hurry and lie down!

345
00:25:58,299 --> 00:25:59,299
Sure, sure.

346
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,700
- Here, here.
- Oh, yes.

347
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,099
Man, I'm so tired.
Why are we so busy?

348
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,700
Oh, damn it!

349
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
What's your problem?

350
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,299
Was I being too harsh to her?

351
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:23,400
Wait, no! Isn't it only natural
that I got mad?

352
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
What is it now?

353
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,700
Man, this is eating away at me inside.

354
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,599
Why is she crying like an idiot?

355
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:32,700
Ugh.

356
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:58,299
Yes, I'm getting discharged today.

357
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,700
Yes.
I'll call you as soon as I get home.

358
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,400
All right.

359
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,500
I'm telling you,
they're one and the same!

360
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,000
The actress Choi Hee Jin
was his guardian!

361
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
They do look alike...

362
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,200
but no way.

363
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,099
Hey, I was the nurse who
was in charge of him.

364
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:20,500
And I'm telling you,
he looks just like that guy!

365
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Why doesn't she know, then?

366
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,200
It seemed that Choi Hee Jin
didn't know anything about this at all.

367
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,799
There are so many
strange things about all this.

368
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,200
What are you talking about?

369
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh my.

370
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,000
I heard you two talking
about Choi Hee Jin.

371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,299
So I was wondering what
you two were talking about.

372
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,000
Well...

373
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,299
What is it?

374
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:39,799
Well, that is...

375
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:43,799
The patient who was in the ICU
disappeared this morning.

376
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,299
And?

377
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,299
You know the patient who you
claimed to be the guardian for?

378
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,500
That man.

379
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,799
He looks way too similar
to him, you see.

380
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,000
What?

381
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,000
They said that he looked
just like Kim Boong Do.

382
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,200
And he'd been struck with arrows,
just as he'd been before

383
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,799
when he was admitted to the ER.

384
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,299
And it's not like there are many
patients who come in with arrow wounds!

385
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:06,799
Isn't it weird?

386
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:10,000
Where is that man?

387
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,400
They said he disappeared again.

388
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,700
He was on the brink of death,
and they barely saved him

389
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,299
but he disappeared this morning!

390
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,299
As if into thin air!

391
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,200
They said they had no idea how a person
in the ICU could walk out and leave.

392
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,000
They said that it was so strange!

393
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,500
<i>I'll take responsibility for everything.</i>

394
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,900
<i>I can do it.</i>

395
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,400
I'll definitely resolve all this
and come back.

396
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,299
<i>(One Month Later)</i>

397
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,299
Please come out.

398
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:22,500
The prisoners Min Am,
Moon Dae Soon, and Moon Dae Wol.

399
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,599
You are charged for treason and
trying to wreak havoc within the nation

400
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,200
as well as daring to disobey the king and
showing contempt toward the royal family.

401
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
And thus, you are
sentenced to be beheaded!

402
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:17,900
<i>(One Month Prior)</i>

403
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,799
Your Highness.

404
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,000
You scoundrel!
Do you have a death wish?

405
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,599
Did I not tell you that
you may not enter?

406
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,799
Yes, Your Highness.

407
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,700
But this arrow with a missive attached
was stuck in the front of your chambers!

408
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,400
What did you say?

409
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,700
Your Highness.

410
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,400
You scoundrel!

411
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,500
My deepest apologies, Your Highness,
for returning so late.

412
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,200
I did have my suspicions.

413
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,700
So it was true that you used magic?

414
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,799
Yes, it is true.

415
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,700
And it is also true that this
talisman saved my life.

416
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,799
It's also true that I was able to escape
the place where I was exiled...

417
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,000
and visited the Queen by using this.

418
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:47,200
You cur!
How dare you!

419
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,200
It is true that I used to visit her.

420
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:56,299
But the reason I visited her
was for your sake, Your Highness.

421
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,700
What did you say?

422
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,099
On that night...

423
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,200
<i>the one who shot the arrow toward you</i>

424
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,900
<i>with a missive detailing the
assassination attempt against you was me.</i>

425
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,700
Let's just say that you're
telling the truth now.

426
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,500
But do you truly believe
that I can forgive you

427
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,400
for showing contempt
toward the royal family?

428
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,700
Even if the talk regarding
the queen were all mere rumors

429
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,400
or the ministers had set up
a trap for you and deceived you

430
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
or the country fell into turmoil

431
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,799
the charges against you are
more than punishable by death!

432
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,700
I am fully aware that my sins
cannot ever be forgiven.

433
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,599
But I was fully aware
of what you wished for

434
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,400
and believed that everything I did was
for the sake of carrying out your will.

435
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,900
Therefore, I felt no remorse
toward my actions.

436
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,599
Isn't this what you wanted?

437
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,400
To reinstate the queen to her position
and punish Minister Min for his crimes?

438
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,500
But now, you are doubting
the queen due to false rumors.

439
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,000
I believed that I had to stop things
from dissolving into chaos at all costs

440
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,200
when we'd worked so hard to
restore order.

441
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,400
This is why I returned.

442
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,799
Really, now?

443
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,900
Yes, it is true that everything
that happened that night

444
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,700
were things that I'd
wish would happen.

445
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,200
And that is why I do not wish
to make all of this public

446
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,799
and allow those people to
regain political power once more.

447
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,000
However!

448
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,700
I must punish you
in one way or another.

449
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,299
How could I possibly trust someone who
deceived the royals and used magic?

450
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,799
That's right.

451
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,700
Please...

452
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,599
kill me, Your Highness.

453
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,400
What did you just say?

454
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,099
The situation became like this because
I evaded the death meant for me.

455
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,599
I feel that I must die as I was fated to
in order to restore peace and balance.

456
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:01,400
So please, kill me.

457
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,599
There is no other way to quell the
rumors spread by the citizens nowadays.

458
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,599
I must die and prove that the rumors
about the talisman are a lie.

459
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,400
This is the only way.

460
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,300
Do you truly mean that?

461
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,400
Yes, I do.

462
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,099
But in exchange, please execute
Minister Min after executing me.

463
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,400
That man knows about this
talisman's existence.

464
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,800
And we cannot be sure of what he'll do
next to arouse suspicion even after I die

465
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,500
as long as he remains alive.

466
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,699
Your Highness!

467
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,699
Let's go.

468
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:57,500
<i>Are you asking me to kill you
with my own hands?</i>

469
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,199
Are you using magic again?

470
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,000
How could you just forfeit your life
and make a request like that?

471
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,300
The reason I'm asking you to kill me
is so that I can live, Your Highness.

472
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,099
I will live.

473
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,500
I truly do wish to live.

474
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,000
So, please...

475
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,500
help me die with honor,
Your Highness.

476
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,500
If you do, I will never appear
in Joseon ever again.

477
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:38,300
My Lord!

478
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:40,300
You came here without
being seen by anyone?

479
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,400
But of course, sire!

480
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,000
But, what happened?

481
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:46,599
There is an arrest warrant out for you!
What will you do now, sire?

482
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:54,000
Remember this spot well.

483
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,699
If I am struck by arrows at the
palace tomorrow, and die

484
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:58,699
you must take my corpse
and bring it here as soon as possible.

485
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,599
What?
Your corpse?

486
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:05,599
There is a great chance that I may die,
but I do have a sliver of a chance.

487
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,800
So you must bring me here,
no matter what.

488
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,199
You must not delay.

489
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:16,500
Was I...

490
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,699
was I deceived by that man's
schemes once more?

491
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:26,599
What are you all doing?
Bring him to my doctor!

492
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,099
- Go!
- Yes, sir!

493
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,699
Is he dead?

494
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,599
He is still breathing, but he
has no chance of surviving.

495
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,800
Then, there would be no problem
with saying that he is dead now.

496
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,300
Declare that he is dead.

497
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Pardon?

498
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,599

For the most part.

514
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,400
I cannot read,
so I didn't know what it said.

515
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
So I asked them to write it down for me.

516
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Please read it over
to see if there are any errors.

517
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,000
Mak Dong said that
they'd stay in Hanyang

518
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,800
so I sent them over to Sir Park's home.

519
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,599
And the rest of them are
going to the elder's home.

520
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,599
Oh, and Yoon Wol
returned to the gisaeng house.

521
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,800
The gisaeng house?

522
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,199
That was the best option for her.

523
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,099
You weren't around,
so it'd be a bit strange

524
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,300
for her to follow the other
servants to another family's home.

525
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,400
Regarding Yoon Wol--

526
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,199
I'm sorry, but I told her everything.

527
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,099
I mean, I felt that it'd be too unfair
to keep this a secret from her, too!

528
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:57,199
So I told her that you're
actually alive!

529
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,800
But that she'd never be able
to see you again.

530
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:04,599
And what did she say to that?

531
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,400
So just know that.

532
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,900
You may never be able to see him again,
but at least he's still alive.

533
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,800
Isn't that right?

534
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,199
You're right.

535
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,699
At least he's alive.

536
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:29,800
Everything has been taken care of now.

537
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:34,300
Now that I've ensured that all of
you will be living comfortably

538
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,400
all I can do now is trust
my maternal uncle.

539
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,300
Shouldn't you be going now, as well?

540
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:42,000
Let us go.

541
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,300
Let us part ways here.

542
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,800
Just how long are you planning
to cry, when you are a man?

543
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,199
Will I truly never be able to
see you again, My Lord?

544
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,000
I am someone who has already died.

545
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,099
It is only right that I
disappear from this land.

546
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:08,500
My Lord!

547
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,400
Go on, then.

548
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:18,199
Go!
Hyah!

549
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,000
My Lord!

550
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,500
My Lord!

551
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,099
My Lord!

552
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,300
Let's go!
Hyah!

553
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:32,500
You should take your leave now, as well.

554
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,900
You've worked quite hard up until now.

555
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:43,400
Hyah!

556
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,699
Hyah!

557
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:39,500
My Lord!
My Lord!

558
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:55,500
Have you truly gone, My Lord?

559
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:59,400
My Lord!

560
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,199
If I keep meeting you, I might end up
being the one who defies death.

561
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,099
I may be a bit late, but...

562
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:30,300
I've come back.

563
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,599
Are you crying?
Why?

564
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,900
Who knows?

565
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,599
I have no idea why, but...

566
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:48,500
now that I no longer
have a place to return to...

567
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,400
I truly feel like I've
become orphaned.

568
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:11,199
You upset me so much that I was planning
to slap you or something when I saw you.

569
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:14,000
But I can't even say anything to you
now, since you're crying.

570
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:19,000
You really are a player.
A born player.

571
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,400
Why would you feel lonely?

572
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,000
You have me, after all.

573
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:32,599
Me! You have me!

574
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:35,000
The most beautiful woman on earth.

575
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:58,900
It's all over now, right?

576
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:04,800
Yes, it is.

577
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:09,300
It really is over, right?

578
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,000
Probably.

579
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,500
There are many terms that
I do not quite understand

580
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,199
and there are also many words
I've just heard for the first time.

581
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,699
But one term hasn't changed
throughout the years.

582
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,000
What?

583
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:48,599
I love you.
