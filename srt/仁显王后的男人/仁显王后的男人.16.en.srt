-=1 year later=-

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,730
I am still preparing.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,910
You will also clear the
trash on that day, right?

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,990
Yes, yes. Call me then.

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,300
8 o'clock. Yes.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,950
There's nothing worth taking. Not even one...

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,770
Hello?

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,200
Hey! You can't throw that tea set away.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,380
I already threw it away.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,960
I knew you would, that's why I called.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,370
Don't throw it away, seriously.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,810
Hey. I haven't seen you use it even once to drink tea.

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,200
You don't even use it...

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,710
I will use it.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,050
I was saving it to use when we move to a 
better house.

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,030
Just leave it.

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,010
Okay, I get it...

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,660
You better leave it.
I will really get angry if it's gone.

20
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,070
Just concentrate on your poster shoot.
I'm taking care of everything else.

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,200
Hello?

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,370
This is really...
I should be there.

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,880
Are you moving?

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,870
Yes.  It's the first time that I bought 
a house, so I'm moving.

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,500
Wow, that must feel great.

26
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,740
You've earned quite a bit of money, 
haven't you.

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,810
In the past year, I have 
seen you in several commercials.

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,580
The appearance fees were pretty 
minimal, so I didn't earn much.

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,150
President, you have a call.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
Please wait a moment.

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Director?

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,310
Miss Hui Jin, have you been well?

33
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,250
Yes. How about you, Director?

34
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,490
I've been busy. I called because
I have a favor to ask of you.

35
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,700
What is it?

36
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,290
My colleague from the educational department,
he's been pestering me to contact you
about a role.

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,620
Could you record a narration?

38
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,470
Narration?

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,820
He said it must be done
by you, Hui Jin.

40
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,980
He said that if it isn't Hui Jin, 
the production won't be possible.

41
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,720
How can that be?
What kind of production would be impossible without me.

42
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,550
Thank you so much for agreeing to do this.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,660
The director asked me as a favor,
so of course I have to do it.

44
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,600
But why does it have to be me?

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,750
This is the program "Untold Stories of History."

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,100
A documentary program that rediscovers 
figures who were hidden in history.

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840
I have seen it a few times.

48
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,090
But the name for the special this 
time is "Queen In Hyeon's Man."

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,020
Queen In Hyeon's Man?

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,730
But what does Queen In Hyeon's Man mean?

51
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,680
Do you know about the unofficial historical
rumor that Queen In Hyeon had a lover?

52
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,090
Really? The drama I acted in didn't 
mention anything about that.

53
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,550
It was probably left out because it was
such a minor episode.

54
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,630
There was only a very short record of 
it in the Chronicles.

55
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,210
But last month, some very interesting
evidence was discovered.

56
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,830
I wanted to do a good job
with it this time. So I am 
counting on you.

57
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,220
Yes, I'll do my best.

58
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,410
Aren't we late?

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,290
I already called to say that we'll be
30 minutes late.

60
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,460
Queen In Hyeon's Man...

61
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,450
If you look at the Chronicles of
1694, Suk Jong's 20th year, the 5th month,

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,000
there is an interesting passage.

63
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,050
It's about the Officer of Special Advisers Administrator 
at that time, Gim Bung Do of the West Faction.

64
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,950
There was a rumor that he frequently visited Queen 
In Hyeon's private residence while she was exiled.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,750
This rumor circulated among the people.

66
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,600
Gim Bung Do?

67
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,670
This is my first time hearing this. 
It wasn't in the script.

68
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,130
Gim Bung Do...

69
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,740
So tiring. I'm going to die.

70
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,760
You're back.

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,440
Hey, what was that earlier? What is this
documentary narration? Did you meet
the director?

72
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,290
I am looking at the notes now.

73
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,120
Why did you agree?
It's just wasting time.

74
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,210
I think it'll be interesting.
The title is "Queen In Hyeon's Man".

75
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,630
Not Lady Jang's man. Isn't it unique?

76
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,390
Queen In Hyeon's Man?

77
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,370
Isn't Queen In Hyeon's man Suk Jong?

78
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,510
No. Listen.

79
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,710
At that time, the Second Minister of the Board 
of Personnel had a son, called Gim Bung Do.

80
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,030
This man is Queen In Hyeon's man.

81
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,800
The rumor was that when Queen In Hyeon 
was deposed and living outside of the palace,

82
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,360
she and this man were lovers.

83
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,810
This rumor reached Suk Jong's ears.

84
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,790
Really?

85
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,070
It's true.

86
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,650
So, when Suk Jong brought Gim Bung Do 
in for interrogation,

87
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,840
he died.

88
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,680
But it was discovered that
that wasn't the truth.

89
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,240
He was wronged.

90
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,380
The conclusion was that he died an undeserved
death because of baseless rumors. That was 
the end of the story in the Chronicles.

91
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,930
I see.

92
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,320
But this documentary is about what 
happened after that.

93
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,550
It gets interesting from here onwards.

94
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,700
It was clearly recorded in the Chronicles 
that this man had died.

95
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,940
But now it has been discovered that there 
were records of him alive after that.

96
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,020
Not long ago.

97
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,220
<i>The descendants of Nam Gu Man, a prime
minister at that time,</i>

98
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,730
<i>revealed a memorandum last month
that was written by the Minister.</i>

99
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,310
<i>In the memorandum, there was a record
of Nam Gu Man's sighting of the still-living
Gim Bung Do.</i>

100
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,460
What are you saying?

101
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,110
Nam Gu Man went on an inspection of the 
border region and happened to see him.

102
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,130
The Gim Bung Do who was thought to be dead.

103
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,110
That was one year after Gim Bung Do was 
recorded as dead in the Chronicles.

104
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,060
It seems that everybody is tired. Take a rest first.

105
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,890
-=The year 1695, the 5th month, 
Pyeongan Province, Euiju=-

106
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,860

107
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,270
The food isn't good here.

108
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,010
It doesn't matter. Let's go somewhere nearby.

109

110
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,880
Yes.

-=Prime Minister Nam Gu Man=-

112
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,850
Please go inside.

113
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,570
No need. It's refreshing here.

114
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,560
Is there something I can use to wash my hands?

115
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,300
I'll bring it for you.

116
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,510
Where is it?

117
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,910
Aigoo, are you all right?
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)

118
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,880
Wait.

119
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,950
Wait a minute.
You look like someone I know.

120
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,750
Hey, that--

121
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,440
Did something happen?

122
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,460
What is going on? I saw a dead man.

123
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,060
What?

124
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,040
Chase the man who ran away just now. 
Find out who he is.

125
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,030
Yes.

126
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,850
<i>A man who is tall and has short hair.</i>

127
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,510
<i>Ah, he's in this room.</i>

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,680
<i>But it seemed like he's about to leave.</i>

129
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,310
Look here, do you realize that the person
you just bumped into was the Prime Minister?

130
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,940
His Excellency wants to see you. 
You have to come with us.

131
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,810
Catch him! Catch him!

132
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,490
When I said he had to leave with us, 
he ran away without saying anything.

133
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,020
Only this was left in the room.

134
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,150
This is not a book that can be read by commoners.

135
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,590
This handwriting is clearly Administrator Gim's.

136
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,280
What on earth is going on?

137
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,480
Where should we go? 
Where do you want to go?

138
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,890
This way? 
Okay, let's go and see.

139
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,360
The people are living safely. The military 
personnel discipline is also very strict.

140
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,950
Is there anything else?

141
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,960
There was a strange incident.

142
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,290
A strange incident?

143
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,310
In Euiju, I happened to see a person who
looked exactly like Administrator Gim.

144
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:11,260
Not only did his appearance and figure look 
the same, his handwriting and writing style 
were also very similar.

145
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,570
So much so that I had the illusion that
the Administrator was still alive.

146
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,190
I wanted to detain him in order to question
him properly, but he disappeared.

147
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,670
Did the Administrator look like he had 
been suffering?

148
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,030
What? Your Majesty.

149
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,450
I owe Bung Do a debt.

150
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,980
Your Majesty. Do Seung Ji has arrived.

151
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,110
Let him in.

152
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,230
Refrain from saying that you've seen someone 
who looks like him. He's already a dead man.

153
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,950
Yes. Certainly.

154
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,440
<i>I have no way of knowing what happened 
between the King and Gim Bung Do.</i>

155
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,350
<i>But I am certain that he's alive, 
and in order not to be caught,</i>

156
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,190
<i>he is traveling around the border regions.</i>

157
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,390
<i>Because I know that the Administrator's sacrifice
was necessary for the stability of the Royal Court,</i>

158
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,550
<i>my heart hurts to think of his difficult life.</i>

159
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,520
<i>However, to us,</i>

160
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,280
<i>his existence must forever remain a secret.</i>

161
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,780
Aren't you going to sleep? Is it that interesting?

162
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,750
I feel sorry for this person.

163
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,930
What?

164
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:32,730
Gim Bung Do. Suk Jong didn't kill him 
but chased him to the borders.

165
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,470
It wasn't an affair, but instead a one sided love.

166
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,210
I mean, a man from a prominent family,
who received the top score in the civil
examination at the age of 19,

167
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:46,610
and was highly respected by Suk Jong,
how did he end up in love with the Queen?

168
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,220
His life was totally ruined because of a woman.

169
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,640
Thank you.

170
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,450
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

171
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,590
Where? Looks like he's not from here.

172
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,000
I've definitely seen him somewhere.

173
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,870
Wait a minute.
Aren't you the person from before?

174
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:47,340
The person who came from Hanyang last year,
looking for the great master of Hyeonam Temple?

175
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,350
What brings you here? Seeing as you're 
being hunted.

176
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,820
I had thought that the Eight Provinces 
of Joseon were fairly large,

177
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,290
but they aren't.

178
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,360
Having traveled for a year, I've passed
by the same places many times.

179
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,710
Until when are you going to keep running away? 
Aren't you tired?

180
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:15,640
I am tired. But although it's laughable, 
this has become the reason I'm living for.

181
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,040
Being hunted is not a bad thing.

182
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,840
If I didn't even have the goal of running away,

183
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,650
I don't know how would I have lived each day.

184
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,520
If you have committed a crime,

185
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,790
wouldn't it be better to pay the price of the crime?

186
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,660
I want to do that too.

187
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,000
But to be caught and to pay the price would 
be an even greater crime.

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,060
What do you mean?

189
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,740
I think I have stayed here too long.
I don't want to bring trouble to the temple.

190
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,210
Over there!

191
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,880
Don't say that you know me.

192
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,300
We have orders to arrest this man on charges 
of murder. Come without making a fuss.

193
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,170
- Tie him up. 
- Yes.

194
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,690
Start.

195
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,690
Last month, a memorandum by Prime Minister
Nam Gu Man was revealed.

196
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,890
His memorandum included a detailed report

197
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:59,100
of his unexpected meeting with Gim Bung Do
and his conversation with King Suk Jong.

198
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,840
A letter written by Gim Bung Do, which
was revealed along with the memorandum,

199
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,110
is also drawing attention.

200
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,640
The letter was written one month after
it was recorded in the Chronicles that 
he died in the 6th month of the year 1694.

201
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,450
In it, his deep affection towards a nameless person

202
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:20,720
and the sadness of their parting is evident.

203
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:29,530
Considering the circumstances at the time,
scholars speculate that the letter was intended
for Queen In Hyeon.

204
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,600
Start.

205
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,940
<i>This is a letter that's written both
to you and to me at the same time.</i>

206
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,140
I might forget that I had ever written this letter...

207
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,280
<i>Or even this letter itself might disappear.</i>

208
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:54,360
<i>For me or for you, this letter is written for 
whoever may live holding on to the memories.</i>

209
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,560
<i>If I have a final wish, it is to remember you.</i>

210
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,100
<i>In a life without aims, to not even have those
memories</i>

211
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,900
<i>would be hell.</i>

212
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,980
<i>And you... Even if you should happen to read this letter
someday far in the future,</i>

213
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:20,780
<i>I pray that you will not be able to realize whom it is for.</i>

214
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,390
Start.

215
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,460
A man who wanted his love to forget him.

216
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,660
It was probably because she was beyond his reach.

217
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,470
As for the man, was he able to 
keep his memories?

218
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,670
It seems that he at least did not forget.

219
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:49,740
The woman is mentioned a few times in other
documents that were found with the letter.

220
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,750
Okay!

221
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,880
The first part is done. You've all worked hard.

222
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:05,630
Aigoo, I think I need a drink. As I get older,
it seems like having a drink does me good.

223
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,880
You've worked hard.

224
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Miss Hui Jin.

225
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,580
You came already.

226
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:27,920
What's up?

227
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,870
For you.

228
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,520
You're doing all sorts of things nowadays.
Even a documentary.

229
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,190
It's because Director Yang asked for a favor.

230
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,400
I thought I saw reports that you were
filming overseas. When did you come back?

231
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,460
Did you miss me?

232
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,930
You must have missed me to search for news about me.

233
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,540
I don't want to say this because you'll
just act superior,

234
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,540
but news about you is all over the internet.
It's impossible not to see it.

235
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,080
It's not acting superior. I am superior.
Only you call it acting.

236
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,820
Why are you here?

237
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,420
You're not dating anyone recently, right? 
I'm so lonely I could die.

238
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,220
Shall we start dating again?

239
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,820
Do you want to work till you die?

240
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,760
What is the use of earning so much money?
I'm lonely and you're lonely too.

241
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,100
I heard you are dating someone in a girl group.

242
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,570
And she's younger than you by 10 years. 
It's been in the news.

243
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:29,180
She's too immature. She's always chattering
and giggling.

244
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,050
No matter how much I look and think about it,
there is no other woman like Choe Hui Jin.

245
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,250
Do I look that easy?

246
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,190
How about a drink tonight?

247
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,060
Don't keep asking me. There, how about
that person over there?

248
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,600
I think the two of you are perfect for each other.

249
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,070
Na Jeong?

250
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,210
Hey, Na Jeong!

251
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,940
What are you doing?

252
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,390
Do you want to date me?

253
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,540
She said we are perfect for each other.

254
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,750
What do you think?

255
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,550
I'm not very happy about it, 
but if you are willing...

256
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,150
I'll do you a favor and date you.

257
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Because I'm too lonely now, I can't afford to be picky.

258
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,620
You're crazy.

259
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,430
You see. She won't do. She's impossible.

260
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,840
When will you grow up?

261
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,430
I don't want to grow up.

262
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,710
What are you doing here again?

263
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,370
Miss Hui Jin.

264
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,500
Hi.

265
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,240
Hurry up, you're out of time.

266
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,310
Button your shirt properly.

267
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,050
I'll call you tomorrow.

268
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,120
I'm very busy.

269
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,390
Wait for me. Are you ready? I'm ready.

270
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,330
Bye!

271
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,590
See you.

272
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,460
Excuse me, Miss Hui Jin.

273
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,000
What is Miss Su Gyeong up to recently?

274
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,470
What are you talking about?

275
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,730
Is she seeing anyone?

276
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,080
Why are you asking?

277
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,560
Because I'm lonely these days.

278
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,500
There isn't anyone, right?

279
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,620
Even though she hasn't said anything,
it seems like there is someone.

280
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,240
Ah, is that so? I see.

281
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,530
You've got to be kidding me.

282
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,800
If he can't sleep at night then he should
just take a sleeping pill.

283
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,870
Why come after me? How can those two be
so alike?

284
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,790
- We're too soft-natured. 
- My thoughts are exactly.

285
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,140
Do they think we're toys for them to pass
the time with? Seriously.

286
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,080
That's what I'm saying.

287
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,810
Really...

288
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:55,420
This old ajussi is setting his sights pretty high. Aigoo.
(Ajussi - older man)

289
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,030
So what did you say?

290
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,660
I said that you're seemed to have a boyfriend.

291
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,100
When did I have a boyfriend?

292
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,040
I had to do that so that he would give up.
Otherwise he'd keep bothering you.

293
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,850
Well...

294
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,960
What? Did I say something wrong?

295
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,260
No. You did well.

296
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,450
This girl is no help to my life.

297
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,390
We're going to be late, please go faster.

298
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,260
That's why I said not to film the documentary!

299
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,190
It's only a few lines of narration, 
so why are they going to the extent
of filming it outdoors?

300
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,660
Just 5 minutes would be enough.

301
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,860
Just because you agreed to do it, they're
trying to milk you for everything they can,
is that it?

302
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,970
Miss Hui Jin, start from here.

303
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,920
The battle between the South and West Factions.

304
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,310
The conflicting fates of Queen In Hyeon 
and Jang Ok Jeong.

305
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:00,780
Announce it like this while walking straight ahead.
And then stop right at the marker for the 5th level
officials and stand there while continuing the commentary.

306
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,660
Okay.

307
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,790
Good.

308
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,410
It's been so long since I've been here.

309
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,310
Pardon?

310
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,660
I came here almost everyday when I was filming 
the drama, but now it's been a year since I came.

311
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,090
I guess that's right.

312
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,760
Wait here for a moment.

313
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,030
Yes.

314
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,670
What are you looking at?

315
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,440
I haven't been here for quite a while.

316
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,860
What? You must be joking.

317
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:11,520
As though you could have been to the palace
before. Who would believe such nonsense.

318
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,780
- Okay, shall we get started?
- Yes.

319
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,860
<i>Cue.</i>

320
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,080
The battle between the South and West Factions.

321
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,280
The conflicting fates of Queen In Hyeon
and Jang Ok Jeong.

322
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,350
This story has been dramatized countless times 
on television. It is the familiar tale of a time
when political power changed hands.

323
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,490
In the year 1694, a battle in political affairs 
led to much bloodshed.

324
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,970
In the midst of that affair, there was 
a man who left an interesting record.

325
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,170
Caught up in allegations of a love affair with
Queen In Hyeon,

326
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,900
this man proved his innocence through
his death in front of King Suk Jong.

327
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,110
He was 27 years of age at the time.
An Office of Special Advisers Administrator 
from the West Faction called Gim Bung Do.

328
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,180
He is today's lead character, Queen In Hyeon's Man.

329
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:25,590
Was he really in love with the Queen?
Or was he falsely accused as written in the Chronicles?

330
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,300
The son of a prominent family, at the 
age of 19 he was a top student in the 
civil examination.

331
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:07,500
He was once highly respected by King Suk Jong.
However, it was recorded that he died because
of his love for the Queen.

332
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,980
In this documentary, we will reveal 
the story of his short life.

333
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,520
<i>Cut. What's the matter?</i>

334
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,730
Why...

335
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,460
Is there a problem?

336
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Let's go. They said the interrogation will
be tomorrow.

337
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,480
Miss Hui Jin. Miss Hui Jin, are you okay?

338
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,820
It seems like something went into my eyes. 
I apologize.

339
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,090
Sorry, I'll do it again.

340
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,690
Oh, I thought...

341
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,230
Okay, let's start again then.

342
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,990
-=Royal Investigation Bureau=-

343
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,860
The interrogation will begin early in the morning.

344
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,930
Who will be questioning me?

345
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,800
Because the charges are so heinous,
head investigator Yun Seong Mun said
he will interrogate you personally.

346
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,070
Yun Seong Mun.

347
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,410
<i>We drew it according to the information
you gave us. However, it did not seem 
like the same man.</i>

348
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,290
<i>My asking you to grant my death,
Your Majesty, is so that I can live.</i>

349
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,090
<i>I will live on. I really want to live.</i>

350
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,900
<i>That's why I'm begging Your Majesty
to let me die with honor.</i>

351
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,500
<i>In the future, I will not
appear in this world again.</i>

352
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,040
<i>I will not appear in this world again.</i>

353
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,320
<i>I will not appear in this world again.</i>

354
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,280
Hello?

355
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,410
Hey, I heard you cried during filming.

356
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,880
Who said that?

357
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,680
That PD called and asked if you were sick.

358
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,420
I'm not sick.

359
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,350
But why did you cry? I heard that you 
cried very sadly.

360
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,820
I don't know why, either.

361
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,690
What do you mean, you don't know?

362
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,230
I don't know. Tears started falling suddenly 
and couldn't stop, so I was confused too.

363
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,300
I suddenly felt really sad, without any reason.

364
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,970
What is this? Did you drink?

365
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,370
What is so sad?

366
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,110
I'm not in a good mood.

367
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,170
Why?

368
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,840
=I said I don't know. I'm just not feeling good.=

369
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,850
Is there any beer at home? 
I think I need to have a drink.

370
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,920
Come back quickly.

371
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,120
Okay, I'll be back very soon.

372
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,380
In the old days, usually the wife would tie this for
her husband when he was leaving for work.

373
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:56,060
So, he would stand like this, and every morning 
his wife would tie it for him.

374
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:03,400
As it was being tied, their eyes would meet
and a feeling would grow.

375
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,870
Then. This. 
This is called the purpose of a tie.

376
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,340
The purpose of the tie.

377
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,930
Why is it raining so frequently?

378
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:25,940
What's wrong? What is this? What is this?

379
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,690
What is this, seriously.

380
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,090
Why am I like this?

381
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:34,280
Player? What player?

382
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,350
Who is the player?

383
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,620
You're a player over there too, right?

384
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,370
Good. Mr Player calls The Most Beautiful Woman in the World.

385
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,370
I will come back after settling everything.

386
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:54,030
Miss Hui Jin. 
Why are you here this late at night?

387
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,010
Why do you look so drenched?

388
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,610
Footage...

389
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,080
What did you say?

390
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:11,090
Please let me have a look at the footage, the one called Queen In Hyeon's man.

391
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,040
This would be a better place if you're watching it alone.

392
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,440
Here.

393
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,450
Did something happen?

394
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,320
Because it's not edited yet, it's still a little bit messy.

395
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:49,530
First, if you want to stop, do this.
If you want to fast forward, do this.

396
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,400
If you have any questions, just ask.

397
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,360
The battle between the South and West Factions.

398
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,230
The conflicting fates of Queen In Hyeon and Jang Ok Jeong.

399
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,300
This story has been dramatized countless times on television.

400
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,700
It is the familiar tale of a time 
when political power changed hands.

401
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,440
In the year 1694, a battle in political affairs led to much bloodshed.

402
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,110
In the midst of that affair, there was a man who left an interesting record.

403
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,580
Caught up in allegations of a love affair with Queen In Hyeon,

404
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,580
this man proved his innocence through his death in front of Suk Jong.

405
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,790
He was 27 years of age at the time. An Office of Special Advisers Administrator from the West Faction called Gim Bung Do.

406
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,990
He is today's lead character, Queen In Hyeon's Man.

407
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,880
A letter written by Gim Bung Do, which was revealed along with the memorandum,
is also drawing attention.

408
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,490
he died in the 6th month of the year 1694.

409
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,160
The letter was written one month after 
it was recorded in the Chronicles.

410
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:31,370
In it, his deep affection towards a nameless person and the sadness of their parting is evident.

411
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:40,170
Considering the circumstances at the time, 
scholars speculate that the letter was intended 
for Queen In Hyeon.

412
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:49,250
This is a letter that's written both to you and to me at the same time.

413
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,590
I might forget that I had written this letter...

414
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,460
Or even this letter itself might disappear.

415
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,660
For me or for you,

416
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,470
this letter is written for whoever may live holding on to the memories.

417
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,610
When I first happened to come into 
possession of this talisman,

418
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,540
I was very curious about
its cause and effect.

419
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:21,550
At first, I thought that the
realization of my dream 
was the effect.

420
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:28,360
Shortly after, I thought
meeting you was its effect.

421
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,630
Then afterwards, I thought
that beginning a new life
in another world was the effect.

422
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,700
But it's only now
that I came to realize its effects.

423
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:44,510
If the cause was me surviving,
then me losing everything 
was the effect.

424
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,580
My future. My honour. My values.

425
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,920
My people. And you, too.

426
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,060
I do not know what will happen now.

427
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,590
Will we forget each other,

428
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:11,330
or will we live unable to forget, forever in agony?

429
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:18,410
If I have a final wish...it is to remember you.

430
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:25,880
In a life without aims, to not even have those memories would be hell.

431
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
And you... as for you...

432
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,350
Even if you should happen to read this letter someday far in the future,

433
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:41,100
I pray that you will not be able to realize whom it is for.

434
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,370
A man who wanted his love to forget him.

435
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:51,240
It was probably because she was beyond his reach.

436
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,380
As for the man, was he able to 
keep his memories?

437
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,380
It seems that he at least did not forget.

438
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:06,190
The woman is mentioned a few times in other 
documents that were found with the letter.

439
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,680
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

440
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,620
Why didn't you answer the phone after calling me?

441
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,930
I had to search for you for so long.

442
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,140
Didn't you call me?

443
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,870
1 hour ago.

444
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,950
Hello?

445
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,200
Hello.

446
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,140
Hello?

447
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,080
Are you listening?

448
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:59,280
Hello? 
Answer me please, the world's most beautiful woman.

449
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,640
Are you going to carry on staring like that?

450
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:28,510
If you called a person who's eating and sleeping well,

451
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,310
shouldn't you take responsibility?

452
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:47,460
Close the door.

453
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,680
Come... over here.

454
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,650
You're real. 
You're still alive.

455
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,670
How have you been for the past year?

456
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,810
I travelled around and left a lover in every province.

457
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,540
And realised that the year passed by quite quickly.

458
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,680
You really know how to lie.

459
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:20,220
The evidence is all here.

460
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,290
What's that?

461
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:35,840
What exactly happened?
The talisman.

462
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,510
The talisman was burnt.

463
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,580
Then how did you come here?

464
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,720
I came back because you called me.

465
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,960
Me?

466
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,720
You.

467
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,500
The use of the tie,
I missed its purpose when you taught me.

468
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:41,770
I almost used it for other purposes.

469
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,240
You missed the purpose of the tie?

470
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,450
So much that I could die from missing it.

471
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,860
Do you mean this?

472
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,130
Our fateful meeting occured through a gap of time.

473
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,870
And this fateful meeting was already ended a year ago.

474
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:22,740
Our reunion now is not because of that talisman.

475
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,680
But because of the link in our memories.

476
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,350
Our second meeting is destined by fate.

477
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,220
Now, I am his life-saver.

478
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:40,090
His price to pay is that he must remain by my side for a lifetime.

479
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,840
How does my letter exist until now?

480
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,310
How did this happen?

481
00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:01,450
The Prime Minister and his descendants prossessions were discovered not long ago.

482
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:04,250
How can personal items be
exhibited so openly?

483
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,390
Looks like I have to destroy it.

484
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,390
It's in the museum.

485
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,660
That will never be destroyed, 
unless the museum is also destroyed.

486
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,600
That's unreasonable.

487
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:01,380
I find it's really ridiculous now.

488
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,510
Claiming that you are her boyfriend
out of nowhere.

489
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:07,780
I have never heard Hui Jin
mention anything about you even once.

490
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,660
Starting now, tell the truth.
You hear me?

491
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,600
What school do you attend?

492
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,670
Where do you study, the school you attend.

493
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,410
Sungkyunkwan.

494
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,810
Sungkyunkwan University?

495
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,680
Where do you live?

496
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,810
Bukchon.

497
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,020
Bukchon?

498
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,220
The houses there are extremely expensive.

499
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,030
By chance, is it a tile-roofed house?

500
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,170
Why are you laughing?

501
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:08,110
My parents have passed away.
I am living by myself.

502
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,780
I am depending on the inheritance that
my parents left me.
