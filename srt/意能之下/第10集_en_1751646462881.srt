1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,300
With style,

2
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,400
Let's someone follow me.

3
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Should be the worst.

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,400
Knowledge everywhere.

5
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,600
gotta try harder.

6
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:07,760
It would be interesting.

7
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,540
Hey!

8
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:25,780
according to the

9
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,080
open up to

10
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
I'm here.

11
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
I'm finally here.

12
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Xiaoqi, let's go.

13
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
We're here.

14
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Okay.

15
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Why is this person always sleeping in the car?

16
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,080
He might be a turtle.

17
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,080
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

18
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:07,080
You can go up the mountain after you hand over your weapons.

19
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,080
I don't have any.

20
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Xiaoqi, you're awake.

21
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,080
I don't have any.

22
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,080
What do you mean?

23
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,080
This is the tacit understanding between the mountain and everyone.

24
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,080
You can't kill anyone.

25
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Huai'en Mountain is where you live.

26
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,080
I'm waiting for you on the mountain.

27
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
You can go to the hotel on the mountain to rest.

28
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Just rest.

29
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,080
The mountain is simple and the guest house is limited.

30
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
If you want to live comfortably,

31
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,080
the train back to the city will open for you at any time.

32
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,080
We're here to find the uncomfortable.

33
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,080
Why is the fog on the mountain so heavy?

34
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,080
It's so strange.

35
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Let's go.

36
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Let's go.

37
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Let's go.

38
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Let's go.

39
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Let's go.

40
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
It's good to be in the inn.

41
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Do you need a coffin?

42
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
No, I don't need it.

43
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Let's do this first.

44
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Everyone, I think the way up the mountain is harder than the way down.

45
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,080
If you want to go back to the mansion,

46
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,080
we would like to give you some money as a gift.

47
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Don't be too hard on yourself.

48
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Since we're here, it means everyone has a desire.

49
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Some people don't have to show their positive attitude.

50
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Who is more noble than others?

51
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,080
We're here to get the false word to help father out of prison.

52
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
The false word is so deep.

53
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
It can solve everything.

54
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,080
We'll know it soon.

55
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
This city is not easy.

56
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,080
The owner said that there are fewer people on the mountain.

57
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
They take people down the mountain every day.

58
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,080
No one can survive the fourth day.

59
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Thank you for reminding me.

60
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
I'm reminding you that I didn't talk to you.

61
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Everyone, it's time to go to bed.

62
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Remember to stay in the hotel.

63
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Drink some hot tea.

64
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,080
The police have a deal with Huayan Mountain.

65
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
As long as there are no cases of murder,

66
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,080
the police have no right to interfere in the mountain.

67
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,080
But how can the people in the world help?

68
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,080
You're right, Ye Jingdu.

69
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
You mean to say that

70
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,080
you want to kill people for the false word?

71
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,080
You think I'm a coward to risk my life for the false word?

72
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
You think I'm a coward?

73
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Ye Jingdu is so kind.

74
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
I'll leave you to it.

75
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,080
I'll send Ye Jingdu to the mountain.

76
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
We haven't taken our weapons.

77
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
How can he have a gun?

78
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
I'm not going to let the murderers die.

79
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
I'm not going to let them die.

80
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Go after them!

81
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
Run!

82
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
This is weird.

83
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Why is this forest going down?

84
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Run! We're going to catch up with them!

85
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
What are you doing?

86
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
What are you doing?

87
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,080
So this is the secret of Huayan Mountain.

88
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Huayan Mountain

89
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,080
Huayan Mountain

90
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Huayan Mountain
