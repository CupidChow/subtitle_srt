1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's sold out!

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Come and have a look!

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Only one person will lose money.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ten people can earn three times more.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
How many people will I have to wait?

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is the private son of the richest student.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's interesting.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What's going on?

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm a master of the art world.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How did I get caught by a little girl?

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't want to fight you.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You can't beat me.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll let you feel

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
what art is.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I want his bracelet.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
One silver dollar.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Where's my元器?

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where's my元器?

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I saw it clearly.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Everyone will come to buy it.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I really don't want to see it.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's go.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't go.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's go to the stall.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why didn't you buy it?

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Three times!

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I give three times!

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why did I buy it with one suit?

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you need a horse?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Do you want to send me to the door?

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So hasty.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wait.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wait.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We haven't paid the price yet.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Will someone come to buy me?

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm the one who killed the master of the art world.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't attract people from this world.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So many people.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can earn a lot of money.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's strange.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't feel the power

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
on these people.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I give 32,000.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
40,000.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
45,000.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
48,000.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
48,000.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh my god.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Are you sure?

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
48,000.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is there anything else that costs 50,000?

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Is there?

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Is there?

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Is there anything else?

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll go with you in the end.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Or you can take off your mask

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and let me see what you look like.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is there anything that costs 50,000?

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Is there anything that costs 50,000?

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is there anything that costs 50,000?

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is there anything that costs 50,000?

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
48,000 once.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
48,000 twice.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll give you 100,000.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
100,000?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Good.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're a good man.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll give it to you.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Isn't this the only son

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
of Feng Xi's father,

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Master Luo En?

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What do you mean?

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If he's the only son,

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
he's not the only son.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Someone has split his property with him.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's here to buy people with money.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It seems that Master Luo En is afraid.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He's a bastard.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And he's shameless.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Take him away.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I dare not go back with you.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What if you want to buy people with money

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and kill me secretly?

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Say one more word.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's so dangerous.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why did he shoot?

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who's that?

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Who are you?

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How dare you shoot at me?

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's him.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,840
Who are you?

98
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
How dare you shoot me?

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
It's him.

100
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,440
Are you cold?

101
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,400
No.

102
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,840
I'm just a little noisy.

103
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,040
Is it you?

104
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,240
The one who taught me to bring this world.

105
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,180
Have you ever wanted to chicken out?

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,720
You've driven out Yan Mo, right?

107
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,840
Everyone.

108
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,220
Go.

109
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,920
Go.

110
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,520
The dragon has'nt died yet.

111
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,240
Midar Universe is about to start their turn.

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,180
I have started looking for her.

113
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,820
I must interfere.

114
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,400
Blind.

115
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,320
Blind.

116
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,360
You go first.

117
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,240
I go first.

118
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,020
Record...

119
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
Trim the gold and silver here.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The truth is broken

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Always wandering around

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Following the direction in my heart

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No fear of the obstacles in the way

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In fact, the story is still unending

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Looking for the direction of the command
