1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:25,240
Oh,isse...

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,360
Are you armed?

3
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,840
I've been looking at you

4
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,300
After you came out of your room

5
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,800
You were sitting for a long time

6
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,300
Why do you have so much gun?

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,800
I'm thinking

8
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,560
why

9
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,600
I don't understand

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,640
why.

11
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,160
There's something strange.

12
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
The original owner of this body is called A'lang.

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,960
My friend Luo Sifu said

14
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,280
he was a useless person.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,560
So

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,920
how could Dou Shisan give the money to someone like him?

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
Unless he knows

18
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,040
the original owner of this body

19
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,800
has been replaced by someone else.

20
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,720
Do you think so?

21
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,040
I don't understand.

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,360
Tonight,

23
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm going to help a friend do something.

24
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,520
You don't have to follow me.

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,680
Is it a dangerous thing?

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,960
It's for the sake of my friend.

27
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,360
I have to do it.

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,120
Don't you take me with you?

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
You're weak.

30
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
You've been followed.

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm tired of it.

32
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,400
Dou Shisan.

33
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Is it you?

34
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,360
Did you design

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,800
everything behind this?

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
You heard it right.

37
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,600
They said they were going to Luo's house

38
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,720
to pick up the Young Master.

39
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,400
Yes.

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,400
They're going to pick up the Young Master

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
and the Second Master.

42
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
The second master and the second master

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
are going to pick up the Young Master.

44
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,440
It's never our turn

45
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
to do this.

46
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Hurry up.

47
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,920
Before the second master

48
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,240
goes to pick up the new master,

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,920
we'll be in the front.

50
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Then we'll be in the top.

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
But

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,680
we don't know the identity of the new master.

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,480
Damn it.

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,840
The front is the front.

55
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
The front is the front.

56
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
The front is the front.

57
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,680
The front is the front.

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,400
Dou Shisan is there.

59
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
I know.

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,280
Get out of here.

61
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,040
I knew it.

62
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,320
How can a person

63
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,560
become so strong all of a sudden?

64
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,320
You're so weak.

65
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,520
You're really my dog.

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,840
So he's the one you're talking about.

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,000
The dog.

68
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
I advise you

69
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,360
not to say that.

70
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,760
You want to scare me again?

71
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
Listen.

72
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,080
Even if you become stronger,

73
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
I'm not afraid.

74
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,680
Can you beat these brothers?

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
And

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
that person

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
is his name.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,680
I'm so scared to death.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,680
The front is the front.

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,240
The front is the front.

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
The front is the front.

82
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,760
A shot can kill a man.

83
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,040
A shot can kill a man.

84
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,720
He can be as strong as an ant.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,760
Die.

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Who?

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Master.

88
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,320
You missed the shot.

89
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,080
He can kill five people with one shot.

90
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,440
Do you think he can miss it?

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,320
Welcome back, young master.

92
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Young master?

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
Welcome back, young master.

94
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Hurry up.

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Young master.

96
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Young master.

97
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Please spare my life.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Spare my dog's life.

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm a dog.

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
Spare my dog's life.

101
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Today.

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,600
Today is your big day of return.

103
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
We are a family.

104
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,120
How can a dog and a man be a family?

105
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,600
Yes.

106
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
You are the master.

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm the dog.

108
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Let's go.

109
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Go to see Boss Du.

110
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
No.

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
He is waiting for you.

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Is he alone?

113
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
He likes silence.

114
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Boss is in the car.

115
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Wait.

116
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,360
We have something

117
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
you can't hear.

118
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Got it.

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,760
вообще

120
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,240
What is most likely is spun.
