00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Music

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The car hasn't started.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Maybe?

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,960
To buy a ticket.

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,060
You didn't do anything?

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:21,500
I just went toï¿½ï¿½

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,540
You different monster

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,260
You did

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,780
Have been

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,820
Like

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,020
Need something cellular?

24
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,940
I need a house.

25
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,020
Anyone?

26
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,220
I need trouble.

27
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,460
You miss her, maybe someone else?

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,380
No.

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,980
Have something to eat.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,140
Just one Japanese omelet is enough.

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,700
I can't eat Y peeling a thing.

32
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,140
Even a dirty building must be expensive.

33
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,500
I'll pick up a bunch.

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,260
Can you wait?

35
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,940
Get over here I need to get my job done.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,340
Alright.

37
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,340
The car is fired once every 12 years.

38
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,340
But the ticket is not sold.

39
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,340
How do we get in the car?

40
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,340
Four tickets left.

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,340
The car is fired once every 12 years.

42
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
You are a beast.

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,340
Understand?

44
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,340
Three tickets left.

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,340
Three tickets left.

46
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Two tickets left.

47
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,340
Two tickets left.

48
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,340
There is no more civilized way.

49
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,340
Civilized?

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,340
There are two kinds of people who can get civilized.

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
Rich.

52
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,340
Mine.

53
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Mine.

54
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
You are a beast.

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,340
They are all masters of the world.

56
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Why don't you go?

57
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,340
The rule is

58
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,340
walk to the end of the road.

59
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
Then you can go to the end of the road.

60
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,340
Then you can go to the end of the road.

61
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
Then you can go to the end of the road.

62
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,340
The rule is

63
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,340
I can get in the car when I get to the gate, right?

64
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,340
You can go to the gate as long as you can get in the car.

65
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
And

66
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,340
the road to the end of the road is very dangerous.

67
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,340
But to get the truth,

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,340
are you willing to live?

69
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,340
You.

70
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
Get up.

71
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,340
Last ticket left.

72
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,340
He can't even get through this.

73
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,340
So he can't get through the thing after the train arrives.

74
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Stop.

75
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,340
Stop.

76
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Forget it.

77
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,340
You are not good at fighting.

78
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,340
You are good at

79
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,340
learning dog barking

80
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
and killing your father.

81
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
I didn't kill him.

82
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,340
Then who is he?

83
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,340
A ghost.

84
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
There is no ghost in this world.

85
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,340
Only the people who make ghosts.

86
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,340
Someone said

87
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,340
the answer

88
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,340
is at the end of the train.

89
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,340
So

90
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,340
I have to get in the car.

91
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
Father.

92
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
Father.

93
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
Luosifu.

94
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,340
I will definitely

95
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,340
avenge you.

96
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,340
He is suspecting me.

97
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,340
It's for Luosifu.

98
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,340
Luosifu.

99
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,340
The End
