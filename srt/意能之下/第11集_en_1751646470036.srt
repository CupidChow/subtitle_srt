1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,780
Mr.

2
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,280
Shç™½

3
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
What is this?

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,280
So this is the secret of Mount Huan.

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Baihu Palace is not weak. You go first.

6
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Hurry.

7
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
This is our money.

8
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,280
This is our money.

9
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Master Baihu, what a coincidence.

10
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Isn't this the murderer who framed the chief?

11
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
I'm curious.

12
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,280
What trick did you use when you came out of the police station?

13
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Just right.

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Today I'll let you try my trick.

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
You want to die?

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Stop.

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,280
What a powerful soul.

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
It can make me move my body.

19
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Too slow.

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
Too slow.

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Still too slow.

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
What's going on?

23
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Is it really Baihu's doing?

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Impossible.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
He's so weak.

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
How could he escape from Baihu's trick?

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
So boring.

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
I'm not playing with you.

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Stop.

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Let's go together.

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
I'll protect you.

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Let's go.

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Why is it getting heavier?

34
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,280
It's getting heavier.

35
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
It's getting heavier.

36
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
That's right.

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
The soul is here.

38
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Don't stare at me.

39
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
You're a police officer.

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
I'll be scared.

41
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Who's looking at you?

42
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm just wondering

43
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
what kind of kung fu you're using.

44
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Kung fu?

45
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
I don't know any kung fu.

46
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
I'm just a useless wood.

47
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
I need a woman to protect me.

48
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
I'll help you.

49
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Let's help you.

50
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Do you sell your stuff?

51
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
No.

52
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
What's the matter?

53
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
I'm not doing anything.

54
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Let's go.

55
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Let's go.

56
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Let's go.

57
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Let's go.

58
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Let's go.

59
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Xue Li.

60
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Where's the water?

61
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
It's coming.

62
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Xue Li.

63
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Take it easy.

64
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Are you okay?

65
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm not going to be able to do anything

66
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
if I don't save my family.

67
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Don't go too far.

68
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,280
The soul is with her.

69
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
I bought a thing from your house.

70
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
It's worth anything.

71
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
I don't want the money.

72
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
I don't want it.

73
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,280
But we can guess the puzzle.

74
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Guess the puzzle?

75
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Three puzzles.

76
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,280
You can take one of them

77
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
and take what you want.

78
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Okay.

79
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
It's a deal.

80
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
The first question.

81
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Why is a pig stupid?

82
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Then the second question.

83
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Why is a person smart?

84
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
It's so hard.

85
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
What are these?

86
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
I don't know.

87
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
I don't know.

88
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
I don't know.

89
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
I don't know.

90
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
What are these?

91
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
The third question.

92
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,280
How does a pig turn into a human?

93
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,280
When does a pig turn into a human?

94
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
If you can't answer,

95
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
then take care.

96
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Let me think.

97
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
She's gone.

98
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Bosses, those in the station

99
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,280
know they can't beat you all.

100
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
So they took your money

101
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
and let you get on the train.

102
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
But those who came here

103
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
are tough enough.

104
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Be honest.

105
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Tonight,

106
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
we're going to kill the rest of the people on the mountain.

107
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,280
You can put the money down

108
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
and go down the mountain safely.

109
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
We can save some energy.

110
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
What do you think?

111
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Done?

112
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Done.

113
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Get me a basin of water.

114
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Water?

115
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
What kind of water?

116
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
To wash hands.

117
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Wash hands?

118
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Boss Luo.

119
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Boss Luo.

120
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
You're amazing.

121
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
I didn't know you could do that.

122
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
If you meet the person

123
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
who got the false word,

124
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
you must bring me along.

125
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
Don't worry.

126
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
The one who got the false word

127
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
and became the master of Feng Xi

128
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
must be me.

129
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
It must be you.

130
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
You're the one who's going to be the master.

131
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Take it.

132
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Follow me.

133
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
1 year later

134
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Why is it so dark

135
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
in the daytime?

136
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Why is it so dark in the daytime?

137
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Oh

138
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Oh

139
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
You
