1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,640
Afterward.

2
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,140
Who is he?

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You dare to hit me?

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Stop it.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How dare you?

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You dare to shoot me?

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you cold?

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Not cold.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Just a little noisy.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My father said you're too noisy.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Your father?

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How dare you hit me?

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Stop it.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
13th Prince?

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
24 years ago,

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the man who took the blood of the Emperor,

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
was 13th Prince.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Emperor?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
13th Prince, it's really 13th Prince.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Father, I didn't know you were here.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We were wrong.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We were wrong.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We were wrong.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Come in.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The wontons are ready.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Eat them while they're hot.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't hit me.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't hit me.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Come on.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Eat.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Eat.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Delicious.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's been more than 20 years.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's not easy.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Back then,

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the boss only had a small cart

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and a stall on the street.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
At that time,

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I was young and strong.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I offended the leader of the gang.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Stop.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Stop.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Stop.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Stop.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Stop.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Stop.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're here.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're still here.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're here to eat, right?

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hurry up.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hide.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Guess who I saw?

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What?

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What does it have to do with me?

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I haven't introduced myself yet.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm a street-dweller.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My friends call me Du Shisan.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There are 12 restaurants in Nan City,

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
12 streets in the south,

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and 300 small stores.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm forced to manage 182 of them.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All the stores I mentioned earlier are here.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're the leader of my gang.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How about it?

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is it really him?

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We're just friends.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You gave me such a big business.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it because I have some special talent?

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Of course you have.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My men told me

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you could escape death

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and avoid bullets.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So it's because of this.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is my goddaughter, Xiaoqi Tuotuo.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
She's very naughty.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She's the leader of my gang.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She won't do it.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
She wants to break into the gang.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I didn't expect to see you.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're so fated.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is not a meeting.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I told her to be your wife.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How is it?

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't worry.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
She must be a good wife.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Xiaoqi.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let go of her.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Xiaoqi.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Xiaoqi, come back.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Xiaoqi.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Stop.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is your husband.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are you looking at?

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't smoke.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Calm down.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't come over.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Stop.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're my husband.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm going to play chess.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't come over.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't come over.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's been more than 20 years.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I finally got you.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This time

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I finally got you.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I finally got you.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I finally got you.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It hurts.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Xiaoqi.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You must work hard to be a good wife.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I will.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What a strong power.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I will.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I will.

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I will.
