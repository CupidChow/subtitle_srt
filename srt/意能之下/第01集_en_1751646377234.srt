1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
The

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,960
The

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,960
In the higher and more advanced world of the Yi world,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,960
people enjoy the super difficult happiness and peace.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,960
They use one year to turn into different energies,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,960
and then release energy through energy,

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,960
called energy-saving.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
And according to the difference in energy,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,960
it turns into P1 to P10,

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,960
different levels of energy.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,960
The ultimate form of energy is to turn into a human,

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
but no matter how extreme it is,

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,960
it cannot break through the limitations of the chemical.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,960
But there is a super power that does not use external objects,

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,960
called the Yi energy, the chemical.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Luo Jie, the full-level P10 Yi energy master of the original world.

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,960
His energy is a watch,

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
which has the highest Yi energy,

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,960
the fifth time.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,960
When he was doing the ultimate training,

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
one of his powers

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,960
sucked him into another world.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,960
The Yi energy master

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,960
The ultimate power

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,960
The ultimate power

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,960
The ultimate power

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Call me teacher.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Teacher, teacher, teacher.

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
Good dog.

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,960
This is the son of the people

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
who went to the capital of Fengxi.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
Come, A'la, lick it again.

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Really lick it.

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Good dog, good dog.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
I want to go in and lick it.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
I want to go in and lick it.

37
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Please let me go in.

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
I will definitely lick it.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
I will do whatever I want.

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Please let me go in.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
I beg you.

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
I will do whatever I want.

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
I beg you.

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,960
I beg you.

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Light a fire.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Okay.

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Don't shake.

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Okay.

49
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Don't go too far.

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Yes, yes, yes.

51
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
We are all good friends.

52
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Good friends, playing around.

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Don't be afraid.

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
I will protect you.

55
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
This play is really wonderful.

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,960
It's about to be his time to die.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
You are lucky.

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
I will reward you for the money.

59
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Okay, okay, okay.

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Come, come and get it.

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Get it, get it.

62
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Die.

63
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,960
What is this?

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Boss, he's dead.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Let's kill him.

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

67
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
He's really a bad guy.

68
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,920
The

69
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Delicious, really delicious.

70
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Not bad, not bad.

71
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Boss, this is really delicious.

72
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Is it noodles?

73
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
You've eaten enough.

74
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Hurry up and go.

75
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Other guests are here.

76
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
There's not enough space.

77
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
It doesn't matter.

78
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
We can sit together.

79
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
They are from the whole gang.

80
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
The whole gang?

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960
You are from the outside world, right?

82
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
They can't afford it.

83
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Can't afford it.

84
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Can you do business?

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Didn't you see our boss coming?

86
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Hurry up and let this piece of crap go away.

87
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
We haven't finished eating.

88
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Haven't finished eating?

89
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
I'll tell you to go home.

90
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Boss, let's go.

91
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Go.

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
We?

93
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Go?

94
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Yes, yes, yes.

95
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
You useless thing.

96
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Is there anyone in Fengxi City

97
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
that I can't afford to offend?

98
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
Don't touch him, boss.

99
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
This seat is mine.

100
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Hurry up and get out of here.

101
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Why are you so fierce?

102
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
We can sit together.

103
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Sit together.

104
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Ghost.

105
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Ghost.

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Sit.

107
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Didn't you insist on sitting just now?

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Why aren't you sitting now?

109
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Ghost.

110
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Ghost.

111
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
You saw me die.

112
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
I just want to ask

114
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
how I died.

115
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Don't touch me.

116
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Don't be afraid.

117
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
I'm very friendly.

118
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Get him.

119
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Get him.

120
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
These people are really friendly.

121
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
I have to give them some color.

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Color?

123
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Don't be so angry.

124
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Here, drink tea.

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Drink tea.

126
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I just want to ask you

127
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
how I died.

128
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
I'll tell you.

129
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
You, you, let me think.

130
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
I, I, I, I saw you.

131
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
You, you, you.

132
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
I, I, I, I remember now.

133
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
It's, it's, it's like this.

134
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Fortunately, the yuan energy

135
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
can set the time and space around us.

136
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
How did I end up here?

137
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
I must die in the blood

138
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
before I can set off this ship.

139
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
If the killer

140
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
can bring me back to this world,

141
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
then the killer

142
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
can be this person.

143
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Where is he?

144
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Where is he?

145
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Where is he?

146
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Where is he?

147
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Where is he?

148
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
I have to find the one who can protect the time and space

149
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
before I can return to the Yuan Realm.

150
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Where is he?

151
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Where is he?

152
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

153
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
I can sense it.

154
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Why hasn't he come to pick me up?

155
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
You know me?

156
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Crazy.

157
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
I don't know what I look like now.

158
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Am I not handsome?

159
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Have you seen this person?

160
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Crazy.

161
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Why is he so rude?

162
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Yes.

163
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Why is he so rude?

164
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Are you looking for him too?

165
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Yes.

166
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
It's so crowded.

167
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,960
It's hard to find someone.

168
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Isn't this the two-pointing fate of the teacher?

169
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

170
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
I can sense it.

171
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Why hasn't he come to pick me up?

172
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
You know me?

173
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

174
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I can sense it.

175
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Why isn't he so rude?

176
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

177
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
I can sense it.

178
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Why isn't he so rude?

179
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

180
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I can sense it.

181
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Why isn't he so rude?

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

183
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

184
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

185
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

186
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

187
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

188
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

189
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

190
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I am the one who is the most powerful.

191
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
