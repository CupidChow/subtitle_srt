1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Please get in the car.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Please get in the car.

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Please get in the car.

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yu Dan, come with me.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Jianghu City, don't move your guns.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Please get in the car.

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Please get in the car.

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't touch my husband.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please get in the car.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Guests in the car,

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
don't you want to eat wontons?

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Please get in the car.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please get in the car.

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please get in the car.

15
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I want wontons.

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Please get in the car.

17
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please get in the car.

18
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't want money.

19
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Boss Luo, you are so arrogant.

20
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please get in the car.

21
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Please get in the car.

22
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You are late.

23
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There is only one bowl of wontons left.

24
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Boss Luo,

25
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
how can we share

26
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
one bowl of wontons?

27
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You are old.

28
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How about...

29
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll take it.

30
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have so many people

31
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
in my hand.

32
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They want to drink some soup.

33
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can't even

34
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
see the door.

35
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why do you need to give them soup?

36
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They will come in soon.

37
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Then,

38
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can't even

39
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
eat one wonton.

40
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Stop stealing.

41
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We are hungry.

42
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Give us this bowl.

43
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Son,

44
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I am your father.

45
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I...

46
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You are

47
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the first wife of Feng Xicheng,

48
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Luo Si Fu?

49
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's so troublesome.

50
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The boss of the money gang

51
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and the first wife of the city all want me.

52
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But the boss of the money gang

53
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
is very sincere.

54
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What about you?

55
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What can you give me?

56
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can give you

57
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
many, many

58
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
wealth.

59
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's really been ten years.

60
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I am still a

61
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
business man.

62
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It seems that you have been

63
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
guarding the wonton stall for so many years.

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Now, you can't keep it.

65
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
From today,

66
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I won't bother you

67
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to look after the store.

68
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How about it?

69
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I will do it.

70
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Son, let's go.

71
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Wait.

72
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Xiao Qi,

73
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
you are his wife.

74
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You should go back to the Luo family with him.

75
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
God!

76
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Listen to me.

77
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You should take good care of your husband.

78
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The danger he will face

79
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
is much more terrible than today.

80
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But his life is more important

81
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
than yours and mine. Do you understand?

82
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Go. Take good care of your husband.

83
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What is this?

84
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's weird.

85
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Why is there a father?

86
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Who do you think

87
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I am?

88
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Brother, I miss you so much.

89
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
How dare you call me your father?

90
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The world is in chaos

91
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
like a dream

92
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
in chaos like a dream

93
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The battle for the throne

94
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
is over

95
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The fates are revealed

96
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000

97
