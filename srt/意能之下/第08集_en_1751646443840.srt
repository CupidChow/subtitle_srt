1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,920
reviewed.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Boss, your wontons are getting worse.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The wontons have been in the hot air for a long time.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But the bowl is still full of wontons.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why are you still in the restaurant if you don't like it?

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hello.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My father's enemy.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's in the restaurant.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't move!

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't be nervous.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm closing the door for you.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you trying to find a secret?

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's strange.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why is the door closed?

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And he's walking on the street in a big way.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not reasonable.

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It looks like a trap.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Go ask around.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No wonder you're not afraid.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You found the people from the money gang to help you.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
How is that possible?

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How could the money gang listen to my orders?

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I heard that someone rushed into the restaurant with a gun early in the morning.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So the money gang is waiting for us.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you don't believe me, I'll try.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Come in!

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Come on, come in!

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
How dare they provoke us?

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Put the gun away.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll wait and see.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They're outside.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you want to try?

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is it their gun or mine?

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You die first.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's no difference between living and dying.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm alive, you're alive.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If I die, you all die.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Kill the father, kill the son.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But, but you,

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
do they want to die with you?

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Young master, I don't want to die.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's good to be alive.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's good to be alive.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So much trouble.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You kill people on the street.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Aren't you afraid that the police will come and catch you?

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When the police arrived, there was no evidence.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Come on.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Really?

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There are many people.

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Who shot the gun?

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's me.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The police just came to report.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Chief Xiu.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Police officer Ye.

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Take me to the prison.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The prison of Du Shisan.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You want to pay the price for scheming me.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Take her away.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can go now.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Go?

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Can I ask why?

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The murderer of the Shalos has confessed.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And the shooting that day, he also confessed.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It has nothing to do with you.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's Luo Jie.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Are you torturing me?

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It has nothing to do with you.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I want to see your Ye Jingdu.

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I want to see your Ye Jingdu.

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Boss Du.

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Isn't this what you want?

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What are you looking at?

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What did he confess to you?

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He is the murderer who killed Luo Sifu.

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Impossible.

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why are you so sure?

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because he knows who the real murderer is.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I knew it.

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Ye Jingdu won't be selfish.

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
To see me, he has to be careful.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You know the situation.

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why are you still here?

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The situation is complicated.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm worried about his life.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Ye Jingdu.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I have something to say to you alone.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Ye Jingdu.

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have something to say to you alone.

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you can't let the police hear it,

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
it must be something I need to know.

94
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I won't leave.

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The confession I just wrote,

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
is enough for you to lock me up for ten years.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you remember the night I told you about?

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The night someone was chasing me?

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You met someone.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He saved you.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He told you that night?

102
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He saved me.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He saved you.

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He saved me.

106
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He saved me.

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He saved me.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He saved me.

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He saved me.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He saved me.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He saved you.

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He told me

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
what would happen in the next twenty years.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He was right about everything.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Mr. fortune teller?

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He also told me

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
about the death of Luo Sifu.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He also told me

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that it would be good

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
if you were the leader.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't believe it.

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Believe it or not,

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
you'll know when you see him.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The me from twenty-four years ago,

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and Luo Sifu from twelve years ago,

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
all got a chance to see him.

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
They got the chance to talk.

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's how they got what they got.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Twenty-four years ago,

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the leader of the front group

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
was the one who talked.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Talk about the truth?

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But I was locked up here.

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How could I get out?

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've been in the martial arts world for decades.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I didn't get out for nothing.

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Who is it?

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's me.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What?

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let him go?

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're the head of the bureau.

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is your right.

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Isn't this the unquestionable leader

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
of the front group, Zhu Que?

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Even you are so suspicious.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're so suspicious.

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No wonder.

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who can resist such a big temptation?

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Am I right?

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There are so few people on the bus this time.

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The person who will lose must be the front group or the Chamber of Commerce.

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Second Master,

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
please take care of this road.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The bus hasn't started yet.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Not yet.

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Mr. Xu Huailong

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
was living in Huai'en Mountain.

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
People who were crazy

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
wanted to fight for Xu Huaiyan.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
They built a road to Huai'en Mountain.

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Buy tickets.

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Your mission is to get on the train

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
with every possible means.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The red light of fate

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
challenges the impermanence of the world.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Even though the world is chaotic like a dream,

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
chaotic like a dream,

170
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
the fate of the right and wrong

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
reveals the fictitious illusion.

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Even the storm

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
makes the road to the other side laughable,

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the hope that never dies.

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Climbing over the wind, rain and frost,

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
going through the thick fog and confusion,

177
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
searching for the true power of the gods,

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
always wandering without a trace,

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
following the direction in my heart,

180
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
without fear of the obstacles along the way,

181
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
even though the story is still unending,

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
searching for the direction of the soul.
