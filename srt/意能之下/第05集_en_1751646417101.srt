1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A little dance?

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How dare you call me dad?

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Brother.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Please let me dance.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't know how to dance.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid you can't.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is that how you dance?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't know how to dance.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid you can't.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid you can't.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How could you dance?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid you can't.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How dare you dance?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How could you dance?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
I was wrong.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,640
How dare you call your brother your father?

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,640
Call your father.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,120
It hurts.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,600
Call your father.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,400
Call your father.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,560
Call your father.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,560
Call.

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
Call your father.

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,400
Call.

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,120
Brother.

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Yi Neng Painting

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Oh, brother.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,800
I remember you drew a painting of a painting of Yi Neng.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,000
Where is the painting?

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,160
I lost it.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,960
Lost it?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,760
Why do you think

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,440
Yi Neng can only be used as a tool?

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,360
can't become our own energy.

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,800
That's the legendary

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,120
power-up.

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,120
Without any external objects,

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,080
we can get the energy of destruction.

39
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,160
But

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,920
it's just a legend.

41
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,520
No one can do it.

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,480
The energy of destruction.

43
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,480
If someone can do it,

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,840
it's really scary.

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,120
Don't talk about destruction.

46
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,400
Think about yourself.

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
The killer

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,960
was killed by your master

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
and he was bleeding.

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,800
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,200
There's no such thing as coincidence in the world.

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,320
So his purpose is to let you pass through.

53
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,800
Only our energy master

54
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,880
can know this.

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,560
By the way,

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,000
why can the master who let me pass through

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,360
be your illegitimate son?

58
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,400
Brother, it's getting late.

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Let's go home.

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,920
Go home.

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,560
What do you mean?

62
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,640
Explain it to me.

63
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,240
Are you trying to make me call your father?

64
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,360
How is that possible?

65
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,960
Go home.

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,440
Go home.

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,920
Go home.

68
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,840
Go home.

69
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,480
Stop.

70
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,640
Wait for me.

71
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,520
Master.

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm useless.

73
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,600
You're not surprised?

74
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,680
I know so many people are interested in Luo Jie.

75
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,960
Why did I only bring you here

76
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,600
to rob people today?

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,040
Well,

78
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,760
it's to let Luo Jie know

79
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,360
our kindness to him

80
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,680
and to let him

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,920
return to the Luo family smoothly.

82
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,320
That's the purpose of today's game.

83
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,040
Go.

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,680
Brother, when you see my son,

85
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
you'd better call me father.

86
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,960
Otherwise, my family's master, Wei Yan,

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,800
will be in trouble.

88
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,720
Get off me.

89
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,920
I'm a bold man. Don't touch me.

90
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,120
Get off me.

91
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,440
Master.

92
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,880
It hurts.

93
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
My ears hurt.

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,000
Father.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,680
Who did this?

96
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,840
He hit you like this.

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,360
It hurts.

98
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,480
I did it.

99
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
Why did you bring him back?

100
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,440
He...

101
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,320
He colluded with the money

102
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,680
and hit me like this.

103
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,200
Well...

104
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,160
Father.

105
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,080
You brought a bastard back to bully me

106
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
when I just left.

107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,320
Didn't you say

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,640
I was your only true love?

109
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,760
Son,

110
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm your only true love.

111
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,960
Then why did you bring him back?

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm the only one in this family.

113
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,680
You're right.

114
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,600
We can't live under the same roof.

115
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,400
You choose.

116
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,240
Son,

117
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,840
you've never suffered any hardship

118
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,400
since you were a child.

119
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,280
I've always been the most precious to you.

120
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,920
Now you've grown up.

121
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,320
You have to go through some hardships.

122
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,240
I have no bad intentions

123
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,920
for you.

124
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,400
Tell me if you need money.

125
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,600
What?

126
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,120
Didn't you say

127
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,120
you're the only one in this family?

128
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,000
Go out and take care of yourself.

129
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,760
Well...

130
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,680
I'm moving out?

131
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,960
Father.

132
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,120
Shouldn't he go?

133
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,760
I should go?

134
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,280
I'm sleepy.

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,600
Look, your brother is sleepy.

136
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
You should go.

137
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
Don't let him rest.

138
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,360
Come on.

139
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,640
Hurry up.

140
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,160
I'll do it myself.

141
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,760
My legs.

142
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,120
Lower.

143
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,440
My legs.

144
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:55,880
Go.

145
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,200
My legs.

146
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,880
My legs.

147
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,000
Go.

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,760
My legs.

149
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,720
Hurry up.

150
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,160
Hurry up.

151
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,680
Father.

152
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,200
It's okay.

153
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,520
I'll do it myself.

154
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,560
No, you don't need me.

155
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,240
Go.

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll do it myself.

157
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,600
Hurry up.

158
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,440
What?

159
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,840
You want to go out and play with him?

160
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,360
Go.

161
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,680
If

162
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,680
the person who lured me from the other world

163
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
is Luo Sifu,

164
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,680
he won't open the door of time and space

165
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,800
and let me go back.

166
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,480
I'm so tired.

167
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,400
Don't laugh.

168
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,600
You'll be like this when you have a wife and a child.

169
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,240
I think it's better not to have one.

170
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Open the door of time and space.

171
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm going back.

172
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,440
Go back now?

173
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,600
You don't plan to find out

174
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
who killed your master?

175
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,800
You've lived here for so many years.

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,120
In this world,

177
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,120
if there are other talents,

178
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,680
will you not know?

179
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,000
So you're just an accident?

180
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,840
Okay.

181
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,680
I'll send you back.

182
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,760
If there are no other talents in this world,

183
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,800
is there a kind of hate?

184
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,880
This murderer is you.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,720
Go back.

186
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,320
Go back to the door of time and space.

187
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,440
Go back.

188
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,240
Go back.

189
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,520
Go back.

190
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,240
Go back.

191
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,920
Go back.

192
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,560
Go back.

193
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,240
Go back.

194
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,920
Go back.

195
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000
Go back.

196
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,960
What's wrong with you?

197
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,320
I...

198
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,560
Why do I have a gun?

199
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,240
What's going on?

200
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,520
Mom.

201
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,120
Mom.

202
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,320
Your primordial spirit.

203
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,880
How can your primordial spirit come back?

204
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,720
Tell me.

205
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Tell me.

206
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,080
In order to stay in this world,

207
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm with my wife.

208
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm with my primordial spirit and body.

209
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,760
If I die,

210
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,880
the door of time and space won't open.

211
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,600
The murderer wants you to stay here.

212
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,600
Ellie.

213
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,800
Brother.

214
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,920
Take care.

215
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,320
My son.

216
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,680
Brother.

217
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:36,500
Beautiful.

218
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Hope

219
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,500
He is the wind, rain and frost

220
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Pass through the thick fog and confusion

221
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
The truth that is deep and deep

222
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Always wandering in the deep

223
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Follow the direction in your heart

224
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
No fear of the road ahead, full of obstacles

225
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Even if the story is still unresolved

226
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Follow the direction of your soul
