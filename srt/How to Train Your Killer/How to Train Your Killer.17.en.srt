=Episode 17=

3
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,670
Hero Shi.

4
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,040
Qingyao...

5
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,950
How come...

6
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,350
You hold liquor so poorly,

7
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,350
yet you are so heavy.

8
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,150
It's so uncomfortable
to sleep with clothes on.

9
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,880
Come on.

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,400
Let me help you take it off.

11
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,880
No...

12
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,990
I...

13
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,350
You've had too much to drink.

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Maybe the inn's wine being too strong.

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,230
You can't handle it.

16
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,790
I remember I was in great shape.

17
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,560
Is that so?

18
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,150
Then I should put that to the test.

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
Qingyao...

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
You...

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,120
I...

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,430
- I...
- Isn't this what

23
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,680
you've always wanted?

24
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,520
You're not Qingyao.

25
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,120
Who are you?

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,430
I truly underestimated you.

27
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,840
I never expected you to have this side,

28
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,800
actually coveting your master's wife.

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,870
But,

30
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,680
I like it.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,190
You've inhaled
the Poisonous Mushroom Powder.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,000
Your mind are clouded right now.

33
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,400
There's no escape.

34
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't worry.

35
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,360
I won't devour you in one bite.

36
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,960
Good things

37
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,430
should be savored slowly.

38
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,360
What are you two doing?

39
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,640
What?

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
A moment of spring night
is worth a ton of gold.

41
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,800
Can you afford that, miss?

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,470
You lousy guy!

43
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,840
You are blinded by desire.

44
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,870
I actually thought...

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,680
And that woman Lady Li.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,430
Also known as Lady Shisan.

47
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,590
Everyone, enjoy your drinks.

48
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,870
She's the devil

49
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,750
who drains men's strength

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,630
to please herself?

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,080
Now no one can save you.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,640
Stop!

53
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,870
Go away!

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,870
He belongs to me.

55
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,750
You dare touch my man?

56
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,240
Your man?

57
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,420
He's my family's guard.

58
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,480
So why wouldn't he be mine?

59
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,030
Hey.

60
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,870
Shi,

61
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,800
you have a beautiful wife

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,870
at home.

63
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,710
Yet you're out here fooling around.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
Shameless!

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,030
No, I don't.

66
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,030
What a pity, then.

67
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,830
Since his wife is keeping the home,

68
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,040
I won't make things hard for him.

69
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,510
Young lady,

70
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,950
treat him well, will you?

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
Of course I'll treat him well.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,510
None of your concern!

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,070
It scared me to death.

74
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,920
- What happened?
- Weren't we just drinking?

75
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,390
But you ended up on the bed.

76
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,160
Your kiss is really cheap.

77
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,120
I didn't...

78
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,800
I didn't...

79
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,310
You didn't?

80
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,270
I swear.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,390
I've only ever kissed you.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,430
Just one kiss.

83
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,190
Hurry up and put your clothes on.

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,360
I have no strength.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
I can't move.

86
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,240
What's wrong with you?

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,190
I've been poisoned.

88
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Po... poisoned?

89
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,960
Hey.

90
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,630
How... how are you now?

91
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,270
I'm fine.

92
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,040
Just feeling weak all over.

93
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,070
Oh right, the detoxification pill.

94
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,350
Here.

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,920
Where is His Highness?

96
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,040
He drank too much.

97
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
He's asleep.

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
No,

99
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,270
it's too dangerous here.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,220
Take His Highness away quickly.

101
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
Hurry.

102
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,430
No one else was in danger.

103
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,270
Only you fell for a beauty's trap

104
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,530
and nearly lost your virginity.

105
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,480
Do you realize

106
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,070
they

107
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,750
are all wanted by the Imperial Court?

108
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,070
If they learned
who His Highness truly is

109
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,290
what do you think they'd do?

110
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,070
They

111
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,630
might not have the courage

112
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,800
to lay hands on the Crown Prince.

113
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,950
They dared to target me.

114
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
What would they not dare?

115
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
If they wanted to harm me,

116
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,510
while we were drinking earlier,

117
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,720
they had countless chances.

118
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,730
Your Highness, you may not be aware.

119
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,370
These are all serious criminals.

120
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,190
If they all learned your identity,

121
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,510
I'm not sure what he might do.

122
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,240
If they're willing
to serve me sincerely,

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,160
those past crimes won't matter much.

124
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,790
But...

125
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,390
In my opinion,

126
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,310
you're far more dangerous than I am.

127
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,630
Lady Li seems to have feelings for you.

128
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,120
If you happen to feel the same,

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,000
I'd be glad to help make it
a good match.

130
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,030
No, I can't.

131
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,630
I'm not interested in her at all.

132
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,240
Fair enough.

133
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,830
Taming a woman like her,

134
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,120
wouldn't be an easy task.

135
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,230
Your Highness,

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,040
I also feel something's off
about this inn.

137
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,390
Maybe we should just leave.

138
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,460
Since there's something wrong
with this inn,

139
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,240
shouldn't we find out what's behind it?

140
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,120
So,

141
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,830
let's go investigate together.

142
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,670
What do you think?

143
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,510
Isn't that a bit too risky?

144
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,070
We're out here roaming the world.

145
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,750
How can we lack a taste for adventure?

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,950
Besides, we've got Hero Shi with us.

147
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,450
We'll be fine. Come on.

148
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,560
Your Highness...

149
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,680
Let's go. It will be fine.

150
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,390
Go, go, go!

151
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,360
Let's go.

152
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
Hurry!

153
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,630
Well, they tidied up fast.

154
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,390
Don't you think that's a bit unusual?

155
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,800
At most, it only proves

156
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,430
the waiter here is rather diligent.

157
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,310
Is that so?

158
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,150
Yeah.

159
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,480
Someone's coming.

160
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
How bothersome.

161
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Endless chores!

162
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,490
What's so special
about being from the capital?

163
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,750
I'll teach him a lesson tonight.

164
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,150
Him?

165
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,510
What does he even mean by that?

166
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,600
You hear that?

167
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,390
Let's go check it out.

168
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,960
- Check out what?
- Let's go.

169
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,840
Can we not go?

170
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,720
No way, come on.

171
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,840
Don't go.

172
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,750
Darn it all.

173
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,200
So much blood, why hasn't it stopped?

174
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,390
Someone's been killed!?

175
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Cutting the body apart?

176
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,360
I don't think so.

177
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,030
Why is this hide so hard to peel?

178
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,670
The three new arrivals are still better.

179
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,790
New arrivals?

180
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,080
He's not talking
about the three of us, is he?

181
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,270
Where did it go?

182
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,630
Cannibal fiend...

183
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,720
Then the dinner we had tonight was...

184
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,630
Tasted pretty good.

185
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,450
Local goods

186
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,340
are still not as fine
as goods from the capital.

187
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
What do we do?

188
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,360
- Looks like...
- Let's run.

189
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,840
He's set his sights on us.

190
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,690
Let's go.

191
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,320
Your Highness, let's take action.

192
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,480
Wait, no, no.

193
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,270
Let's head back and plan this out.

194
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,910
I agree, take time to plan.

195
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,750
Come on, let's go.

196
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,200
Who's there?

197
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's go.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,840
Go, hurry!

199
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,240
Your Highness, you go first.

200
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,300
What do you mean by that?

201
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,790
Then what will you do?

202
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,630
Go, quickly!

203
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,510
Why are you here?

204
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,510
What's going on?

205
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,030
Your man-eating inn

206
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,790
actually dared to set your sights on us.

207
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,390
Man-eating?

208
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,480
Man-eating?

209
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,630
Lady Li, do we have such a rumor here?

210
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,470
Never heard of it.

211
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,390
What's so funny?

212
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,240
I personally heard him

213
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,120
skinning and flaying in the kitchen.

214
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,670
Planning to cook us into a dish, right?

215
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,150
We all heard it.

216
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,200
This is the 'man' you spoke of?

217
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,480
I saw him eat a piece of finger myself.

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,870
Miss,

219
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,390
is this what you mean?

220
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,410
I was afraid of neglecting you,

221
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,770
so I specifically instructed my men

222
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,840
to get authentic mutton
from the capital,

223
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,630
prepared to roast it for you.

224
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,000
It was truly out of my goodwill.

225
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,350
Sorry, sorry.

226
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,360
Looks like we misunderstood you.

227
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,810
But what are you three doing
in the kitchen

228
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,910
in the middle of the night?

229
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,670
To make some...

230
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,910
We...

231
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
We were hungry.

232
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,140
- Mm.
- We came for something to eat.

233
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,240
Turns out you are hungry.

234
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,630
You should've said it earlier.

235
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,550
My room has everything you need.

236
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,910
No need, really.

237
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,630
I couldn't manage that.

238
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,440
You dare to kiss a girl
who is even more impressive.

239
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,080
Seems my charm isn't enough after all.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,910
Alright then.

241
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,080
I won't dampen everyone's spirits today.

242
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,920
Let's roast it.

243
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,030
Alright.

244
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,390
Lady Li is straightforward.

245
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,420
Young Master Lin, no need to say more.

246
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,590
Let's head in for a drink.

248
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,680
Young Master Lin.

249
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,840
You seem to have dropped something.

250
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,940
