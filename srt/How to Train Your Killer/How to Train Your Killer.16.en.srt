00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,900
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,040
Here.

4
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,000
Try Feng's cooking.

5
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,320
Qingyao, you eat first.

6
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,790
It's a new dish.

7
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,150
It really tastes like mint!

8
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,110
Of course.

9
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,960
- Smells good?
- Mm.

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,070
Cool and refreshing.

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,150
The taste's lovely.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,790
Shiyi.

13
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,070
Shiyi, you're...

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,120
Leaving?

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,430
Yes.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,310
I've troubled you for too long.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,520
It's time I go.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,200
But your wounds...

19
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,070
They're near healed.

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,550
Thank you for taking me in these days.

21
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,350
Acting tough again!

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,120
Farewell.

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,310
Have you given any thought

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,640
to the matter of being the guide?

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,310
I'm wounded.

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,660
I truly can't take on such a duty.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,070
I hope you can understand.

28
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,840
If I have the authorities
lift their wanted notices,

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,480
and pardon their crimes,

30
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,150
would you grant me some courtesy?

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,760
Shiyi.

32
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,990
Take care.

33
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,270
Bai,

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,680
take care.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
The sunlight feels wonderful.

36
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:23,140
(Friend's Inn)

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
Friend's Inn?

38
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,580
Isn't that obvious?

39
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,190
Out here in the wilderness, could it be…

40
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,940
(Friend's Inn)

41
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,470
So it really is called Friend's Inn.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,030
What a strange name for an inn.

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
Waiter.

44
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,120
Sir, will you be grabbing a bite
or staying the night?

45
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,580
What do you mean by 'grabbing a bite'?

46
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,120
Grab a bite and stay the night.

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,120
Then what would you like to eat?

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,940
Bring us a pot of wine first.

49
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,840
Apologies.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,080
We don't serve wine here.

51
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,910
Then… what are those people drinking?

52
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,750
Wine, of course.

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,400
Here.

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,750
Now we have some?

55
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,710
Sir,

56
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,360
yes, yes.

57
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,430
You three look unfamiliar.

58
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,560
Where are you from?

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,200
The Capital City.

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,150
Ah, the Capital City.

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,960
The Capital City is truly a fine place.

62
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,560
I've never been there.

63
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,240
Could you tell me about it?

64
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,360
Come, come, thank you.

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,200
Go on, tell us.

66
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,720
It really is a marvelous place.

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,680
Sadly, we have no chance to be there.

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,830
Why is that?

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,270
Since ancient times, the martial world
and the Imperial Court,

70
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,560
knights and officials,

71
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,630
are like fire and water.

72
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,830
Yes, that's true.

73
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,040
Perhaps that's just your prejudice.

74
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,750
From what I know,

75
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,160
the Imperial Court values talent.

76
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
In recent years,

77
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
they've begun recruiting
from the martial world.

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
Forget it.

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,920
It's merely leading the tiger
into the cage.

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,800
We're not falling for that trick.

81
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,160
By the way, after talking to you
for so long,

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,190
I still haven't asked your name.

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,480
I am He Zheng.

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,870
May I have your name?

85
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,720
I am

86
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,270
Lin Yu.

87
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,870
Good, very good.

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,480
Lin,

89
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,240
what a destined meeting this is.

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
In that case,

91
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,830
let's get drunk tonight, shall we?

92
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,040
Sure, sounds great!

93
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
- Cheers!
- Here!

94
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,880
Here.

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,400
To be honest,

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,870
when I first saw you,

97
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,950
I thought you came looking for trouble.

98
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,360
Ah, Lin,

99
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
you've got me all wrong.

100
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,680
Our inn is named Friend's Inn.

101
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,760
The reason

102
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,560
is to keep trouble far away.

103
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,870
What we truly seek

104
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,310
is to build good ties with all.

105
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
Am I right, brothers?

106
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,320
That's right.

107
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,720
So lively in here!

108
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,190
Lady San?

109
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,140
Lady San,

110
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,580
you've come at just the right time.

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,600
Listen,

112
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,240
these three here are honored guests

113
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,630
from the Capital City.

114
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,830
You must bring out

115
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,930
your finest wine and dishes.

116
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
From the Capital City?

117
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,000
Of course they deserve
the best hospitality.

118
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,350
Waiter!

119
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,040
Bring out the finest wine in the inn!

120
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,880
Got it.

121
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Brothers,

122
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,800
take good care of Young Master Lin.

123
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,080
- No need.
- Sure.

124
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,710
Have a drink, Young Master Lin.

125
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,040
Here, pour another cup.

126
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
What's wrong?

127
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,070
The madam is pretty,

128
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,390
and your eyes are glued to her.

129
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,590
Hey!

130
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,040
Say something.

131
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,260
Have you been blinded by lust?

132
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,870
Sit still.

133
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm afraid what I'll say
might scare you.

134
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Go on, say it.

135
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,720
That man with the scar
is called He Heng.

136
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,800
Three years ago,

137
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,160
he wiped out an entire caravan alone
in Baiyun Ravine.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And that Lady Li too.

139
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,710
Drink well!

140
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,600
Also known as Lady Shisan.

141
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,360
I told you before.

142
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,630
You remember, right?

143
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,750
That devil who drains men's strength

144
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,920
to please herself?

145
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,270
Exactly.

146
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,780
This is bad.

147
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,680
We've in deep water.

148
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,820
Well,

149
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,070
with you and Eunuch Leng here,

150
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,390
we don't have to be afraid, right?

151
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,870
It's not as simple as you think.

152
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,430
They're all wanted
by the Imperial Court.

153
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,750
Then let's hurry up and go,

154
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,590
and not stay here.

155
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,510
Look at the Crown Prince.

156
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,600
Wouldn't leaving now

157
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,630
arouse even more suspicion?

158
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,750
Just now,

159
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,070
if I hadn't shown a little skill
in advance,

160
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,950
how could they be so friendly?

161
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,870
So it's because of you.

162
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,750
What should we do now?

163
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,680
Eat, of course.

164
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Where's the food?

165
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
Waiter!

166
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,510
Why aren't you drinking?

167
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,910
Not interested.

168
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,630
What's so good about alcohol?

169
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,870
He drank that much!

170
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,560
He has stayed in the Palace
for a long time,

171
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,480
so naturally he needs to relax
when he comes out.

172
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,870
I don't get it.

173
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,750
Are you doing alright?

174
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,480
These are just small occasions.

175
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,510
I can handle them easily.

176
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,720
I'm asking

177
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,910
if you're living well

178
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,320
in the Palace now.

179
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,110
Well...

180
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,800
What about you?

181
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,840
I was pretty free and easy before.

182
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,630
Never thought

183
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,030
I would become your guard.

184
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,630
Well, it's quite the coincidence.

185
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,680
Coincidence?

186
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,440
Did you happen to pass
by that bamboo grove?

187
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,480
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

188
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,990
If it weren't for me and His Highness,

189
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,120
you've been killed.

190
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,140
Whatever.

191
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,130
No one would care anyway.

192
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,120
I care.

193
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,750
What did you just say?

194
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,800
I...

195
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,550
I said...

196
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,790
Look at me when you say it.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,940
Fill it up, fill it up!

198
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,750
Where's Qingyao?

199
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,390
Qingyao.

200
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
Qingyao.

201
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,120
- Qingyao.
- I'm here.

202
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,960
Qingyao,

203
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,550
I think I've had too much to drink.

204
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,720
Help me back to my room to rest.

205
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,630
- Alright.
- Hurry.

206
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,320
Let's go.

207
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,510
Young Master Lin, don't leave.

208
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,720
Let's keep drinking.

209
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,800
What about you?

210
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,550
Not satisfied yet.

211
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,790
Bring out a few more jars!

212
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,360
My fist technique...

213
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,550
Would you do me the honor?

214
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,870
I heard from Young Master Lin

215
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,840
that you are highly skilled
in martial arts.

216
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,910
But in the martial world,

217
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,790
I've never heard of your name before.

218
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,240
Highly skilled?

219
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,550
I'm merely a guard, that's all.

220
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,960
I have no title.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,320
True mastery hides its brilliance.

222
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,670
One conceals both merit and fame.

223
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,960
Indeed, that is the highest realm.

224
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,720
But this face of yours...

225
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,870
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

226
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,160
Is that so?

227
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,360
Not I think,

228
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,390
I must've truly seen you somewhere.

229
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,150
Perhaps,

230
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
it was a bond carried over
from a past life.

231
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,510
Who knows?

232
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,600
Why does your heart race so fast?

233
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,030
Why do I think

234
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,790
you're even more nervous than I am?

235
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,440
Enjoy yourself.

236
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,280
