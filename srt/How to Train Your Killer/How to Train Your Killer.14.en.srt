=Episode 14=

3
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
Are you really leaving?

4
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,160
Come on.

5
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,150
Well...

6
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,430
That rich lady is so generous.

7
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,070
Isn't working as her bodyguard

8
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,870
more profitable than fighting
and killing?

9
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,040
She doesn't need my protection anymore.

10
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,550
Why's that?

11
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,950
Did she find someone
with better martial arts skills?

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,200
I came here today

13
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,790
to say goodbye to you.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,920
I'm done being a killer.

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,070
You're quitting the martial world?

16
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,310
Will the Wind and Rain Pavilion
let you go?

17
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,680
They're welcome to come and try.

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,680
The debts I owed them

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,510
were repaid long ago.

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,680
I want to choose my own path

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,590
from here on.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,270
Then where are you headed?

23
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,910
Jiangnan.

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,040
Ah, Jiangnan is a fine place.

25
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,690
Heard there've been
many lady-kidnappers there lately.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you're short on money,

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,990
you could take action.

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,880
I told you,

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,200
I'm no longer a killer.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,590
Alright, alright.

31
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,920
It's up to you.

32
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,480
What a pity for all that bright silver!

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,960
Come on.

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,400
After this drink,

35
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,750
I'm leaving.

36
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,870
Take care.

37
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,590
Hey!

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Take care.

39
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,750
You're dragging this out.

Why are you here?

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,560
Did the Wind and Rain Pavilion send you?

74
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,520
No.

75
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,480
I just happened to pass by.

76
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,070
I'm no longer a killer.

77
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,310
Were you implicated

78
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,150
because of what happened to me
last time?

79
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
Wait.

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
Our meeting must be fate.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,390
Why don't we share a drink together?

82
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,710
No need.

83
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,510
Let's go.

84
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,510
- Here.
- Here.

85
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,160
Do you have family or friends
in Jiangnan?

86
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,350
No.

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,680
Then why do you want to go there?

88
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,590
I've never been there.

89
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,990
I just want to see more of the world.

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,920
What happened to that female killer

91
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,990
who was with you last time?

92
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,630
What female killer?

93
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
I don't remember.

94
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,190
You left because of her,

95
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,310
didn't you?

96
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,720
Enough about me.

97
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,480
Tell me about you two instead.

98
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,630
Why did you come back?

99
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,680
I didn't want Feng

100
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,870
to keep wandering with me.

101
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,000
Perhaps the most dangerous place

102
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,560
is often the safest.

103
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,350
Who knows?

104
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,390
Living one more day

105
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,870
is already a blessing.

106
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,870
No matter what happens,

107
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,750
I will never leave your side.

108
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,150
Qingyao,

109
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,430
you've known me for so long.

110
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,870
Why are you still so tense?

111
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Qingyao, you are

112
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,410
not going to be like
the last two times, are you?

113
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,910
Bai.

114
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
- Here.
- Here.

115
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,510
In my lifetime,

116
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,440
I have possessed

117
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,630
wealth,

118
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,030
status,

119
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,390
and mastery of martial arts.

120
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,390
But all these together

121
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,600
are not worth
even a single finger of Feng.

122
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,120
You are drunk.

123
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,200
No, I am not.

124
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,480
With a true friend,
even a thousand cups feel too few.

125
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,670
- Come on.
- Come on.

126
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,080
Shiyi,

127
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,030
let me offer you some advice.

128
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,150
Life drifts like fleeting clouds
in the sky.

129
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
Cherish the one beside you
in this moment.

130
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,600
And you'll have no regrets.

131
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,280
Bai,

132
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,560
you are drunk.

133
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,120
Come, I'll help you get some rest.

134
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,360
Go back inside and rest.

135
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,200
Let's go.

136
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,360
Take care, Bai.

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,840
Be careful.

138
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,080
Fleeting clouds in the sky.

139
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,790
The present.

140
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,470
The one beside me.

141
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,000
What is it again?

142
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,750
I'm not feeling well.

143
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Not feeling well?

144
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
So I married a sickly woman?

145
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,920
Or perhaps

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,480
these are all just excuses?

147
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,600
You

148
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,790
don't like me at all.

149
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,230
I...

150
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,770
- Your Highness...
- Enough!

151
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,870
Don't think I don't know

152
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,910
that the old fox

153
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,080
married you to me back then

154
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,480
just to secure the Gu family's position.
