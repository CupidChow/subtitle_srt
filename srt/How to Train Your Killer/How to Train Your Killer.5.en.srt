00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,900
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:48,820
How's that?

4
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,130
Pluck a blossom within ten steps.

5
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,880
Looks like my skill is mastered.

6
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,520
A promising talent.

7
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,200
No time to waste.

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,070
Let's set out at once.

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,120
Ah?

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,520
Set out?

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,360
Mm.

12
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,550
Go where?

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,600
To finish the mission.

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,230
Right now?

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,120
Strike while it's hot. Let's move.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,280
No, no, no.

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,710
- Go.
- No.

18
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,430
Go.

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,760
I… I really can't right now.

20
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,390
A man can't admit he's incapable.

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,350
But right now, I'm hardly a man.

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,640
I am a man.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,480
That's Butcher Wang Quan?

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,040
Isn't he just a pork seller?

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,200
Don't underestimate him.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,640
That year, he used this knife

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,650
to kill all 13 members
of the Liu family.

28
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,280
13 members?

29
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,680
Just one knife?

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,950
Nothing to be afraid of.

31
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,150
Butcher Wang Quan is fierce

32
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,070
and quick-tempered.

33
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,990
Easy to spark his fury.

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,920
You can start by shaking his composure.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,870
Wait.

36
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,590
My composure, or his?

37
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,440
I…

38
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,030
Aren't you a noble lady?

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,970
Can't make difficulties?

40
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,030
Still need me to teach you?

41
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,030
I'm always so gentle and refined,

42
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,430
so graceful and kind.

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,000
How would I know those shameless tricks?

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,240
Excuse me.

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,240
We are making wontons today.

46
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,000
Cut me ten jin of minced pork.

47
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,400
All lean,

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
not a speck of fat.

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,800
Alright, alright.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
Good knife skills.

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,840
Here's your pork.

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,920
Wait.

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,630
I also need ten jin of fat pork,

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,240
minced the same way,

55
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,360
to fill meat buns.

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,120
You certainly have an appetite.

57
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,030
Your meat is ready.

58
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,030
Two copper coins.

59
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,870
Well then...

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,680
I'll take another ten jin
of minced meat,

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,310
half fatty

62
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,150
and half lean.

63
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,310
We'll make meatballs.

64
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,550
Are you trying to mess with me?

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,870
I'll turn you into meatballs.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,080
Hurry up and give me a hand!

67
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,070
(The mind follows the will,)

68
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,630
(channeling strength through.)

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Wang Quan.

70
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,750
You have a really good appetite.

71
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,830
The mission's complete.

72
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,670
Why wouldn't I eat?

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,920
Candied hawthorns are delicious.

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,180
I've liked it since I was a kid.

75
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,430
Then keep on eating.

76
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,650
(Assassination List)
Killer God Bai Yan.

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
This guy commits

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,840
every imaginable crime.

79
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,660
He's committed over a dozen offenses.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,480
He only targets women.

81
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,240
What a vile man.

82
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,630
And a skilled fighter too.

83
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,070
You mean,

84
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,120
you can't beat him?

85
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
I could before.

86
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,950
Now I can't.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,240
If we join forces,

88
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,300
that Bai Yan

89
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,390
will be easy to bring down.

90
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,720
It's because you slow me down,

91
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,880
that I can't win against him.

92
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,430
He must have a weakness, right?

93
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
Of course.

94
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,480
Bai Yan is fond of beauties.

95
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,120
He often visits the brothels.

96
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,670
Brothels?

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,070
I am the dignified Crown Princess.

98
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,950
Going to a place like that

99
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,310
would hardly suit me.

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,950
You're right about that.

101
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,510
A place of pleasure,

102
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,360
a crowd of women.

103
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,440
That wouldn't suit you much.

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,560
But right now I'm a man.

105
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,360
Is it fun there?

106
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,590
What?

107
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,640
You want to go?

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,870
Don't forget.

109
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,950
You're the dignified Crown Princess now.

110
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,310
As Crown Princess,

111
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,680
I must lead by example,

112
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,920
and step forward before others.

113
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,680
How could I tolerate someone
like Bai Yan,

114
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,780
bringing harm to the realm?

115
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,870
Tomorrow,

116
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,510
we'll set out for the brothel.

117
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,320
No, wait.

118
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,600
It is to eliminate harm for the people.

119
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,680
It's convenient for you,

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
but it's troublesome for me.

121
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,040
That's easy.

122
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,150
I've got a way.

123
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,790
Take a bite and I'll tell you.

124
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,710
No, I'm not eating.

125
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Come on, come on.

126
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
Come on, come on.

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,080
Young master.

128
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
What is it?

129
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,630
This is your so-called plan?

130
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,000
You're really daring.

131
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,040
It's for the people's good.

132
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,680
To be honest…

133
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,120
You're beautiful.

134
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,000
Truly beautiful.

135
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,390
Young master.

136
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,920
My mother passed away early,

137
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,120
but...

138
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,800
She did make me rather handsome.

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,220
- Really?
- Indeed.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,950
Feeling quite cheerful.

141
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,270
Happy indeed.

142
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,800
I can't stand those flaunting gestures.

143
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,170
If you like dressing up,

144
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,390
do it yourself.

145
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,990
When you tried to charm
the Crown Prince last time,

146
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,120
you were doing pretty well.

147
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
Do you still want
to complete the mission?

148
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,510
You need to show some professionalism.

149
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,120
Besides, you're using my body.

150
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,060
What are you shy about?

151
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,630
Come on, let's go.

152
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,110
Go, carry out the mission.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,360
That won't do, sir.

154
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,310
How wicked.

155
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,120
I accidentally walked
into the wrong place.

156
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,160
Wait a moment.

157
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,900
Since you're already here,

158
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,960
don't ruin my mood.

159
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,150
Stay and keep me company.

160
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,790
I'm worried

161
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,360
other guests will grow impatient.

162
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,960
Rest assured.

163
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,200
No one dares vie with me.

164
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,510
May I know

165
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,240
what skills you possess?

166
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I am skilled in dance.

167
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,730
Sir, come join us.

168
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,480
Catch me if you can.

169
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,720
Here I come.

170
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,080
You came alone, sir?

171
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,150
Alone.

172
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
Come catch me.

173
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,790
Young Master...

174
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,120
Slow down.

175
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,190
You're playful.

176
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,790
(It's taking far too long.)

177
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,870
(Could it be my beauty)

178
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,670
(has no sway over Bai Yan?)

179
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,750
Though your beauty is striking,

180
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,670
when it comes to your dancing skill…

181
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,200
Well, it's no big deal.

182
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,440
(Darn it!)

183
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,710
(I danced poorly on purpose,)

184
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,030
(to make him not look at me,)

185
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,510
(so that I could make my move easily.)

186
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,080
(Why does this fellow
keep staring at me?)

187
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,150
Beauty, stop dancing.

188
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,690
Come share a drink with me.

189
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,670
To win a beauty's favor tonight,

190
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,750
even if I perish in your gentle embrace,

191
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,120
that would still be my fortune.

192
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,960
You...

193
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,670
Your fortune?

194
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,600
How could this be?

195
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,560
Let go of me!

196
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Lucky I wore chainmail beneath my robe.

197
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,790
I knew there was something
wrong with you.

198
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,440
When did this Qinyue House

199
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,600
have a beauty like you?

200
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,240
Since you've come here,

201
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,910
you might as well stay for good.

202
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,790
If I hadn't shown mercy,

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,190
you'd have been gone long ago.

204
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,840
Take my advice.

205
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,720
Do as you're told.

206
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,600
Get your filthy hands off!
