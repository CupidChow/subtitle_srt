00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,900
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,270
Qingyao.

4
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,200
Qingyao.

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,040
It's so late already.

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,040
You're still awake?

7
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,310
Your Highness.

8
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,590
Qingyao,

9
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,750
in the middle of the night,

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,600
why are you suddenly dressing up?

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Ling just told me

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,560
that you were coming, so I...

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,400
Qingyao,

14
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,120
I've always felt it was a pity

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,120
that the killer ruined our wedding night

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,590
that night.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,480
Your Highness,

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,710
I...

19
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,840
My father hasn't been well lately.

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,850
He's been longing to see his grandchild.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,510
The wet nurse was sent
for this very purpose.

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,510
So, Qingyao,

23
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,640
I think the time has come.

24
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,270
Your Highness,

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,920
it's inconvenient for me today.

26
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,350
It's already been days.

27
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,760
It still hasn't left.

28
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,350
Alright then.

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,400
We'll make plans another day.

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
Shiyi.

31
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,270
Shiyi.

32
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,710
The sky is vast, the seas unbounded.

33
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,840
Hero Shi, you are not a sparrow,

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,960
so why do you willingly trap yourself
in a cage?

35
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,080
Although I don't know exactly

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,710
what you want,

37
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,680
in this Palace,

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,310
whether it is power

39
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,360
or wealth,

40
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,630
it is not something you can obtain

41
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,870
merely by having skills.

42
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,680
I advise you

43
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,560
to find another path.

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,030
Your martial arts skills
aren't bad either.

45
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,590
You not only serve as a lackey
to others,

46
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,120
but you also fail to be a real man.

47
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,190
How come you're trying to lecture me?

48
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,360
Don't think that just because
the Crown Princess backs you,

49
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,390
you can look down on everyone else.

50
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,160
You're no better yourself.

51
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,360
Time will tell.

52
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,190
We'll see about that.

53
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,240
Qingyao.

54
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,800
Your Highness.

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
I have something for you.

56
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,910
Your Highness,

57
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,070
these are treasures
specially prepared for you

58
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,240
by His Highness.

59
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,870
Well? Do you like it?

60
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,160
Yeah.

61
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
I like it.

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,600
Your Highness,

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,880
the rouge from Ningxiang Pavilion

64
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,100
is a rare treasure to come by.

65
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,240
Where did you get so many of them?

66
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,950
What is a little
Ningxiang Pavilion worth?

67
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,390
His Highness knew you adore it,

68
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,190
so he bought the entire shop for you.

69
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,480
From now on, this pavilion

70
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,510
is like your own dressing table.

71
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,760
Qingyao,

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,840
let me help you.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,840
Come here.

74
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
Qingyao,

75
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,630
from now on,

76
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,170
take good care of the inner quarters;

77
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,040
you don't need to worry
about anything else.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,640
I will protect you.

79
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
(Crown Prince's Residence)

80
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,070
Shiyi.

81
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,480
You were looking for me?

82
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,230
No.

83
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,400
Shiyi,

84
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,270
I feel like

85
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,070
you've been avoiding me lately.

86
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,430
Are you unhappy here?

87
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,670
Not at all.

88
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,160
Oh, come on.

89
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,190
I know you too well.

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Whenever you're upset,

91
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,480
it's written all over your face.

92
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,000
You've never been one to hide it.

93
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,150
However,

94
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,120
the residence has been
quite peaceful lately,

95
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,440
and no one's been causing trouble.

96
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,270
So what's there to be unhappy about?

97
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,680
You're right.

98
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,160
Nothing to be unhappy about.

99
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,430
What about you?

100
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,630
You seem in good spirits too.

101
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,310
I think things have been
going well lately.

102
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,310
I'm quite happy.

103
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,760
What's wrong?

104
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,800
To carry on the royal bloodline

105
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,600
and enjoy the splendor of palace life,

106
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,390
it is indeed quite pleasing.

107
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,360
What do you mean by that?

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Why do I feel like there's more
behind your words?

109
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,470
Gu Qingyao,

110
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
you keep saying

111
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,290
that you want to fulfill your own worth.

112
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,700
Does that mean

113
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,220
having children for men in this Palace?

114
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,120
I am the Crown Princess after all.

115
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,830
Is there anything wrong with me

116
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,070
continuing the royal bloodline?

117
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,480
But is this truly what you want?

118
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,600
What's the matter?

119
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,120
He is my husband.

120
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,190
If I don't have a child for him,
should I have one for you instead?

121
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,960
Alright.

122
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,670
Since

123
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,870
you've secured your place
as the Crown Princess,

124
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,960
there's no reason for me

125
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
to stay by your side.

126
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,650
Rather than remain your shadow guard,

127
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
I'd rather be a killer.

128
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm leaving.

129
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,150
Then go out and risk your life.

130
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,440
Even if one day you get hurt

131
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,790
or die, no one will know,

132
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,080
no one will collect your corpse.

133
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,150
You brought it all on yourself;

134
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,480
you have only yourself to blame.

135
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,590
Gu Qingyao,

136
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,510
we were never meant
to walk the same path.

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,440
The world is vast.

138
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,270
I have my own road to follow.

139
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,120
Are you really leaving?

140
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,960
Alright then.

141
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,910
Then take your lousy rouge with you.

142
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,390
Go wherever you like.
