00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,430
Shiyi,

4
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,790
how does it feel to be pinched?

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,430
Didn't you eat?

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,840
You're so weak.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,920
How stubborn you are.

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,150
I just don't want your blood
splashing on us.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,680

Qingyao.

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,400
Qingyao.

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,520
What is wrong with you?

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,590
Need a physician?

16
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,120
No… no need.

17
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,350
Your Highness,

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,590
this is a hidden ailment.

19
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,310
Never spread it around.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Your Highness,

21
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,400
please head back first.

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,710
I don't want you to see me

23
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,710
in this state.

24
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,840
That won't do.

25
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,350
I'll fetch the physician.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,760
Your Highness...

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,270
Physician!

28
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,790
Physician!

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,200
Wait.

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,550
Could it be that something
happened to Shiyi?

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
Shiyi.

32
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,150

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,750
Come and take a look.

34
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,870
Hold it carefully.

35
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,140
Sir, get me one.

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,460
Candied hawthorn skewers.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,360
Come and take a look.

38
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,030
Take a look, miss.

39
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,390
- Here, little trinkets.
- Thanks.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,120
Send it to my house.

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,750
Alright, Miss, take care.

48
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,720
Leave here.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,840
No...

51

Qingyao...

52
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,310
Leave, quickly.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Shiyi.

54
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,110
Shiyi.

55
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,240
Are you alright?

56
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,070
I'll take you home.

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,400
Come on.

58
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,670
Get up.

59
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,750
Here, sit properly.

60
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,350
Come on.

61
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Come on.

62
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go.

63
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
Master,

64
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,510
let them leave just like that?

65
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,310
What?

66
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,650
Do you want me to have no one available

67
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,940
around me?

68
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,210
I wouldn't dare, Master.

69
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,110

Shiyi...

74
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Come on.

78
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,670
Who's there?

79
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,840
Quick, help him!

80
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,080
Take care.

(Moyu Pavilion)

82
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,630
Shiyi?

83
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,510
Shiyi?

84
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,000
Shiyi?

85
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,790
Yuan Chen.

86
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,510
How is he now?

87
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
See for yourself.

88
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,630
He almost didn't make it.

89
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,550
Luckily, my medical skills
are unmatched.

90
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,190
I spent a fortune and went all out

91
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,030
to buy him high-quality medicinal herbs

92
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,400
for both internal and external use.

93
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,550
My shining silver!

94
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,320
Then why hasn't he woken up yet?

95
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,910
He's suffered such grave injuries.

96
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,290
It's not so easy to wake from that.

97
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,240
Besides,

98
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,670
I still need more medicinal herbs,

99
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,150
like the snow lotus,

100
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,480
the blood-replenishing pill,

101
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,360
and supreme ginseng.

102
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,390
Right?

103
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,390
Yuan Chen...

104
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,600
You're so noisy.

105
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,360
You ungrateful scoundrel.

106
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,750
I went to great lengths to save you.

107
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
You're awake.

108
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,080
Does it hurt anywhere?

109
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,150
No, it doesn't.

110
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,080

I can handle it myself.

You're still a patient right now.

147
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,870
Be good.

148
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,940
You've been here these past few days?

149

My father already

154
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,130
confirmed who you really are.

155
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,630
Even if he finds out later,

156
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,470
it won't matter.

Minister Gu?

158
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,150
Why did he hide my true identity?

159
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,240
Honestly,

160
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,600
I have no idea either.

161
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,390
Maybe,

162
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,480
my father was worried

163
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,940
that I hadn't yet found my footing,

164
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
and someone might speak ill
of me before Ling Yu,

165
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,060
affecting the relationship between them.

166
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,440
I can't figure it out either.

167
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,240
I'll ask him when we meet again.

168
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,910
Anyway, the top priority right now

169
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,480
is for you to heal your injury first,

170
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,440
and we can make long-term plans later.

171
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,280
Alright?

172
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,680
Come on.

173
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,150
When will you be leaving?

174
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,840
Depends on my mood.

175
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,320
Then I suppose my injury

176
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,940
will have to heal a little slower.

177
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,510
Come on, eat something.

178
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,670
My injuries still haven't healed fully.

179
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,750
Eat or not?

180
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,120
Finally, you're all recovered.

181
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,390
Lady, take him away.

182
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,470
I really

183
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,320
can't afford to serve him.

184
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,230
Hey, Shiyi.

185
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,840
What's your plan after this?

186
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,670
I plan to head back.

187
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,600
For what?

188
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,160
To settle the score.

189
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,440
Let it go.

190
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,790
Don't stir up more trouble.

191
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,670
You're no longer tied to them.

192
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,750
Better to cut things clean

193
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,750
and live your own life.

194
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,150
I think Yuan Chen's right.

195
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,120
I think you'd better just stay

196
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,790
by my side as a guard.

197
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,790
With my father's word behind you,

198
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,750
it's perfectly legitimate.

199
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,870
Perfectly legitimate, is it?

200
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
Well,

201
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,080
it's happily decided.

202
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,440
I'll tidy up a bit,

203
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,550
and then we'll go home.

204
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,790
Come on, just go.

205
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,780
(Crown Prince's Residence)

206
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,200
You've finally returned.

207
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,040
His Highness has been waiting
for you all day.
