=Episode 15=

3
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,780
Don't think I don't know

4
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,700
that the old fox

5
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,940
married you to me back then

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,460
just to secure the Gu family's position.

7
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,500
If you truly have no feelings for me,

8
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,900
there's still time to change your mind.

9
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,460
Qingyao,

10
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,820
what's really troubling you?

11
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,620
Was it someone who bullied you,

12
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,700
or are you saying

13
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,060
you find life here too stifling?

14
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,940
I admit, days like these,

15
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,880
are dull beyond measure.

16
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,340
Everyone thinks the Crown Prince

17
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,140
will wield immense power in the future.

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,740
But I've long known

19
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,060
the Emperor here in the Palace

20
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,100
is merely the prisoner
with the longest sentence.

21
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,860
How about this?

22
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,460
Let's journey
through the world together.

23
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,500
That way,

24
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,980
wouldn't it be OK?

25
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,100
Of course it would.

26
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,260
As the Crown Prince,

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,280
it is only right

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,840
to see what kind of life the people lead

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,380
under the grandeur of our land.

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,340
Besides,

31
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,060
I've dreamed of the martial world
since childhood.

32
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,090
To uphold justice and protect the weak,

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,690
and roam the world with a sword,

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,980
is a unique charm.

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,500
Qingyao,

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,500
what do you think?

37
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,700
Mm.

38
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,700
Your Highness,

39
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,940
this must never be done.

40
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,500
If anything were to happen to you,

41
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,300
how should I report this to His Majesty?

42
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,220
This journey is merely
for leisure and sightseeing.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,740
Where would any danger come from?

44
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,540
I will travel lightly with Qingyao.

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,720
We will bring no attendants.

46
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,820
Never make a big fuss,

47
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,220
or it will ruin her good mood.

48
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,900
But Your Highness,

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,280
the martial world is treacherous;

50
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,780
those people are all crude,

51
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,740
striking without restraint.

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,260
- If you...
- I still have you.

53
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,540
Remember this.

54
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,800
Protect us from the shadows.

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,030
Don't show up unless necessary.

56
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,460
I wish to see for myself

57
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,460
what the legendary martial world,

58
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,340
truly looks like.

59
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,180
Yes, Your Highness.

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,300
You're awake.

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,140
I'm awake.

62
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,900
At your level of skill,

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,520
still using an axe to chop wood?

64
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,220
It's not an easy task for people
in the martial world

65
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,540
to chop wood and cook meals.

66
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,540
It's just chopping wood.

67
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
How hard could it be?

68
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,980
Don't believe me?

69
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,940
Here, give it a try.

70
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,260
Fine, I'll try.

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,940
Here.

72
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,980
Here.

73
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,020
Well?

74
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,180
Not that simple, is it?

75
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,460
Let me try again.

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,780
You said my swordsmanship is too rigid
and thus easy to break,

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,700
but overcoming rigidity with strength

78
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,990
is precisely my way of the sword.

79
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,500
That night,

80
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,780
if I hadn't faced two foes alone,

81
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm afraid you wouldn't be able
to beat me.

82
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,740
All the hidden secrets

83
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,500
lie within the art of chopping wood.

84
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,700
You feel it out.

85
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,100
I'll go cook us a meal.

86
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,060
You'll get to taste my cooking soon.

87
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,700
Alright, Bai.

88
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,620
See? I told you so.

89
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,100
Bai Jun was bound to return.

90
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,260
Who would've thought your stubborn head

91
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,620
finally figured it out?

92
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,820
End this quickly.

93
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,860
The Master

94
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,260
has long grown impatient.

95
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,020
If we just let him die like this,

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,760
wouldn't that be letting him off
too easily?

97
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,060
Shiyi,

98
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,940
take a rest for now.

99
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,820
Come, it's mealtime.

100
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,660
Coming.

101
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,540
Today I must

102
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,500
really savor your cooking.

103
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,340
Come on over.

104
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,340
Have a sip of water first.

105
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,820
Thank you.

106
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,100
This water is poisoned.

107
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,300
What?

108
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,780
You narrowly escaped
and became a traitor.

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,960
You actually colluded with two fugitives

110
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,300
wanted by the Imperial Court.

111
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,580
The innocent lives

112
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,540
lost at your hands

113
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,220
outnumber the bamboo in this grove.

114
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,300
How dare you still

115
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,060
twist truth and falsehood?

116
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,540
You stand defiant even at death's door.

117
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,420
Let me deal with those two first,

118
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,140
then I'll come for you.

119
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,260
Feng, run!

120
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,540
No, I won't leave.

121
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,980
If you die, I'll die with you.

122
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,020
- I'm not leaving.
- Go.

123
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,900
No.

124
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,140
- Hurry!
- I said no.

125
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,620
So devoted!

126
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,500
No need to rush.

127
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,740
I'll send you all to your deaths
right now.

128
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,580
Bai, you go first.

129
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,300
Struck by her whip,

130
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,420
you are already a spent force.

131
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,340
How about this, Shiyi?

132
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,180
Kneel and beg us now.

133
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,420
Maybe we'll consider

134
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,980
to spare that woman.

135
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,220
What do you say?

136
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm not sure

137
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,060
if you've ever heard this saying.

138
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,260
What saying?

139
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,900
A villain

140
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,980
always dies from talking too much.

141
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,660
You're courting death.

142
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,340
You old eunuch,

143
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,220
it's you again.

144
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,300
You two only know how to talk tough.

145
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,140
You got away last time.

146
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,580
But this time,

147
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,660
you might not leave here alive.

148
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,500
Eunuch Leng,

149
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,740
I told you not to steal the spotlight.

150
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,700
Let me join in the fun

151
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,500
of saving a beauty as well.

152
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,580
Your Highness,

153
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,260
these two are ruthless and cunning.

154
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,140
I must strike first
to gain the upper hand.

155
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,940
Is that so?

156
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,320
You brat,

157
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,300
consider yourself lucky.

158
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,940
Forget it.

159
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,280
Never chase a desperate foe.

160
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,180
Yes.

161
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,540
Be careful.

162
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,220
Are you alright?

163
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,420
Hero Shi.

164
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,580
Hero Shi.

165
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,300
No need to be nervous, Hero Shi.

166
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,980
Your Highness.

167
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,060
No, I wouldn't dare.

168
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,020
It's always others who serve me.

169
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
You're actually the first one

170
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,940
who's ever refused to let me serve.

171
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,380
Your Highness.

172
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,660
This time I am traveling incognito.

173
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,090
My identity must not be revealed.

174
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,240
Just call me young master.

175
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,540
How are you feeling?

176
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,460
Don't worry.

177
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,400
After taking the pill

178
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,760
I got from the imperial physician,

179
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,660
you'll be fine.

180
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
Where are Bai Jun and Ruan Feng?

181
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,900
They're both fine.

182
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,540
You're the one who's more badly hurt.

183
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,500
You looked impressive
taking on two alone.

184
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,140
Still as stubborn as ever.

185
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,820
Why are you here?

186
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,140
You think I want to be here?

187
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,060
It's just a coincidence.

188
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,620
Actually, it's Qingyao...

189
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,860
Life in the Palace is dull,

190
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,340
so the Crown Prince brought me
for some travel.

191
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,300
Guess what?

192
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,640
When I passed by the bamboo grove,

193
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,980
I heard the sound of a fight.

194
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,020
What a coincidence.

195
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,300
It turned out to be Hero Shi,
who left without a word.

196
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,180
A coincidence?

197
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,380
No story is complete
without coincidences.

198
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,900
I'm venturing through the world,

199
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,220
and I just happen to need a guide.

200
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,300
Meeting like this must be fate.

201
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,100
I wonder if you...

202
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,940
Your Highness.

203
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,820
Sorry, I am unable to do so.

204
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,060
Fine.

205
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,940
If you can't, then you can't.

206
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,380
You're not much of a guide anyway.

207
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,660
Qingyao,

208
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,220
how do you know that so well?

209
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,860
Just a guess.

210
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,020
Either way,

211
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
please think it through, Hero Shi.

212
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,060
Both Qingyao and I

213
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,660
hope you'll stand guard for us.

214
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,900
Let's go.

215
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,740
Mm.

216
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,020
Wind and Rain Pavilion?

217
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,740
Yes, Your Highness.

218
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,300
I've looked into it quietly.

219
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
Those two are exactly

220
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,260
the top killers of the Pavilion.

221
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,500
They're known as the Serpent
and Scorpion Twin Fiends.

222
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,140
Then why would these killers suddenly

223
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,140
come looking for Hero Shi for no reason?

224
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,380
The owner of this bamboo grove, Bai Jun,

225
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,280
is a wanted criminal pursued
by the authorities.

226
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Perhaps he is a close friend
of Hero Shi.

227
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,900
The two sides must have
long-held grudges.

228
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,820
So that's how it is.

229
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,020
Is this Wind and Rain Pavilion

230
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,580
the most deadly killer group
in the martial world?

231
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,220
Its name is not well-known,

232
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,740
but it is the most mysterious.

233
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,180
To the Imperial Court,

234
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,180
there's no such thing as mystery.
