00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,900
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,280
Did you notice anything unusual?

4
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,000
Tempered muscles and bones,

5
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,640
he is a first-class master.

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,350
Only with a hint of gentle grace.

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,560
Shall I investigate further?

8
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,400
No need for that.

9
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,710
The hidden truth

10
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,040
will be revealed tonight.

11
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,760
Honey,

12
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,150
you've come.

13
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,990
Qingyao.

14
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,590
You look radiant.

15
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,270
Come here.

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Qingyao,

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,280
I offer this pot of wine

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,910
as my respect to you.

19
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,590
Without you,

20
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,870
I'd have lost my life.

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,680
Even if there were a next time,

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,520
I would still do the same.

23
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,150
Even if

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
it meant risking my own life,

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,000
I would be willing.

26
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,680
There will be no next time.

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,460
Now, within the residence,

28
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,990
expert guards are stationed everywhere.

29
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,470
With Eunuch Leng holding command,

30
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,680
even a fly could not get through.

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,360
Then in this courtyard,

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,030
are there many masters lying in wait?

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,630
How could there be any here?

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,870
Tonight is truly our wedding night

35
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,520
for just the two of us.

36
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,430
No one is allowed to disturb us.

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,520
However,

38
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,990
there is one thing I do not understand.

39
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,360
I want you to clear my doubts.

40
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,870
What is it?

41
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,150
That night, I was saved by you
more than once.

42
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,770
The assassin could have killed you
with a single strike.

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,520
But I believe

44
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,680
he never meant to harm you.

45
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,310
Your Highness,

46
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,280
what do you mean by that?

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,310
I mean,

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,710
he dared to attack even me,

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,080
would he truly have spared you?

50
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,800
Do you believe

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,580
that I have any connection
with that killer?

52
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120
Not quite.

53
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,600
You and I have known each other
since childhood.

54
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,430
Marrying you is a blessing

55
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,070
earned over many lifetimes.

56
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
I never thought

57
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,720
you would come to doubt me.

58
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,600
Qingyao, what are you thinking about?

59
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,480
I am only worried about your safety.

60
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,000
When you ascend the throne someday,

61
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,750
I was hoping

62
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,600
to truly assist you

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,510
in ruling the realm.

64
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,480
How could I ever...

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,320
Alright, alright.

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
I have wronged you.

67
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,680
From now on, I'll never
bring this up again.

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
Is that alright?

69
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,670
Mm.

70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,270
Your Highness,

71
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,480
it's getting late.

72
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,350
Alright.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
I'll follow your lead.

74
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,270
Then let's go.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
(This is)

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,920
(killing intent.)

77
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,190
(Could it be...)

78
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,680
That scoundrel!

79
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,870
Since you show no kindness,

80
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,160
don't blame me for being merciless.

81
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
Qingyao,

82
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,000
are you feeling nervous?

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,840
Qingyao,

84
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,590
what's wrong with you?

85
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,440
Qingyao.

86
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,480
My whole body aches.

87
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,470
Qingyao.

88
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,320
(Feng Yu, Shen Wanwan, Secondary Consorts)
His Highness seems full of life.

89
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,120
(Yaoyao, imperial dog)
I truly don't see

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,360
what exactly makes her special?

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,730
Speaking of family background,

92
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,830
you were born
into the General's Mansion.

93
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,510
And in terms of beauty,

94
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,240
she is far less than you.

95
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,030
Relax.

96
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,510
In just a few days,

97
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,330
His Highness will naturally
got tired of her.

98
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,310
As long as she stays in here,

99
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,360
she can't cause any real trouble.

100
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,560
What's gotten into you?

101
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,830
Qingyao! Qingyao!

102
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,840
- Your Highness.
- Qingyao.

103
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,000
What happened to you?

104
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,270
Qingyao! Qingyao!

105
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,000
Qingyao...

106
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,960
Qingyao, wake up!

107
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,080
Qingyao!

108
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,670
Someone!

109
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,790
The Crown Prince!

110
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,310
Where is His Highness?

111
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,750
Your Highness, you're awake.

112
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,480
There's something you may not know.

113
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,310
Yesterday, you suddenly fainted.

114
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,870
His Highness stayed by your bedside

115
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,070
all through the night.

116
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,200
Later, news came from the palace
that His Majesty was gravely ill,

117
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,480
so His Highness hurried away at once.

118
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,680
I see.

119
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,630
Gu Qingyao.

120
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,550
Do you truly think I wouldn't dare
to end your life?

121
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,120
Right now, I am Gu Qingyao.

122
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,720
I can make you

123
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,320
stay trapped in this body forever

124
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,790
and never become the Crown Princess.

125
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,270
Do you enjoy being a woman so much?

126
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
I'm warning you right now.

127
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,270
Warning me?

128
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,160
What else?

129
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,030
What did you do last night?

130
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,960
Why did I sense killing intent?

131
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,550
What are you talking about?

132
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,650
There was no killing intent.

133
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,630
No, there was.

134
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,550
Who were you trying to kill last night?

135
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,330
It's nothing.

136
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,230
Just a servant.

137
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,240
A servant?

138
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,080
Mm.

139
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,790
Take your hand off me.

140
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,680
Stop touching me.

141
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,440
Now you've touched me too.

142
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,480
We're even now.

143
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,240
You asked me to touch you.

144
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,100
Even my own husband
has never touched me.

145
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,120
You shameless rogue.

146
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,210
You think you deserve it.

147
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,100
You're calling him so affectionately.

148
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,660
Yet he keeps multiple women by his side.

149
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,120
You're not even in his heart.

150
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,690
Nonsense.

151
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,320
His Highness and I grew up together.

152
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,260
You wouldn't understand.

153
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,600
Childhood sweethearts.

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,220
If he weren't the Crown Prince,

155
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,330
would you still marry him?

156
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,130
I…

157
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,980
Your Highness.

158
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,550
Your Highness, you're here.

159
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,320
His Highness has arrived.

160
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,270
He's waiting for you at the garden.

161
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,630
Who is that woman?

162
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,200
The Secondary Consort,

163
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,270
Shen Wanwan.

164
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,150
Why the look on your face?

165
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,990
Do you bear a grudge against her?

166
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,150
That Shen Wanwan,

167
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,960
since the day I wed,

168
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,510
has been setting traps for me.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,390
Clearly, she envies me.

170
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,320
One of these days,

171
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,390
I'll teach her a good lesson.

172
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,120
No need to wait.

173
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,080
Your Highness.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,840
Your Highness.

175
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,550
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

176
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,750
Qingyao.

177
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,240
How fares your health?

178
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
Has it improved?

179
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,840
Thanks to your blessings,

180
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,960
I am well again.

181
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,030
You're unharmed.

182
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,000
But you made His Highness

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,440
stay up keeping watch over you.

184
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,670
I

185
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,000
truly feel sorry for him.

186
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
I am deeply ashamed.

187
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,750
I beg you to forgive me.

188
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,370
My beloved, you're exaggerating.

189
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,910
It was what I should have done.

190
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,230
Rise.

191
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

192
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,470
Sit.

193
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,480
His Highness cherishes you so much.

194
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,550
I'm so envious.

195
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,840
It's just a pity

196
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,960
that last night was wasted.

197
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,480
Oh, by the way,

198
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,960
these are grapes tributed
from the Western Regions.

199
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,320
His Highness rarely eats them himself,

200
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,000
but he specially asked me

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,870
to pick out the finest ones from them

202
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,510
to nourish your health.

203
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,200
Qingyao,

204
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
you mustn't turn down his kindness.

205
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,320
Here.

206
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,440
Let me feed you.

207
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,320
Well, Qingyao?

208
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,390
Do you like it?

209
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,320
(What on earth is this?)

210
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,910
(Why is it so sour?)

211
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,000
This grape

212
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
is truly delicious.

213
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,630
You try one too.

214
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,240
His Highness prepared this just for you.

215
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,480
Then I won't eat.

216
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,360
I can't enjoy it alone.

217
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,840
Do not disappoint

218
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
His Highness's kindness.

219
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,840
Come on.

220
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,320
Could it be
that you are disdaining the grapes

221
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,630
bestowed by His Highness?

222
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,350
No.

223
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,840
Come on, Wanwan.

224
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,510
Are they good?

225
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,390
Your Highness,

226
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,910
I suddenly remember

227
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,720
that my dog is about to give birth.

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,240
I must take my leave.

229
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,870
Isn't your dog a male?

230
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,850
Qingyao, sit.

231
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,250
The weather is scorching.

232
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,870
Your Highness,

233
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,510
please have some tea.

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,910
I troubled you last night, my dear.

235
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,950
It's all my fault for drawing assassins,

236
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,840
so that you can't sleep peacefully
at nights.

237
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,690
Even when you lie down to rest,

238
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,330
you keep a dagger under your pillow.
