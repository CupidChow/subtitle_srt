=Episode 7=

3
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,480
Do it.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,720
Stop it!

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,440
Jun!

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,840
Jun!

7
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,750
What do we do now?

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,600
Jun, are you all right?

9
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,870
Feng,

10
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,270
go back quickly.

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,710
No, I'm not leaving.

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,840
This all started because of me.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,280
How could I let you die for it?

14
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,230
Those people don't care
for right or wrong.

15
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,310
They are in cahoots,

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,240
yet they still dare
to call themselves heroes.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,040
Who are in cahoots?

18
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,510
Bai Jun is already wanted
by the authorities.

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,380
Killing him

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,320
is perfectly justified.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,590
Jun only killed them

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,150
to save me.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
Are we destined to be oppressed

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,280
just because we were born into poverty?

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,280
- Don't move!
- Let me go!

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,560
Father! Father!

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,350
Father!

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,040
Father.

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,760
Wake up, Father!

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,600
Father.

31
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,430
Stay away from me!

32
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,840
Go! Leave me alone!

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,950
Jun saved me from the mountain bandits.

34
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,920
But the very next day, he was wanted.

35
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,790
Soon, people like you began

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,280
to hunt us down.

37
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,840
If not for Jun's remarkable skills,

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,310
we'd have died hundreds of times.

39
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,190
That being the case,

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,750
those bandits

41
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,310
really deserve to die.

42
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,430
You think

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,960
you are enforcing justice
on behalf of Heaven,

44
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,800
but in reality,

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,590
you can't distinguish
between good and evil.

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,680
Not necessarily.

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,470
From this day on,

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,870
there will be no more Bai Jun.

49
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,030
Is your foot alright?

50
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,310
It's fine.

51
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,870
You let them both go,

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,840
how will you explain this to the Master?

53
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,280
Never thought about it.

54
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,310
The Wind and Rain Pavilion
kills only the truly wicked.

55
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,680
If there's more to this matter
than it appears,

56
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,590
I'll go back and make my case.

57
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,550
Then there should be no trouble.

58
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,840
But as Bai Jun and Ruan Feng said,

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,190
Bai Jun's act of killing

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,710
was in fact an act of justice.

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,400
And the ones he killed

62
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,520
were all bandits
with countless blood debts.

63
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,240
Why would the Wind and Rain Pavilion

64
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,800
issue such an order?

65
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,120
The first iron rule of the Pavilion

66
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,000
is to obey the Master's command.

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,670
No matter the cause or consequence,

68
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,500
no matter the reason behind it.

69
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,910
Then the Pavilion could easily use you

70
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,190
to commit acts of injustice.

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,240
This very matter proves that point.

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,520
Perhaps the Master isn't as righteous
as you think.

73
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,280
Why do you still stay in that place?

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,120
I was an orphan to begin with.

75
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,560
If the Master hadn't saved my life,

76
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,630
I would've starved to death long ago.

77
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,910
I've always seen the Pavilion
as my home.

78
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,360
But now,

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,910
I no longer know where to go,

80
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,680
nor

81
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,590
whom I should trust.

82
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,910
What's up?

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
You still have me.

84
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,950
If you truly have nowhere else to go,

85
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,750
then you can still come to me

86
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,510
and be my shadow guard.

87
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,520
Well,

88
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,750
just put me down.

89
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
What's wrong?

90
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,070
Haven't you noticed?

91
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,080
Half an incense stick
has already burned,

92
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,490
but we still haven't stepped
out of the courtyard.

93
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,920
We'll reach home only at dawn.

94
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,670
It's fine.

95
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,390
I can walk on my own.

96
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,580
I originally thought we were here
to celebrate Shiyi's success,

97
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,920
but now it seems

98
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,120
this guy has failed.

99
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,220
The bloodstains are still fresh.

100
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,750
He can't have gone far.

101
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,950
I didn't notice it just now.

102
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,870
Now that I've relaxed a bit,

103
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,360
this path feels rather unsettling.

104
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,560
You're just scaring yourself.

105
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,710
Eunuch Leng.

106
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

107
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,160
Your Highness, you went out
late at night,

108
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,680
and His Highness was much concerned.

109
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,390
He sent me specially to watch over you.

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,920
You're being overly cautious.

111
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,430
I was just in a bad mood,

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
so I came out for a walk

113
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,000
and to enjoy the spectacular beauty

114
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
of this bamboo grove.

115
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,870
Your Highness, you went out to relax,

116
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,190
but chose a desolate wilderness.

117
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,800
That's fine.

118
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,000
But you,

119
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,510
as a bodyguard,

120
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,390
should be persuading her properly.

121
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,720
The Crown Princess
is delicate and frail.

122
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,000
If anything goes wrong,

123
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,040
how could a servant like you
bear the blame?

124
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,750
Stop calling me a servant.

125
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,680
Even the Crown Prince

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,680
calls me Hero Shi.

127
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,240
As an imperial eunuch,

128
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,480
you'd better watch your language.

129
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,880
Fine.

130
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,830
Quite the sharp tongue you have.

131
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,720
Today, I'll teach you a good lesson

132
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,920
for the Crown Princess.

133
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,480
Such a lively scene.

134
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,240
Where's Bai Jun?

135
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,070
Don't tell me

136
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,510
you let him go.

137
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,910
Be careful!

138
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
There's an assassin!

139
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,800
Who are you?

140
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,430
State your name and origin.

141
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,990
Wind and Rain Pavilion
is handling matters.

142
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,750
What's it to you, old fart?

143
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,310
You've got some nerve.

144
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,510
This is the top fighter
in the Imperial Court,

145
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Eunuch Leng, Leng Wuchang.

146
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,950
The Crown Prince's personal guard.

147
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,630
Even the Crown Prince relies
on him greatly.

148
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,120
His safety

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,510
is entirely in his hands.

150
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,150
How could you insult him?

151
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,630
Leng Wuchang of the Imperial Court?

152
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,360
I'd like to see

153
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,960
what skill an eunuch truly has.

154
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,080
You seem rather at ease.

155
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,960
If Eunuch Leng defeats those two,

156
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,200
those snake and scorpion types,

157
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,950
our identities will be
completely exposed.

158
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,840
If the Crown Prince finds out

159
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,720
that I am associating with a killer,

160
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,910
my honor,

161
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,370
my title as Crown Princess
will be completely gone.

162
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,550
When it comes down to it,

163
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,200
you're only worried about yourself.

164
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,040
Well, what else?

165
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,700
I'm trapped in this body right now

166
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,510
all because of you.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,550
Because of me?

168
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,550
You think I actually want

169
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,770
to be a useless Crown Princess?

170
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,240
Every day I stay in this residence,

171
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,480
confined deep within my boudoir,

172
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,460
putting on affected airs.

173
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,300
But you have it easy,

174
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,550
using my body to have fun
and drink outside.

175
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,630
And now you're blaming me?

176
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,510
You think I want to be a killer

177
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,600
and visit those places?

178
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,290
I just like to put on airs

179
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,580
and stay secluded in the boudoir.

180
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,940
I'm just being the Crown Princess,

181
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,610
who did I offend?

182
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,580
You... what are you trying to do?

183
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,040
Fine, it's all my fault.

184
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,200
I have no shame.

185
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,040
Stop right there.

186
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,080
Happy now?

187
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,050
You truly have no shame.

188
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,910
I concede the win.

189
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,720
(From Yuan Chen)
See you at Moyu Pavilion tomorrow.

190
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,630
Just what you want.

191
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,000
We can switch back very soon.

192
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,240
Exactly, just what I want.

193
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,790
See you at Moyu Pavilion.

194
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,680
Can you walk any faster?

195
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,390
Yuan Chen.

196
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,940
Last night, you sent me a letter.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,440
Does it mean that matter is settled?

198
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,630
What matter?

199
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,030
You tell me.

200
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,120
Why are you glaring at me?

201
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,440
Let's get straight to the point.

202
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,510
Any news about the soul shifting
technique?

203
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,840
Of course.

204
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,200
I went through the ancient texts.

205
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,790
In an anonymous unofficial history,

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,240
I read an unusual story.

207
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,840
According to the legend,

208
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,870
there was a devoted couple

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,080
who agreed to end their lives together
in the lake,

210
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,970
but they accidentally encountered
a thunderstorm

211
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,180
and were struck by lightning.

212
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,120
And something strange happened.

213
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,480
Yet neither of them died.

214
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,840
They became attuned
to each other,

215
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,270
supporting and caring for each other.

216
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,630
What does this have to do
with the technique?

217
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,320
Just listen till I'm done.

218
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,240
It says on the book,

219
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,000
after being struck by lightning,

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,220
this man has feminine features,

221
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,770
and this woman has a masculine voice.

222
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,220
It caused quite a stir at the time.

223
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,390
If you ask me,

224
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,150
these two were struck by lightning,

225
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,440
and somehow swapped bodies.

226
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,750
Come here.

227
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,670
Cherry blossom tree.

228
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
What exactly are you doing?

229
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,930
I heard

230
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,810
if you break the highest branch
on the tree,

231
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,080
and give it to the one you love,

232
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,870
you'll be together forever.

233
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,490
You actually believe that?

234
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,280
None of your business.

235
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,150
My reputation as a killer

236
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,440
is nearly ruined because of you.

237
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,390
Here, take it.

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,510
Looks like it's going to rain.

239
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,510
