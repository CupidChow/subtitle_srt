=Episode 11=

3
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,760
Gu Qingyao.

4
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,880
If you wish to learn martial arts,

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,540
I can teach you.

6
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,670
Practicing dark arts

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,240
may lead to madness, you know that?

8
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,750
Who says I'm practicing dark arts?

9
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,240
What nonsense are you spouting?

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,080
Let me see

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,060
what it is that you're training.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,480
Give it back to me!

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,110
Give it back!

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,360
Give it back to me!

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,480
Return it, now!

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,190
Gu Qingyao,

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,070
what exactly are you learning here?

18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,060
These

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,900
were arranged by Nanny Li.

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,580
It's for the next contest.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,740
What kind of contest is it?

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,620
Nanny Li said,

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,100
only by mastering everything
written here,

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,100
can one properly serve the Crown Prince,

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,680
and deepen the bond
between husband and wife.

26
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,220
Serve the Crown Prince…

27
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,860
So you worked so hard

28
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,580
to learn these things

29
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,260
just to please men,

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,100
is that right?

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,600
What choice do I have?

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,990
I didn't set the challenge myself.

33
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,900
But you could refuse.

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,440
Do you know

35
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,230
in the martial world,
there's a feared woman

36
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,100
known as Lady Shisan,

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,500
who draws inner strength
from men's

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,820
to nourish yin and replenish yang?

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,540
Although it is an evil technique,

40
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,900
in the end she practices it

41
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,220
to please herself

42
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,260
and increase her power.

43
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,700
What about you?

44
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,900
Why are you really doing this?

45
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,060
To win the contest.

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,860
To become the Empress.

47
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,820
Are you satisfied now?

48
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,940
In short,

49
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,300
will you help or not?

50
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,820
If you train in this sort of thing,

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,460
better go to your Crown Prince.

52
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,060
You think I'm willing?

53
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,660
These days, you only eat and drink,

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
or go out to have fun.

55
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,580
In a few days, the contest...

56
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,620
Don't worry about it.

57
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,980
No matter the outcome of this contest,

58
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,100
it'll be enough to give Gu Qingyao
a hard time.

59
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,860
You have your plan?

60
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,420
If she loses, that's fine too.

61
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,700
At worst, she'll just lose face

62
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,820
and get scolded a few times.

63
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,740
But if she wins,

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,990
it'll be seen as disloyalty.

65
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,100
Wanwan, are you saying…

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,460
Think about it.

67
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,000
Gu Qingyao just got married,

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,250
and newly entered the residence,

69
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,770
and she's still rather inexperienced.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,790
But if she's already skilled
in such matters,

71
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,540
then who could have taught her?

72
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,060
Ouch!

73
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,700
Shiyi was right after all.

74
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,780
Why must women always strain themselves

75
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,180
just to please others?

76
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,840
The New Year is still far away.

77
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,340
You don't have to rush like this.

78
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,300
Don't take advantage of me.

79
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,340
Didn't you say you wouldn't help?

80
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,660
Then what are you doing here now?

81
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,680
I have something urgent.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,880
Forget it if you won't listen.

83
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,220
I'm listening. I'm listening.

84
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,020
I'm listening.

85
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,220
That's going too far.

86
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,780
Gu Qingyao,

87
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,060
you just withdraw.

88
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,620
They've planning to corner you.

89
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,460
No way.

90
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,100
Once I give up,

91
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,140
I won't please either side.

92
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,690
Wouldn't that be exactly what they want?

93
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,620
I must take part in this contest.

94
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,980
But this path leads nowhere.

95
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,980
That's fine.

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,060
Since both losing and winning
lead to death,

97
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,300
why not just neither lose nor win?

98
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,780
I've already thought of a way.

99
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,140
But

100
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,380
I need your help.

101
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,300
You little rascal.

102
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,480
You must do that on purpose.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,660
I'm helping you
build a solid foundation.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,550
If you don't want to train, that's fine.

105
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,220
Giving up early might save you
some trouble.

106
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
Give up?

107
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,460
I will never give up.

108
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
Watch closely now.

109
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,340
I'd rather die than admit defeat.

110
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,900
Shiyi,

111
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,340
it's snowing.

112
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,740
It's so beautiful.

113
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,780
Be careful.

114
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,860
It's so beautiful.

115
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,650
Like you've never seen snow before.

116
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,700
What are you doing?

117
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,860
I'm just afraid you'll get sick

118
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,140
and won't be able to train anymore,

119
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,700
then lose the contest

120
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,260
and cry to me.

121
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,660
Oh.

122
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,540
Today we will

123
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,060
assess your learning outcomes

124
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,900
from various aspects

125
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,220
including movements, expressions,

126
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,060
and postures.

127
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,740
Which of you will show us first?

128
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,380
Nanny,

129
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,740
then allow me to start.

130
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,500
Next.

131
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,990
Nanny, please give your judgment.

132
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,720
Well done, very good.

133
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,340
You've clearly worked hard.

134
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,820
Forgive me for my humble display.

135
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,060
Your Princess,

136
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,020
are you ready?

137
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,540
Of course.

138
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,180
You always manage to surprise me.

139
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,900
Her Highness's performance
is truly splendid.

140
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,260
However...

141
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,100
This doesn't seem part of the contest.

142
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,620
Exactly. Nanny said

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,740
what we're testing today

144
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,090
are the movements from the scroll.

145
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,020
Why do we have to do

146
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,260
the same movements as on it?

147
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,140
In my humble view,

148
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,700
the winner in this contest

149
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,260
should be Consort Shen.

150
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,900
Thank you, Nanny.

151
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,940
Serving His Highness well is my duty.

152
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,620
Your Highness,

153
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,420
I have said before

154
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,620
a woman without talent is virtuous.

155
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,620
As a woman,

156
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,580
you should uphold
the traditional virtues,

157
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,260
and put away your martial arts tricks

158
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,820
and petty cleverness.

159
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,860
Caring for the Crown Prince
is what truly matters.

160
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,900
Following the rules

161
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,660
and virtues,

162
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,700
always depending on others,

163
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,980
isn't it pathetic?

164
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,260
What did you just say?

165
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,620
This scroll came from India.

166
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,540
It was created by ascetics
to train their willpower,

167
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,860
seeking a state of unity
between self and the divine.

168
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,020
But you treated it as a secret

169
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,860
to please men.

170
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,060
How utterly absurd.

171
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,540
You insolent child!

172
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,900
How dare you!

173
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,340
Where is the grace befitting a wife?

174
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,700
Grace?

175
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,380
Nanny,

176
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,820
do you know what I've seen

177
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,100
during my outings these days?

178
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,980
I saw some sights

179
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,940
that I had never encountered before

180
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,100
in the deep, grand courtyard.

181
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,340
Many weak women

182
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,820
were bullied by mountain bandits.

183
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,260
But I've also seen

184
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,260
some women

185
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,660
who relied on their own strength

186
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,420
to hold together their broken families.

187
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,000
Who decided

188
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,860
that women must follow
the rules and virtues,

189
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,900
spending their whole lives
shut away in a courtyard,

190
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,660
relying on a man to live?

191
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,340
I have my own worth and place
in the world.

192
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,340
Rather than being a useless
dodder flower,

193
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,460
I would rather be

194
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,500
a wintersweet in the cold winter.

195
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,100
You!

196
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,620
You've gone too far.

197
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,180
Nanny,

198
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
I strive to win this contest today,

199
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,020
only to tell you

200
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,820
that I am first myself,

201
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,660
and only then the Gu Qingyao
in others' eyes.

202
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,140
You...!

203
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,620
You...

204
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,620
Gu Qingyao!

205
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,140
Gu Qingyao!

206
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,940
What's wrong with you?

207
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,860
Shiyi,

208
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,420
I just accidentally said everything

209
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,500
I was thinking in my heart.

210
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,660
Was I too rash?

211
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,860
What if I offend Nanny Li,

212
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,940
and the Crown Prince divorces me?

213
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,300
He won't.

214
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,270
What you said just now was perfect.

215
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,620
It's the most powerful words I've heard.

216
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,220
If he really divorces you,

217
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,940
then he truly doesn't see your worth.

218
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,700
Really?

219
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,900
But what if he really doesn't see it?

220
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,820
If he doesn't want you,

221
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
at worst,

222
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,140
you still have me.
