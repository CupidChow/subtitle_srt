00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,900
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,150
Get your filthy hands off.

4
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,240
Does it hurt?

5
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,910
No, it doesn't.

6
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,560
I'm the one in pain.

7
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,840
Well? Any other injuries?

8
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm fine now.

9
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
Why is it always me who gets hurt?

10
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,400
If this keeps up,

11
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,640
one day I'll be gone for good.

12
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,230
That's the life of a killer.

13
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,280
If that's the case,

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,040
why not retire for good?

15
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,770
You think the Wind and Rain Pavilion
is a marketplace?

16
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,350
Come when you please,

17
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,430
leave when you wish.

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,200
Didn't you ask me

19
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,910
why I came to kill the Crown Prince?

20
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,360
Because the Master promised me.

21
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,120
If this mission works out,

22
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,930
he said I could live a different life.

23
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,280
Entering the martial world,

24
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,430
acting chivalrously as you please,

25
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,400
no longer being used
as someone else's tool,

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
such carefree days are quite enjoyable.

27
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,840
Here, drink this one.

28
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,590
That cup's gone cold.

29
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,030
It's getting late.

30
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,200
I should go bathe.

31
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,270
Wait.

32
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,190
Bathe?

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,300
In front of Bai Yan,

34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,590
I've been flirting for so long.

35
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,850
I get sweaty, and I need a wash.

36
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,640
No way.

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,750
You don't actually think

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,710
I haven't taken a bath
these days, do you?

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,030
Taking a bath is fine,

40
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,180
but you can't touch my body.

41
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,000
That's not so easy.

42
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,520
Unless you bathe me yourself.

43
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,280
Are you serious?

44
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,430
Don't move.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,630
Hey, do you really have
to be so resentful?

46
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,910
I don't believe

47
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,440
that you haven't bathed all these days.

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,630
I'm afraid

49
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,850
you've already touched my chest

50
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,080
many times in private.

51
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm not as indecent as you think!

52
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,190
A bathhouse at night.

53
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,750
A man and a woman alone.

54
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,150
If anyone finds out

55
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,080
that you are bathing the Crown Princess,

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,360
that would be a capital offense.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,550
If anyone loses a head, it'll be yours.

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,240
Qingyao.

59
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,150
Ling Yu's coming, hide quickly!

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,500
You're the one who should hide!

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,560
Oh, right, right.

62
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,030
Where should I hide?

63
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,120
Here.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
I heard from the servants

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,480
that you are bathing alone here.

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,160
You could've asked Ling to handle that.

67
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,000
I…

68
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,950
I've grown used to being on my own.

69
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,160
I've been busy lately.

70
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,580
I feared you might feel neglected,

71
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,950
so I made time to come back.

72
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,730
State matters take precedence.

73
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,430
You need not worry about me.

74
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,910
Qingyao,

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,070
what happened to your hand?

76
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,000
Your Highness…

77
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,040
It's from my martial training.

78
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,120
It's nothing serious.

79
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,800
I've already heard about this.

80
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,680
Your status is noble.

81
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,950
No need for that.

82
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,530
Last time was purely an accident.

83
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,050
Now that Eunuch Leng
is guarding the mansion.

84
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,720
No assassin could possibly hide here.

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,240
That eases my mind, then.

86
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,070
Your Highness,

87
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,600
I must change my attire.

88
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,070
Alright.

89
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,600
I'll wait for you outside.

90
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
Hmm.

91
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,190
Your Highness.

92
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,960
Qingyao,

93
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
it's such a beautiful moment.

94
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,070
It's getting late.

95
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,070
Darn it, Shiyi,

96
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,800
next time I see you,

97
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,800
I'll make sure to teach you a lesson.

98
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,160
It's freezing out here.

99
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,750
Eunuch Leng.

100
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,160
In the dead of night,

101
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,000
you soaked through from head to toe.

102
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,380
You bathe without taking off
your clothes?

103
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,190
Just now,

104
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,560
I checked beneath the lotus pond.

105
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,630
I feared an assassin
might be hiding below.

106
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,510
Did you find anything?

107
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,190
Nothing at all.

108
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,510
All is safe.

109
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,400
Everything is in order.

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,800
Hero Shi, you truly are thorough.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,190
Not even the pond escapes your eyes.

112
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,630
It's my duty, of course.

113
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,120
Keep up your efforts too.

114
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll take my leave now.

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,110
That sly eunuch

116
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,870
always appears and disappears
like a shadow.

117
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,670
Your Highness,

118
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,270
it's not convenient for me today.

119
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,950
If that's the case,

120
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,830
then rest well for now.

121
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,190
(I can't keep going on like this.)

122
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,190
(I still need to find a way
to switch back.)

123
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,870
(Never thought)

124
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,000
(this guy's build is actually
pretty decent.)

125
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,720
Why block me?

126
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,660
I've been looking at this body
for 20 years.

127
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,630
Well,

128
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,480
what brings you here?

129
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,790
Shouldn't you be with the Crown Prince?

130
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,820
He wanted to sleep with me.

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,670
I just made up an excuse
to send him off.

132
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,160
He's the Crown Prince, after all.

133
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,440
How could you be so discourteous?

134
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,390
Then what should I do?

135
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,670
You expect me to sleep with him?

136
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
Shameless.

137
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,870
Your husband is the shameless one.

138
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,080
Just now, he...

139
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,960
He kissed me.

140
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Utterly disgusting.

141
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,630
What's wrong with that?

142
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,600
We're now a married couple.

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,020
You mustn't give yourself away.

144
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,910
If it slips, so be it.

145
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,930
When he gets close to you,

146
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,090
I can't help feeling annoyed.

147
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,000
True enough.

148
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,960
You're a man after all.

149
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,960
No wonder it feels awkward.

150
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,600
Once Bai Jun is dealt with,

151
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,750
your mission will be complete.

152
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,230
When that time comes,

153
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,870
I'll find a way to switch us back.

154
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,000
That would be best.

155
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,980
(Moyu Pavilion)

156
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,220
The throwing knife you asked for.

157
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,630
This one is really good.

158
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,030
That soft sword.

159
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,080
I'll take it.

160
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,360
Miss, you have a keen eye.

161
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,670
This sword draws the essence
of sun and moon,

162
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,150
forged from black steel,

163
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,270
perfect for a beauty like you.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,910
It's for him.

165
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,240
Kid,

166
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,440
the way you live off others
is truly enviable.

167
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,100
The soul-shifting technique
I asked you about last time,

168
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,110
any progress?

169
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,750
Uh… nearly there.

170
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,390
Soon it'll be done.

171
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,030
What do you mean 'nearly'?

172
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,960
It's either done or not done.

173
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,630
Then we'll wait for your good news.

174
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,470
Let's go.

175
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,630
Ouch.

176
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,660
- We're off.
- Alright.

177
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,440
Take care, wealthy lady.

178
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,600
Anyone here?

179
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,240
I strayed into the mountains,

180
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,080
and lost my way for a time.

181
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,390
I hope you'll give me shelter.

182
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
Never thought

183
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,870
he'd discover us so soon.

184
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,030
Lately, my name

185
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,260
seems to be a bit ostentatious.

186
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,790
It's no wonder people grow wary.

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,890
I've already hidden away
in the mountains.

188
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,320
Why do you still force me so?

189
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,040
You slew over a dozen
from Heishan Village.

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,580
Do you think you can get away like this?

191
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,600
In the vast martial world,

192
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,580
plenty of vermin like you

193
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,690
can't tell right from wrong.

194
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,720
Courting death.

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,660
You chase first.
Don't let him slip away.

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,350
Alright.

197
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,310
Give it up.

198
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,070
Your swordsmanship is rigid,
bound to break.

199
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,140
You're no match for us.

200
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,320
Just do it.

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,840
