=Episode 3=

3
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
It's all my fault for drawing assassins,

4
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,210
so that you can't sleep peacefully
at nights.

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,110
Even when you lie down to rest,

6
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,660
you keep a dagger under your pillow.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,390
Qing... Qingyao.

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,400
Qingyao.

9
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,630
Qingyao!

10
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,150
Someone!

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,350
Qingyao. Qing...

12
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,590
I only kept the dagger

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,430
to fend off another assassin's attack.

14
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,280
It helps me feel ease.

15
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,190
Well...

16
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,590
You are truly thoughtful.

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,000
Shame on you!

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,040
I ate all the sour grapes.

19
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,940
Compared to the pain
of branding torture,

20
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,710
the taste of sour grapes
is nothing at all.

21
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,590
So, what about the wedding night?

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,660
You have no shame at all.

23
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,110
You still deny wanting to be a woman.

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,710
Just to frame my husband,

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,280
you used my body to set a snare.

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
What do you even know?

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,960
A skilled killer

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,240
must use every possible means

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,120
to reach the goal.

30
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,280
Besides,

31
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,910
your figure

32
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,520
is hardly impressive.

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
What?

34
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,000
You've actually seen it?

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,470
I bathe every day, don't I?

36
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,910
Even my husband has never seen it.

37
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,750
Yet you...

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
Shameless.

39
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,190
So what do you want?

40
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,000
You bath me?

41
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,470
Shameless.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,920
Thanks for that.

43
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,190
I'm that good.

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,550
What does it say?

45
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,710
(At the time of Si,)

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,000
(hurry to the dye workshop
west of the city.)

47
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,280
If you want me

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,440
to spare your husband's life,

49
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,630
I'll need your help

50
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,800
with one thing.

51
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,750
You still don't know
who I really am, do you?

52
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,470
Say it directly.

53
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,000
In the martial world,

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,030
there's a fearsome assassin organization

55
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,590
known as the Wind and Rain Pavilion.

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Its top ranked killer, Swordsman Shiyi,

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,290
you must have heard of that name.

58
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,910
Top ranked?

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,470
Shouldn't his name be Yi?

60
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,430
Then why call him Shiyi?

61
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,960
The key point is,

62
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
I

63
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,280
am the most skilled killer
in the martial world.

64
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Oh.

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,430
So what?

66
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,190
I made a three-day pact
with the Master.

67
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
Now the time has come.

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,560
I've swapped bodies with you.

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,520
This thing can only be done by you.

70
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,520
I go to the Wind and Rain Pavilion?

71
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,510
That's right.

72
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,030
I'm not going. It's too dangerous.

73
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm not going.

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,220
(Piaoyao Cloth Shop)

75
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,720
This is the place.

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
About the rules and the passcode,

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,700
have you memorized them all?

78
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,600
I think so.

79
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,600
This is no child's play.

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,070
If you slip up even once,

81
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,830
life and death hang on a single thought.

82
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,100
If you hadn't threatened me
with the Crown Prince's life,

83
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,040
I'd never have come.

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,040
If by chance,

85
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,870
something truly happens to me,

86
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,360
you must take good care of my father.

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,520
Don't worry.

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,950
I'll treat him like my own father.

89
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,950
And one more thing.

90
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,070
If I really die,

91
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,140
remember to carry on
the Crown Prince's lineage.

92
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,560
Carry on the lineage? Seriously?

93
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,480
Just make sure you stay alive.

94
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,630
Or else I swear,

95
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll strip that Crown Prince.

96
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
Here, take this.

97
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,600
Go ahead.

98
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,150
Go.

99
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,700
(Piaoyao Cloth Shop)

100
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,590
Hope to see you again.

101
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,600
Sir, what may I get for you?

102
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,600
The feat shakes mountains and rivers,

103
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,830
as wind and rain

104
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,830
persist through the night.

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
What?

106
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,000
Wind and rain persist through the night.

107
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,870
Please, come with me.

108
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,240
Please wait here.

109
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,030
Shiyi.

110
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,080
Why so flustered?

111
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,580
It's been three days
since I last saw you.

112
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
Little Shiyi,

113
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,680
since when did you become so timid?

114
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,720
(Don't be afraid, Gu Qingyao.)

115
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,000
(Didn't Shiyi tell you)

116
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,680
(this awkward fellow is called)

117
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
(Lingyi?)

118
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,560
Three days passed.

119
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,360
I didn't expect you to look
much worse now.

120
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,910
Fine.

121
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,270
I hope

122
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,920
when you meet the Master,

123
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,120
your tongue stays just as sharp.

124
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,360
Why are you dawdling?

125
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,120
The Master has waited long enough.

126
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,190
Careful not to offend him.

127
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,270
Master,

128
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,800
I greet you.

129
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
Ah, little Shiyi,

130
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,630
the Master has always
had high hopes for you.

131
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,480
Yet this time,

132
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,950
you've let him down.

133
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,950
Master,

134
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,870
I willingly accept punishment.

135
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,310
Willing to be punished, are you?

136
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
What a pity.

137
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,160
The mission failed.

138
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,920
As for me...

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,270
Master, please see clearly.

140
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,630
It was that Crown Princess
who blocked the way.

141
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,920
That's what caused the mission to fail.

142
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,560
Then why could you

143
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,310
remain safe and sound in the Residence?

144
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,600
In a moment of quick thinking,

145
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
I changed out of my night suit,

146
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,890
disguised myself as a guard,
and rescued the Crown Princess,

147
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,720
which is how I was able
to remain safe and sound.

148
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,720
Initially, I thought,

149
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,240
it would be a good chance
to get close to the Crown Prince,

150
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,030
and continue fulfilling the mission.

151
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,840
(Darn it!)

152
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,360
(What a ridiculous excuse.)

153
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,150
(Who would ever believe that?)

154
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,270
Very well then,

155
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,360
you stay in the Residence for now.

156
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,750
I

157
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,000
have a new mission for you.

158
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,300
(Assassination List:
Wang Quan, Bai Yan, Bai Jun.)

159
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,000
Rest assured.

160
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,630
They are all vile men.

161
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,200
This is exactly what you want.

162
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
Every one of them is skilled in combat.

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
But for you,

164
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,480
that shouldn't be a problem, right?

165
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,670
I

166
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,030
am grateful, Master.

167
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,710
You may go.

168
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,360
He won't mess this up, will he?

169
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,480
Thanks for your coming.

170
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,470
Please take care.

(Piaoyao Cloth Shop)

172
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,320
I am scared.

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,670
Your Wind and Rain Pavilion

174
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,960
has a Snake,

175
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,080
and also a Scorpion,

176
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
and

177
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,960
that mysterious master.

178
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,750
Glad you are alive.

179
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,960
What's wrong?

180
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,440
You don't want me back, do you?

181
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,680
I understand.

182
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,320
If I died,

183
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,270
you could finally be the Crown Princess,

184
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,770
enjoying all the splendor and wealth.

185
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,000
I have no such desire.

186
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,540
How carefree it is to be a killer!

187
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,750
Oh, spare me.

188
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,320
The past few days,

189
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,510
you've been borrowing my body,

190
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,790
and enjoying yourself.

191
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,270
Do you really think

192
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,670
everyone dreams

193
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,060
to be the Crown Princess like you?

194
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,030
Then what else?

195
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,440
You're even more vain

196
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,600
than I imagined.

197
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,000
I didn't marry the Crown Prince

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,120
because of vanity.

199
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,390
Then what for?

200
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,390
You're just a young girl.

201
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,720
Do you understand what love is?

202
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,250
What's wrong?

203
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,200
I was right, wasn't I?

204
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,110
You don't understand.

205
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,720
My father's power is fading.

206
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,440
If I marry the Crown Prince,

207
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,650
my father will have strong backing.

208
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,840
What about you?

209
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,550
No wonder

210
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,200
you are so cold toward me.

211
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,270
Turns out you've found someone new.

212
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
Lingyi.

213
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,630
Let's go.

214
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,630
I've long sensed
something was off with you.

215
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,080
Who is this woman?

216
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,720
Answer me.

217
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,000
It's none of your concern.

218
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
What did you say?

219
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,630
I said it's none of your concern.

220
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,810
I act on my own accord.

221
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,990
I still have to report to you?

222
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,720
Take a look at yourself.

223
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,150
You're courting death.
