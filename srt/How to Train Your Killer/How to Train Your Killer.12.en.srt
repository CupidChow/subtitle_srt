=Episode 12=

3
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,710
If he doesn't want you,

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,110
at worst,

5
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,950
you still have me.

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,430
I'm not tagging along with you.

7
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,960
You're drowning in debts yourself.

8
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,840
What, are we supposed

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
to go and rip off Yuan Chen every day?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,350
It's funny just thinking about it.

11
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,510
That's hilarious.

12
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,510
In the vast world,

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,400
there are plenty of places
to swindle people.

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,960
Besides,

15
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,350
it could be a blessing in disguise.

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,790
Who can predict the future?

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,430
My mouth...

18
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,790
Why does it run so fast?

19
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,310
Who's there?

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,640
Your Highness.

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,400
Nanny, what brings you here?

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,840
Please come in.

24
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,400
What made you come looking for me?

25
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,560
Your Highness, no need to be uneasy.

26
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,190
I came today
because I have a few words to say.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,960
(After all that talk,)

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,430
(you're just here to lecture me.)

29
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,550
Nanny,

30
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,560
please speak freely.

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,250
I've served in the Palace
for over 40 years.

32
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,150
I've disciplined

33
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,560
countless palace maids,

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,120
as well as imperial consorts.

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,750
But a lady like you

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,310
is someone I've never seen before.

37
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,560
What I said today
was indeed a bit too much.

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,680
Please don't take them to heart.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,560
If I must be punished, so be it.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,640
No.

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,240
I've come here today

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
to hand in my resignation.

43
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,000
Resignation?

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Mm.

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,910
Nanny,

46
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,560
I meant no offense to you.

47
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,710
You need not apologize.

48
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,000
It was your words that opened my eyes.

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,400
I entered the palace when I was ten.

50
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,560
I thought it was a path to glory.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,960
I never expected

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,000
to spend my life trapped
within these walls.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
I have long forgotten

54
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,750
what it feels like to find myself again.

55
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,080
Now the Crown Prince is grown.

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,120
I have no ties left.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,280
It's time I leave the Imperial Palace

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,800
and taste the meaning of true life.

59
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,360
You have my support.

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,960
Qingyao,

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,520
thank you.

62
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,360
You have no idea

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,120
how scared I was last night.

64
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,870
She came knocking on my door so late.

65
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,680
- Who knew it was about this?
- Your Highness.

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,750
Is Nanny Li really leaving?

67
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,590
Mm.

68
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,800
She said,

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,620
she wants to see the world
beyond these walls.

70
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,870
I told you so.

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,800
Things aren't as bad as you imagine.

72
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,550
Even Nanny Li was moved by your words.

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
Things are not as simple as we think.

74
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,120
Shen Wanwan will surely

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,910
make a big fuss over this.

76
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,960
Then what can I do?

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,430
I can't possibly hit her.

78
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,750
We can't just keep letting her
act so recklessly.

79
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,960
True.

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,000
But what can I do?

81
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,070
There are plenty of ways.

82
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,070
What ways?

83
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,360
Shiyi.

84
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,750
Go on, tell me.

85
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,470
Tell me.

86
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,630
Starting tomorrow,

87
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,430
Nanny Li will no longer
teach you etiquette.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
It must be because

89
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,530
Gu Qingyao spoke out of turn that day.

90
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,950
When she came to resign,

91
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,510
she said she was deeply moved,

92
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,190
and had decided to leave the Palace,

93
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,920
to return home and live her own life.

94
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,760
So I agreed.

95
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,650
That's a good thing.

96
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,040
Nanny Li has already reached the age

97
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,090
to retire from the Palace,

98
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,240
and now she's found something

99
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,270
she truly enjoys doing.

100
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,480
We should be happy for her.

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,680
Nanny Li has long served in the Palace.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,270
If she leaves just like that,

103
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,800
won't the other palace maids rebel?

104
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,160
It's you who is going to rebel,
isn't it?

105
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,710
No, no, no.

106
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,950
Your Highness,

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,360
I wouldn't dare.

108
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,790
Wanwan.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,630
Wanwan, please speak for me.

110
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,600
I believe the Crown Princess
is absolutely right.

111
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,430
(Has Shen Wanwan lost her senses today?)

112
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,720
The words you spoke yesterday

113
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,120
truly taught me a valuable lesson.

114
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,800
I personally prepared this chicken soup.

115
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,920
Consider it an apology
for my rudeness days ago.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,920
Qingyao.

117
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,800
I hope you will be tolerant
towards me in the future.

118
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,720
(She's not trying to poison me, is she?)

119
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,560
You get along well now.

120
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,200
It isn't in vain for Nanny Li to come.

121
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,160
Shen Wanwan.

122
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,030
Qingyao.

123
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,750
Greetings, Qingyao.

124
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,720
What exactly are you up to today?

125
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
Qingyao, come here.

126
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
Qingyao, please sit.

127
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
Qingyao, what are you talking about?

128
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,360
I've always focused on matters,
not on people.

129
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,560
Besides,

130
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,800
you're not wrong.

131
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
Don't try to fool me.

132
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,270
Are you trying to mess with me again?

133
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,190
Or do you need my help?

134
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,870
Qingyao, you've misunderstood me.

135
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
In the past, I didn't understand
the ways of the world

136
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
and often offended you.

137
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,870
Today, after Guard Shi's guidance,

138
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,160
then I suddenly realized.

139
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
From now on,

140
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,120
I will definitely help you

141
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,190
manage the residence properly.

142
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,800
Do you really mean what you said?

143
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,390
It couldn't be more real.

144
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,120
Your eyes and brows really are striking.

145
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,600
If I were a man,

146
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
I'd be fond of you too.

147
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,270
In the past two days,

148
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,680
why haven't I seen Shiyi around?

149
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,520
Your Highness,

150
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,560
Guard Shi left last night.

151
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,350
Oh.

152
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,350
Your Highness,

153
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,950
I truly didn't expect that.

154
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,120
Consort Shen is usually so overbearing,

155
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,950
yet Guard Shi handled her in no time.

156
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,920
How did he manage it?

157
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,190
I have no idea.

158
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,160
But he's full of clever tricks.

159
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,390
Shen Wanwan is just a young woman.

160
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,920
He must have a way to deal with her.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,160
If you ask me,

162
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,750
it must be a dark, windy night.

163
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,150
Yaoyao.

164
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,920
Gu Qingyao.

165
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,270
Don't move.

166
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,800
That's not right, Your Highness.

167
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,290
The doors and windows were shut tight.

168
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,160
So how did Guard Shi get in?

169
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
Are you silly?

170
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,190
He must have been hiding
in the room beforehand.

171
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,440
Now watch closely.

172
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,630
Oh.

173
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,750
Who are you?

174
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,670
What do you want?

175
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,670
What do you think I want?

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,360
I hear you named it Yaoyao.

177
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,160
I... I...

178
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,200
I won't dare do it next time.

179
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,670
Next time?

180
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,870
If you provoke the Crown Princess again,

181
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,670
- I just...
- No! No!

182
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,910
Let go of Yaoyao, please.

183
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,630
I swear I won't do it next time.

184
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,910
No animals were harmed
in the making of this drama.

185
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,030
I was wrong, I truly was!

186
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,960
I admit my fault.

187
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
Your Highness.

188
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,550
Isn't this a bit too cruel?

189
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,200
Isn't that how it's always written
in storybooks?

190
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
But I don't think Guard Shi

191
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,960
seems like such a vile person.

192
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
Besides,

193
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,550
did you notice

194
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,870
if Consort Shen has any injuries?

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,790
It seems not.

196
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,960
It should be like this.

197
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,870
Do you know

198
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,960
what kind of person
Gu Qingyao really is?

199
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,720
What kind of person?

200
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,130
She is known as the big sister

201
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,240
in the martial world.

202
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Those so-called bullies
of the East Street

203
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,440
and twin fiends of the West Street
were all subdued by her.

204
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,480
Even the leaders
of the Eight Great Sects

205
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,440
show her due respect
whenever they see her.

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,200
You should really

207
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,480
know your own worth

208
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,870
before daring to provoke her.

209
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,840
I… I was wrong.

210
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,200
I won't dare do it again.

211
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,040
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,200
I'm really sorry.

214
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,630
Your Highness.

215
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,680
Your Highness.

216
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,670
Your thoughts are getting
more and more ridiculous.

217
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,390
What are you two chatting about?

218
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,390
I heard you laughing
from a long distance away.

219
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,550
Shiyi, you're here.

220
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,360
So did you manage
to win Shen Wanwan over?

221
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,630
What else could it be?

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
Amazing!

223
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,320
Ling,

224
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,840
hurry and instruct the imperial kitchen

225
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,970
to present him with the finest wine
from the storeroom

226
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,120
that belongs to my father.

227
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,960
Tonight,

228
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,480
I will treat Shiyi well.

229
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,480
Go ahead.

230
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,720
Yes, Your Highness.

231
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Come on, Shiyi.

232
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,790
Something terrible happened!

233
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,720
Your Highness, something goes wrong!

234
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,840
Your Highness.

235
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,600
Why are you so flustered?

236
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,630
Speak slowly.

237
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,510
All your dowry

238
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
in the storeroom is gone.

239
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,390
What did you just say?

240
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,440
All your dowry is gone.

241
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,200
Really? I don't buy it.

242
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,670
No, I just...

243
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,510
How could that be?

244
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,410
Who did it?

245
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,360
Your Highness,

246
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,200
I suddenly remembered
I have something to do.

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,180
I'll take my leave first.

248
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,360
Shiyi,

249
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,150
you probably didn't do this, right?

250
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,520
- I did.
- Really?

251
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,440
Then you'd better honestly explain

252
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,000
how you managed to win Shen Wanwan over.

253
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,160
That's enough?

254
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,870
No wonder when I was dining today,

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,720
I saw that necklace
on Shen Wanwan's neck,

256
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120
and it looked familiar to me.

257
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,390
It's part of my bridal dowry.

258
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,790
That necklace doesn't suit you.

259
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,960
It's far too gaudy.

260
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,550
Are you serious?

261
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,630
If I had known you would

262
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,080
use such a plain and simple method

263
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,390
to bribe her with money,

264
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,600
why would I need you?

265
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,910
You don't even have the courage
to spend for peace.

266
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,750
Besides,

267
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,320
that Shen Wanwan

268
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,120
isn't as shallow as you make her sound.

269
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,720
I, Shen Wanwan,

270
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,120
was born into the General's Mansion.

271
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,680
Ever since I married the Crown Prince,

272
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,120
others have always envied me,

273
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,790
until she appeared,

274
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,550
and the Crown Prince has not
looked at me properly.

275
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,360
You have your own world to live in.

276
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,790
Why trouble yourself
with others' opinions?

277
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,870
You and she are truly
the same kind of people.

278
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,960
Yet the way she spoke back to Nanny Li

279
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,320
did make me realize something.

280
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,910
Always depending on others

281
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,480
truly is a sad thing.

282
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
It's alright.

283
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,890
Better to understand now than never.

284
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,040
So,

285
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,790
you don't want these jewels, right?

286
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,120
Being myself,

287
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,200
these are my sources of confidence.

288
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,390
Thank Gu Qingyao on my behalf.

289
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
From now on,

290
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,200
I won't trouble her again.

291
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,670
That silly girl

292
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,910
realized it quite promptly.

293
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,200
Well?

294
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,820
Didn't I handle this beautifully?

295
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,080
Think of a way to reward me.

296
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,270
You've got some nerve saying that.

297
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,100
I could've saved

298
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,360
an entire chest of bridal dowry.

299
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,690
Do you know how much that's worth?

300
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,150
Don't be upset.

301
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,120
Rouge from the Ningxiang Pavilion.

302
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,480
This rouge is so hard to get.

303
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,390
Where did you buy it?

304
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,390
I can get it if I queue all night.

305
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320
You took away a whole chest of my dowry.

306
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,720
Don't think buying a box of rouge

307
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
means I'll forgive you.

308
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,470
Lady,

309
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,360
do you still care
about that chest of dowry?

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Don't be upset.

311
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,630
Getting worked up will ruin your looks.

312
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,110
Do I look good?

313
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,390
Yes, you do.

314
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,630
Qingyao.
