1
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,750
Qingyao,

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
at last, you belong to me.

3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,230
I

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,230
have always belonged to you.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,800
Your Highness.

6
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,520
I am the real Qingyao.

7
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,470
She is an assassin.

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,280
Impudent assassin!

9
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,670
Utter nonsense!

10
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:52,960
Your Highness,

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,390
I am the true Qingyao.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
You once said

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,640
you vowed to guard me forever.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,200
Of course.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,750
With me here,

16
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,480
no one can harm you in the slightest.

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,890
Your Highness, be careful!

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,880
Qingyao.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,870
I've awaited

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,550
this moment for long.

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,070
Your Highness.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,230
Wants to kill me?

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,150
Would you dare?

24
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,230
After all,

25
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,150
this is your own body.

26
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,040
Though we've exchanged bodies,

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,000
the sense we have for each other's body

28
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,230
remain unchanged.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,480
Your heart must ache terribly now.

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,060
=How to Train Your Killer=

31
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,020
=Episode 1=

32
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,590
Qingyao,

33
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,280
it was I who proposed to the Emperor

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,990
I would only marry Gu Qingyao
from the Prime Minister's Residence.

35
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,680
Now you stand right before me,

36
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,240
it feels almost like a dream.

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
Your Highness,

38
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,590
a dream

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,750
is never this real.

40
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,560
Who are you?

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,990
How dare you?

42
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,150
Your Highness, run!

43
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,550
Your Highness!

44
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,000
(Where is this place?)

45
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,360
(Why can't I move?)

46
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200
Speak.

47
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,000
Who ordered you

48
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,720
to attack the Crown Prince?

49
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,560
(Attack the Crown Prince?)

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,400
I didn't!

51
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,600
I didn't harm him!

52
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,360
(Why is that a man's voice?)

53
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,680
Still denying it.

54
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,000
Come on.

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,190
Burn a heart shape onto his chest.

56
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,520
Let's see how he dares
show his face again.

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,070
It really wasn't me.

58
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,630
I truly didn't harm him.

59
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,750
(Why doesn't my body feel any pain?)

60
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,630
Ah!

61
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,750
It hurts.

62
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,400
Your Highness.

63
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,270
We did not know you were coming.

64
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,320
Please forgive us

65
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,040
for not greeting you sooner.

66
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,070
(Her appearance...)

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,950
I came late.

68
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,430
Sorry for making you suffer.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
Your Highness,

70
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,240
he tried to kill the Crown Prince...

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,080
Nonsense.

72
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,850
He is a shadow guard sent
by my father to protect me.

73
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,920
Last night, he saved both me
and the Crown Prince.

74
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,430
How dare you torture him?

75
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
You're awake.

76
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,150
Where is this place?

77
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,200
Want to see a mirror, right?

78
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,270
Well?

79
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,270
Are you pleased with this face?

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Why have I turned into a man?

81
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,070
What's with that look?

82
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,430
I've taken on your face.

83
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,590
And I haven't even complained.

84
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,440
Why are you crying?

85
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,390
You don't understand.

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,390
With this look,

87
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,920
how could I still be Crown Princess?

88
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,880
Exactly.

89
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,830
Right now, I'm the Crown Princess.

90
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
If I wanted to harm your husband,

91
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
wouldn't it be very easy?

92
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,110
What?

93
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,430
You mean harm Ling Yu?

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
The task isn't done yet.

95
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,680
How could I give up?

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,550
You've already ruined me so badly,

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,290
and now you still want
to kill my husband.

98
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,680
I'll fight you to the end!

99
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,650
- Let go!
- I won't!

100
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,630
- Will you let go?
- No!

101
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,530
- Let go or not?
- No!

102
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,350
Not letting go, huh?

103
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,670
How's that?

104
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,390
Does a slap feel so pleasant?

105
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
You dare slap me?

106
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,390
Though our bodies have been exchanged,

107
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,920
the sense we have for each other's body

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,630
remains unchanged.

109
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,720
Since my childhood,

110
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,510
my father has never hit me,

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
yet you actually struck me.

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,040
Hold on, are you missing the point here?

113
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,100
I endured branding torture in prison.

114
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,650
What's the big deal about taking a slap?

115
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,720
You deserve it!

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,200
You put me in such a state

117
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
and even try to kill my husband?

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,600
I'll tell Ling Yu

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
and let him exterminate

120
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
your entire family.

121
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,750
Sure.

122
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,600
Go tell him right now

123
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,390
let's see who will be treated
as an assassin.

124
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,390
If I hadn't said

125
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,270
you were my guard,

126
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,600
do you think you'd still be alive?

127
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,190
- You...
- Me what?

128
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,830
Greetings, Your Highness.

129
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,630
Your Highness,

130
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,310
His Highness has come to see you.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,720
Ling Yu, I…

132
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,750
Shut up!

133
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,310
Qingyao, are you available to meet me?

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,400
What are you doing?

135
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,440
Hide at once.

136
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,760
He's my husband.

137
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,950
- Why hide?
- Qingyao.

138
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,430
Do you still think you're Gu Qingyao?

139
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,430
As a guard, if you flirt with the him

140
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,270
and he notices,

141
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,150
you'll suffer.

142
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,510
Who is striking a pose?

143
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,480
Qingyao, may I come in?

144
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,600
I am here.

145
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,950
Your Highness, please allow me
to change clothes.

146
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
No time left. Hurry and hide.

147
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,390
Where am I supposed to hide?

148
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,870
On the beam, where else?

149
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,920
It's too high. How do I get up there?

150
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,930
You now possess 20 years

151
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,040
of my inner strength.

152
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,320
There's nowhere you can't reach.

153
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,440
Quickly.

154
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,350
Go.

155
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,270
Please come in, Your Highness.

156
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,630
Your Highness.

157
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,230
Qingyao, what happened to you?

158
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,550
I just caught a chill from the water.

159
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,550
Now I've taken the medicine.

160
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,960
I feel much better.

161
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,510
Don't worry about me.

162
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,030
That assassin was clearly aiming for me.

163
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,440
If you were dragged into this,

164
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
I would truly feel uneasy.

165
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,150
(If not for Gu Qingyao,)

166
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,390
(your life would already be mine.)

167
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,630
Not at all.

168
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,910
It is my honor

169
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,360
to help you.

170
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,630
I heard

171
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,510
a shadow guard sent by Minister Gu
saved me.

172
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,910
Where he is now?

173
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,910
He endured some punishment.

174
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,240
He is now healing.

175
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,240
Once he is better,

176
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,840
I will bring him to meet you.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,840
Get down!

178
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,150
How dare you!

179
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,550
You misunderstand, Your Highness.

180
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,870
This is the shadow guard

181
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,200
my father assigned to protect me.

182
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,320
Shi...

183
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,120
Hero Shi.

184
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,270
So it was you who saved me.

185
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,150
Quickly, pay respects to His Highness.

186
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,200
Hurry up.

187
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

188
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,360
You are quite an interesting man.

189
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
Your Highness.

190
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,510
And this is?

191
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,660
This is an imperial bodyguard

192
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,990
sent by the Emperor to protect me.

193
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,120
Eunuch Leng.

194
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,320
(Leng Wuchang of the Western Bureau?)

195
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

196
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Your Highness,

197
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,870
I heard Hero Shi was punished,

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,120
and still carries wounds.

199
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,600
Perhaps allow me to take his pulse.

200
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,670
That won't be necessary.

201
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,750
Qingyao,

202
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,630
let Eunuch Leng

203
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,840
check on Hero Shi.

204
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,720
It's a token of my affection.

205
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,440
(Even if you were an immortal,)

206
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,170
(you would never notice)

207
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,990
(I've swapped bodies
with the Crown Princess.)

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,870
Your Highness,

209
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,440
Hero Shi's injuries are not serious.

210
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,670
With some rest,

211
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,320
he'll soon recover completely.

212
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,600
That puts my mind at ease.

213
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,150
Eunuch Leng,

214
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,670
take Hero Shi and step outside first.

215
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,110
Yes, Your Highness.

216
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,350
Eunuch Leng,

217
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,030
why do you have a beard?

218
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,390
The assassin from last night

219
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,990
must've been sent by the court factions,

220
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,320
unhappy about the alliance

221
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,270
between our two houses.

222
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,080
What a pity though.

223
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,150
The man slipped away.

224
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,840
But don't worry.

225
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,870
I will definitely drag him out

226
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,720
and execute him by dismemberment.

227
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,990
Qingyao,

228
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,870
are you tired?

229
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,590
How about this?

230
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,200
I will visit you again tomorrow.

231
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,350
Your Highness.

232
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,510
What is it, Qingyao?

233
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
(In a few more days...)

234
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,790
(Tonight, I'll end your life.)

235
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,470
Your Highness,

236
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,000
do you want me to be left alone
in an empty room

237
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,630
just after getting married?

238
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,200
I have yet to…

239
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Your Highness, say something.

240
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
Qingyao.

241
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,920
Mm.

242
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,630
Your strength

243
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,030
seems to have grown lately.

244
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,840
Then as you wish,

245
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,160
see you tonight.

246
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,270
(This time,)

247
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,080
(let's see where you can run.)

248
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,950

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,810

♪As if you are still by my side♪
