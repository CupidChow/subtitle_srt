=How to Train Your Killer=

2
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,900
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
You're courting death.

4
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,410
- You all right?
- You all right?

5
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,590
- I'm fine.
- I'm fine.

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,070
Shiyi.

7
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,870
Have you fallen so low

8
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,120
that you need to hide behind a woman?

9
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,230
She's my new apprentice.

10
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,550
She just tested your skills.

11
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,880
Her?

12
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,450
Then she's courting death.

13
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,070
Enough.

14
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,350
Enough, stop fooling around.

15
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,150
Previously,

16
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,150
you took the mission meant for us,

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,710
and ended up ruining it.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,280
This time,

19
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,070
if you fail again,

20
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,760
you should know what awaits you.

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,430
I can handle it myself.

22
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,190
Good boy.

23
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,430
Since that's the case,

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,480
then I'll be looking forward
to your performance.

25
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,270
Let's go.

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,860
Gu Qingyao,

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,840
what's wrong with you?

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,870
They struck you,

29
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,840
but I'm the one getting hurt.

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,130
You don't even apply medicine.

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,630
There'll be scars.

32
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,470
After so many years of fighting,

33
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,030
I've grown used to it.

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,590
You mustn't get used to it.

35
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't get used to being hurt.

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Learn to protect yourself.

37
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,120
Done.

38
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,440
Didn't you say your martial skills
are unmatched?

39
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,270
How come you can't even beat
the Scorpion?

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,590
It's because we swapped bodies.

41
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,270
I've lost all my inner strength now.

42
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,590
Half of my martial arts are gone.

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,630
Gone?

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,400
Well,

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
what about the assassination list
from the Master?

46
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,560
Butcher Wang Quan.

47
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,240
Killer God Bai Yan.

48
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,800
Liu Shui Bai Jun.

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Those names alone sound formidable.

50
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,520
Can you handle it?

51
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,520
If it were before, of course I could.

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,520
But now…

53
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,990
I can only fight desperately.

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
Fight desperately?

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,240
You mustn't do that.

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,410
Because you are using my body.

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,080
Then there's only one way left.

58
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,640
What way?

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,240
You go.

60
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm not going.

61
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,080
Are you going or not?

62
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,680
Then I can only fight desperately,

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,300
and in the end be left abandoned

64
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,400
in the wilderness by others.

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,870
I might not even have a whole corpse,

66
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,870
no one to comb my hair,

67
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,990
and my body covered in scars.

68
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,710
Stop.

69
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,270
You're doing this on purpose.

70
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,270
You're willing to help now?

71
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
I do want to help.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,480
But I simply don't have the strength.

73
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm just a frail woman.

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,310
You can even catch a throwing knife.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
You're hardly a frail woman.

76
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,120
You now possess the inner strength
I've cultivated

77
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,290
through 20 years of training.

78
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,240
Never underestimate yourself.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Well...

80
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,720
I still don't know how to kill.

81
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,240
Killing

82
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,750
is just cutting off the head.

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,830
It's a simple matter.

84
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,620
(Moyu Pavilion)

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,830
We're closed.

86
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,670
Please head back.

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,010
Yuan Chen.

88
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,160
Closing up this early?

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,660
Have you earned your savings already?

90
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,670
Well..

91
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,870
Shiyi, you dare show your face here?

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,720
Last time you took a fine sword
on credit.

93
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,970
When will you repay the silver?

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,270
I'll settle his debt.

95
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,720
And

96
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,600
pick out another fine weapon.

97
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,120
Shiyi,

98
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,720
when did you hook up with a rich lady?

99
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,600
When are you this well-off?

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,200
Handsome, right?

101
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,480
It's your dowry.

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
What?!

103
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,390
Blades, spears, swords, halberds,

104
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,830
pick whichever you like.

105
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,240
That's a lot.

106
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,000
Still not familiar with them?

107
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,920
No, these don't suit me.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,220
(Datura Poison, Crane's Crest Poison,
Poinsettia Poison)

109
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,670
Poison.

110
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,900
(Crane's Crest Poison)

111
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
Crane's Crest Poison.

112
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,430
If we coat our weapons with this poison,

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,510
wouldn't it kill in a single strike?

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,920
I haven't seen you these past days.

115
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,560
How did you grow so ruthless and sly?

116
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,340
I...

117
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,950
Using poison harms both self and others.

118
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,410
It earns only others' disdain.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,870
Three years ago,

120
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,390
Poison Master Ouyang Xun,

121
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,270
after killing, pretended to be fierce,

122
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,000
and licked the blood
from the knife's tip.

123
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
As a result, he died on the spot.

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,780
Seems like,

125
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,950
that's all you've got.

126
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,190
I forgot this knife was poisoned.

127
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,000
I've always despised those
who use poison.

128
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,870
I truly didn't expect

129
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,560
you'd actually choose a throwing knife.

130
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
Doesn't it look fine?

131
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,560
Look, see that ring on top?

132
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,470
Look.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,270
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?

134
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,100
Miss,

135
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,370
come again if you need anything.

136
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,440
Oh, right,

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,950
have you heard

138
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,000
of a certain sorcery

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,370
that lets two people switch bodies?

140
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,600
Could it be

141
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
the art of shifting shadows?

142
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,600
Feels more like the soul shifting
technique.

143
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,160
This is truly a strange matter.

144
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,280
But in the vast martial world,
nothing is impossible.

145
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,040
Let me look into it for you.

146
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,630
Then I'll leave it to you.

147
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,060
- Farewell.
- Let's go.

148
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,840
I'm counting on you.

149
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
It really looks good.

150
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,630
Who is this young lady?

151
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,600
The art of throwing knives

152
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
requires complete focus,

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,320
so that the mind can follow the will,

154
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,840
never missing a shot,

155
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,990
and channeling strength through.

156
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,320
That's all?!

157
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,330
Even I can skip stones
three or four times.

158
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
See?

159
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,080
That's amazing!

160
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,270
You need a steady grip.

161
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,510
Keep your eyes on the target.

162
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,750
Focus on the target.

163
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,360
Mind how you use your strength.

164
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,680
Draw on your inner power,

165
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,090
not just the strength of your arms.

166
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,270
Three.

167
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,150
Two.

168
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,280
One.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,840
Wanwan.

170
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,120
I deserve punishment.

171
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,150
Please forgive me.

172
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,720
What a reckless little maid.

173
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,120
Just like your mistress.

174
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
Where's Gu Qingyao?

175
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,630
I haven't seen her for days.

176
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Who knows what tricks
she's plotting this time?

177
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,630
Consort Shen,

178
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,150
Her Highness has been
practicing martial arts.

179
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Practicing martial arts?

180
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,030
I did it!

181
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,360
Come, give it a try.

182
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,710
Like this?

183
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,280
Keep your hand steady.

184
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,510
Eyes on the target.

185
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,840
Watch the target, not me.

186
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,910
Three, two, one.

187
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,390
Well, this is unexpected.

188
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,480
It's been long since I saw you.

189
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,390
I didn't expect you

190
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,390
to be hiding here
practicing martial arts.

191
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,790
Quite a surprise.

192
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,080
But ranks must be respected.

193
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,470
Qingyao,

194
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,790
you are the dignified Crown Princess.

195
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,550
How can you be so close with a servant?

196
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,150
What made you suddenly decide

197
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,750
to train so diligently in martial arts?

198
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,130
His Highness was attacked last time.

199
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,750
I diligently practiced martial arts

200
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,670
just in case.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,550
It sounds good.

202
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,200
I just wonder,

203
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,480
whether all your efforts

204
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,870
have yielded any result.

205
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,030
Wanwan grew up in the General's Mansion.

206
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,750
She's mastered every form of combat.

207
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,600
Why don't the two of you have a match?

208
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,120
That might not be a good idea.

209
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
After all,

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,550
I was born into a family of warriors.

211
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,840
You want to challenge me?

212
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,990
What's this?

213
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,550
Could it be that you're afraid?

214
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,440
Then I shall accept with respect.

215
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,000
Go easy on her.

216
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,200
Don't worry.

217
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,320
I'll show some mercy.

218
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,480
After all, if she gets hurt,

219
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,240
His Highness would be upset.

220
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,240
No, no, no!

221
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,300
I wasn't talking about you.

222
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,120
I told her to go easy,

223
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,980
hold back a bit,

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,960
so she doesn't hurt you.

225
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,200
After all, you're a general's daughter.

226
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,680
You've courting death.

227
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,240
Wanwan.

228
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
You…

229
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,280
Feng Yu,

230
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,510
it just came to me

231
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,360
that my dog's about to give birth.

232
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,920
Gu Qingyao, next time...

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,680
Next time, I'll settle the score
with you.

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
Hey.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,870
How many times a year
does your dog give birth?

236
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
Isn't your dog a male?

237
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,360
They won't bother you again.

238
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,630
What are you doing?

239
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,340
Scattering flower petals.

240
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,060
Have you ever heard a line of verse?

241
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,140
The flowing water splashes
like blossoms.

242
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,480
The setting sun dyes the old gauze
in warm hues.

243
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,590
Beautiful, isn't it?

244
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,490
I loved admiring flowers
when I was little.

245
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,030
Now's the perfect season
for flower viewing.

246
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,240
These are all things you girls like.

247
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,480
I'm not interested at all.

248
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,360
How beautiful it is!

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,790
Wanwan, where's your dog?

250
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,910
Chasing butterflies in the garden.

251
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,920
Oh.

252
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,150
Are you on purpose?

253
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,670
Didn't you say

254
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,630
that your dog...

255
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,510
This is a tactical retreat.

256
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,390
Don't you get it?

257
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,720
If I just clash head-on,

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,440
how could I stay in this residence

259
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,390
for so many years?

260
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,360
You're right.

261
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,790
Never thought Gu Qingyao's skills

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,630
could surpass yours.

263
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,080
Surpass me? That's impossible.

264
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,870
I've looked into it long ago.

265
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,150
That girl was pampered since birth.

266
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,670
She knows nothing of martial arts.

267
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,240
But seeing her move with ease,

268
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,270
she clearly fights like a master.

269
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,150
Could her guard be that skilled?

270
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,440
In just a few short days,

271
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,390
he taught her superior martial arts.

272
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,440
I already had my doubts.

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,240
That night His Highness was attacked,

274
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,120
Gu Qingyao not only escaped harm,

275
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,550
but somehow ended up

276
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,440
with a shadow guard no one recognizes.

277
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,080
There must be something hidden here.

278
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,360
So you mean,

279
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,910
the assassination attempt

280
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
is tied to Gu Qingyao?

281
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
It's just a guess.

282
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,550
There's no proof.

283
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,750
But there is someone,

284
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,510
who would surely take interest in this.

285
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,000
You mean Eunuch Leng?
