00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,900
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,740
(Crown Prince's Residence)

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
You've finally returned.

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,450
His Highness has been waiting
for you all day.

6
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,190
Qingyao.

7
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,000
Your Highness.

8
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,120
Your Highness.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,240
Qingyao,

10
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,640
where have you been all this time?

11
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,480
I haven't seen you around the residence.

12
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,040
I feel the residence is a bit stuffy,

13
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,200
so I went out for some fresh air.

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,680
(Crown Prince's Residence)
Even if you must leave,

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,280
take more people with you.

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Many eyes are watching you right now.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,950
Who are watching me?

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,840
Last time you fought Shen Wanwan.

19
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,620
This time you got involved with killers

20
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,510
and fell in the water,

21
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,000
causing quite a stir.

22
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,920
Even my father and mother

23
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,310
have learned of it.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,790
So my mother sent someone
to look after you.

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,200
Who is it?

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,200
She'll be here soon.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,590
Who could make you

28
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,000
personally come out to greet?

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,870
It's my wet nurse.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,840
The wet nurse?

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,680
Yeah.

32
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,750
Whoa.

33
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,150
This way, please.

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,860
(Crown Prince's Residence)

35
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,470
Nanny, please take care.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,870
Your Highness.

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
You are the noble Crown Prince.

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,120
That truly overwhelms me.

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,840
I was raised under your care.

40
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,960
This is what I should do.

41
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,280
I has failed to live up to your trust.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,800
I was careless in discipline
for a moment.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,750
I never expected

44
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,200
such a disgraceful incident to occur,

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,560
where the Princess and the Consort

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,750
ended up in a physical fight.

47
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,100
This time,

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,470
I am acting under the orders
of His Majesty and Her Highness

49
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,590
to purge the inner court for you

50
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,840
and rectify the family conduct.

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,360
As the Crown Princess,

52
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,630
your attire is disheveled,

53
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,750
your makeup improper,

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,310
how improper that is.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,520
Such willful conduct

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,680
brings shame upon the Crown Prince.

57
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,470
If Minister Gu failed to teach you
proper manners,

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,470
then I will instruct you in his stead.

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,710
Therefore,

60
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,960
copy Reflections of the Heart
ten times

61
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,000
and give it to me tomorrow.

62
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,150
Ten times?

63
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,030
What?

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,960
Do you object?

65
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,120
Thank you for your guidance, Nanny.

66
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,400
See if I've got it right.

67
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,190
If the Prime Minister failed
to teach you the rules,

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,750
then I'll step in to instruct you.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,730
When Gu Qingyao heard
about copying books,

70
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,000
her face turned pale with dread.

71
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,150
How amusing.

72
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
Indeed.

73
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,910
Now we're in for a good show.

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,310
Delicious.

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,680
Nanny Li is clearly
making things hard for me.

76
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,870
How could I finish in one night?

77
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,240
Shiyi,

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,830
can you help me, please?

79
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,630
I'd love to help you,

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but I can't read a word.

81
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,720
What now?

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,900
You caused this mess yourself,

83
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,470
and you still want to drag me into this?

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wasn't it because I took care of you

85
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
that I became disheveled

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,190
and got punished by her?

87
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,880
I can handle swords,

88
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,150
but this thing…

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,080
I really can't.

90
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,670
Go on.

91
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,410
Relying on myself is better
than relying on others.

92
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,830
Oh no.

93
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,070
I haven't even finished it yet.

94
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
This guy…

95
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,120
(He can't write but still wants
to show off.)

96
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,120
Your face…

97
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,430
Why can't this mark be wiped off?

98
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,790
Don't move.

99
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,390
I'll do it myself.

100
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,920
How's my handwriting?

101
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,750
Who said that he couldn't write?

102
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,240
I really can't write.

103
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,550
But I know a bit
about copying handwriting.

104
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,150
You fool.

105
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,320
Don't tell me you stayed up all night.

106
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
What do you think?

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,390
Imitating your handwriting is tough.

108
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,750
Harder than taking a life.

109
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,120
Are you slow or something?

110
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,550
If you can't finish, just leave it.

111
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,720
Nanny Li won't do anything to me anyway.

112
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,900
Look, your hand's all red now.

113
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,390
Alright.

114
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
It's fine.

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
Copying books is not hard for me.

116
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,500
Besides, calligraphy and swordsmanship

117
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,060
ultimately lead to the same destination.

118
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
As for me,

119
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,480
I am naturally intelligent.

120
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,320
Yeah.

121
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,840
If I hadn't chosen the martial path,

122
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,540
I'd surely be a master of words and ink.

123
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,120
You misuse idioms.

124
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,000
You're truly an unlearned man.

125
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,560
Unlearned man?

126
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,360
What does that mean?

127
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,840
'Unlearned man' means

128
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,200
a gifted person.

129
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,510
I don't believe that.

130
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
(This is bad.)

131
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,390
(She won't find out, will she?)

132
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,360
Barely acceptable.

133
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,600
However, to become a qualified consort,

134
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,840
you have to always keep in mind
the teachings of the ancestors.

135
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,150
Next,

136
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,480
I shall instruct you

137
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,080
in the next stage of learning.

138
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,550
Nanny Li, you are right.

139
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,550
I was born
in the Prime Minister's Residence.

140
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,720
Though I can't claim mastery
over every art,

141
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,030
I am still competent enough.

142
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,270
Qin, chess, calligraphy, painting

143
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,790
is just a refined pastime for men.

144
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,790
What use is it for a woman to learn?

145
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,390
A woman's virtue lies in modesty.

146
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,030
How to serve your husband

147
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,270
so that he is satisfied

148
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,200
and comfortable

149
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,320
is what you should do.

150
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,910
Nanny, you are right.

151
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,120
So, what should we study next?

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
The next contest

153
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,240
is key to becoming a proper consort.

154
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,600
This scroll

155
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,960
contains a folk secret from India.

156
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,840
It teaches you all

157
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,720
how to train a supple body.

158
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,720
Do not underestimate it.

159
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,510
This is not merely a matter

160
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,030
of a few simple actions;

161
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,360
it concerns the vital issue
of the royal offspring.

162
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,910
What the heck is this?

163
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,720
That's far too embarrassing.

164
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,960
What are you doing?

165
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
Why are you here?

166
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,590
What are you hiding?

167
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,000
I wasn't… I didn't.

168
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,360
Why is your face so red?

169
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,390
You have a fever?

170
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,360
No, I don't.

171
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,910
It's just been too hot lately.

172
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,910
I do feel a bit hot.

173
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,990
Hot?

174
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,990
Something's wrong.

175
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,390
I sensed something was off earlier.

176
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,230
Haven't you finished copying the book?

177
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,440
What now? A new trick?

178
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,600
No.

179
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,870
Don't fuss over it.

180
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,870
This is women's business.

181
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,870
Why do you keep meddling in such things?

182
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
Fine.

183
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,960
You don't need me right now.

184
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,670
But when you do need my help,

185
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,600
don't come to me then.

186
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,490
What are you thinking about?

187
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,710
Nothing.

188
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,470
You head back now.

189
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,720
Leave me alone.

190
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,670
Go on, leave.

191
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,510
Go.

192
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
Go!

193
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,000
She behaves so strangely.

194
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,510
Something's off.

195
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,730
There's definitely a problem.

196
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,080
Is Gu Qingyao dancing?

197
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,910
It doesn't look like

198
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,150
a formal dance.

199
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,590
This isn't right.

200
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,200
Gu Qingyao.
