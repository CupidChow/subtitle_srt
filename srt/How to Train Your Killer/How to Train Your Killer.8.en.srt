00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,900
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,840
Are we just going

4
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,250
to stand here waiting to be
struck by lightning?

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,200
What else can we do?

6
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,200
In my whole life,

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,670
I've never done anything truly wrong,

8
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,330
yet I still get struck by lightning.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,040
Meeting you,

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,870
has been, in my lifetime,

11
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,000
the one thing
worth risking the lightning.

12
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,760
Why did the rain stop?

13
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,910
Where's the rain?

14
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,220
Why isn't it falling anymore?

15
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,790
What do we do now?

16
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,510
Guess we were tricked.

17
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,400
What else could it be?

18
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,780
Wait,

19
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,430
you seriously seek a lightning strike?

20
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,030
What else would we do?

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,070
There was only one thunder strike.

22
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,910
The two of us got completely drenched.

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,310
How strange.

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,150
Why did the rain suddenly stop?

25
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,590
Something must have gone wrong.

26
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,960
Otherwise, it couldn't have failed.

27
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,030
So you already know about us?

28
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,310
Know what?

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,150
About the body swap.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Now I know.

31
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,530
If you dare tell anyone,

32
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,660
I'll make sure you regret it.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,080
You...

34
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,960
Don't worry, miss.

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,910
With the bond between Shiyi and me,

36
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,560
I'd never breathe a word.

37
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,250
Though he's greedy and fond of beauty,

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,660
he's still somewhat trustworthy.

39
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,910
I never expected

40
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,190
such a strange event could happen
in this world.

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,400
You two really swapped bodies?

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
Just as I thought.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,810
Shiyi,

44
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,280
fortune sure favors you.

45
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,030
Now that you've got a woman's body,

46
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,680
doesn't that mean...

47
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,000
Take your filthy hands off me.

48
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,270
Right now, the most urgent thing is

49
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,590
to switch our bodies back.

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,080
That thunderstorm you mentioned earlier,

51
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
why did it suddenly stop?

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Well...

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,400
I figured it out.

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,800
That couple who chose death for love,

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,150
their devotion moved the heavens.

56
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,300
You two probably dislike each other,

57
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,730
so there are no feelings between you.

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,470
That's why lightning never came.

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,440
That's really the reason?

60
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,800
Without a doubt.

61
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,000
If I'm lying,

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,300
may the heavens strike me down.

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,630
It's thundering. Let's go.

64
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,650
- Alright.
- I'm kidding.

65
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,840
You scumbag!

66
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,590
Why hasn't lightning struck here?

67
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,630
According to historical records,

68
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,750
that couple chose death for love,

69
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,910
which drew the lightning down.

70
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,750
Would our act count as death for love?

71
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,840
Death for love?

72
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,030
It's not just about dying,

73
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,310
but about the love itself.

74
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
Think about it.

75
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,000
That couple faced death together.

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,720
So deep was their bond.

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,390
They must have done something

78
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,750
that moved the heavens.

79
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,310
You're the man,

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,240
so you'll have to take the lead.

81
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,150
Mm.

82
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,480
I don't have any experience either.

83
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,320
How could I know it?

84
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
Seriously?

85
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,370
Don't you have someone you love?

86
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,090
I've only known how to fight
since I was little.

87
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,290
How could I have anyone I love?

88
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,590
But you do have someone you like.

89
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,470
You find a way.

90
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
Since they are lovers,

91
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,560
of course they should engage
in intimate acts.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,190
You're a young lady.

93
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't you feel a bit shy?

94
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,110
What are you imagining?

95
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,040
I mean a simple embrace.

96
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,840
Anyway, we are using

97
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,650
each other's bodies,

98
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,730
so we are holding ourselves.

99
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,660
Nothing to be afraid of.

100
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,000
Here we go.

101
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Why is your breath so unsteady?

102
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,720
It's your breath that's unsteady.

103
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,390
My breath's unsteady?

104
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,360
Mine is steady as ever.

105
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,630
Clearly, your breath is unsteady.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
You're a young lady,

107
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,850
but you just hug me like that.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
I'm not even ready yet.

109
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,430
What's there to prepare for?

110
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,750
We're both fully clothed.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,360
Besides, it's only a friendly embrace.

112
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,790
Well?

113
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,430
Do you feel anything?

114
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,470
Not really.

115
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,680
Nothing at all?

116
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,870
How can that be?

117
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,310
Then maybe we should try something

118
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,190
a bit more thrilling.

119
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,070
What do you think?

120
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,910
Thrilling, hmm?

121
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,760
Yeah.

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
How about we share a kiss?

123
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,250
- No way.
- It's fine, come on.

124
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,070
Shameless couple,

125
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,390
face your doom!

126
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,660
You two are flirting by the lake,

127
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,190
really enjoying yourselves.

128
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,430
We battled that eunuch all night.

129
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,360
Shiyi, you're asking for trouble!

130
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,200
Hold on.

131
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,430
Can you let us
finish our business first?

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,440
No way.

133
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,310
I'll uphold the Master's honor
right now.

134
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
Watch out!

135
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,960
Qingyao.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
Your Highness.

137
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Why?

138
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,200
Qingyao.

139
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,470
Qingyao.

140
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,560
Qingyao.

141
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,460
Something's not right.

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,720
Where's Shiyi?

143
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,560
Qingyao.

144
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,760
Qingyao!

145
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Are you alright?

146
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,360
Your Highness.

147
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,600
Come, sit down.

148
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
What exactly happened?

149
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,300
If Eunuch Leng

150
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,700
hadn't arrived in time to save you,

151
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,650
you'd still be at the bottom
of that lake.

152
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,360
(I can't let him suspect anything
about Shiyi and me.)

153
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,350
Your Highness,

154
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,390
there was a heavy rainstorm yesterday.

155
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,120
I was in a hurry,

156
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,200
trying to rush back.

157
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,910
But I accidentally fell into a lake.

158
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,120
I nearly drowned.

159
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,550
I've feared water since I was a child,

160
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,960
so I'm still quite shaken even now.

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,920
Yes.

162
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,480
I remember when I fell into the river
as a child,

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,390
you risked everything to save me.

164
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,910
Ever since then,

165
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,750
you've feared the water.

166
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,670
Since it's a day of torrential rain,

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,390
why insist on going out?

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,910
I...

169
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Of course, I have matters to attend to.

170
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,750
I see.

171
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,390
You are truly remarkable.

172
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,510
You merely stepped outside,

173
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
and it drew ruthless assassins
to strike at you.

174
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,600
That shadow guard
has a suspicious background.

175
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,160
I already had Eunuch Leng send people

176
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,360
to Jiangnan to ask your father.

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
We will soon know

178
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,790
his identity.

179
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,790
(What should I do? What should I do?)

180
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,670
(Now we're in trouble.)

181
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,550
Your Highness,

182
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,440
it's me.

183
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,720
Enter.

184
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,980
Reporting to you, Your Highness.

185
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
Your Highness.

186
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,910
I sent a letter to inquire
with Minister Gu

187
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,750
about the true identity of Hero Shi.

188
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,590
He said

189
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,320
Hero Shi

190
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,320
was indeed a shadow guard
assigned by Minister Gu

191
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,000
to protect the Crown Princess.

192
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,750
Shiyi,

193
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,440
do you still remember

194
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,390
this place?

195
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,000
Naturally not.

196
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,280
After all,

197
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm not like the two of you,

198
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,960
who fail every single mission.

199
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,240
It seems you haven't forgotten the rule

200
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,910
that failure in a mission

201
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,270
will be punished.

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,150
I only remember

203
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,000
that in the Pavilion,

204
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,790
there is a rule

205
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,840
that forbids harming fellow members.

206
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,910
You spared Bai Jun,

207
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,080
and met secretly
with the Crown Princess.

208
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,840
To avoid the Pavilion's questioning,

209
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,790
you even hurt your own comrade.

210
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,790
Let me think

211
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,200
how I should punish you.

212
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,750
Does the Master know

213
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,630
you two have used force on me?

214
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,200
You've failed so many times,

215
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,720
do you still think

216
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,080
you're his favorite?

217
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
Shiyi,

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,840
in the Master's eyes,

219
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,200
you're already just a discarded pawn.

220
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,240
From now on,

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
just follow me.

222
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,240
Eunuch Leng, you've worked hard.

223
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,460
Since there's nothing else,

224
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,720
you may leave for now.

225
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
Qingyao,

226
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,270
you are pure and trusting.

227
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,160
I'm only doing this

228
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,940
because I'm afraid
you'll be used by others.

229
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,630
These past days,

230
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,820
you've been spending much time
with that shadow guard,

231
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,390
and I fear you might be in danger.

232
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,200
I understand.

233
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
You only worry for my sake.

234
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,200
Without painted brows or lips,

235
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,600
you look especially graceful,

236
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,510
even more endearing than usual.

237
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,960
(Just now, he looked ready
to strangle me.)

238
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,120
(Now he says I'm endearing.)

239
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,510
(So, does he plan to kiss me?)
