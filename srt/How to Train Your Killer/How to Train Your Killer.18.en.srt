=Episode 18=

3
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,620
Young Master Lin, no need to say more.

4
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,960
Let's have a drink inside.

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,180
(Token)

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,720
Young Master Lin,

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,480
you seem to have dropped something.

8
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,620
(Crown Prince's Token)

9
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,430
Oh my goodness.

10
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,310
You're from the Imperial Court.

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,040
Your Highness, you go first.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,950
What about you?

13
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,790
Trying to leave?

14
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,310
Young Master, go quickly!

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
What about Hero Shi?

16
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,840
Don't worry. He can handle himself.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,150
- Go!
- Shiyi! Shiyi!

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,280
Brothers, after them!

19
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,790
Let's go.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,320
Your Highness.

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,620
You go first.

22
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,840
I'll come find you in a bit.

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,950
No, Qingyao!

24
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,480
Your Highness, it's too dangerous here.

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,320
Please leave at once.

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,280
Shiyi!

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,710
Don't come any closer!

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,370
Are you all right?

29
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,510
Didn't I tell you to run?

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,920
If I leave, it would be so disloyal.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,560
Don't forget you taught me martial arts.

32
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,710
Then stay focused.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,030
In a situation like this,

34
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,970
I can not keep you safe.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,190
Keep me safe?

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,430
What do we do now?

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,680
Same as before.

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
Mm.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,430
Let's see where you can run.

40
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,590
Run?

41
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,120
Taking down you two minor players,

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,190
do we really need to run?

43
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,150
Minor players?

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,430
Do you know

45
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,910
the most feared poison master

46
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,360
in the martial world?

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,310
Ouyang Xun?

48
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,240
Since you know my name,

49
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,960
I can at least consider

50
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,430
giving you a quicker end.

51
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,300
Didn't you once say

52
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,390
that when he killed someone,

53
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,660
he licked the blade to look cool,

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,790
and poisoned himself instead?

55
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,240
Yes, that's him.

56
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,030
He poisoned himself.

57
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,080
The martial world sees him

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,520
as a laughingstock.

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,080
You're the fool.

60
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,990
I've long been impervious
to all poisons.

61
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,310
A mere poisoned blade

62
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,560
is nothing in my eyes.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
Yeah, you didn't put it in your eyes.

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,610
But you put it in your mouth.

65
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,590
You're courting death.

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,840
Shiyi, are you alright?

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Even with your unrivaled skill,

68
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,030
with a burden by your side,

69
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,520
you're no match for the two of us.

70
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,780
You…

71
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,800
Go on then.

72
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,280
I left the Palace
to seek worthy talents.

73
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,800
I will not cause you any trouble.

74
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,680
What exactly do you want from us?

75
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,080
Serve at my command.

76
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,150
I will grant you wealth and honor,

77
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,750
and spare you all punishments.

78
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
What do you think?

79
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,080
Choose life or death.

80
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,990
Brothers!

81
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,430
Greetings, Your Highness.

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,910
Greetings, Your Highness.

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,480
Shiyi.

84
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,630
My Lady!

85
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,480
How dare you lay a hand on me?

86
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,560
The taste of Vein-severing Powder
isn't pleasant, is it?

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,960
At this moment,

88
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,600
do you feel your inner strength blocked?

89
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,750
Hurry, go find him.

90
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
You can't get away.

91
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,830
Hey, stop shouting like that.

92
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,680
Show yourself.

93
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
What?

94
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,120
Given up struggling?

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,040
Even your husband has abandoned you.

96
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,870
Living doesn't seem worth it anymore.

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,430
What are you planning?

98
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,630
How about...

99
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,720
Stay back.

100
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,390
Let me set you free.

101
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,880
No!

102
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,000
I originally thought that you,
just a mere guard,

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,430
were coveting the master's wife,

104
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,870
only having lust in your heart.

105
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,920
I never imagined you'd love her
this deeply.

106
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,430
Shiyi,

107
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,320
what's wrong with you?

108
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,070
What have you done to him?

109
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,430
Saving a beauty isn't as easy
as it looks.

110
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,950
I placed the Yin-Yang Poison

111
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,720
on my hairpin.

112
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,790
Within the duration
of a burning joss stick,

113
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,950
if he does not consummate with a woman,

114
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,720
he will die from a rush of blood
to the heart.

115
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,750
Shameless.

116
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,570
Shiyi.

117
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,750
I merely helped him fulfill his wish.

118
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,430
He's willing to die for you.

119
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,750
Can't you devote yourself to him?

120
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,110
Your Highness,

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
we only have one umbrella.

122
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,720
Let's make do with it.

123
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,050
Her Highness is in a difficult spot.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,510
Shall we step in to help?

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,000
No need.

126
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,720
I want to see

127
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,750
what choice she will make.

128
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,310
There's not much time left.

129
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,560
Will you really just watch him die?

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,720
If we hadn't swapped our bodies,

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,120
you wouldn't have fallen to this fate.

132
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,350
Qingyao,

133
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,040
don't forget me.

134
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
Shiyi!

135
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,000
Shiyi.

136
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,910
Qingyao.

137
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,480
What a pair of love‑struck souls.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,480
Li, let's go.

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,270
In this lifetime,

140
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,910
will I ever meet someone like him?

141
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,630
Of course you will.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,910
Where is my wife?

143
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,880
If you make amends for your crimes,

144
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,960
I can spare your lives.

145
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,550
There's one thing I fail to understand.

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,120
The court has countless skilled
generals and soldiers.

147
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,360
Why must you go through such trouble

148
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,480
to ask help from rough men like us?

149
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,600
Each craft has its own masters.

150
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,320
Only you can accomplish

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,270
what I need to do.

152
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,360
Who are you dealing with?

153
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,360
The Wind and Rain Pavilion.

154
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,000
Have you heard of it?

155
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,270
How did we switch bodies again?

156
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,270
How could this happen?

157
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,200
We just switched it back!

158
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,080
Come on.

159
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,960
Surviving such peril is luck enough.

160
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,910
The way we are now

161
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,870
can be considered a good thing.

162
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Good thing?

163
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,750
Seize this chance

164
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,320
to see Ling Yu's true colors.

165
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,390
Qingyao... Qingyao!

166
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,230
Stop!

167
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,750
Qingyao!

168
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,600
- Your Highness!
- Qingyao!

169
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,080
- Qingyao!
- Your Highness!
