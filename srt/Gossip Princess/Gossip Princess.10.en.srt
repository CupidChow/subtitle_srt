1
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,359
I know it.

2
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,519
You don't care about money.

3
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,519
What matters is whether they make the best use of it,

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,439
isn't it?

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,199
Why help me?

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,999
I don't mean to help you.

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,439
I just don't want to see this happen again.

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,719
How about you?

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,399
What do you want?

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,839
I do these things for a reason.

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,999
Mu.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,119
You're all here today.

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,999
On no, a trap for me.

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,799
From now on.

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,559
You, Liang Hong, are my brother.

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,439
All thanks to you.

17
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,319
We brothers can live a safe and stable life.

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,359
From now on,

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,199
whether it's going through fire or water,

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,199
I, Mu, will definitely stand by you.

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,719
Whatever happens to you,

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,679
I'll always by your side.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,719
I will not treat my brothers badly.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,879
You can rest assured.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,159
from today onwards,

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,159
every penny in the village will include your share.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,279
Well said.

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,959
I accept you as my friend.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,359
Leave money for the passage.

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,599
Keep you safe and sound.

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,359
Pay the money.

32
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,679
Yours.

33
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,919
Hurry.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,599
Go.

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,479
Money.

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,479
Hurry.

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,679
Leave money for passage.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,959
Keep you safe and sound.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,319
Quick.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,599
Take out the money.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,999
Pay the money.

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,079
Pay up!

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,319
I want to leave here.

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,959
Then leave.

45
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,959
Keep you safe and sound.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,519
Pay the money.

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,599
Our Childe wants to see you.

48
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,959
The rest, come up.

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,479
Come on, come on.

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,359
Thanks to Miss Liang for your help

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,559
during this calamity.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,679
Miss Liang's single-handed struggle

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,679
against a group of bandits and bullies

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,199
truly makes your a heroine

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,799
I admire you very much.

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,079
They don't have bad intentions.

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,719
They just chose the wrong way to live.

58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,919
Besides.

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,359
They are all my brothers now.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,599
I misspoke.

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,719
After all, based on my experience,

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,079
it's hard to see them as not bad people.

63
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,359
It's okay.

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,319
What do you want to see me about today?

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,079
You have great talent.

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,919
It's a waste for you

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,159
to stay here.

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,839
Why not follow me to the capital?

69
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,799
Let's go then.

70
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,199
He's here.

71
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,999
I brought some snacks for Prince Song.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,799
Please wait.

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,919
Greetings, Prince.

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,919
Miss Gao, is there anything wrong?

75
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,159
I know today is the day your depart.

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,599
The journey is bumpy,

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,159
and there aren't any decent eateries.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,399
So, I made some snacks for you.

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,759
Miss Gao's snacks

80
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,159
are always unique and delicious.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,599
Thanks for your hard work.

82
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,199
Doing things for you

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,359
will never be hard.

84
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,399
The weather is so hot.

85
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,999
Even if your snacks are delicious,

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,719
Prince may not be able to eat them.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,799
Look.

88
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,959
They are arguing.

89
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,119
What are you doing here?

90
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,519
Don't you see it?

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,799
The same thing as you do.

92
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,479
Her eyes are rolling like a parabola.

93
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,079
Guest.

94
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,199
Come take a look.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,879
Thanks.

96
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,399
I'll treat you to dinner later.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,999
I still think

98
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,079
staying at this inn isn't quite right.

99
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,039
It's better to stay at

100
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,599
the villa I arranged for you.

101
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,399
No need.

102
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,359
I'm not one

103
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,999
to trouble others.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,279
Here is fine.

105
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,719
In this case.

106
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,999
I won't force it.

107
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,319
If you need anything,

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,199
feel free to say.

109
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,759
Okay, thank you.

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,719
Then you slow down.

111
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,879
Take your time.

112
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,399
Goodbye. See you later.

113
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,559
Exhausted.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,799
Let's go.

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,559
Time to eat.

116
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,319
Go back to your room. I'm going to sleep.

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,599
I can't sleep.

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,999
Have a drink with me?

119
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,919
It'll be dawn when you're satisfied.

120
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,759
Makes sense.

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,439
So annoying.

122
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,799
What should I do?

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
I didn't expect Song Shilian to have a bead.

124
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,239
Why not follow me to the capital?

125
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,039
Now that we know where the bead is.

126
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,679
No need to rush to get it.

127
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,919
Why don't you do what you like most first?

128
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,039
My favorite thing?

129
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,559
Making money.

130
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,599
If you want to make money.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,439
You still have to find Song Shilian.

132
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,079
But why did he bring me here?

133
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,639
What does he really want?

134
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,759
No matter his intentions,

135
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,079
if you want to use him,

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,079
you'll have to move his chips.

137
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,759
It's really true that the brave aren't afraid of anything

138
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,479
except cultured warriors.

139
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,359
Childe, I found it out.

140
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,799
Is it him?

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,799
Exactly.

142
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,999
He's willing to be a girl's thug.

143
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,079
I haven't found out about her background.

144
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,759
But what can be confirmed is

145
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,159
she has no power in the court.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,799
Interesting.

147
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,999
I didn't expect you to write so well.

148
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,159
Every word is like a gem.

149
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,879
Very eloquent.

150
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,359
What's going on?
