1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,270
I've heard

2
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,470
there is a woman named Liang who is both talented and beautiful.

3
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,710
If she can stay with childe,

4
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,790
she will definitely be able to share your worries.

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,950
Not like me,

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,790
I can just do these chores.

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,590
In my heart,

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,950
no one can compare to you.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,310
Have you taken your medicine today?

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,470
Yes.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,270
I take medicine every day.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,310
Never slack off.

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,590
You are the best.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,990
Take good care of yourself.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,230
Then expand the Song family as soon as possible.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,510
As for life,

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,270
there should be some sense of ceremony.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,310
Cheers.

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,870
Today,

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,710
you have to have a drink with me,

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,030
because I am so tired.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,710
What did you do? You are so tired.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,550
I...

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,830
Hurry up.

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,750
That, that, that.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,590
There are tables, and tables.

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,550
Put the mirror over there.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,590
Wait.

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,430
Why not put it there?

30
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,590
Let's put it over there.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,030
Otherwise, just put it there.

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,270
Unimportant.

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,830
To tell the truth,

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,070
what else do you remember?

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,270
My name is Xiao Changfeng.

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,670
Anything else?

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,030
I used to be a killer.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,750
You are so calm.

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,990
Aren't you afraid that I will dislike you?

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,190
You won't.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,470
You know it for sure.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,910
I just know it.

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,230
If he is the one you want,

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,750
he will never leave you at any time.

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,870
It's with his status

46
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,190
not related.

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,590
No matter what you become,

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,270
he will like you,

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,710
and not leave you.

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,110
Is it right?

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,270
You said you didn't believe

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,150
a man fell in love with a woman

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,950
and it would never change.

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,310
Why are you asking this suddenly?

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,510
If this person is me,

56
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,670
are you willing to believe it?

57
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,190
What if I don't believe it?

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,830
If you believe it,

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,630
let's have a try.

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,390
I've been confessed.

61
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,750
My mouth is so dry.

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,070
I was in such a hurry that I forgot to bring the wine.

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,310
He understands me.

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,710
Am I being taken advantage of?

65
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,790
He offered himself to me on his initiative.

66
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,350
I won't suffer any loss.

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:45,270
He dares to tease me.

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,710
Should follow my pace.

69
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,830
What's your rhythm?

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,190
The driving rhythm.

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,750
Hey, hey, hey.

72
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,470
Come out.

73
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,470
Lord asked you to go home.

74
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,350
Give me three more days.

75
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,670
You've woken up.

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,670
I drank a little more last night.

77
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,510
How much alcohol can you drink?

78
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,070
Don't you know it in your heart?

79
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,590
So annoying. Don't say it.

80
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,750
I can't tell you're quite open.

81
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,150
Aren't you people here all abiding by the rules?

82
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,390
Follow the orders?

83
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,510
What if you don't admit it?

84
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,870
Don't most women have to wipe their necks?

85
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,070
I have already decided that you are the only one in my life.

86
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,270
As you wish,

87
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,790
adjusting the steps

88
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,190
is also possible.

89
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,470
After all, you are not an ordinary woman.

90
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,710
What's this?

91
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,070
My family assets.

92
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,390
All is given to me.

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,510
Then I'll put them all away.

94
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,030
Including me.

95
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,150
Why are you suddenly so cheesy today?

96
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,750
Don't you like it?

97
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,270
Yes.

98
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,670
No peeking!

99
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,030
First one.

100
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,510
Apple.

101
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,990
The second.

102
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,990
Go here, forward.

103
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,750
I'm not kidding you anymore.

104
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,470
I want to know everything about this woman.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,630
Yes.

106
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,110
I want to eat the roast duck.

107
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,830
What do you eat,?And you just know what to eat.

108
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,430
I also want to eat a Bingtang hulu.

109
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,510
Go to have a look later.
