1
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,719
What's going on?

2
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,159
The two of you have such a good relationship.

3
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,759
Same last name again.

4
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,879
Are they siblings?

5
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,359
More or less.

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,479
By the way.

7
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,119
I called you here today

8
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,719
because I have an idea to discuss with you.

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,639
Have you heard of 'wife diplomacy?

10
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,039
Wife diplomacy?

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,319
Exactly.

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,439
You wrote it.

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,719
Look at what you did today.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,479
From now on,

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,119
if there is such a situation where I need to show up,

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,479
you should inform me beforehand.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,399
If not for my quick thinking today,

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,479
our negotiations have broken down.

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,839
Then how can I carry out my grand plan?

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,959
Brothers and sisters

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,319
When did we become brother and sister?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,399
Look at you.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,639
I thought only us girls

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,999
had age anxiety.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,679
Didn't expect you to have it too.

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,479
All right, all right.

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,479
I am older than you. I am the elder sister.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,279
All right?

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,119
Where are you going?

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,439
Alright.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,479
Who?

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,519
Guest.

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,159
Prince Song has a letter for you.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,639
Prince Song.

35
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,959
What does the letter say?

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,599
Nothing serious.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,719
Shangjing walk.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,839
He's asking me out for a walk.

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,359
Why does he keep finding you?

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,799
From my experience,

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,199
with his initiative

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,279
and eagerness to meet daily

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,399
he's definitely interested in me.

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,359
Are you really going?

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,199
He's practically

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,679
my financial backer now.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,239
Consider it a market research trip.

48
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,519
How is it, Xiaoweiwei?

49
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,199
Sister takes you to tour the capital's commercial center, huh?

50
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,759
Are you having your period?

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,759
Lord.

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,319
The trace of the young master has been found.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,839
How is he?

54
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,079
He's physically fine,

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,319
but it seems he doesn't remember anything.

56
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,079
As long as he's safe.

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,999
The most important thing now

58
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,919
is the selection consorts.

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,759
I don't know why.

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,479
But the thing of The Chosen Princess

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,959
is widely known now.

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,159
There are discussions everywhere.

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,039
Everyone knows.

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,479
The Chosen Princess is just a cover.

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,199
Is there someone secretly fanning the flames?

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,839
Lord.

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,959
Even if

68
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,999
the King of Changsha uses the blood

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,719
of The Medicine Man as medicine.

70
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,799
It will take at least a year or more to succeed.

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,079
Lord.

72
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,319
Our grand plan—

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,839
How could I not know this?

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,279
This method takes a long time and has many variables.

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,559
Changsha Palace is like a solid wall.

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,519
Last time's assassination

77
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,199
almost cost Feng er's life.

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,879
We must not act recklessly.

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,199
Go ahead.

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,679
Yes.

81
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,039
So stylish.

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,439
Prince Song.

83
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,759
Welcome.

84
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,719
I've been waiting for you.

85
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,399
These are...

86
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,399
They are my close friends.

87
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,999
Liang Hong and Liang Chaowei.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,679
Greetings.

89
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,959
Hello, boss.

90
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,079
I have to trouble Brother Chen again

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,399
to treat them toady.

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,679
Your friends are my friends.

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,239
Don't worry.

94
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,919
Come on.

95
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,959
This way.

96
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,479
Miss Liang.

97
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,799
You might as well try this one.

98
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,879
This one is also good.

99
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,279
Take a look.

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,239
It's OK, Miss Liang.

101
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,519
We have various styles.

102
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,559
You can choose slowly.

103
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,799
Girls always choose clothes like this.

104
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,159
It's like they can't sit still

105
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,879
for the duration of a cup of tea.

106
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,879
I really don't know as much as you.

107
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,239
Why is it taking so long?

108
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,159
Come in.

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,639
How does it look?

110
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,239
Classy and sophisticated, right?

111
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,279
Like a thousand-year-old tree.

112
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,719
Hey!

113
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,439
These accessories

114
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,519
match perfectly with you.

115
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,479
Look at this hairpin, so vibrant.

116
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,119
It complements your fair complexion superbly.

117
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,879
And this brooch, so charming and elegant,

118
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,639
complements your figure perfectly.

119
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,279
It really complements each other.

120
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,719
And finally...

121
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,839
That's enough.

122
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,159
Stop talking.

123
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,239
Today.

124
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,079
I'll spend as much time as I like.

125
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,719
I want to try on

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,439
all your clothes.

127
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,439
Your clothes here

128
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,919
are so troublesome to wear.

129
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,199
I'm so tired of trying.

130
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,359
How about it? Are you satisfied?

131
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,519
Prince Song.

132
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,679
All these clothes

133
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,399
have been tried on by Miss Liang.

134
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,439
They match her perfectly.

135
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,279
What do you think?

136
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,919
Should l send them to your house?

137
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,999
About all these clothes...

138
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,559
I don't want any of them.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,799
Miss Liang.

140
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,839
The best clothes and tailors in the capital

141
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,039
are all here with me.

142
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,999
Why don't you try again?

143
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,399
When it comes to selling clothes,

144
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,999
I'm more professional than you.

145
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,439
My opinion is

146
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,879
to establish a circle through

147
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,359
high-end custom clothing.

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,279
Within this circle,

149
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,919
we implement a membership system

150
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,119
with a high threshold for entry.

151
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,079
Those who can join

152
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,999
are all rich ladies and wives.

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,279
Everyone sits together,

154
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,999
buys clothes, chats,

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,559
drinks tea, and looks around.

156
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,399
What's wrong, Prince Song?

157
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,639
I've already thought of a name for it.

158
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,079
I'll call is The Secret of the Upper Capital。

159
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,639
Why that name?

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,599
Because that place of secret

161
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,839
is loved by both men and women

162
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,119
in our hometown.

163
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,119
So I borrowed it.

164
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,359
Prince Song.

165
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,359
Do you know what this place sells?

166
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,479
What?

167
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,479
Belly bands

168
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,639
What do you need me to do?

169
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,679
Prince Song.

170
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,519
You only need to appear

171
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,839
for very necessary moments.

172
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,919
Okay.
