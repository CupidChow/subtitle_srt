1
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,999
I've given all my money to you.

2
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,999
Let me go.

3
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,479
Let you go?

4
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,559
Mu.

5
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,519
Stop it.

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,479
Mu.

7
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,359
You can't kill this person.

8
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,119
Shut up.

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,399
You witch.

10
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,159
If it weren't for you interfering with our plans,

11
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,959
we wouldn't have lost so many people.

12
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,359
You are a jinx,

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,759
bringing disaster wherever you go.

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,759
Boss Mu.

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,959
I know you are anxious to avenge your brother.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,479
But this person is not ordinary.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,399
Even if he's the Heavenly King,

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,759
he must die today.

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,279
Mu.

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,719
Then I ask you.

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,799
Did you get any money today?

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,559
My brothers are gone.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,279
What's the use of money?

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,439
Big Brother.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,639
Don't listen to this witch's lies anymore.

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,839
I think

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,239
she's in cahoots with him.

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,039
Can I kill her now?

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,879
Idiot! You can die if you want.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,879
But don't cause the whole village die with you.

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,279
Then I'll kill you first.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,159
Junior bro.

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,599
Big Brother.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,959
Who are you?

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,879
Son of Song Qi'an。

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,479
Song Shilian。

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,999
Song Qi'an, General of the Cavalry.

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,439
The No.1 Prince of Shangjing City

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,399
Song Shilian.

40
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,479
I've heard stories of General Song breaking enemy lines single-handedly

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,559
since I was young.

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,519
I admire him greatly.

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,599
Unfortunately.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,839
No matter who it is,

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,199
if they kill my people,

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,679
they must pay with their life.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,719
It was obviously your people who wanted to kill first.

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,999
That's why such a disaster happened.

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,159
If I die here today.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,719
My father will hunt you down to the ends of the world.

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,239
If you let me go.

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,599
The benefits are naturally indispensable to you.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,999
Rewards?

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,399
Men.

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,759
Yes.

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,679
Take him out.

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,879
Dismember him.

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,679
Boss.

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,839
There are a lot of people searching below the mountain.

60
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,879
They're coming this way.

61
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,519
Soldiers.

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,519
They come really quick.

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,999
Brothers,

64
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,759
are you afraid?

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,799
No!

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,999
Good.

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,039
Then let's avenge our brothers first

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,359
and then fight those officers to the death.

69
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,239
Kill!

70
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
Kill!

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,279
Enough!

72
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,439
Fight to the death, then what?

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,599
You all died.

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,479
What will be the meaning of the lives

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,759
your dead brothers sacrificed?

76
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,559
So every time you take risks,

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,199
it's just to have your brothers

78
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,119
accompany you in death?

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,159
It's not your turn to talk about the village issues.

80
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,319
What about Shunzi?

81
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,519
I am okay.

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,799
You go back and wait for me.

83
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,679
Speak.

84
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,559
What did Shunzi say before he died?

85
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,119
He didn't get a chance to say anything

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,599
before he died.

87
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,359
You're lying to me again.

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
Though he couldn't leave a message.

89
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,519
But I know what he wants to say.

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,199
He doesn't want you to do this anymore.

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,119
Died meaninglessly.

92
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,959
I once asked Shunzi

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,999
why he became a bandit.

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,599
He told me

95
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,999
that when he had no one to rely on,

96
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,599
you took him back to the village.

97
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,239
Mu.

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,159
I know you are a sentimental person.

99
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,479
Every brother's death

100
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,279
pains you the most.

101
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,559
But if you don't change,

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,479
today it's Shunzi and the others,

103
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,959
and what about tomorrow or the day after?

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,399
Being a bandit is the life we chose.

105
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,639
But no one wants to be born a bandit.

106
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,359
They are all miserable people.

107
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,079
They chose to follow me

108
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,519
and live a life licking blood off the blade.

109
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,719
So I can't let them die in vain.

110
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,439
Fate can be changed.

111
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,639
Last time,

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,719
you said you can replace the Heaven.

113
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,959
And this time,

114
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,519
you say you can change my fat.

115
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,919
Who do you think you are?

116
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,719
What if I say

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,639
I can help your brothers avoid taking risks

118
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,639
and get a stable job?

119
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,879
Would you be willing?

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,319
He must die.

121
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,039
The soldiers are surrounding us now.

122
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,159
No matter how many people your village has.

123
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,119
The court will always has more.

124
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,999
If you fight them head-on now,

125
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,039
it will only cost the lives of all your brothers.

126
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,599
Mu.

127
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,479
I've thought it over.

128
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,119
We can set up rest stations

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,479
on the routes leading into the city.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,799
This way, we can charge a small fee from everyone

131
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,999
passing by for tea and refreshments.

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
Just for tea and refreshments?

133
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,439
Don't underestimate this small fee.

134
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,519
There are four routes leading into the city

135
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,519
with a high traffic flow daily.

136
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,279
Accumulate it over time,

137
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,239
and it will become a substantial sum.

138
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,399
What does this have to do with Song Shilian?

139
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,399
We can do it ourselves.

140
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,519
Setting up private checkpoints

141
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,879
will attract government crackdowns.

142
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,919
But if we have official document.

143
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,519
This matter has become a matter of course.

144
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,199
That's the role Song Shilian can play.

145
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,999
Also,

146
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,599
building rest stations requires initial funds.

147
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,319
I can help you secure

148
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,719
a large sum from Song Shilian.

149
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,439
This way, you can use it for basic construction

150
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,319
and distribute the remainder

151
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,839
to the families of

152
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,199
your fallen brothers.

153
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,719
Since they are already dead,

154
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,439
let those who are alive live well.

155
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,839
Are you sure Song Shilian won't take revenge?

156
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,399
I'll fix it.

157
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,479
I believe you can see it too.

158
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,679
They want to kill you.

159
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,279
This is no joke.

160
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,679
This is the greatest benefit

161
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,439
I could gain for you.

162
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,839
But.

163
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,199
I can guarantee you.

164
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,279
No one in the entire village

165
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,119
will mention you being captured.

166
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,119
Are you sure?

167
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,119
Actually,

168
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,679
this is a win-win for both sides.

169
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,919
You

170
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,039
can assist the government in eradicating bandits

171
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,239
and solve the local security issues.

172
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,839
As for them.

173
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,439
They get legitimate jobs

174
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,119
and won't be thinking about killing every day.

175
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,239
I know it.

176
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,399
You don't care about money.

177
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,399
What matters is whether they make the best use of it,

178
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,319
isn't it?

179
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,079
Why help me?
