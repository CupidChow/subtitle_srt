1
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,039
Junior bro.

2
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,919
You count the left side with Shunzi.

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,399
You guys follow me and count the right side.

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,599
Well done, Mu.

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,759
Come on.

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,759
Just a sheep.

7
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,439
Oh on.

8
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,159
I forgot the number.

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,879
Be focused!

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,759
What's the number?

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,999
I forgot where I left off counting.

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,639
You....

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
You're so useless.

14
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,399
I'm done counting.

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,839
176

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,799
This is really weird.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,799
Where did that woman come from?

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,719
I...

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,159
How did we two fall into her hands?

20
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,039
I told you she was a witch.

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,959
A rogue.

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,830
Big Brother.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,799
You won't really let her go like this, will you?

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,759
Once the word is spoken, I will accept the loss.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,399
I can't deny it.

26
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,679
How did you end up with something like this?

27
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,759
I didn't mean it.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,079
Every time I think of her voice now,

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,759
it gives me a headache.

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,999
Big Brother.

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,719
She refused to leave.

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,519
Even if I die together with that pretty boy.

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,679
I'm going to kill that witch.

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,839
Big Brother.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,599
Hurry, catch up.

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,879
Big Brother.

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,639
What on earth do you want?

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,999
I won't marry you anymore.

39
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,799
And cares no more about what happened between you and Junior bro.

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,239
I'm telling you.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,199
Don't force me to use violence.

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,759
Mu.

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,119
Why are you so angry?

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,199
I just want to make friends with you.

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,399
I'm not interested.

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,359
And never will.

47
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,479
Oh come on.

48
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,239
We just want to be bandits with you

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,159
and join your gang.

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,399
No way.

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,239
Every time I see you,

52
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,599
I feel so depressed.

53
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,519
I'll never accept you.

54
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,039
Come on, Mu.

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,839
Witch.

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,639
I am good at making money.

57
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,079
I can help you make a lot of money.

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,639
Don't you want money?

59
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,839
I'm a bandit,

60
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,479
living off the land.

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,759
Do you think you can control the heavens?

62
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,359
Well...

63
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,839
No.

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,039
But I have a lot of money-making ideas.

65
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,319
Pay attention.

66
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,999
I said making money, not robbing.

67
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,919
Then give me one now.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,759
This is not like an hen laying eggs.

69
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,079
It's not that easy.

70
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,039
I have to check your working mode first.

71
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,239
Your operation rules

72
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,559
And during your work...

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,159
Three days.

74
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,679
Give me three days.

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,279
Just three days.

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,359
The king asked me to patrol the mountain.

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,839
I travel the world around.

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,639
Hey.

79
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,359
You've been chattering all the way.

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,319
Chirping.

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,959
Why are you following us?

82
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,279
Stupid.

83
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,679
We are colleagues now.

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,039
As colleagues,

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,519
should we cooperate and help each other?

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,639
I don't know what you mean.

87
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,959
Stop following us.

88
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,359
Go.

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,639
Shunzi.

90
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,959
Who gave you this name?

91
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,199
My dad.

92
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,639
I also have a nickname.

93
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,959
Do you know what it's called?

94
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,439
No.

95
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,359
It's Ace.

96
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,199
If my last name is Wang.

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,959
Do you know what my name is?

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,839
It's be Ace Wang.

99
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,119
Sister, take it.

100
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,319
Where did you get the egg?

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,719
My chickens laid eggs.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,039
My mom said that

103
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,559
eating eggs is good for woman.

104
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,839
Shunzi.

105
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,599
Why are you in the village?

106
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,799
Where are your family members?

107
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,399
My family was poor.

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,239
My parents died of illness.

109
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,399
Boss felt sorry for me.

110
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,839
He took me back.

111
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,839
Come with me.

112
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,639
Go.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,959
Let's go back.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,759
Why?

115
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,119
We've just started.

116
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,799
Don't kill people.

117
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,039
Come up if you want to help.

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,359
Or just shut up.

119
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,119
Shunzi.

120
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,559
Shunzi, come back.

121
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,039
Stop hitting.

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,639
Sister.

123
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,119
Hello, sister-in-law.

124
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,399
Sister.

125
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,079
Take it.

126
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,959
He died right in front of me.

127
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,719
He's still so young.

128
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,719
His blood splashed on my face and it was hot.

129
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,799
Don't think about it.

130
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,399
Why do people have to kill?

131
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,959
Because this is the way the world is.

132
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,959
Either you kill,

133
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,559
or get killed.

134
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,199
Have you ever killed anyone?

135
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,559
Whose life is more worthless?

136
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,079
Does having much power mean

137
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,679
you can take someone else's life?

138
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,439
Considering where we are, yes.

139
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,119
A poor and humble life.

140
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,519
No one will care.

141
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,039
I care.

142
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,359
Shunzi.

143
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,359
Find a good family in the next life.

144
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,399
Don't being a bandit any more.
