1
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,950
No.

2
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,230
If sister, you don't have any lecture today,

3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,750
brother will leave first.

4
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,430
You sit down.

5
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,510
What's the matter

6
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,310
with you today?

7
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,510
What is this for?

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,310
Since sister, you recognized me as your brother yesterday,

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,150
and my parents are no longer here,

10
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,270
the elder sister is like a mother.

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,830
It is necessary to take good care of you every morning and evening.

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,750
I don't know what my sister thinks is wrong.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,270
I...

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,990
Can't we just avoid all of this?

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,430
My sister, don't you want to acknowledge me as your brother anymore?

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,150
No, I..

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,030
I just feel

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,310
unaccustomed.

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,030
Greet my sister every day,

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,670
and obey my sister's instructions are the younger brother's duties.

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,390
You, you are real...

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,950
Girl, please rinse your mouth.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,430
You are real...

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,550
I...

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,950
You two are real...

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,670
Only learning a skill

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,070
will you have the foundation to be independent,

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,390
so you must study hard.

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,190
Do you understand?

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,990
Yes.

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,270
Xiaolian, you go too.

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,190
Xiaolian is the girl's maid.

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,350
and I don't need to save dowry.

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,390
As long as the girl doesn't dislike me,

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,630
just give me some food,

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,470
Xiaolian wants to serve the girl for the rest of my life.

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,390
Lian,

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,430
you have to think it like this.

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,990
Since you are my maid,

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,630
then I have to know

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,150
what you can do and what you can't,

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,870
right?

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,910
So the opportunity is equal.

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,830
If you learn well,

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,790
you can still help me, right?

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,670
You two did well.

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,630
Keep going.

48
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,070
You look

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,430
the materials of the two are actually completely different.

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,910
Xiaolian,

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,430
You see, what we usually use most

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,390
is a needle.

53
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,070
It's time to eat.

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,790
There is also a triangular needle.

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,030
I'll be busy first and eat later.

56
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,830
Eat first.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,870
Press and secure the cuffs of your garment.

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,590
Eat first, eat first.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,150
You see, like this.

60
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,950
We're going to move the needle from left to right.

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,110
A thug dares to snatch people from childe.

62
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,510
Childe, do you want to kill him?

63
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,430
Killing him now

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,790
will ruin my plan, I am afraid.

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,550
Should we just let him stay with Miss Liang?

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,750
If the old fox, the State Preceptor, knows about this,

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,510
how will he feel?

68
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,830
No one can snatch away the person I like.

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,550
Your task today

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,350
is just putting on these clothes

71
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,070
and then spending a day strolling around the streets of upper capital.

72
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,950
Alright.

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,830
If you have nothing else, then set off.

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,270
Go. Go.

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,590
What's wrong?

76
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,430
I remember the girl said

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,150
the Secret of Upper Capital was exclusive customization.

78
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,510
The only original

79
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,750
was bought by Miss Gao at a high price.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,550
Yes.

81
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,150
But if running into Miss Gao,

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,190
she would see we were dressed similarly,

83
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,630
wearing roughly made clothes,

84
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,550
wouldn't she be unhappy?

85
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,430
It is because of the rough workmanship

86
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,390
that it won't be a problem.

87
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,230
A truly beautiful dress

88
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,270
is to be imitated by others.

89
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,270
Then it can be called a trend.

90
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,950
Got it.

91
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,390
I know a few shops.

92
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,630
There are often some

93
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,550
servants of the nobles to visit them.

94
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,110
If we take some that look similar

95
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,550
but cheaper clothes to sell them,

96
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,750
their masters must be curious.

97
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,270
Who are they imitating?

98
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,510
Okay.

99
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,790
So you can go to these shops and have a chat.

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,550
OK.

101
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,910
Happy.

102
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,910
This is my first time to be a matchmaker.

103
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,030
I have told you

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,030
what a toy boy can protect you from.

105
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,710
I have to handle it for you.

106
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,190
Say, who bullied you?

107
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,070
I'll kill him.

108
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,830
Lao Mu.

109
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,190
Stop talking nonsense.

110
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,670
I ask you to come here because there are good things.

111
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,870
Good things.

112
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,830
What good things?

113
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,030
Blind dates.

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,630
My name is Tiezhu.

115
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,670
Why is it so hard?

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,510
Also writing and drawing.

117
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,750
Dating

118
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,990
is a process of seeing each other.

119
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,310
You have to let the girls

120
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,030
know your basic information.

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,310
I tell you

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,510
let your brothers be more polite.

123
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,270
What if you scare your brides away?

124
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,230
None of my business.

125
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,270
Got it.

126
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,750
Go and register.

127
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,910
I also have to register?

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,190
I am the great man from Dawang village.

129
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,510
I, I, I, what you?

130
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,430
Don't think you can get special treatment just because you are the boss.

131
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,310
This is a matter of eye contact.

132
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,510
Everyone is equal.

133
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,470
If unsatisfactory,

134
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,430
no introduction.

135
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,550
Whoever wants to go can go,

136
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,350
I can be single for the rest of my life.

137
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,070
Just now, I

138
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,550
actually saw a very beautiful girl

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,070
who's been stealing glances at you.

140
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,150
I married two women.

141
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,310
Follow me.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,470
My parents are big pig butchers.

143
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,470
My family is rich.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,030
I come first.

145
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,510
Name?

146
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,790
Boss Mu.

147
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,110
Say real name.

148
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,590
I'm called Boss Mu.

149
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,230
If there is someone you are satisfied with,

150
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,510
just pass this cup of tea to the him.

151
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,670
If he drinks this cup of tea,

152
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,230
that means the relationship is successful.

153
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,070
Come out, girls.

154
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,990
Really not bad.

155
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,950
This one is the most beautiful.

156
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,670
Lao Mu.

157
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,750
Lay it down.

158
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,230
What tea do you drink?

159
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,270
Go back to the village and drink.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,230
You give it back to others.

161
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,670
This is free pairing.

162
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,110
Put away your banditry.

163
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,910
What's wrong with me?

164
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,230
I was originally a bandit.

165
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,710
Besides,

166
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,230
if she marries me,

167
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,070
how can I wrong her?

168
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,110
Shut up.

169
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,430
Today is my big day.

170
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,710
No one can spoil my fun.

171
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,470
Big brother, you, I...

172
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,950
This cup is yours.

173
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,070
Why did you come?

174
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,390
My childe has something to discuss with Miss Liang.

175
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,630
No problem.

176
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,550
When?

177
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,350
The childe is already in the courtyard.

178
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,030
Looking forward to your coming, Miss Liang.

179
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,670
Boss,

180
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,150
you're in a good mood today.

181
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,950
What do you want from me?

182
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,030
About the Clothing Shop,

183
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,870
do you have any new ideas?

184
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,590
The new version is almost ready.

185
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,670
I plan when I show new products next time,

186
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,190
I will promote the beauty makeup part.

187
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,230
This is

188
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,350
title deed.

189
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,750
If following your idea,

190
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,430
the shop is too small now.

191
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,990
In the best location, I

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,950
bought the best shop and gave it to you.

193
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,630
Why?

194
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,710
I just don't want you to struggle for life.

195
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,990
Because of my identity,

196
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,550
as long as you are happy,

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,790
gold, silver, jewelry, wealth, status,

198
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,470
all of which can be given to you.

199
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,590
So you're throwing money at me.

200
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,750
The true love may change,

201
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,550
but wealth and status will not.

202
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,510
You love money, and I have money.

203
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,150
Isn't it a good match?

204
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,390
Only I can make you succeed.

205
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,110
You talk to her like this.

206
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,790
You have lost her.

207
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,350
The fish won't bite,

208
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,030
just because the bait is not big enough.

209
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,590
Liang Hong,

210
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,470
there is no light in this world.

211
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,950
It turns out that n the eyes of others,

212
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,590
I am worthy of a price.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,910
Do not mind.

214
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,950
He doesn't understand you.

215
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,230
Are you so sure that I won't be tempted?

216
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,630
I am so mercenary.

217
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,390
I don't even believe in myself.

218
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,550
You're just used to

219
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,110
protecting yourself in this way.

220
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,870
In fact, you care sincerity more than anyone else.

221
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,950
What's wrong?

222
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,670
You go home and wait for me.

223
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,870
I...

224
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,350
Please come home, young master.

225
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,910
Don't let me see you following her again.

226
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,630
I have to come and invite you in person,

227
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,030
then you're willing to go back.
