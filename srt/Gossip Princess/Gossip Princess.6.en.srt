1
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,830
Let's make a bet.

2
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,950
If I can drink more wine than you,

3
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,310
this misunderstanding between me
and your brother is written off,

4
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,710
what do you think?

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,110
You,

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,110
how dare you want to make friends with us,

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,390
and want to write off what's happened between us?

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,950
I'll kill you right now.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,870
Stop.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,390
You?

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,190
You serious?

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,670
A man should do

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,830
as he said,

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,230
whoever can't keep a promise is not worthy to be called a man.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,710
Boss, boss,

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,550
pour more wine.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,830
Come on, boss.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,990
One more, one more,

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,590
keep it cool.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,430
Keep it cool,

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,110
keep it cool.

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,830
Come on, come on.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,590
Come on, boss.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,670
Keep it cool,

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,310
boss.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,470
Drink it, boss.

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,910
Come on, come on,

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,990
come on, boss.

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,030
Come on.

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,670
Come on, Mu,

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,950
are you happy?

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,510
Let me tell you,

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,710
I'm so happy right now.

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,790
So drink.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,110
I can't, I can't drink more.

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,750
Yes you can.

37
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,110
Great, Mu.

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,150
I need a rest, let's call it a stop.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,630
I won't talk to you anymore if you don't drink it.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,710
Shunzi,

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,270
you can't drink this,

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,750
you're under age,

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,550
go drink your milk.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,390
I'll play with you.

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,550
Drinking game words.

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,870
I can't even deal with you,

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,390
how am I gonna take down the whole mountain.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,830
Bro, stop crying.

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,630
I'm so pissed off.

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,270
Tomorrow, let's go take down ten mountains.

51
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,910
You do can drink a lot.

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,870
Of course,

53
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,630
I basically

54
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,710
fought my way out

55
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,310
with the ability of drinking

56
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,750
in my career.

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,830
I really don't think

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,150
you can drink anymore.

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,150
I feel much more better now.

60
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,150
Let's go

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,990
find a place to sleep.

62
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,670
That place.

63
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,430
You really know where to sleep.

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,630
That's for sure,

65
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,910
that rogue covet my beauty,

66
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,230
what if he tries to take advantage of me
in the middle of the night.

67
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,230
You can go up there, can't you?

68
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,670
I'm flying,

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,630
I'm really flying.

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,910
Shut your mouth.

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,030
I'm really flying,

72
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,870
you're awesome.

73
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,230
What a beautiful moon,

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,350
I feel so much cooler now the wind blows.

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,710
Come on.

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,070
Nice, Tony,

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,990
you're so thoughtful,

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,830
good.

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,670
Let's share.

80
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,430
I'm fine.

81
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,390
Do you remember anything.

82
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,190
No.

83
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,110
It hurts my head every time I tried to think.

84
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,670
How about this,

85
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,470
what can you feel?

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,070
Cicadas,

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,510
wind blowing,

88
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,750
and an owl.

89
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,310
Yes,

90
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,430
the wind is nice,

91
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,390
but I can't hear the owl.

92
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,790
Life is

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,470
just like this,

94
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,230
each one of us

95
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,430
has a different starting point,

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,430
then the different experiences,

97
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,750
we all live a different life.

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,550
Then at some point,

99
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,030
we're gonna get close to each other,

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,150
like you and me right now.

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,470
You can't remember

102
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,150
the past,

103
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,110
while I can't

104
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,710
go back to the place I come from.

105
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,990
It's so strange.

106
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,550
And we end up at this place.

107
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,430
I don't even know whether I can go home or not.

108
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,150
But it doesn't even matter now,

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,710
no one really cares about me after all.

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,590
I'll just take this

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,310
as a journey.

112
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,950
Living in the moment, and try to be as happy as I can.

113
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,270
I think both of us

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,950
can think of this in a different way.

115
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,590
Like you, though you lost all your memory,

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,830
it's because

117
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,830
what's gonna happen next in your life

118
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,430
is much more wonderful

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,430
than your previous life,

120
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,350
yet you can only remember not much,

121
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,750
so it needs to format,

122
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,990
what I mean is it needs to
delete all the useless things in your head,

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,710
am I right?

124
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,190
Oh my god, my head starting to hurt again.

125
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,470
I'm really getting old right now,

126
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,990
my head so hurts.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,310
It's all because you tried to be strong.

128
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,990
You're a girl,

129
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,950
yet you do things regardless of consequences.

130
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,870
But I need to solve the problem,

131
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,950
of course I need to pay my price.

132
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,550
So you got yourself into this situation.

133
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,070
Is it worth it?

134
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,630
We both at this

135
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,510
shabby place,

136
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,990
do you think it's kind of fellow suffering?

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,990
Yes, kind of.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,910
But don't worry,

139
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,990
before you can think of anything,

140
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,910
you go where I go,

141
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,590
and you're gonna have what I have.

142
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,030
I'll never leave you behind.

143
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,550
You're a good girl.

144
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,750
I know,

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,390
and I feel even better with you.

146
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,750
So this is so called a bandits' lair.

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,590
I've never

148
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,470
seen one before.

149
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,230
There's even a bridge,

150
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,510
quite stylish.

151
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,510
By the way, tony,

152
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,310
you're so good at fighting,

153
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,030
could you actually a bodyguard of the emperor?

154
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,910
So called The Man Bodyguard,

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,910
AKA the inner bodyguard.

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,550
You're not a storyteller, are you?

157
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,910
You talk so much.

158
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,430
Every time you open your mouth,

159
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,270
you're less cool.

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,430
Why do I feel this place is even more festive

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,950
than yesterday.

162
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,950
A little to the left,

163
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,510
is it okay?

164
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,230
Yes, and a little higher.

165
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,790
Here,

166
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,550
take it.

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,190
I'll take it away.

168
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,950
Alright,

169
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,150
it's good.

170
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,390
Hello, Madame.

171
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,750
Who are you?
