1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,510
Why haven't you come back all the time yet?

2
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,110
Failing in assassinating Changsha King,

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,070
there is no news of your death or survival,

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,750
do you know how worried I am?

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,230
But you are

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,790
following a crazy girl out there and having fun.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,910
She is the woman I cherish.

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,030
You're going to piss me off to death.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,990
Have you forgotten who you are?

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,870
You are the orphan of our prince,

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,070
carrying the cause of national restoration.

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,230
What can that woman give you?

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,030
How can she help you?

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,630
That's all.

15
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,510
I won't look into the previous matter.

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,190
Now there are spies in the organization.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,070
You know what to do.

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,030
I don't want to be involved in the organization anymore.

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,790
Do you know what you are saying?

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,790
I want to pass the checkpoints.

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,670
For that woman?

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,910
You don't want your life anymore.

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,630
Anyone who wants to leave the organization

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,670
can pass the checkpoints.

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,390
This is the rule you set.

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,590
No one can ever leave alive.

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,950
I have made up my mind.

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,710
This is a life-threatening checkpoint.

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,910
Please think twice, young master.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,590
Lady,

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,830
don't worry too much.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,150
It'll be fine.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,670
Did you find him?

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,510
Girls,

35
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,950
have you seen one

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,150
about this tall

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,470
in green clothes,

38
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,110
a handsome boy?

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,510
Never seen it.

40
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,510
Thanks.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,390
Young Lord.

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,510
Uncle,

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,630
I will definitely repay your kindness in raising me.

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,390
But from now on,

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,310
my life is no longer controlled by anyone.

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,150
Lord,

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,270
the young master has fainted.

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,230
Excuse me, bro.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,230
Have you seen one

50
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,390
about this tall

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,110
in green clothes,

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,670
a handsome boy?

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,510
No, no.

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:47,910
Thanks.

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,670
Never seen it.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,590
Liang Hong.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,230
This woman can't stay.

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,950
But...

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,470
Who is Liang Hong?

60
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,590
Who are you?

61
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,270
In broad daylight,

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,150
how dare you break into a private house?

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,750
Take all of them.

64
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,510
Yes.

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,030
You...

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,870
Stop.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,030
I am Liang Hong.

68
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,350
Let them go.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,350
Bring the princess back home.

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,510
When did this happen？

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,790
Just now.

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,190
Liang Hong's blood is not toxic.

73
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,230
What's the point of sending her to the palace?

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,070
It seems that they are desperate.

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,110
The young master has been preparing for a long time.

76
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,270
Nearly

77
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,590
our candidate for princess can be sent in now.

78
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,150
What a pity!

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,510
Go.

80
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,230
Let my people find out

81
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,670
to see that old fox

82
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,990
make any plans.

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,990
Yes.

84
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,910
Who are you guys?

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,710
What do you want to do?

86
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,270
I have itchy flesh.

87
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,950
What's this?

88
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,190
Please take medicine, princess.

89
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,350
What's this?

90
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,630
What did you give me to drink?

91
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,230
What are you doing?

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,510
Okay.

93
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,550
I wear it myself.

94
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,190
Turn back.

95
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,510
Girl,

96
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,270
I've been here for half a day,

97
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,270
but no one told me what was going on.

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:40,270
Girl,

99
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,630
I'm going to ask you something.

100
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,870
Look at me.

101
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,710
Girl,

102
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,110
girl, girl.

103
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,910
Are all the people in Changsha Palace deaf?

104
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,030
King of Changsha,

105
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,510
where are you?

106
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,830
I'm furious.

107
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,710
I've lost my voice from shouting.

108
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,710
I...

109
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,150
It's really big.

110
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,950
There is such a big back garden in the commercial center.

111
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,430
How much does it worth?

112
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,470
Presumptuous.

113
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,270
Who are you yelling at?

114
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,790
Do you know who I am?

115
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,270
Princess.

116
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,950
You dare to yell at me.

117
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,430
Do you think you are the King of Changsha?

118
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,510
I am the King of Changsha.

119
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,870
You don't take care of the princess.

120
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,750
Deserve to die.

121
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,190
His Highness, His Highness.

122
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,470
Please forgive us, His Highness.

123
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,270
His Highness,

124
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,110
the younger sister smashed what I, your concubine

125
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,270
carefully prepared for you as a birthday gift.

126
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,830
Death penalty can be avoided, but punishment cannot be escaped.

127
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,630
You are talking nonsense.

128
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,830
You obviously broke it yourself.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,910
You're so noisy.

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,790
Drag them out.

131
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,350
Beat to death.

132
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,030
His Highness, please spare my life.

133
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,150
His Highness. His Highness.

134
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,870
His Highness, please spare my life.

135
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,070
Keep your duty.
