1
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,159
Fifth sister, you're coming.

2
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,719
Thank you for your hard work, second sister.

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,599
Never mind it

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,959
Fifth sister, thank you for your hard work

5
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,959
Wish Your Highness health and fortune.

6
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,559
What makes you so happy?

7
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,759
The princess said

8
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,399
Let us serve with a smile

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,359
and love our life and work

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,199
Your Highness will be pleased to

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,639
see us in such a happy mood.

12
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,679
A happy mood is good for your recovery.

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,759
In the prince palace

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,719
Nothing

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,759
is more important than your health.

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,359
Dear Colleagues,

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,759
Good morning

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,759
Good, very good, excellent

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,519
Our target is

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,359
Wish Your Highness health and fortune.

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,959
Our slogan is

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,999
Go all out to do the best

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,159
Our service philosophy is

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,039
Smile more

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,559
Act Faster

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,279
Execute more decisive

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,519
Very good

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,759
She is quite bewitching.

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,439
The princess is generous and kind

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,079
to her servants

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,159
So she wins a wide popularity

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,879
Generous

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,639
Where did she get the money?

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,559
I just heard

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,359
The princess made arrangements

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,479
for some vacant shops.

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,959
which brings a lot of income to the prince palace

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,519
And give porridge to some poor people

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,879
In the name of Your Highness

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,159
Now the people are full of praise for you

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,359
And spontaneously go to the temple to pray for you

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,679
She told others about my illness?

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,359
Nope

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,119
The princess only said

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,919
As long as Your Highness is healthy

46
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,959
No one dares to invade our territory

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,159
The people can live and work in peace and contentment

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,719
That's all for the morning meeting.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,999
Pray for blessings?

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,999
He is just a warrior man

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,759
How does he learn how to offer bribes?

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,799
But Liang Hong

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,159
is very good at using public opinion to create momentum

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,999
Right

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,679
What the people said about the King of Changsha

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,599
is very different from before

57
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,319
I didn't misjudge her.

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,959
When I take the throne

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,359
She will definitely be able to help me

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,599
What a pity

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,639
Your Highness

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,879
How do you determine

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,999
the girl is the chosen one.

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,399
As far as I know

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,879
She doesn't know her birthday.

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,639
You don't know, Your Highness

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,959
The girl has an unknown identity

68
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,239
What identity?

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,679
Not long ago

70
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,679
Suddenly, a female devil who aims at

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,479
gathering Yang to replenish Yin at Luo Xia Town.

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,599
Many men were murdered

73
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,639
This person is Liang Hong

74
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,799
She suffers from a syndrome of extreme yin-cold

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,879
When it attacks

76
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,479
Only man's yang energy could suppress it.

77
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,479
The toxicity in your body is of yang nature.

78
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,479
If Liang Hong's blood is used as medicine

79
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,759
You will recover.

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,159
Really?

81
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,159
When will it attack?

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,039
It is during the sacrificial ceremony

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,679
The most yin time of this month

84
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,679
By then

85
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,839
I will pray to the gods

86
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,279
Pure her malice

87
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,079
Bloodletting for medicine

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,799
You are in repose, Your Highness

89
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,599
I prepared a bottle of Fengyoujing

90
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,719
This is a miracle cure for headaches

91
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,759
You can have a try

92
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:33,879
I

93
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,599
Your Highness

94
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,359
Please let me go.

95
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,239
I'm just a commoner

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,239
I really am not worthy of the Princess of Changsha

97
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,839
Such a distinguished status

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,959
You have done so many things since you come to the prince palace.

99
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,239
What's your purpose?

100
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,039
Your Highness

101
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,559
Come on

102
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,239
In the prince palace

103
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,799
You provide me meals and accomodation

104
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,639
Then I must try my best.

105
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,559
to do things for you.

106
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,879
My only purpose

107
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,639
is hope that you can recover soon, Your Highness.

108
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,839
And regaining strength

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,799
Cut the crap

110
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,239
What do you want?

111
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,399
Then I'll say it straight

112
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,239
Go ahead

113
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,239
I want the bead on your head

114
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,639
Fine

115
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,959
Really?

116
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,119
Thank you, Your Highness

117
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,519
Your Highness

118
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,839
I know you are of generosity and wise

119
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,239
at the first sight.

120
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,559
You may leave

121
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,799
And

122
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,239
There is one more small thing

123
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,279
Say it

124
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,839
Can I go back home?

125
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,759
That day you suddenly took me out of the house

126
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,839
My brother must be worried.

127
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,359
I want to go back and report my safety

128
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,959
I promise to return soon

129
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,879
Go ahead

130
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,319
Thank you, Your Highness

131
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,439
I'm back

132
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,039
You're back, young lady.

133
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,919
Are you okay?

134
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,519
I'm fine. I'm fine.

135
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,439
Any news from him?

136
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,639
You're back, sister

137
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,839
What happened?

138
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,599
How did you get hurt like this?

139
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,119
Seeing that my sister is safe and sound

140
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,719
I feel relieved.

141
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,999
Xiao Lian, tell me.

142
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,039
Zhao Wen

143
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,879
All of you get out

144
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,639
Don't come in without my order.

145
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,639
Besides

146
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,199
Go get the best doctor in town.

147
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,239
Right now!

148
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,919
Yes!

149
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,039
Xiao Lian

150
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,639
What is going on?

151
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,679
That day you were kidnapped

152
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,879
Zhao Wen and I were both very worried

153
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,199
Later I learned that you were in the prince palace of Changsha

154
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,479
Zhao Wen went to look for you

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,679
But he was not allowed to get in.

156
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,399
Zhao Wen got so anxious

157
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,399
that he conflicted with them

158
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,799
The guard beat him

159
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,879
These brutes

160
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,199
are so ruthless in their attacks.

161
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,839
You know Zhao Wen's personality

162
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,399
He went there every day

163
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,359
and returned being black and blue all over

164
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,999
But there was still no news about you.

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,359
Everyday?

166
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,479
Are you stupid?

167
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,399
We don't know if you're fine

168
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,959
and have no news about you

169
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,479
Zhao Wen couldn't sleep at night

170
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,679
Zhao Wen only hates he is so imcompetent

171
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,679
to protect my sister.

172
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,599
Poor kid

173
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,839
Why are you so stubborn?

174
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,239
What if you died?

175
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,199
Sister

176
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,199
Zhao Wen is stupid

177
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,279
I should have known that my sister is very smart.

178
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,159
You will definitely be able to turn misfortune into fortune

179
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,679
I made you so sad today.

180
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,679
It's my fault

181
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,479
Where is the doctor? Where is the doctor?

182
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,679
Why hasn't the doctor come yet?

183
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,079
How is him, doctor?

184
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,679
Don't worry, Princess.

185
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,079
No problem

186
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,479
Let me prescribe a prescription

187
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,479
and adjust for a period of time

188
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,479
He will be cured

189
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,719
Do you hear him?

190
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,359
The doctor wants you to take a rest.

191
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,679
There is one more thing I need your help.

192
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,559
Please help me take a look

193
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,599
What is the composition of this medicine residue?

194
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,279
Okay

195
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,839
These are all tonics that nourish the body.

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,879
No tricks

197
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,279
There's nothing wrong with that?

198
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,759
Nothing wrong

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,439
Thank you, sir.

200
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,079
Then go and prescribe the prescription.

201
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,439
Boss Song

202
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,079
I heard that you have news about Changfeng.

203
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,079
Do you know why you became the chosen princess?

204
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,439
I just want to know where Changfeng is

205
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,599
The blood of the Chosen Princess

206
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,799
Can cure the poison of the King of Changsha

207
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,759
The so-called Chosen Princess

208
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,839
is just an antidote plant grown in the prince palace.

209
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,679
They will slowly drain your blood

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,719
How could anyone believe this kind of bullshit?

211
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,839
These are all rumors

212
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,319
The person who spread this rumor

213
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,399
wants to kill the King of Changsha by your hand.

214
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,639
The person who planned this

215
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,039
is Xiao Changfeng's uncle
