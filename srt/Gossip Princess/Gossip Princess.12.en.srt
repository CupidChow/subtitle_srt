1
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,999
I'm so tired today.

2
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,799
You have no idea.

3
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,799
I demonstrated 800 times

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,399
to teach those girls catwalk.

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,399
Plus the lights and the choreography.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,839
And all kinds of stuffs.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,999
What’s wrong with you

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,879
I'm leaving.

9
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,759
Why don't you knock on the door?

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,359
Your face is so red.

11
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,879
You must have a fever.

12
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,479
What are you doing?

13
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,999
Physical cooling for you.

14
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,439
There's no medicine here.

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,879
What if the fever damages your brain?

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,119
Don't you know that men and women shouldn't touch?

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,639
Do you still care about that

18
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,639
at a time like this?

19
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,959
Am I an outsider?

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,199
I'm your sister.

21
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,439
A sister should take care of her brother.

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,639
Elder sister.

23
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,839
This way please.

24
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,199
Welcome, everyone.

25
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,639
To the T-stage show of our The Secret of the Upper Capital

26
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,239
Today's showcased attire is

27
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,919
designed by, er,

28
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,999
world-renowned masters.

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,799
And there is only one of each style.

30
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,159
The highest bidder wins.

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,359
Don't miss this opportunity.

32
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,359
So.

33
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,599
The Secret of the Upper Capital show.

34
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,439
Starts now!

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,159
Great.

36
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,319
This purple one is also nice.

37
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,839
Yu.

38
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,919
Miss

39
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,239
This, this and this one.

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,279
I want them all.

41
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,079
Miss.

42
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,559
These clothes are for auction.

43
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,479
The highest bidder wins.

44
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,319
Then I’m determined to win.

45
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,879
You have no idea

46
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,999
how lively it is outside today.

47
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,999
Why didn't you call me when you left?

48
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,159
Aren't you feeling unwell?

49
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,559
I thought you need more rest.

50
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,599
You must be tired today.

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,399
Do you need a break?

52
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,119
I'm fine.

53
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,159
The busier it is outside,

54
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,479
the happier I am.

55
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,719
To me,

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,919
it's all about the money.

57
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,159
Miss Liang's makeup design today is very...

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,359
Weird, isn't it?

59
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,719
Not very pretty yet.

60
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,799
People were here to buy clothes.

61
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,239
Not to see the beauties.

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,039
We just need to create

63
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,879
a unique atmosphere.

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,319
If we're welcoming guests,

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,519
Why only

66
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,399
why did we turn away Miss Zhao?

67
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,039
I knew she didn’t get along with Miss Gao,

68
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,999
so I intentionally didn’t invite her.

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,599
When selling clothes,

70
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,199
the key isn't how pretty the clothes are.

71
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,839
The key is that

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,279
some people can buy them,

73
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,799
while others can't even if they have money.

74
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,119
I just want them to know.

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,759
At our place.

76
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,719
Their clothes

77
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,319
represent more of their status.

78
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,759
That way,

79
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,119
people will flock to us.

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,159
Exactly, flock to us.

81
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,319
Of course.

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,319
I dared to do this because I have

83
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,399
Prince Song backing me.

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,399
Right, boss?

85
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,559
Boss, take care.

86
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,479
See?

87
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,479
People are just like this.

88
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,759
The harder something is to get,

89
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,279
the more they want it.

90
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,119
This is called human nature.

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,719
You might not be good at other things,

92
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,159
but you're so good at this.

93
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,839
You're good at compliments too.

94
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,159
I'm just telling the truth.

95
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,679
This is just the beginning.

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,999
Let's take advantage of Song Shilian's popularity

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,079
to attract customers first,

98
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,639
then we can open our own store.

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,199
Miss Liang.

100
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,119
It's time for you to show up.

101
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,879
Time for the star.

102
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,319
The boss is here.

103
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,919
Thank you for your hard work, boss.

104
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,319
I'm okay.

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,919
You're the one working hard.

106
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,319
Miss Liang is really talented.

107
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,079
The money we made today

108
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,719
equals what I earn in several months.

109
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,319
By the way,

110
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,079
am I famous now?

111
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,239
What's the word about me outside?

112
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,799
Some say

113
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,679
you're as elegant as a celestial being,

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,279
while others say

115
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,879
you're pretentious and not a good person.

116
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,239
It's a mix of good and bad.

117
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,359
However,

118
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,479
there are many people outside

119
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,559
who want to talk to you.

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,719
Oh my.

121
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
I forgot to make up an official history for myself.

122
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,359
What?

123
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,559
Nothing.

124
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,039
Listen.

125
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,559
Just go tell those people

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,839
I'm already fully booked today.

127
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,679
Let them come back another day.

128
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,599
Aren't you afraid of damaging your reputation?

129
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,799
No.

130
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,879
Scarcity makes things valuable.

131
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,799
Curiosity is the best publicity.

132
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,159
Everyone worked hard today.

133
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,359
Go back and rest.

134
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,399
I have another big thing to do.

135
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,479
Farewell.

136
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,519
I'll take you back.

137
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,439
No thanks.

138
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,719
Boss.

139
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,239
Everyone’s eyes are on you now.

140
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,319
If your fans find out,

141
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,399
our business could be ruined.

142
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,399
Another day.

143
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,479
Let’s celebrate another day.

144
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,719
Goodbye.

145
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,839
13, 14, 15

146
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,759
Is this your big task?

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,279
Of course.

148
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,399
What’s more important than counting money?

149
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,719
17, 18, 19, 20

150
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,039
Your ears are swollen.
