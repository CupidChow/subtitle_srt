1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,390
Changfeng,

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,870
you weak boy,

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,270
I said I'm gonna kill you.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,030
Don't be sad,

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,110
I don't belong here

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,790
anyway.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,470
Wait, don't cry,

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,430
I'm not dead yet.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,230
The story begins here with me.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,270
I'm Liang Hong,

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,790
embarrassed,

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,030
I'm a senior sales girl of a food company,

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,030
with an unfathomably capacity for alcohol

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,150
and

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,630
extremely cheeky character,

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,710
I kinda have created

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,310
a world of my own

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,910
in this field,

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,950
and then, I end up here.

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,030
Please have a draw.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,590
The star of Mike is the star of your life,

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,870
accompanied by the stars of romance
and Xian Chi bathing in the wedding star,

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,630
along with the help of the star of Tian Xi,

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,870
you're doomed to stick in bad romance,

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,270
at least five marriages in your life.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,790
What you mean is,

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,030
I at least going to have five husbands in my life?

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,310
Now the whole world is not so well in peace,

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,950
that devil girl around the cloudy mountain

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,710
still hasn't got caught.

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,470
Enjoy.

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,310
And now there's a man in black appeared.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,670
The devil girl?

34
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,310
You don't know about that?

35
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,190
This devil girl would gather Yang to replenish Yin,

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,750
she destroyed a lot of men.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,150
I just saw that with my own eyes,

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,750
there's a strong man,

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,510
with blood all over his body.

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,430
His flesh even got bitten off several pieces.

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,110
He didn't talk about me,

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,030
did he?

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,870
Where's this place?

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,430
Miss,

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,070
you dress weird,

46
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,470
but kinda has a different flavor.

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,270
Do something with me,

48
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,990
will you?

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,350
You wanna money or else?

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,270
You're so pretty,

51
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,830
of course I wanna something else.

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,430
All right.

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,950
All right? You're so straight forward.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,150
Come on.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,150
She loves doing the dirty deeds

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,830
in the broad daylight.

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,790
We'd better not to go to

58
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,710
that cloudy mountain in the future.

59
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,750
It seems that it's even more horrible
when men start talking nonsense.

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,030
I just lend his some clothes,

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,990
how does that make me a creepy devil girl?

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,670
And destroyed him?

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,430
He looks so ugly,

64
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,030
I can't even do that myself.

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,950
Where the hell am I?

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,670
The king of Chang Sha decides to choose his queen.

67
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,990
Regardless of where she's from or her age.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,230
The only requirement is virtuous and kind,

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,590
anyone who's interested,

70
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,790
please leave your name

71
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,950
and your birthday date.

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,550
Listen to me, come here.

73
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,910
I will work harder and eat less,

74
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,150
please. Just listen to me.

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,550
We can't even afford a meal at home.

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,390
Help me.

77
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,750
Doesn't be a princess a good thing?

78
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,630
Why is she crying?

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,990
This king of Chang Sha is the emperor's little brother.

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,550
He fights and wins a lot, very powerful.

81
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,870
But he's brutal,

82
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,310
killing without blinking.

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,830
It is said that,

84
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,430
that he eats human flesh.

85
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,030
He eats human flesh?

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,470
Really?

87
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,470
It is said that you have to see with your eyes
before believing.

88
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,070
Auntie,

89
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,070
you shouldn't slander others

90
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,150
if not see with your own eyes.

91
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,070
How dare you curse me?

92
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,630
No one should allow to see
something like eating human flesh.

93
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,030
You're a scholar for god's sake,

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,710
what's wrong with you?

95
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,590
I didn't curse anyone.

96
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,710
Even the flaws are exactly the same.

97
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,870
This is indeed a bead on my bracelet.

98
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,910
You own five love debts in your previous life.

99
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,950
If you are not going to pay for them in this life,

100
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,230
I'm afraid you might have a blood disaster.

101
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,590
Could this be the key of me returning home?

102
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,470
There are five beads in total.

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,710
Five, again?

104
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,990
Five husbands.

105
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,630
Miss, can I ask

106
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,750
why do you follow me?

107
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,510
Why do you stand up for that king of Chang Sha?

108
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,470
I didn't mean to stand up for him.

109
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,830
I just spread out this rumor,

110
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,750
but I do have proof.

111
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,870
So Miss,

112
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,670
what do you exactly want from me?

113
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,430
I wanna ask you about something.

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,870
What?

115
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,550
I wanna ask,

116
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,270
how many beads do you have?

117
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,390
Only this one.

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,470
Only this one?

119
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,430
So can you sale this to me?

120
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,190
This is a remain item of my deceased grandfather.

121
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,950
If you wanna something else,

122
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,990
I'll feel free to give you.

123
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,590
However,

124
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,350
my grandfather enjoin me specially before he die.

125
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,470
This can only pass down to my wife, not any girls.

126
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,150
So I can't just give it to anyone.

127
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,630
Pass down to your wife?

128
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,190
Good.

129
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,390
Others travel through time

130
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,590
to be a white-headed queen

131
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,070
or an empress.

132
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,390
But what about me? I have to collect beads.

133
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,830
So what can I do if I collect all of them?

134
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,230
Calling a magic dragon?

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,110
Xiao Zhao,

136
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,590
you have to help me.

137
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,630
Liang,

138
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,750
please wait me up.

139
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,590
I have no money

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,510
nor home right now.

141
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,590
And I heard that

142
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,470
there's a devil girl
who's gather Yang to replenish Yin around here.

143
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,030
Zhao,

144
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,030
I can't live

145
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,830
if you're not going to help me.

146
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,630
Liang,

147
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,270
what the hell are you talking about?

148
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,510
I'm not that kind of people
who just stand there and see others suffering.

149
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,510
You can live at my place,

150
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,670
make it your own,

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,470
enjoy yourself.

152
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,310
Zhao,

153
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,350
you're really a good man.

154
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,430
If I want to achieve my goal, I have to settle,
if I want to get my bead, I have to be close to him.

155
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,310
So from now on,

156
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,390
I'm going to be right in front of your eyes all the time.

157
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,870
You have to compromise someday.
