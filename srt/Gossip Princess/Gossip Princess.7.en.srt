1
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,199
Hello, sister-in-law.

2
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,599
What?

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,999
Hello, sister-in-law.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,799
Why get married?

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,279
Why?

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,159
Don't be shameless.

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,599
Our brother looks highly on you.

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,999
Thus he's willing to marry you.

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,599
OK then.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,079
He thinks highly of you too.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,119
Why don't you two get married?

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,279
I wish you happiness.

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,959
Can you speak human language?

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,999
Boss Mu。

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,199
Give me a quick word。

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,439
Why get married?

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,679
What did I do to you?

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,159
Don't tell me that

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,839
you fell in love with me at first sight.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,599
No more question.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,759
This is settled.

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,599
Stop!

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,599
Boss Mu.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,759
If you were a man,

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,439
just make it clear before you go.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,999
Long time ago.

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,319
I once said some harsh words in public.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,599
Who could drink more than I do,

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,319
I'd recognize that guy as my boss.

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,399
I'm not familiar with your business.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,439
But I still have this management experience.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,239
But after all, different trades vary so much.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,999
Nonsense!

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,599
As a man,

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,479
I can't recognize a woman as my boss?

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,159
I'll take a loss.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,919
Ill marry you.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,559
You can't decide that on your own!

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,439
I disagree.

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,679
Strongly disagree.

41
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,959
Do you have the final say in my Dawangzhai?

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
I might not be able to defeat you.

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,679
But if all of us fight together.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,639
I don't believe you can afford that.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,879
As for the worst result.

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,119
We can die together.

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,719
What do you mean by dying together?

48
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,839
There are so many people in your village.

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,479
It's clearly a case of using the majority to bully the minority.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,999
I'm not a gentleman.

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,439
I'm a bandit.

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,039
I don't have so much poverty.

53
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,599
Fine.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,759
Getting married, right?

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,599
I accept this loss.

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,039
Let's do it.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,359
It's not that I'm saying this,

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,399
but how come people from your generation get married

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,719
even more casually than we did in our time?

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,119
I've been single for more than 20 years.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,999
I've only been here a few days.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,399
I've been matched for marriage countless times.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,319
Are you really going to marry him?

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,679
Of course not.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,879
Boss Mu has one bead.

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,519
Exactly the same as this one.

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,239
You know?

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,799
Kill!

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,399
In the first.

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,079
My plan was to resolve the conflict first,

71
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,799
then the bead.

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,759
But I didn't expect that

73
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,839
he couldn't resist my beauty.

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,839
I can get you out.

75
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,599
What about the bead?

76
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,359
The guard outside is lax.

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,959
I can kill Boss Mu tonight

78
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,039
and get the bead back.

79
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,959
Why makes you keep talking about killing?

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,639
I am an educated person.

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,359
We must win people over with virtue and wisdom

82
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,039
Violence cannot solve fundamental problems.

83
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,879
Understand?

84
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,399
Go go go, leave.

85
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,759
Get out.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,159
Take a walk to get some fresh air.

87
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,839
The air is so nice.

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,999
No haze.

89
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,079
The traffic is also good.

90
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,599
There's no car.

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,839
Let me tell you.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,399
We should just go out more often.

93
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,159
Physical fitness.

94
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:02,319
I really want to live another 500 years.

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,119
Stop.

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,879
My throat is a bit tight.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,319
Hurry up.

98
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,719
Stop.

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,039
If you go forward, you will get out.

100
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,399
You dare to trick me.

101
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,239
Do you believe I'll kill you?

102
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,999
Well, I have to admit that

103
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,799
The gate is really impressive.

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,199
No wonder it's the face of the village.

105
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,319
You have no idea.

106
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,159
My big brother has set up guard posts

107
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,559
every mile around the mountain.

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,039
Do you think you can escape?

109
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,199
No way.

110
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,359
Then your big brother really looks up to...

111
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,639
...you.

112
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,119
What's the purpose of those crosses

113
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,919
you drew on the gate?

114
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,239
Quite regular.

115
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,039
I see.

116
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,079
Does it mean the number of people you killed?

117
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,239
My big brother drew those.

118
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,119
Your brother killed so many people?

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:24,999
No.

120
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,639
Big brother even got beaten by the old boss

121
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,919
because of these crosses.

122
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,559
You.

123
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,439
Why do you say everything?

124
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,199
Shut up.

125
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,239
Why did your big brother get beaten?

126
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,719
None of your business.

127
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,319
Your big brother is my fiancée.

128
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,279
What's wrong with me wanting to know him?

129
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,479
Shunzi.

130
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,439
Talk to our sister-in-law.

131
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,159
Why did your big brother get beaten?

132
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,199
When my big brother was learning to count

133
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,959
The teacher asked him to count the crosses on the wall.

134
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,759
Big brother always can't count.

135
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,799
The old boss was not happy.

136
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,719
Go, let's visit my fiancée.

137
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,359
You...

138
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,399
How could you say everything?

139
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,919
Mu.

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,999
What are you doing here?

141
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,799
Let's play a game.

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,519
Big Brother.

143
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,159
No.

144
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,719
You have too many tricks.

145
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,839
I'm afraid of being fooled.

146
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,159
Do you know how many crosses are there on the gate?

147
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,039
Who told you that?

148
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,479
I'd never know that a bandit leader

149
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,639
can't even count.

150
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,679
If the old boss knew this,

151
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,919
he'd be so disappointed.

152
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,119
What on earth are you going to do?

153
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,199
Tell me!

154
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,039
Let's make another bet.

155
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,439
If I win.

156
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,679
If I can count faster than you.

157
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,319
Then we'll cancel our engagement.

158
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,919
She got me drunk and I passed out.

159
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,759
Now she wants to compete counting with me.

160
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,519
What if I lose again?

161
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,319
Then how can I ever hold my head up

162
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,759
in front of my brothers again?

163
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,559
I don't have time to play with you.

164
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,559
Just stay in your room.

165
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,559
If you're afraid, forget it.

166
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,679
Who is scared?

167
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,319
The one who don't dare to compete.

168
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,159
When did I say I dare not compete?

169
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,239
Just do it!

170
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,319
I don't believe it.

171
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,079
I've been counting for so many years

172
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,439
and still can't beat you.

173
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,719
How about this, Mu.

174
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,079
Since I came up with this game.

175
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,319
For fairness.

176
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,679
You can find help.

177
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,119
You can go together.

178
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,719
Who do you think I am?

179
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,119
Together?

180
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,679
I can't afford to such an assault.

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,119
Junior bro.

182
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,999
You count the left side with Shunzi.

183
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,479
You guys follow me and count the right side

184
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,679
Well done, Mu.

185
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,479
Come on.
