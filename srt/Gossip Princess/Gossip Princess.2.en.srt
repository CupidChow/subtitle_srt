1
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,830
I don't have any money,
and I still live under someone else's roof.

2
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,630
This is not a long term plan.

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,510
So is it easy to find a job in ancient time?

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,870
Transferm.

5
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,350
What are you saying?

6
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,150
This is called transfer.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,470
You look like a learned man,

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,030
I didn't expect that you're a illiteracy.

9
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,470
You're a illiteracy,

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,430
you're a damn illiteracy.

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,390
Welcome.

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,950
The place is big enough,

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,310
but decoration is just so so,

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,870
furniture is okay,

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,230
but the sanitary conditions is so so.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,990
This area is not bad,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,390
but the flow of people is just okay.

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,510
Hey owner.

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,310
Sir, what do you want?

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,790
I want to eat,

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,030
bring me

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,030
all of your good dishes.

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,110
All right,

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,150
coming right up.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,150
Waiter.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,870
How do you feel, good?

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,870
The flavor is okay,

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,870
but the plating is not so good,

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,790
the portion is not bad,

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,070
but not so creative.

31
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,430
The speed of serving is okay,

32
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,710
but service is average.

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,950
No wonder you want to transfer this.

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,350
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,150
Anyone in the Luo Xia town knows that

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,630
we're a time-honored brand, a golden brand.

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,230
The reason I want to transfer this,

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,910
is because I want to try to do something else.

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,310
Please pay for your meal,

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,350
two taels of silver.

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,630
I don't have money.

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,030
You don't have money?
How dare you eat so much if you don't have any money?

43
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,390
I'm going to beat you up.

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,230
Hu,

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,910
calm down.

46
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,030
we can talk about this, shall we?

47
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,150
We have nothing to talk about,

48
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,710
you're gonna pay for this meal,

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,750
or I'll take you to the official,

50
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,190
come with me.

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,070
I can help you earn money.

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,110
Bullshit,

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,870
come with me.

54
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,630
Hu,

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,630
please think about it,

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,270
if I do help you out,

57
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,230
you can earn so much than this one meal,

58
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,710
and even if I failed,

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,910
you won't feel so bad

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,110
because you have already lost so much.

61
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,070
You can feel free to

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,430
send me to the officials by that time, can't you?

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,670
Is it that obvious I'm losing money?

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,670
You're on the edge of breaking out.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,470
You sure you can help me out?

66
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,110
After it's done,

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,030
I want thirty percent of the profits.

68
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,750
Today is our 50th anniversary

69
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,310
of the opening,

70
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,550
we have special dishes at thirty percent off.

71
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,390
The first pot of wine is free.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,070
Everyone, take a look at this coupon,

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,390

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,710
and free wine with this.

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,390

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,510
That's right.

78
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,870
Free wine for everybody?

79
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,910

drink all you like.

82
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,830
If you don't want to come inside, that's your problem.

83
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,550
And it's gonna be my fault if I don't treat others well.

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:52,830
Am I right?

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,630
Why don't you try?

86
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,110
Come and look.

87
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,910
Come on.

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,190
Two VIPs come inside.

89
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,990
The private room upstairs.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,310
Please, come inside.

91
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,630
This is our big opening day, drinks and dishes are all free.

92
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,430
Show me your coupon,

93
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,830
come inside, slowly, be careful.

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,750
Take care.

95
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,510
Are you having a good time?

96
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,190
It's good,

97
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,910
the taste is not bad.

98
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,590
Come again.

99
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:10,990
All right.

100
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,630
Come again.

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,270
Thank you so much, Liang.

102
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,070
I'll prepare a very good wine tonight,

103
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,150
I'll make sure you enjoy.

104
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,350
Hu,

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,990
thirty percent profits, we had a deal.

106
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,430
Thirty percent,

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,470
is it too much?

108
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,030
Give it to me.

109
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,230
I said I would make you earn money,

110
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,950
I won't lie to you, okay?

111
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,430
Yes, I know that.

112
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,990
So what about next?

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,310
Relax, Liang,

114
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,390
after it's done,

115
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,350
you're gonna get that thirty percent profits.

116
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,230
I'll give all of it to you.

117
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,150
I want shares now.

118
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,910
You little profiteer,

119
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,630
don't even try to frame me.

120
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,310
Lady,

121
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,030
you are?

122
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,990
Zhao,

123
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,510
we've been apart not long ago,

124
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,750
you don't recognize me?

125
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,270
You are,

126
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,190
bro Liang?

127
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,790
What are you talking about?

128
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,070
Look at me,

129
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,190
do I even look like a boy?

130
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,430
You blind or what?

131
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,150
Sorry, it's my fault.

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,430
Please forgive me.

133
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,670
Nonsense.

134
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,430
I'm a

135
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,430
tolerant person,

136
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,390
I'll forgive you.

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,270
Zhao,

138
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,070
you keep looking at me,

139
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,510
are you greedy for my beauty?

140
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,590
No, no, no,

141
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,070
I definitely don't intend to do that.

142
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,590
But you can do that.

143
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,310
Since it's no use talking about money with that little nerd.

144
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,070
I'll have use my trump card,

145
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,270
a sex trap.

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,350
Liang,

147
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,590
sorry for interrupt you

148
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,030
in the middle of the night.

149
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,590
Not at all,

150
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,590
come inside.

151
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,870
Come on.

152
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,070
Sit down.

153
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,470
What's wrong?

154
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,470
Miss,

155
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,670
the way you're sitting,

156
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,470
is not very lady-like.

157
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,710
All right, I get it.

158
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,870
It's all my fault for

159
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,350
not recognizing you're actually a girl.

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,510
However,

161
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,990
since that being the case,

162
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,630
how about we,

163
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,390
we,

164
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,470
How about what?

165
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,510
I've already written a letter to our clan leader.

166
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,630
I'll come to propose you marriage in a few days.

167
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,070
Marriage? It's so sudden.

168
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,830
Hey, make things clear for me before leaving.

169
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,310
Since you've already seen my body,

170
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,990
that means

171
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,630
we've already give each other our true self.

172
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,910
However, please don't worry,

173
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,110
I'm not a lady oligonucleotide righteousness,

174
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,430
so I will treat you well

175
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,710
no matter what happens in the future.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,070
I've just seen your upper body, that's all,

177
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,030
how is that make me have to marry you?

178
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,390
By your logic,

179
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,510
half of the men in the capital

180
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,910
are all gonna included in my harem.
