1
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,159
So all these injuries on you

2
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,759
are all because of me

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,119
So you traveled through time and space to get here

4
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,559
is because of me

5
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,759
So what should we do now?

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,959
Song Shilian wants to kill me

7
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,959
Your uncle wants to kill me

8
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,919
The King of Changsha also wants to kill me

9
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,759
How did I end up in such a mess?

10
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,759
Sorry

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,079
It's all my fault

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,399
Come on

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,959
The first day I came here

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,119
A fortune teller told me

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,599
I have five debts to pay off in my lifetime.

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,559
Maybe I'll lose my life.

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,919
My uncle has been planning for many years

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,439
He will never give up.

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,599
You have to get out of here quickly.

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,239
I don't care

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,679
I won't leave, anyway

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,319
If I leave

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,039
I'll never see you again

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,679
Can you bear to part with me?

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,119
I don't want you to go

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,279
I will try my best

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,719
To protect you

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,959
You don't need to be here

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,999
if you intend to kill me.

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,119
Let's make a deal

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,559
Talk like this?

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,559
I can convince my uncle

33
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,359
Send your people in.

34
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,759
I do not know what you're talking about

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,599
You originally wanted to use the matter of the Chosen Princess as an excuse

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,919
To kill the King of Changsha

37
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,999
And frame my uncle

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,559
So you killed my uncle's medicine man.

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,959
intended to send your people to the prince palace.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,359
To control me

41
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,319
Uncle sent Liang Hong to his house

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,759
which disrupted your plans

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,999
So you want to kill her.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,559
You are very smart

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,719
Since you all want to kill the King of Changsha

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,319
I can convince my uncle that you guys can cooperate.

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,079
We have different paths and cannot work together

48
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,119
Although the King of Changsha was poisoned

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,319
Not long to live

50
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,279
But can you wait?

51
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,359
What do you want?

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,599
I want your bead.

53
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,759
Send your people in and replace Liang Hong.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,919
We'll leave here right now

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,439
If you leave

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
How did the State Preceptor legitimately restore the previous dynasty?

57
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,159
I can give up the throne

58
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,759
Who will win or lose in the future

59
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,119
has nothing to do with me

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,039
What does this mean?

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,279
If you're done

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,639
I can abdicate to you

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,239
What you need

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,359
is just a legitimate reason

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,439
I can be the reason

66
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,239
For a woman

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,839
You can even give up your great cause now.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,039
It's your cause, not mine.

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,839
I don't need or care

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,079
You never asked me what I needed

71
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,679
Throne or kingdom

72
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,279
I don't care

73
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,759
Princess

74
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,959
Don't be sorry, Your Highness

75
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,959
This is her destiny.

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,719
Your Highness

77
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,919
The medicine is ready

78
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,119
Why didn't the State Preceptor deliver it himself?

79
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,759
The State Preceptor is tired tonight

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,039
He has already back home

81
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,719
Your Highness

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,959
Bring the State Preceptor here

83
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,199
Yes

84
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,519
This is the antidote that my uncle has already developed.

85
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,079
Why are you helping me?

86
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,479
Restoring the previous dynasty is an impossible task

87
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,839
It's just that my uncle is too obsessed

88
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,279
and refuse to recognize reality

89
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,559
The current emperor is incompetent

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,519
Song Shilian wants to replace him

91
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,239
But he is vicious and conceited

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,879
He won't be a good emperor.

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,279
With you

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,879
The prosperous times will be stable

95
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,359
The people will have a good life.

96
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,799
Have you heard of the bad temper of the King of Changsha?

97
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,279
I cured it.

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,079
Am I awesome?

99
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,039
Sure

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,999
Come

101
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,399
Today

102
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,399
We bid you farewell.

103
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,399
Sister

104
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,959
I haven't decided yet.

105
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,399
Do not be silly

106
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,919
Mr. Tang is such a great man.

107
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,879
You follow him

108
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,799
There will definitely be some benefit.

109
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,279
But

110
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,199
But I leave this time

111
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,399
I don't know when I can see you again.

112
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,399
Leaving is for a better encounter

113
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,039
We are a family

114
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,919
No matter how far you go

115
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,119
Our hearts will always be together

116
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,999
The air here is so fresh

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,999
Raindrops can float

118
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,959
When I was a child, I lived in my uncle's house

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,239
After every rain

120
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,319
There are always many stars in the sky

121
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,919
Those old people said

122
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,199
After died

123
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,799
People will become a star in the sky

124
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,239
Keep protecting his home

125
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,199
I don't know if my family

126
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,479
Has noticed that I have become a star?

127
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,759
I cannot come back anymore

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,239
They don't want you, but I want

129
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,359
This star is here

130
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,799
I walked through the darkness

131
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,439
Thought my life would be eternal night

132
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,799
Without light

133
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,839
It's you

134
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,999
Who split the darkness

135
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,999
Walk into my life

136
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,199
Let me see the light

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,559
Let my heart no longer be like stagnant water

138
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,839
Why are you so talkative today?

139
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,719
Because

140
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,919
I owe you a confession

141
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,199
You said before

142
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,519
In your country, people propose marriage with a ring

143
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,599
I don't know what your so-called ring looks like.

144
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,799
I can only rely on your descriptions

145
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,399
to make one for you

146
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,599
I hope you would like it

147
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,519
Heaven and earth as witness

148
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,959
I, Xiao Changfeng

149
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,599
will protect you all my life

150
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,599
And never leave you

151
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,599
Even there will be difficulties
