1
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,639
Liang Hong has already entered the Prince Palace

2
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,759
What about poison?

3
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,839
Arranged

4
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,239
Pay attention to dosage

5
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,159
Don't give yourself away

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,839
But Lord

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,719
We are poisoning him now

8
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,399
If the dosage is too small

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,799
I'm afraid it won't cause any effect to the King of Changsha.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,679
Now that Feng'er has feelings for her

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,039
If something happens to her

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,999
I'm afraid of hurting our friendship

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,919
Do as I say

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,559
I know my place

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,879
Yes

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,399
Lord

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,519
Should I stop acupuncturing the young master?

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,679
The doctor said

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,039
Long-term acupuncture to induce coma

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,999
may pose a risk of dementia.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,839
After the sacrificial ceremony

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,479
I'll wake him up, of course.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,519
You may leave

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,559
Yes

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,279
Changfeng, help

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,399
Changfeng

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:57,719
Changfeng, help

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,439
Changfeng

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,119
Please take medicine, princess

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,079
I am not sick

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,279
Why should I take medicine?

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,559
This is the tonic that the prince specially prepared for you.

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,039
His Highness ordered

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,239
Make sure you take medicine on time every day

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,039
I drink it myself

36
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,879
Princess

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,279
Ladies come to greet you

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,679
Who?

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,399
Welcome the princess into the Prince Palace

40
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,479
Greetings to the Princess

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,119
Ruolan gets late because I was helping His Highness

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,479
change his clothes

43
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,679
Please forgive me, Princess.

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,319
Why are you kneeling all the time?

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,839
The Princess is of virtue

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,879
You've been kneeling all the time

47
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,439
If it is seen by others

48
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,879
They may think the princess doesn't like us.

49
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,239
You may rise

50
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,639
Didn't you hear me?

51
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,900
Rise

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,239
She is claiming her sovereignty to me.

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,439
I'm not competing with you for your husband.

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,479
Fight!

55
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,679
Huancui

56
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,719
What did they call me just now?

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,639
Princess

58
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,919
Which of us has a higher status,

59
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,199
me or them?

60
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,439
The princess is the mistress of the house

61
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,479
Of course it's you.

62
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,839
Mistress of the House

63
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,479
I heard that the mistress of the house

64
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,279
has the power to sell or dispose of concubines, right?

65
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,319
The princess has just entered the Prince Palace

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,319
and sells concubines at will

67
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,839
If it is widespread

68
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,279
I'm afraid it will ruin the princess's virtuous reputation.

69
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,159
Virtue

70
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,159
Who told you that I am virtuous?

71
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,719
Kneel down

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,559
As for me

73
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,079
I am of bad reputation

74
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,159
As long as I have no virtue

75
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,199
You can't kidnap me

76
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,999
Of course

77
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,599
As a princess

78
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,999
I naturally should share His Highness's worries.

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,279
If you don't believe

80
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,399
You can write down your suicide note first.

81
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,999
Then you can screw yourself!

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,279
I dare not

83
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,799
Please calm down, Princess.

84
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,719
Xiao Er, Xiao Wu

85
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,039
None of your business.

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,439
You guys go back first

87
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,719
Yes

88
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,519
You seem to be the most favored, right?

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,439
His Highness has such a bad temper.

90
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,839
You can handle him.

91
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,559
It seems that you must have your own strengths.

92
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,119
After His Highness was injured

93
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,599
He gets moody

94
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,879
Only my singing voice

95
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,399
can calm him down

96
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,799
I have served His Highness for a long time.

97
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,799
If anything happens to me

98
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,879
His Highness won't let it go

99
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,119
I see

100
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,119
You can go back

101
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,759
What are you waiting for?

102
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,879
Leave

103
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,919
I'm so tired

104
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,839
How does he suddenly wake up?

105
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,639
I don't know either.

106
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,359
But I acupuncture him just now

107
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,119
Young Lord did not react at all

108
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,359
Normally, the young lord cannot wake up.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,639
You'd better be careful

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,799
Don't hurt the young lord's roots.

111
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,119
Yes

112
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,919
Well, then

113
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,319
Before the King of Changsha was injured

114
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,839
He is not that violent

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,279
According to my observation

116
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,999
When it was noisy

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,759
He'll have a splitting headache

118
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,039
If you say so

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,519
Huancui

120
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,119
Yes

121
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,119
Prepare the pen and ink

122
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,239
Yes

123
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,839
Coexistence, sharing and win-win cooperation

124
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,159
Girls

125
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,279
What is your common dream?

126
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,799
What was your original intention in coming to the Prince Palace?

127
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,399
That's right

128
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,639
His Highness's Favor

129
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,399
But how can I make all of you

130
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,879
win the favor of His Highness.

131
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,199
Huancui

132
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,079
Yes

133
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,639
I made a schedule.

134
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,639
This schedule

135
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,319
has encapsulated

136
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,239
all your strengths and advantages

137
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,879
I allocate your common resources

138
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,959
That is, His Highness

139
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,079
reasonably

140
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,999
On this table

141
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,519
You can see

142
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,679
Everyone will maximize your value

143
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,279
with regard to shared resources

144
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,399
within a specified time frame

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,839
But

146
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,039
Why has the frequency of my seeing His Highness decreased?

147
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,079
Lunch time

148
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,599
Why should I give it to second sister?

149
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,119
She is usually not favored by His Highness.

150
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,479
Ruolan, tell me

151
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,519
Compared with second sister

152
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,239
Who is better at cooking

153
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,239
That's not the key

154
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,039
The cooks will prepare meal for His Highness

155
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,719
Fine

156
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,319
Then tell me

157
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,959
How long have you not practiced a new song?

158
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,039
The reason why His Highness is more fond of you

159
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,679
It's because of your heavenly voice.

160
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,839
But if you don't learn and make progress

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,639
and sing those old songs over and over again.

162
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,199
Will His Highness get bored?

163
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,279
You have lunch with His Highness.

164
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,919
He won't look at you with admiration

165
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,319
But if you give this time to the second sister

166
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,159
Then you can use this time

167
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,479
To improve yourself

168
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,639
So, have you two reached

169
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,999
Win-win cooperation?

170
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,479
This

171
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,599
is to utilize your advantages

172
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,719
to maximize values

173
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,799
But

174
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,359
There is no princess on this schedule.

175
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,919
Princess, don't you see His Highness?

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,239
As a princess

177
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,679
My responsibility

178
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,479
is to maintain the harmony of the Prince Palace.

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,319
You can get along well with each other.

180
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,479
and take advantage

181
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,759
to make His Highness happy physically and mentally

182
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,959
His Highness will naturally reward me.

183
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,559
This is what is called giving and getting.

184
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,399
Understand?

185
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,799
The princess puts the overall situation first

186
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,039
and sacrifices yourself

187
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,199
How impressive it is!

188
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,919
I want you to remember

189
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,959
Symbiosis leads to coexistence

190
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,199
Coexistence requires sharing

191
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,199
Only sharing could reach to

192
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,239
Win-win cooperation

193
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,279
That's right

194
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,319
Is fate in the hands of His Highness?

195
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,640

We need to create our own destiny

Today is finally my turn to brainwash others
