1
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,319
Unexpectedly, she narrowly escaped the disaster by a fluke.

2
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,559
She's lucky.

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,959
But Childe

4
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,399
After this thing

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,359
I'm afraid it'll be hard to find another chance.

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,319
No worries

7
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,359
Someone will come to me naturally.

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,879
It's me

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,599
Changfeng

10
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,719
It's really you

11
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,479
I'm sorry

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,599
I'm late

13
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,599
Why did you come back so late?

14
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,479
You suddenly disappeared

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,199
without a trace

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,559
I'm so worried about you

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,319
It's all right now

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,799
It's not so serious

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,799
I do not care

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,599
But I care, I care

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,519
Don't cry

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,999
I miss you so much

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,599
The princess was too frightened and needed tonic

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,599
The princess said

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,799
Cook all the most precious medicinal supplements

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,199
in the prince palace

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,399
Five meals a day, and each meal should be different.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,199
The taste should be light and not greasy

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,799
But it can’t be tasteless and inedible

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,759
The dishes look ordinary

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,199
But can't reduce the taste

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,559
Are you clear?

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,519
It is well known that His Highness loves the princess

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,919
What the Princess orders

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,359
If there is a slight mistake

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,159
You'll be seriously punished

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,199
Yes

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,239
Do it right now!

39
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,119
Yes

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,999
Princess

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,119
Your instructions have been given.

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,999
Good

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,759
I need to take good care of myself these few days.

44
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,999
Without my order

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,119
No one is allowed to come near

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,559
Even one step inside, clear?

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,919
Keep an eye on them.

48
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,399
Yes

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,599
What a majestic princess

50
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,199
Of course

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,319
Who am I?

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,519
Let me tell you

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,199
If you come two days later

54
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,759
I would adapt to it.

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,199
I'm living a life of luxury every day.

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,559
Remember

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,599
I haven't made a move yet

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,519
The King of Changsha

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,199
has been infatuated with me and completely lost his head.

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,999
Haven't you heard the rumors?

61
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,119
The prince loves the princess

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,799
Everyone knows

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,799
So

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,839
If you dare to disappear again

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,719
I will seduce the King of Changsha

66
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,559
Then I betray you

67
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,119
to be a real princess

68
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,959
What did you say?

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,799
What would you do to me?

70
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,199
If you dare to disappear

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,399
I'll betray you

72
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,439
Not seen for a few days

73
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,399
You are quite arrogant.

74
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,719
How do you know arrogance is my nickname?

75
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,839
What can you do?

76
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,399
What do you think?

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,239
Be careful with medicine

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,439
Come on, Dalang, take the medicine

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,359
I can drink it myself

80
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,100
One

81
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,799
Two

82
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,580
Is it bitter?

83
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:34,999
No
Is it bitter?

84
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,580
No

85
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,359
I have a bowl of medicine too

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,799
Are you uncomfortable?

87
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,919
No, it's tonic.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,359
Since I came to the prince palace

89
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,359
I'll take one bowl a day

90
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,599
I asked the doctor when I got home.

91
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,719
It is okay.

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,399
Don't drink it

93
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,879
What's wrong?

94
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,959
It's not that simple.

95
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,519
I know

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,999
Your uncle wants to treat me as a pill

97
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,399
But why did he poison the King of Changsha?

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,639
What does this have to do with me?

99
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,479
Anyway

100
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,799
I won't let anything happen to you.

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,839
Don't worry about this for now.

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,799
From last night till now

103
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,559
Why did you disappear?

104
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,559
Why were you hurt?

105
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,159
You never mentioned for a word

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,479
After you regain your memory

107
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,959
Your life, your experience

108
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,519
You didn't tell me either.

109
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,599
Okay

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,999
These are your privacy.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,879
You don't tell me

112
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,039
I won't ask you

113
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,799
But now this is clearly my business

114
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,799
Why do you still want me to leave it alone?

115
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,439
According to your logic

116
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,519
You don't tell me about you

117
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,719
I won't tell you my affairs.

118
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,959
Then we'll each take care of our own business.

119
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,999
No one cares about anyone else.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,879
When did I ignore you?

121
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,159
You just ignored me.

122
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,519
Why are you unreasonable?

123
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,359
Who is being unreasonable?

124
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,319
It's you

125
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,119
You push me out of your world

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,519
as your will

127
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,039
What?

128
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,919
When did I push you?

129
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,159
Right now!

130
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,439
I'll go out and see if I can find any clues.

131
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,719
I feel uneasy if I can't find a reason

132
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,319
for you to take medicine

133
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,239
So when will you come back?

134
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,919
I'll be back soon.

135
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,159
Then can you promise me

136
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,719
Don't let yourself get hurt anymore.

137
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,519
Okay

138
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,759
You didn't say a word after you came back today

139
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,319
What does that mean?

140
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,559
You don't think I need to know

141
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,999
These herbs seem to be tonics

142
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,359
But if it is added to your food

143
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,359
It will cause toxicity

144
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,279
Why does your uncle want me to die?

145
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,279
I didn't offend him.

146
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,159
You always say

147
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,959
If you collect five beads, you can go home.

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,199
Where is your home?

149
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,599
I

150
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,959
This matter

151
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,559
It's a bit dreamy

152
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,519
And quite bizarre

153
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,319
How much do you want to know?

154
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,039
All

155
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,039
And you

156
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,959
I also promise

157
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,959
I tell you everything about me
