1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,830
Zhao Wen.

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,510
Why is it you?

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,670
Drink some water.

4
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,990
Do you want me to get you something to eat?

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,270
I had eaten this morning.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,110
I have not eaten anything yet.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,630
Haven't you eaten anything?

8
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,950
I'm hungry again.

9
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,830
It was me who lied to you.

10
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,510
You can beat me or scold me as you like.

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,750
To relieve anger, do as you like.

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,550
I can also return the bead to you.

13
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,190
I know that bead

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,750
means a lot to you.

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,350
You didn't mean to deceive me.

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,790
I've been looking for you these days.

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,590
I just want to confirm

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,990
whether you are safe.

19
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,950
It seems

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,470
Brother Liang takes good care of you.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,150
Seeing you are well,

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,270
I feel relieved.

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,270
Go.

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,670
I'll take you out to play.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,550
Boss Chen, you're busy.

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,110
Boss Liang, you're coming.

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,150
Pick out some clothes for him,

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,910
which are clean and fresh with good material.

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,190
Don't worry, leave it to me.

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,510
Go.

31
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,830
Miss Liang,

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,070
I feel like the clothes here are very expensive.

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,430
Don't spend money.

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,310
Oh, what are you afraid of?

35
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,110
My own place. Choose freely.

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,830
Please come here, childe.

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,710
For just a few days after we parted,

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,270
you have achieved such a success.

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,470
You know it.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,070
What should I do if I don't make money?

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,830
You're no longer the same as you used to be.

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,590
It is I, Zhao, who can't afford it.

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,550
Zhao Wen,

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,270
I have a question for you.

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,830
Do you like me?

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,390
You.

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,190
Why are you asking this suddenly?

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,350
You said you wanted to marry me,

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,670
because you feel responsible for me.

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,270
But two people are together.

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,390
The most important thing is to like each other.

52
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,510
Therefore,

53
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,190
You and Brother Liang...

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,110
Right.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,630
We like each other.

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,710
However,

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,830
marriage since ancient times

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,710
is all the parents' orders and the matchmaker's words.

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,190
The couple treat each other with respect.

60
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,590
What you said

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,790
is like a fairy love.

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,470
But love is naturally without reason.

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,870
Wait, until one day

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,350
you can't remember these great principles.

65
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,390
When you just meet a girl

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,430
and want to marry her home

67
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,430
to spend your lives together,

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,910
you will understand it.

69
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,750
Will I encounter it, too?

70
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,550
I believe you will definitely encounter it.

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,470
Oh, right.

72
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,270
Let's call each other brother and sister from now on.

73
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,150
Sister and brother.

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,830
I am older than you.

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,430
We are both here and we don't have any family.

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,550
So, later,

77
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,310
you are my brother.

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,630
We share happiness and I bear the hardship.

79
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,430
Eat an apple.

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,270
Next,

81
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,070
just study hard and prepare for the exam.

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,070
Tell your sister what you need,

83
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,830
and I'll buy them all for you.

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,590
There's actually nothing to buy.

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,430
Just the books in this house.

86
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,430
Girl, give me some food.

87
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,110
Go away.

88
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,510
Boss, give me some food.

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,110
Go away. Go away.

90
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,150
Delay my business.

91
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,030
Girl.

92
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,750
It is you.

93
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,910
Eat slowly.

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,430
Been to that place,

95
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,710
it's impossible to get back home.

96
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,310
Our parents all thought we were dead.

97
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,950
Some girls even took the initiative to go back.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,910
If we don't go to the street to beg for food.

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,830
Nowadays,

100
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,030
I don't know how to live.

101
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,310
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

102
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,110
Who is she?

103
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,150
Why did you bring a beggar back?

104
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,150
What's wrong?

105
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,030
I do not understand

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,070
since they actually didn't become prostitutes,

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,870
why their families still don't want them.

108
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,910
Since ancient times, people have considered women's chastity

109
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,070
surpassing everything.

110
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,430
How about you?

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,910
Will you look down on me?

112
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,590
Will you think I'm frivolous?

113
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,430
I won't.

114
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,550
In my eyes,

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,030
you are more important than anything else.

116
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,110
I want to help them.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,470
Greetings to my sister and brother-in-law.

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,350
Morning, Guye.

119
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,590
Brother-in-law.

120
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,230
Upper seat.

121
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,430
Morning, lady.

122
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,190
Xiaolian help you comb your hair.

123
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,910
Or I'll do it myself.

124
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,710
Do you think Xiaolian's hands are dirty?

125
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,670
I don't.

126
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,910
Xiaolian will pay attention to it later.

127
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,230
I won't touch your personal belongings anymore.

128
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,870
I just, I just...

129
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,070
I'm just not used to bothering others.

130
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,710
Okay, you go ahead, go ahead.

131
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,750
Sister, please take a seat.

132
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,550
You sit, too. You sit, too.

133
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,990
Sit.

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,790
Thanks.

135
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,190
I'm going out for a walk.

136
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,950
I...

137
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,310
Please take a seat.
