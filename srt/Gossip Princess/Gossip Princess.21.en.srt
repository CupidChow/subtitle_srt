1
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,359
The person who spread this rumor

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,359
wants to kill the King of Changsha by your hand.

3
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,479
The person who planned this

4
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,119
is Xiao Changfeng's uncle

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,119
What do you want to tell me?

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,359
Xiao Changfeng just disappeared

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
Then you became the chosen princess.

8
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,159
Don't you think these two things

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,759
are too much of a coincidence?

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,879
So you're not here to tell me about him.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,959
You are here to sow discord

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,479
Perhaps

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,559
Xiao Changfeng remembered more important people or things

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,079
I believe that even if he wanted to leave me

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,719
he wouldn't do it in this way.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,879
You trust him so much?

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,079
Should I trust you

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,239
instead of him?

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,119
Liang Hong

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,759
Why are you resisting me so much?

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,479
We are the same people.

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,959
He is a killer.

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,959
What can he give you?

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,279
I can give you everything

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,359
Let me go

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,559
He can give me sincerity

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,759
Can you?

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,759
Sincerity?

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,239
Yes

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,879
I didn't want to believe in sincerity.

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,959
It's Changfeng who

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,559
Protects me with his life

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,279
So I'm willing to believe him

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,679
believe in love

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,239
But what about you, Song Shilian?

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,359
Your love for me is just an exploit

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,519
You only love yourself

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,639
Liang Hong

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,079
Only I can help you now

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,279
Help me?

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,159
You want to help yourself, right?

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,239
You want to use me to fight against the King of Changsha?

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,759
So for me

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,479
What is the difference between you and the king of Changsha?

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,679
I can tell you right now

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,679
I will never choose you

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,879
It's exactly what I read in the book.

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,079
Exactly the same

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,159
Have some snacks first.

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,159
And you too.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,719
Sister

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,639
Young lady

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,359
I made a decision

54
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,279
You two get married right here.

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,159
Zhao Wen is smart and hardworking

56
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,519
He will definitely be able to pass the exam in the future.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,159
But me

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,959
I'm just a servant girl

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,959
who was sold to a brothel

60
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,039
I don't want to hinder his future.

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,319
Zhao Wen, what do you think?

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,439
Xiao Lian

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,159
I do not care

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,239
Don't look down on yourself.

65
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,559
Xiao Lian

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,879
You have to believe in yourself

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,639
You have your brilliance and excellence

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,919
And I hope

69
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,839
You can protect Zhao Wen's purity

70
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,679
Please drink tea, sister.

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,599
Great

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,839
Wishing you a long and happy marriage.

73
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,479
Sister drinking tea

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,359
I look forward to hearing the patter of tiny feet.

75
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,359
There is

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,239
some money I deposited with Boss Mu.

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,159
There are also shares in some shops

78
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,359
This is my wedding gift to you.

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,399
Well

80
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,759
That's your property

81
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,839
We can't receive it

82
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,319
I can make money on my own

83
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,919
Won't you support me

84
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,879
if you have money

85
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,039
As long as Xiao Lian and I have a penny to our name

86
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,919
we won't leave you behind.

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,999
I don't want you to be tortured

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,719
by life at the very beginning.

89
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,479
This is my gift to you,

90
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,839
wishing you a good starting point.

91
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,079
As long as you two live a good life

92
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,519
I am satisfied

93
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,119
You have shown Zhao Wen the favor of recognition

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,239
And you saved Xiao Lian

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,239
My mother passed away when I was young.

96
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,959
So I've been alone all the time

97
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,799
It is you who let Zhao Wen learns about

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,559
The meaning of family again

99
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,519
You try your best to make plans for me and my wife.

100
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,519
We must follow your teachings.

101
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,039
To have you

102
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,119
is the greatest blessing for Xiao Lian and I in our life.

103
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,079
Sister

104
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,879
Please accept my brother and sister-in-law's greetings

105
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,639
That's it.

106
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,679
Get up, get up.

107
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,359
To have you

108
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,879
is also the greatest blessing in my life.

109
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,239
There

110
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,839
Get started

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,479
Yes

112
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,719
I heard that she went crazy after being sent to the prince palace for a few days.

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,159
I guess she won't live long anymore

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,479
What the Chosen Princess

115
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,039
Just a short-lived ghost.

116
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,759
What about the bride?

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,479
So

118
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,599
You are alone now

119
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,279
Right?

120
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,999
Lord

121
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,239
Something happened to the princess

122
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,999
Your Highness

123
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,039
I heard that the princess was almost in danger today.

124
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,759
Do you know who did this, Your Highness?

125
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,959
I have a rough idea in my mind

126
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,079
Could it be that the news of the prince's poisoning

127
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,479
has leaked out?

128
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,839
If he really knew that I am a useless person now

129
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,399
He should have taken action earlier.

130
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,079
Why wait until today?

131
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,199
This ceremony is coming

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,799
You better be careful,

133
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,279
and ensure the Princess's safety, Your Highness.

134
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,879
This Liang Hong

135
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,039
She is indeed not an ordinary woman

136
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,479
Recently

137
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,679
I used the medicated oil she prepared for me.

138
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,639
I feel much better

139
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,079
If she was like an ordinary woman

140
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,879
How can she become the chosen one?

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,839
Poor blood

142
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,919
can't cure the remaining poison in the your body.

143
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,999
Is there any other way to cure my poison?

144
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,639
Your Highness

145
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,039
Are you feeling sympathetic?

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,879
She is the only one

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,679
who sincerely dedicate to me

148
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,079
And never count on rewards

149
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,399
Please think twice, Your Highness

150
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,239
Your health is related to the peace of the country

151
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,519
Please put the country first.

152
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,639
The princess is intelligent and virtuous

153
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,599
A perfect match for you

154
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,479
After coming the prince palace

155
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,879
Make the palace full of laughter

156
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,599
And you are in a good mood

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,079
Your complexion has improved a lot

158
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,879
But the State Preceptor is right

159
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,999
You should still put the country first, Your Majesty.

160
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,199
You don't know

161
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,999
How hard is my life?

162
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,759
That day

163
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,479
That arrow is so long.

164
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,879
Such a long arrow

165
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,919
Then it away from my head

166
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,999
Only a hair's length away from me

167
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,359
So close

168
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,439
Just a moment

169
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,799
Flying in front of you

170
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,999
Then it shot the carriage into a sieve.

171
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,159
Princess

172
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,759
Princess, how are you?

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,319
It's okay, no problem

174
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,199
I'm glad. I can drink

175
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,599
Be careful

176
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,399
The rain of arrows

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,999
And the fire

178
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,479
It's all over the sky

179
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,039
Densely scattered

180
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,719
Just like that meteor shower

181
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,919
That's so awesome!
