1
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,670
You've been acting really strange lately.

2
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,430
Say it .

3
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,550
What do you want me to do?

4
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,790
What?

5
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,470
Lack of money?

6
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,950
Are you?

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,270
Is this your attitude of asking for help?

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,910
Spoiled.

9
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,230
People in ancient times didn't need makeup.

10
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,910
Why is a grown man so hesitant when going out?

11
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,510
Really not bad.

12
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,670
Let's go.

13
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,110
Coming.

14
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,070
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

15
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,590
It's OK.

16
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,750
You're being too exaggerated.

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,670
How can you get into the fashion circle without being exaggerated?

18
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,910
Do you understand it or not?

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,470
Go.

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,190
Everyone,

21
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,230
let me introduce to you.

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,430
This is the Secret of the Upper Capital's

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,910
brand founder and designer

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,870
Liang Hong, Lady Liang.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,990
First of all,

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,110
thank you very much for coming.

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,590
The success of the Secret of the Upper Capital new products' show

28
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,470
can't make it without your supports,

29
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,790
especially Miss Gao.

30
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,790
Miss. Gao, as our

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,070
customer with the highest daily spending,

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,710
is entitled to

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,790
the priority to choose new products for the next season.

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,070
Secondly,

35
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,390
we will also regularly conduct

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,670
Fashion New Product Exchange.

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,470
In this way, we can communicate with each other about

38
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,870
dressing and experience.

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,310
I'm here.

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,190
You are Liang Hong.

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,950
Make yourself so mysterious.

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,470
I thought you had three heads and six arms.

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,190
With your beauty,

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,230
are you also worthy of staying beside Prince Song?

45
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,710
What Miss Zhao said is right.

46
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,310
I really don't deserve to be with Prince Song.

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,550
But Prince Song, he

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,430
is just my boss.

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,950
He scolded me today,

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,790
and said how I could have missed inviting Miss Zhao.

51
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,030
Really?

52
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,590
Prince Song said

53
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,790
you and Miss Gao

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,430
are all his good friends.

55
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,830
Ask me to take good care of.

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,430
I have always been close to Prince Song.

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,950
How can others compare?

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,510
Since you know you neglected me

59
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,070
How can I be compensated?

60
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,230
Compensate?

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,750
Naturally, the best clothes in your store,

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,150
bring out all of them to me.

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,190
I'm so sorry, Miss Zhao.

64
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,590
Our store's new models

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,270
are all customized

66
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,950
and have been already sold out.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,110
May as well next time.

68
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,390
There is no next time.

69
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,430
I tell you

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,590
if you can't satisfy me today,

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,070
I'll tear down your store.

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,830
If Miss Zhao wants to dismantle it, then go ahead.

73
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,190
Isn't this Prince Song?

74
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,630
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,630
It's fine.

76
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,870
I'm fine.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,910
Boss,

78
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,270
are you here to inspect the work?

79
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,830
Inspect work.

80
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,470
Miss Zhao wants to demolish this store,

81
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,710
then I will open a new one for her.

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,150
Miss Liang is my best friend.

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,590
What she wants to do

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,390
is what I will fully support.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,950
Please for my sake,

86
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,270
take care of her.

87
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,910
I really troubled Boss Song today.

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,190
But such a small matter,

89
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,870
I can solve it.

90
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,390
I know you can handle it.

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,070
I just want to solve it for you.

92
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,750
Thank you, Boss Song.

93
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,390
If there's nothing else,

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,630
I'll leave first.

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,990
That day, Miss Liang said to drink to celebrate,

96
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,910
but I didn't receive your inviting later.

97
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,750
Oh, look.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,510
I've been too busy these two days.

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,870
I was so busy that I forgot it.

100
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,670
I wonder when Miss Liang is free.

101
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,470
No problem.

102
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,670
I'm planning.

103
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,350
Let's pick an auspicious day.

104
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,190
I'll have a nice drink with Boss Song.

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,590
Then I will wait for good news.

106
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,670
You and I will drink and talk happily.

107
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,510
No business talk, only romance.

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,470
Then I'll go first.

109
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,870
So annoying.

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,630
He's going to destroy me.

111
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,110
I have offended all the women in this city.

112
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,870
How can I still do business?

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,830
You think too much.

114
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,590
Don't disbelieve it.

115
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,870
I doubt

116
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,510
I have offended some of my male customers.

117
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,030
When the little girls looked at him,

118
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,910
they 're just like looking up to an idol.

119
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,630
My foundation is not stable yet.

120
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,870
What should I do?

121
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,790
Oh, so annoying.

122
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,190
You said girls came out to quarrel.

123
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,190
What the hell was he doing there?

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,950
If this shit-stirring stick doesn't stir shit,

125
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,910
he doesn't deserve this name.

126
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,990
This is coming out of your mouth.

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,670
How come it is like that

128
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,230
vicious,

129
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,110
but

130
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,710
quite harmonious.

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,270
Just know it.

132
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,470
Take care in the future.

133
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,350
Childe,

134
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,670
for a wild girl with no foundation,

135
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,110
you have offended Miss Zhao.

136
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,470
Isn't it a bit worthless?

137
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,590
Her brother has just been promoted to the Third Rank Official,

138
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,630
who is gaining Grace.

139
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,470
I want someone who can help me with my great cause,

140
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,790
rather than just a slobbery straw bag.

141
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,790
Gaining your such protection,

142
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,870
Miss Liang must be so happy.

143
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,190
Unimportant.

144
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,470
I just want her to understand

145
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,590
if she wants to stay here,

146
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,070
she can rely only on me.

147
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,790
How is the selection of concubines going?

148
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,230
It's going well.

149
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,390
Smoothly?

150
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,150
How can it go smoothly?

151
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,230
It's my inability.

152
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,590
The Royal Highness wants to survive this disaster.

153
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,630
The key lies in a woman.

154
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,350
This woman has a strange fate.

155
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,830
She escapes from the Action of the Five Elements,

156
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,270
and is the chosen girl who comes to the world against time.

157
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,390
But this woman's identity is mysterious,

158
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,710
and is hard to find her roots.

159
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,110
The Royal Highness wants to find her.

160
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,430
It is no easy task.

161
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,030
Among the crowd, you need to

162
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,670
select the chosen one.

163
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,190
The work is very hard and tiring.

164
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,030
Give a good reward for your hard work.

165
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,070
Yes, sir.

166
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,150
I don't know this so-called chosen one

167
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,390
is a what kind of different woman.

168
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,070
I'm so heartbroken.

169
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,750
Well,

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,430
it's just a small broken yard.

171
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,430
Why is it so expensive?

172
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,830
How generous of you!

173
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,350
Then he mixed it up like this,

174
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,470
how can I survive in this industry?

175
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,310
I can't find any other way out.

176
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,030
Then we can only offer him first.

177
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,590
Well,

178
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,070
if my gift is too light,

179
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,390
It seems that I am not sincere.

180
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,390
What if my gift is too heavy?

181
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,150
According to his narcissistic personality,

182
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,110
what if he thinks I like him?

183
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,470
Do you know how long I thought about it,

184
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,990
and then came up with this idea?

185
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,390
As long as you are happy.

186
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,430
You.

187
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,910
You can't catch a wolf without sacrificing your child.

188
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,950
I paid this time,

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,750
and I must earn it back tenfold.

190
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,430
You find someone

191
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,670
to help me make a big door sign.

It says

193
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,710

194
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,670
