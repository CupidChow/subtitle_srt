1
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,910
I won't lose anything anyway,

2
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,350
I can just say yes for now.

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,950
Alright.

4
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,390
So if you have any need,

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,910
you can just tell me.

6
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,910
Alright.

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,230
I think you'd better just talk more normally,

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,030
I'm not really used to you being like this.

9
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,110
All right, of course I can.

10
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,630
Find her?

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,830
No.

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,830
Bring her to me, live or dead.

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,390
Chase her.

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,630
Money, money, I earn money,

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,550
I don't even know how to spend them, it's so much.

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,110
I'm holding a Nokia in my left hand

17
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,230
and Motorola in my right hand.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,030
Go that way,

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,070
go check that way.

20
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,750
Yes.

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,390
He's hurt so badly,

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,590
only a breath left,

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,270
It's not so easy

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,830
if you want to save him.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,470
Doctor,

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,070
his life is at stake,

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,070
so please, no matter what,

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,510
tell me

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,430
what is gonna cost?

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,110
Damn you, damn you,

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,230
why don't you have to save him?

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,390
Miss,

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,790
what are you looking at?

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,110
I'm looking at money.

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,670
Oh right,

36
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,310
you've indeed cost so much

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,110
in order to save his life.

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,030
You're totally right.

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,590
I've never thought myself that

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,950
I can be so kind of a person.

41
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,470
Miss, for a man you've even never seen before,

42
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,550
you can do so much for him,

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,710
I'm very respect for that.

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,630
It's my luck

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,110
for marrying a girl like you.

46
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,030
You're right, but not quite.

47
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,910
I've spent so much on you,

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,390
you're gonna pay me back with every penny of it

49
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,150
when you wake up.

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,830
However, he does look so cute,

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,990
these eyelashes

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,390
are even longer than mine.

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,750
If he can't pay me back my money,

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,670
it's not bad

55
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,510
if he dates me.

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,630
I should be more reserved.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,790
Oh forget it,

58
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,030
I'm beautiful now,

59
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,350
so whatever.

60
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,630
I'm so beautiful,

61
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,670
I'm so beautiful,

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,270
so beautiful, so beautiful.

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,150
When did you wake up?

64
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,910
Just now.

65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,590
Let me introduce myself first.

66
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,110
My name is Liang Hong.

67
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,670
I'm your life saver.

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,510
In order to save me,

69
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,510
I've spent a lot of money.

70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,310
However,

71
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,350
I'm a little tight these days myself,

72
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,150
and I don't see any valuable items

73
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,710
on you,

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,670
so how about this,

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,190
I'll now help you get in touch

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,870
with your family or friends,

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,110
and check out the bill too.

78
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,710
Hey, what's wrong?

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,830
Where's your home?

80
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,150
I don't remember.

81
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,510
Then what's your name?
You should at least remember that, right?

82
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,030
I don't remember.

83
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,510
What's going on here?

84
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,550
Has he lost his memory?

85
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,670
Wait, wait.

86
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,150
I'm traveling through time, and he lost his memory,

87
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,670
this is a TV show.

88
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,910
So I guess the next scene is,

89
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,670
a kiss?

90
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,990
Why don't you just rest here,

91
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,870
maybe you'll remember in a couple of days.

92
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,630
Okay.

93
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,230
I'll pour you some water.

94
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,230
Here.

95
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,990
He even looks cute when he drinks water,

96
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,830
oh my god.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,110
He's so cute.

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,270
What's wrong with me keeping him?

99
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,310
It's all good.

100
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,230
Hey.

101
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,030
Why don't I give you a name?

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,510
Okay.

103
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,270
So your surname

104
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,830
should be the same as mine, Liang.

105
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,630
As for

106
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,750
your first name,

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,270
Tony.

108
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,990
Yes, Tony Liang.

109
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,390
Do you know how to call me?

110
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,830
Liang Hong.

111
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,390
You should call me honey.

112
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,190
Honey.

113
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,070
Morning, Zhao.

114
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,390
You're reading?

115
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,870
What's wrong?

116
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,150
Miss Liang,

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,310
you dress pretty revealing.

118
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,870
It's no big deal.

119
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,910
The place where I am from,

120
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,350
girls dress are even more revealing than this.

121
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,470
Your hometown is indeed

122
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,190
a very unique place.

123
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,830
Where's Tony?

124
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,790
He should come outside and exercising.

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,630
It's good

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,390
for his recovery.

127
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,110
Quick.

128
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,750
Five, six, seven, eight.

129
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,590
One two three four, two two three four.

130
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,390
Three two three four, let's do it again.

131
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,990
Watch your face,

132
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,590
your expression, smile.

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,030
Why pulling a long face?

134
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,350
I'm your life saver,

135
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,790
do you even know about that?

136
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,670
Work harder.

137
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,070
You work out, right?

138
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,750
Miss Liang,

139
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,350
you're a woman, while he's a man,

140
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,270
it's not very appropriate

141
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,950
for you doing this.

142
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,070
I,

143
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,550
he needs medical attention,

144
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,110
so I'm only treating him.

145
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,710
And I do not think of anything inappropriate

146
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,350
when I'm treating.

147
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,510
I should go check the porridge.

148
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,270
You little nerd,

149
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,830
you're kinda nice.

150
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,670
This tea is cold,

151
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,950
you said you have a weak stomach, didn't you?

152
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,710
It's not good for your stomach.
