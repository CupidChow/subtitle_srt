1
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,310
You're still up.

2
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,230
Wait.

3
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,270
Can you sit with me for a while.

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,230
I'm so torn,

5
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,470
I feel so sorry to Zhao Wen.

6
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,990
I can't lie to him all his life,

7
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,830
so I choose to lie him for some time.

8
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,950
It's so hard.

9
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,150
Why do you want that bead so bad?

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,030
How do you know that?

11
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,510
You're so obvious.

12
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,030
That bead is the key of me returning home,

13
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,430
but Zhao Wen said that,

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,430
that bead only passes down to his wife.

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,430
So I just thought that I'll lie to him, and then,

16
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,070
but he's just so kind,

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,790
and his heart is so pure,

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,670
I'd rather just steal his bead

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,830
than keep lying to him now.

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,630
Every choice has it's price,

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,030
I guess it depends on what can you afford to lose.

22
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,670
Miss Liang,

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,230
you're up?

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,550
The clan leader is already in the front hall,

25
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,790
we should go to him now.

26
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,430
Stop.

27
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,430
Stop it, stop.

28
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,990
I thought you're in a hurry.

29
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,710
But this is too hurry.

30
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,390
I'm gonna die.

31
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,790
You're a patient,

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,310
while I'm a girl.

33
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,950
We should at least get some rest.

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,190
Stop it.

35
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,590
What a coincidence.

36
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,590
Shit,

37
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,750
it's him.

38
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,470
It's her.

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,350
You wanna money or else?

40
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,350
You look so pretty,

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,510
of course I want something else.

42
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,110
I was nearly

43
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,630
ruined by you.

44
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,310
Bros,

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,630
I want her alive.

46
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,710
Don't just stand there, run.

47
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,230
What's wrong with you at this critical moment?

48
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,190
Beat him. Beat him.

49
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,270
He's so cool,

50
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,270
I've thought he looks so weak,

51
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,070
but actually this strong.

52
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,190
Beat him.

53
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,870
Shunzi,

54
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,870
go get that girl.

55
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,590
Okay,

56
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,190
be careful of your back.

57
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,990
Don't near me.

58
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,510
Don't let her fall.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,750
I'll beat you to death.

60
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,390
Stay away from me.

61
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,150
Stay away,

62
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,470
stay away,

63
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,270
stay away from me.

64
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,110
Stay away from me.

65
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,390
Shunzi,

66
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,990
call our boss here.

67
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,110
Hey, bro,

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,230
I,

69
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,390
it's unfair that you're calling more people.

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,390
You, wait here,

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,750
you're all gonna be dead

72
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,150
when my boss is here.

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,150
Come on.

74
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,310
Come on.

75
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,470
Haha, my boss is here.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,390
Come on.

77
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,310
He's there.

78
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,510
Go kill them.

79
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,270
Stop, stop it.

80
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,630
There are so many of you,

81
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,150
I'm so scared.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,590
What's going on?

83
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,510
I surrender, I surrender.

84
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,350
I'm gonna pass out.

85
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,150
She's shocked by me?

86
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,390
I guess.

87
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,390
So why I've never shocked others before?

88
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,030
Boss,

89
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,710
you should be careful.

90
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,750
She's so foxy.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,990
That's the one,

92
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,870
take her.

93
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,630
What a luxury gate.

94
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,510
Hey boss,

95
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,590
your do have a simple yet stylish name for your village.

96
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,190
I guess

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,070
you should be a straightforward person.

98
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,070
Don't try to impress me,

99
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,230
you're so annoying,

100
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,070
it's piss me off.

101
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,670
Shut her mouth.

102
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,630
You're right,

103
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,230
she does so foxy.

104
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,030
Yes.

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,070
Shunzi,

106
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,470
keep an close eye on her.

107
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,550
Yes, boss.

108
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,310
Go.

109
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,790
What the hell are you trying to do?

110
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,070
Follow my lead.

111
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,710
Boss,

112
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,270
what should we do with this girl.

113
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,870
Take her to your room,

114
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,870
we'll deal with you when you cool down.

115
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,790
You can't beat me.

116
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,670
You've been tied, yet you're still so arrogant.

117
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,550
What exactly do you want to do?

118
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,150
Just do it now.

119
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,790
Quickly.

120
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,230
Let my brother go.

121
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,670
I can't open my eyes,

122
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,190
untie me.

123
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,710
Shunzi.

124
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,430
What's going on here? Why do you fight out of sudden.

125
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,550
Now let's get to the point.

126
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,470
Me and your brother,
there's indeed a misunderstanding between us.

127
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,990
Bullshit.

128
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,430
You picked on me first, didn't you?

129
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,310
That's bullshit,

130
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,510
his reputation has been ruined by you.

131
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,670
I'm his boss,

132
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,590
I have to help him.

133
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,950
It is said that better to
get rid of an enmity than keep it alive.

134
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,830
Bro,

135
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,190
just by looking at you, I know you're a great hero.

136
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,950
How about we

137
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,510
make friends with each other?

138
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,670
Bro,

139
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,430
like the old saying,

140
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,630
drinks can

141
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,310
solve anything,

142
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,950
how about this,

143
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,830
let's make a bet,

144
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,950
if I can drink more wine than you,

145
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,310
this misunderstanding between me
and your brother is written off,

146
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,270
what do you think?
