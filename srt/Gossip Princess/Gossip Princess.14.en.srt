1
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,910
Childe,

2
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,630
this place is so weird.

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,870
For safety,

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,750
let me accompany you in.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,510
You come.

6
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,350
I've been thinking

7
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,470
how I can

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,470
create a high-quality lunch

9
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,030
to repay you for helping me with my work.

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,670
I have a friend,

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,630
called Liang Chaowei.

12
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,190
He is someone very similar to you.

13
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,230
He,

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,710
because of work，

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,670
often needs to attend some important occasions.

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,350
But he is a person who likes to be alone,

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,550
and doesn't like being surrounded by those boring compliments.

18
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,750
What he needs

19
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,710
is a quiet place where he won't be disturbed.

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,630
He often goes to Prague Square to feed the pigeons.

21
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,110
Thus,

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,510
I made a simple version for you.

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,590
Why do you think

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,350
I like to be alone?

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,190
I have been living under someone else's roof since I was a child.

26
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,550
Live according to people's mood

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,670
is a skill I learned very early.

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,630
I can see

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,510
you have been catering to the world with a smile.

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,150
I know this is tiring.

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,150
So I hope to have a small courtyard like this.

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,270
I hope when you are upset,

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,350
you have a quiet time without being disturbed,

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,230
and you can be alone.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,550
Didn't you see

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,390
the way Song Shilian looked at me?

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,670
I almost thought he liked me.

38
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,950
He might just like you.

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,790
He can't possibly like me.

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,510
Why?

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,590
He acted just on the spur of the moment.

42
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,630
Men.

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,150
Quick impulse and faster come to sense.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,670
I'm already old.

45
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,950
Can I still believe this?

46
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,750
Who believes it is a fool.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,870
There were many stories in the past that love lasted a lifetime,

48
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,470
and love was unchangeable.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,110
I changed it to something you can understand.

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,750
A man and a woman

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,550
love for a lifetime.

52
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,030
I can still understand this level, okay?

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,470
I'm not mentally retarded.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,350
You explained it this way,

55
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,310
which is not very harmful but very insulting.

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,550
So you still don't believe it, right?

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,030
You don't believe a man

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,870
will fall in love with a woman for no reason,

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,990
and it will never change.

60
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,270
Why are you asking this?

61
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,790
You are lonely too, right?

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,750
You don't believe a man

63
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,590
will fall in love with a woman for no reason

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,790
and it will never change.

65
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,190
Chao Wei.

66
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,310
Disappeared?

67
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,190
Didn't I just grimace with displeasure?

68
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,870
As for running away from home?

69
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,030
Girl, you wake up.

70
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,910
How is everything?

71
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,230
Where is this?

72
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,110
Someone will come soon.

73
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,550
Don't raise your head.

74
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,670
Why?

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,910
This is a brothel.

76
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,070
Brothel!

77
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,710
What are these things you caught for me?

78
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,910
Still so old.

79
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,750
Deal with them quickly.

80
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,510
If they are not sold out, give them up in my hands.

81
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,630
You,

82
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,110
You are so right.

83
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,990
So why don't you just let me go?

84
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,430
After training, they are the same.

85
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,070
Don't come over here.

86
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,310
What are you going to do?

87
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,510
What are you doing?

88
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,630
I have money.

89
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,710
I can give you money.

90
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,990
My, my elder brother is Song Shilian.

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,070
We have something to discuss.

92
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,990
Can discuss it.

93
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,390
Wait, wait.

94
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,230
She is like this.

95
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,750
If we're gonna say she's a newcomer,

96
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,030
no one will believe it.

97
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,910
Yes, big sister.

98
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,310
No one believes it.

99
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,390
I have money.

100
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,630
I can give you money.

101
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,790
Do you know the Secret of the Upper Capital?

102
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,710
I run it.

103
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,790
Song Shilian is my brother.

104
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,070
If you let me go,

105
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,630
it's definitely better than selling me.

106
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,390
Yes.

107
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,070
Let's train her to be an old hand.

108
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,550
Just say we poached her from next door.

109
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,910
What do you mean? You come back.

110
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,830
What are you doing?

111
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,830
If you let me to get out,

112
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,710
I will definitely make your asshole place

113
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,950
razed to the ground.

114
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,830
I have trained so many people.

115
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,390
You're the only one who talks so much.

116
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,310
If I have a bad thing,

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,070
I will break your legs.

118
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,510
Help!

119
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,150
Chao Wei.

120
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,710
Save people first.

121
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,270
Go fast.

122
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,710
What are you still staying there for? Go away!

123
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,190
Go! Go!

124
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,870
Go!

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,830
Hurry up!

126
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,150
Why did you leave without saying anything?

127
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,430
Why didn't you even leave me a letter?

128
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,150
Why did you leave me alone?

129
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,750
Do you know

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,030
I almost died?

131
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,190
It's all your fault. It's all your fault.

132
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,190
Why did you leave me alone?

133
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,150
I couldn't find you.

134
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,230
I was scared to death.

135
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,710
I am afraid.

136
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,750
I was afraid I would never see you again.

137
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,430
Sorry. Sorry.

138
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,510
I came late.

139
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,910
Why did you come so late?

140
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,470
You scared me to death. You scared me to death.

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,830
This is where I used to live.

142
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,470
I wanted to clean up today and bring you here.

143
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,310
Therefore,

144
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,230
you regained your memory.

145
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,830
More or less.

146
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,950
This will be our home from now on.

147
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,830
How come?

148
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,950
How could she be poisoned?

149
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,870
Is there a traitor?

150
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,910
Moreover.

151
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,310
Say it.

152
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,350
Recently, it's been going viral outside

153
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,110
that the chosen one has appeared.

154
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,230
Check it for me.

155
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,910
Yes.

156
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,350
Wait.

157
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,710
Call him back.
