1
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,030
This tea is cold.

2
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,310
Didn't you say you have a bad stomach.

3
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,070
It's not good for it.

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,030
Have some more.

5
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,190
Thank you, Miss,

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,110
I'll remember your kindness.

7
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,550
Miss Liang.

8
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,710
What's wrong?

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,430
Say it.

10
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,750
Miss Liang,

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,310
I see

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,990
Tony Liang now can walking,

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,870
he was hurt so badly that day,

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,390
in my opinion,

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,790
he might not be a very normal person.

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,910
So?

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,510
If he's really suspicious,

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,070
I'm afraid that you'll be affected by him.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,310
How about we?

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,150
How about what?

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,710
How about we let him find his family.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,310
I'm not going to send him away,

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,870
he's so weak right now,

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,030
and he lost his memory,

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,390
where the hell is he gonna find his family?

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,630
I'm not afraid of affecting,

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,590
I'm all alone myself,

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,110
so whatever.

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,110
Zhao,

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,230
if you're really afraid of getting affect,

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,110
I'll go find some else to live tomorrow.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,150
I don't mean that,

33
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,110
you're a girl,

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,990
you're not afraid of anything,

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,510
how could I be?

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,950
It's just that,

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,390
I'm only getting a little worried that

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,350
you might be dragged down by him some day.

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,950
Please don't get me wrong.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,150
This is the little nerd that I know of.

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,230
What's there to worry?

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,070
I'll take down whatever coming at us.

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,190
Tony,

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,630
how do you feel? Getting better?

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,710
How can you dress like that?

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,190
What's wrong with it,

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,910
it's so comfortable.

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,910
Go change your clothes quickly.

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,310
If someone else sees you,

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,030
he's gonna think you're an,

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,070
an what?

52
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,270
An immoral slut.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,790
You shy?

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,030
I've never thought that

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,630
someone like you could be shy.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,790
You see,

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,190
since I'm your life saver,

58
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,430
so if this is only

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,230
between us,

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,910
no one is never gonna know about it.

61
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,110
Boss Liang.

62
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,110
Who is it?

63
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,790
It's me.

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,310
Oh my nose.

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,590
You should

66
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,350
knock.

67
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,550
Boss Liang,

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,110
I have something I need to talk to you.

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,350
All right.

70
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,150
That's what a big figure like,

71
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,590
always busy.

72
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,110
This clothes has so many layers,

73
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,390
it's so troublesome to wear.

74
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,670
I've never thought you could be so thoughtful.

75
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,070
What are you doing?

76
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,190
I am now a married woman,

77
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,150
don't even try to take advantage of me

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,230
while my husband is not at home.

79
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,950
Take care.

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,750
Thank you.

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,550
Have some more.

82
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,910
Waiter, come here.

83
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,590
Alright.

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,710
Cheers.

85
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,710
Suddenly she's Miss Liang,

86
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,590
I'm really not very used to it.

87
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,190
Now the business.

88
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,390
You sure this dish is only one in our restaurant?

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,910
Of course.

90
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,430
This is not only the unique one in here,

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,550
but everywhere.

92
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,150
By the way,

93
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,550
the first three days the information is getting out,

94
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,510
you have turn down all the bookings,

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,870
tell them it's already got full booked.

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,510
Why should we do that?

97
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,510
That's not your business,

98
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,390
just do as I said,

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,750
I'll make sure

100
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,510
you earn so much money.

101
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,950
Hu, I need to go now.

102
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,390
Hey, little one, are you okay?

103
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,230
I'm fine.

104
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,870
Where's his father?

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,150
Bao, are you alright?

106
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,070
Don't run away again.

107
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,590
You're his father?

108
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,790
It's so dangerous on the street,

109
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,350
how could you just let him running like that.

110
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,630
You're totally right, Miss.

111
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,750
I'm so sorry.

112
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,550
It's fine,

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,710
as long as the child is okay.

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,790
Is it appropriate?

115
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,790
Of course it is.

116
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,590
Don't run away again.

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,310
Look at my eggs, what do you think of them?

118
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,150
It's all fine.

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,710
You brought the four treasures of the literary.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,390
Zhao, what do you bring?

121
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,390
I'm back.

122
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,030
She's back,

123
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,870
she's back.

124
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,670
It's only a small matter,

125
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,670
you don't have to bring

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,150
a gift.

127
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,870
But Tony, take it.

128
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,790
So does that mean that

129
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,670
you're agreed to this marriage?

130
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,870
Why?

131
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,950
Why doesn't agree to me but him?

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,710
I saw it.

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,950
You're so cheeky, Wang.

134
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,310
You only saw her calves,

135
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,110
big deal,

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,230
I saw her thighs.

137
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,750
What are you talking about?

138
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,550
What's going on here?

139
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,910
I saw her more.

140
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,390
It's all your fault.

141
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,350
What do you mean by that?

142
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,150
You saved a child,

143
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,790
your skirt was blown up by the wind,

144
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,350
they saw your legs at that time.

145
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,550
And then?

146
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,950
You forget how did you get that engagement

147
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,990
with the little nerd to begin with?

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,590
I,

149
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,070
it's my fault.

150
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,510
They've all been married anyway,

151
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,150
so even if you agree to them,

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,670
you can only be a concubine.

153
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,510
What the hell?

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,590
Everyone,

155
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,790
listen to me,

156
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,350
this girl has long ago engaged to my son Zhao Wen,

157
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,670
so I'm here to propose today,

158
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,350
why don't you just go back?

159
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,710
So many men has seen her,

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,950
her reputation has already been ruined,

161
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,750
you're all

162
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,510
scholars,

163
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,710
she's just a slut, she doesn't deserve you fight over her.

164
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,150
Shut your mouth.

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,750
So you said you saw my thigh?

166
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,550
Alright,

167
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,550
now I'm gonna strip all of your clothes

168
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,670
and see your body.

169
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,230
What are you doing?

170
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,750
Don't do that, Miss.

171
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,950
You want me to be concubine, is that it?

172
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,750
Go,

173
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,870
all of you.

174
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,470
I can't believe her.

175
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,910
And you,

176
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,310
you call me a slut?

177
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,670
Is that it?

178
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,230
I'll go myself.

179
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,990
Is that it?

180
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,710
You talk pretty well just now,

181
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,630
why don't you keep talking?

182
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,230
How dare you do this to me?

183
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,550
If anyone dares to come again,

184
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,590
I swear I'll break his legs.

185
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,630
Pissed me off,

186
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,270
bunch of crazy.

187
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,790
Miss Liang,

188
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,150
eat something,

189
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,230
you should take care of your body.

190
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,950
I,

191
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,430
I get it,

192
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,190
don't worry,

193
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,790
I won't drag you down with me.

194
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,190
We now don't have that marriage engagement anymore.

195
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,190
Miss Liang,

196
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,030
I don't mean that.

197
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,230
Although you act a little weird,

198
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,270
but I can see that

199
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,790
you're an actually kind person with a pure heart.

200
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,830
Miss Liang,

201
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,350
since I've already promised to marry you,

202
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,030
I will not abandon you

203
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,830
when you're in need.

204
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,430
You're too kind, you're gonna suffer with this character.

205
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,190
You're still up.

206
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,110
Wait.
