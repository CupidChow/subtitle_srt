1
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,679
Understand your life

2
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,559
Smile at me all day

3
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,239
We've agreed

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,119
One wish for each person

5
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,039
No regrets

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,839
Come on, smile

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,759
Come on

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,959
Keep it

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,559
Good job

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,239
Great

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,239
Why is my man so handsome?

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,919
I can do it too

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,079
Come, let me show for you.

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,239
Be careful

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,759
Am I awesome?

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,279
How is it?

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,319
Don't run

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,359
Enjoy it

19
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,039
Isn't this grass?

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,359
Didn't you say you wanted to experience my life?

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,839
These two dishes are just a piece of cake

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,079
Is that all?

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,639
These are healthy light meals

24
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,759
Thank you for your hard work.

25
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,359
Today I will teach you something new

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,079
Come on, put here

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,479
Hands like this

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,759
You step on my foot

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,559
The rain has stopped

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,959
You know what

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,639
I like the smell of soil after rain very much

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,759
I feel very happy now

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,759
Me too

34
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,239
I have you and money

35
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,719
Without either of them, it's not perfect.

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,919
Do you know

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,559
Your behavior is similar to

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,959
that of a gold-digger in our culture.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,759
To put it more locally

40
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,959
means marrying into a woman's family

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,559
Then what

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,879
Then I will support you

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,959
I am responsible for earning money to support the family

44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,159
You are responsible for being beautiful

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,119
I agree

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,439
But you can't be too clingy to me.

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,839
I have to deal with business worth 1 billion yuan every day

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,319
You have to learn to get along with yourself

49
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,119
It was okay before

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,839
But now?

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,559
I don't seem to have this ability anymore

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,039
Oh well

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,639
Then I'll let you be clingy to me a little more.

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,279
Your Highness

55
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,239
Song Shilian's spies has been cleaned

56
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,079
In addition

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,999
We have secretly

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,719
Removed many forces of the Song family

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,559
The Song family is over.

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,519
The State Preceptor has not been found yet

61
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,119
He won't leave town.

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,959
Take him back

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,759
even if search the entire Upper Capital

64
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,759
Yes, Your Highness

65
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,519
You need to

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,719
take care Zhao Wen

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,159
I have already arranged

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,599
By the way

69
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,359
The emperor has sent someone to inquire about

70
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,159
how you are considering the matter of remarrying.

71
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,359
Seal this place up.

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,119
No one will live there anymore.

73
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,039
Yes

74
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,039
Childe

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,679
Their traces have been found

76
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,719
Xiao Changfeng! Liang Hong!

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,719
How dare you play tricks on me

78
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,559
Kill them

79
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,239
Big Brother

80
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,599
Lao Liang, why did you come just now?

81
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,919
Lao Mu

82
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,039
The carriage is ready

83
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,559
Hurry up and leave me behind

84
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,479
Lao Mu

85
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,479
I, Liang Hong, have a brother like you in my life.

86
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,479
It's all worth it!

87
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,279
Hurry up and leave

88
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
Don't delay me from going home to be with my wife.

89
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,039
Brothers

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,479
Lao Liang has done us a favor

91
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,679
Let us have wine, meat and wife

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,479
Someone wants to kill her today.

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,559
What should we do!

94
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,839
Kill, kill, kill

95
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,079
kill

96
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,519
Go back

97
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,479
Back to where you belong

98
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,239
No, I won't leave

99
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,719
Changfeng, Changfeng

100
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,279
Stop fighting

101
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,439
Stop fighting.

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,199
Don't fight anymore.

103
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,079
Toy boy

104
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,519
I said I would kill you

105
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,719
Don't be sad

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,799
Anyway

107
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,479
I don't belong here.

108
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,639
Next Life

109
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,879
You find me first, okay?

110
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,279
Girls Girls

111
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,399
Wake up, wake up, wake up

112
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,039
Finally woke up

113
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,999
Are you alright, girl?

114
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,439
Drink some water

115
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,519
Drink some water. Drink some water

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,119
We saw you faint here.

117
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,599
Crying and laughing

118
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,679
We can't wake you up.

119
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,439
How dangerous!

120
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,519
This signal is not good either.

121
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,159
We call the ambulance

122
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,399
But it can't get here.

123
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,519
We're so worried

124
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,519
Right

125
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,199
Listen

126
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,799
You have to take care of your body

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,279
when you go outside

128
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,519
Why are you crying?

129
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,919
Okay, okay, it's okay.

130
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,839
Let's go.

131
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,719
Please follow closely, everybody

132
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,479
This yard and this wooden house

133
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,199
you see

134
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,439
are our last scenic spot today.

135
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,719
This wooden house has a history of hundreds of years.

136
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,519
I'll take you in later.

137
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,119
Take a look inside the house

138
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,079
Watch your steps, everybody.

139
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,719
It will be slippery

140
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,319
Get closer to me

141
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,919
You can hear more explanations

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,919
So you traveled through time and space to come here

143
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,439
Is because of me

144
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,559
You don't trust a man

145
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,519
would fall in love with a woman for no reason

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,479
And it will never change

147
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,439
If this person is me

148
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,879
Are you willing to believe?

149
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,119
In my eyes

150
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,639
You are more important than anything else

151
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,039
I will try my best

152
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,079
To protect you

153
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,919
I, Xiao Changfeng

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,679
I will protect you all my life

155
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,719
Never give up in this life

156
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,719
And never leave you

157
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,519
Changfeng

158
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,679
This dream

159
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,959
It's all worth it

160
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,519
Is this your bead?

161
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,599
Come on, everybody

162
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,039
Go this way.

163
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,479
Follow closely behind

164
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,839
Watch your step.

165
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,559
It's slippery

166
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,879
Don't fall down.
