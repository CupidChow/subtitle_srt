1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it the heat that will last only in the wind and clouds?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are the warmth that is engraved in my heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Memories have been struggling because of you

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't forget your eyes

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can't escape this love

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can't forget the love that is engraved in my heart

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Love by Hypnotic

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Your Majesty

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Your Majesty, you finally arrived at the Heart-pumping Abyss

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Did you have a good journey?

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Fu Yue, you came to pick me up, right?

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Your Majesty can't recognize me after a long time?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Fu Yue, you've become different after you've been inquiring about the news in the Heart-pumping Abyss

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Have I become like an ordinary fairy?

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If I have the power of the Su Lake, if I change a few more things, Your Majesty won't recognize me

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Who can recognize me when Fu Yue is so powerful?

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
By the way, Your Majesty's identity is not convenient

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Fu Yue found a place suitable for practicing the Thousand-Way Tree for Your Majesty

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Really?

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Take me there

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There are many blue butterflies there

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They can help Your Majesty to increase your power

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sometimes I really envy these free butterflies

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They can fly wherever they want

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then wherever Your Majesty flies, I will follow you

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Where did Your Majesty go? Why are you back so late?

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I went to deliver medicine to Mingyi

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I knew it

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yesterday, the fairy of the Flower Moon Night went to the wedding of Ming Yu and Boca

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You must know it, right?

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why didn't you tell me?

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't want to hurt Your Majesty

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm sorry

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't want to hurt Your Majesty

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Mingyi fell in love with Li Hentian

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Li Hentian?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I have to save him

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I must save him

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Fu Yue, help me

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Your Majesty, do you understand that you have no spiritual veins?

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's why your father kept interviewing you

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and you were bullied by your brother

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You have always been the fighter in the Qingyun Conference

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's your dream

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But to realize your dream, you must have a spiritual vein

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So I went to the Ji Xingyuan with you to find the dream of the Yellow Bracelet

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Now you tell me that you want to save a woman

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She means you have to give up the dream of the Yellow Bracelet to help her

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But I wanted to be a fighter because of her

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I was born without a spiritual vein

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I was bullied

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I was bullied

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Until she appeared

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I won the only one in my life

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why do you take Ming Xian's sleeve?

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You want to fight in the Qingyun Conference like her

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Do you know that Ming Xian is a god of war with a natural spiritual vein?

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You want to have a dream like her?

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm tired, let's go

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Go

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
She made me have hope for the future

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I want to be the Fight King

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like her

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Unfortunately, fate made her fall into the abyss

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
For me, the dream is because of her

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can give up because of her

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Her life is more important than mine

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And Fuyue, do you know that Mingyi must be with the Yellow Bracelet for the dream of the Yellow Bracelet

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Their wedding is just a play

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There must be nothing between them

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But Ming Xian, will he care about what's between him and the Yellow Bracelet?

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He won't mind if he doesn't achieve his goal

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You go back

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll go back

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Lord said that you were loyal and grateful to Mingyi

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But now, you are just like that

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You are just like that

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You are just like that

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You are just like that

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You are just like that

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You are just like that

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You are just like that

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You are just like that

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Lord

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What's up?

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You just got married

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You are getting married and I am getting old

96
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You were hurt last night

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think you should take it

98
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I am getting old?

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's the wedding day, the stars are coming out soon

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Lord

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The wedding of the Yellow Bracelet is to find the auspicious day and the auspicious place first

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then make a wish to the stars and stay together forever

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If the stars are coming out, you will be very lucky

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Then, under the witness of the Yellow Bracelet, you will be named in the marriage ceremony

105
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a fake wedding

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Lord will divorce Mingyi, right?

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why are you so impolite?

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Lord, although it's a divorce

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Even if it's in the seven heavens

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's better to fail

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can see that Mingyi is sincere to Lord

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's rare to be sincere

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Those people outside seem to be loyal to Lord

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
In fact, they either want to steal money or use Lord

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He has some evil intentions

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I never steal the Yellow Bracelet

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Besides, the true heart

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is the true heart something that is very rare?

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Of course it's rare

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There are so many people in the six realms

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's just that you and I, Mingyi, are sincere to Lord

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Can we still spend the rest of our lives with Lord?

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why not? Of course I want to spend the rest of my life with Lord

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're such a silly dragon, you're talking nonsense

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Lord was killed by those evil people in the Chenyuan

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's been 21 years

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I've been waiting for you for 21 years

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The Chenyuan people have been killed by those evil people for 21 years

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, you have to revenge for your master

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But people can't just revenge

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Mingyi can share the pain with the Lord

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The Lord should hold this happiness by hand

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Grandma Xun

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Can't the three of us share the pain together?

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Is this a matter?

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why not?

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Aren't we happy together?

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Can this happiness be the same as that happiness?

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do you have a brain?

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Happiness is the same as happiness

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I think the three of us are very happy

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Did you two find out that

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Since Mingyi came

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You two seem to have changed

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't talk about us

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Lord, give me a word

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Is this marriage still valid?

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I think

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Look

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The ghost appears

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Good sign

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Good sign

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It must be the ghost blessing the Lord

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Lord, go make a wish with Mingyi

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Grandma Xun

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Make a wish is such a childish thing

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Do you think the Lord will do it?

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Right?

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Of course

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Too childish

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I think the ghost is very childish

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Of course

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Too childish

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
How childish is Xu Yuan?

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Xu Yuan is very childish

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You are childish

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Childish people eat leeks

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't eat leeks

169
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm not childish

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm going to add some leeks to you

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because you are very childish

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't eat leeks

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I tell you

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Childish people eat leeks

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I only eat oysters

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You eat more

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Grandma Xun

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You are old

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why are you so childish?

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Why does the Lord suddenly think of

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Bring me to the wedding dresser

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Since it's a wedding

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There should be a wedding dresser

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I have to buy you some gifts

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Have you seen it?

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Pack it all

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No need

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
All

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
it is good

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Good powder

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Take a look in person

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I haven't seen powder before

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Is this done?

195
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No need

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No need

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No need

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Take all the colors

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
it is good

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No need

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Needed

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Fresh flowers

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Take care

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Flowers of all kinds

206
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Two

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Take a look

208
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
All

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No need

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Put

211
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No need

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No need

213
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No need

214
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Fairy Mingyi, right?

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Fairy Mingyi was born on the night of the full moon

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Now fighting with the fight

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The fairy king still loves you so much

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
With you

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The things that you bought

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I bought it all

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The story in your fairy tale

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I've spread it all

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You see

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We all worshiped your portrait

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm so happy

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm so happy

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm so happy

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm so happy

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm so happy

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm so happy

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm so happy

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm so happy

233
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm so happy

234
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm so happy

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I worshiped your portrait

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So I'm hoping for

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:18,160
a

238
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,200
Make a pile

239
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,400
You're using me to get married and act.

240
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,360
So you feel guilty.

241
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,880
That's why you're so nice to me.

242
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,160
I'm nice to you

243
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,080
because I feel guilty?

244
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,800
It's your first time to date a fairy, right?

245
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,560
You don't even know how to help me carry things.

246
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,880
It's time to borrow your hands

248
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,320
to help me with my thoughts.

249
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,080
I just thought of it.

250
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,120
We bought this little box.

251
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,160
You said so many things.

252
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,520
If we put things in one by one

253
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,720
with our spiritual power,

254
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,280
we won't have to use our hands.

255
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,120
It should work.

256
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,280
Try it.

257
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,280
It's so amazing, sir.

258
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,040
There's a money pocket in this bag.

259
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
Let's call it the money pocket bag.

260
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,440
Let me see.

261
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,240
It's really here.

262
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,920
A hairpin.

263
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,960
A dagger.

264
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,840
Do you think this hairpin and dagger

265
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,640
can be combined?

266
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,000
Let's compare them.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,720
Let's see.

268
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,440
Let's see.

269
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,160
Let's see.

270
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,840
Let's see.

271
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,800
It's a one-of-a-kind.

272
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,560
I usually wear it as a hairpin.

273
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,520
When something happens,

274
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,720
I can use it as a dagger to protect myself.

275
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,800
You think I can't protect you?

276
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,600
No.

277
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,960
If you're not here,

278
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,280
what if I'm in danger?

279
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,560
Help me.

280
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,840
I really want one.

281
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,080
Give me a change.

282
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,200
Okay.

283
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,840
It's so amazing, sir.

284
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,040
Thank you.

285
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,560
Well.

286
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
Let's call it the money pocket bag.

287
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,400
I usually wear it as a hairpin.

288
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,360
Well.

289
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,840
Give me another one.

290
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,720
I want to see it.

291
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,320
Come on.

292
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,360
Give me another one.

293
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,320
It's unnecessary.

294
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,520
I really want to see it.

295
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,800
Give me a change.

296
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,760
A change.

297
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,360
No.

298
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The money pocket bag and the money pocket bag.

299
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,640
I can do it since I was a kid.

300
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,040
Now I have to help you do it

301
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,120
to use these hairpins with justice.

302
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,200
Okay.

303
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,600
The money pocket bag and the money pocket bag.

304
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,880
So many changes.

305
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,400
You're amazing.

306
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,240
You can make a hairpin with a hairpin.

307
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,960
This is a hairpin.

308
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,120
It's not fragile.

309
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,920
I don't need it.

310
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,240
Thank you, sir.

311
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,600
Let me give it to you.

312
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,640
Thank you.

313
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,880
I have decided.

314
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,840
From now on,

315
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,840
I need to check a lot of things

316
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,600
and face them together.

317
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,640
If...

318
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,840
What... What do you mean?

319
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,240
I have something to do.

320
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,440
I'll leave now.

321
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,160
Zhen...

322
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,320
Yeah.

323
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,760
Er Qi,

324
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
I'll go and see...

325
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,560
Yao Guoshan.

326
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,480
What aired you

327
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,280
trying to fake已經,

328
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,680
finally,

329
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
ning Wuxian.

330
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,720
You...

331
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,520
Wh algorithm you used

332
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,400
has been escaped from the trial.

333
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,320
Your plan

334
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,760
is hard to predict,

335
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,800
but

336
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
I'm in the room.

337
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,720
You're not a fairy?

338
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,720
Master,

339
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,280
look carefully.

340
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm a fairy.

341
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,520
How could I be a fairy?

342
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,000
You're not a fairy.

343
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm a fairy.

344
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,240
I know you're a fairy.

345
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,680
Why did you...

346
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
All these years,

347
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,560
you've been using

348
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,840
a broken secret

349
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,560
to cover up your goddess.

350
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,720
You think I don't know?

351
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,280
You said you wouldn't hit me.

352
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
I wouldn't hit you?

353
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,440
I hit you on the head.

354
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,680
Stop!

355
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,640
You've been

356
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,480
ignoring me for a while.

357
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,960
You don't know me.

358
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,040
You don't know me.

359
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,000
You don't know me.

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,040
You don't know me.

361
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,160
You don't know me.

362
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,200
You don't know me.

363
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
You brat.

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,760
I'll beat you.

365
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,120
Don't hit me.

366
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,560
I didn't hit you. Why are you yelling?

367
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,360
Kneel down.

368
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,800
So, you know me.

369
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,040
I'm a poet for a day.

370
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,720
I'm a father for a lifetime.

371
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm like you.

372
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm like your father.

373
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,880
I'm not a fool.

374
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Let's get to the point.

375
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,600
Last month,

376
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,880
Ming Xin

377
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,400
got hurt

378
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,720
and went back to Yaoguang Mountain.

379
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,000
She took the hunting mirror you made

380
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,920
and said you came to the enemy's territory.

381
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,640
Madam Meng was playing the flute again.

382
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,160
You'd detained her

383
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,320
and rescued her

384
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,760
from the undeads.

385
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,280
Hydrangea is an ancient name.

386
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,880
Madam Lin created it

387
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,920
to describe the wood of the forest.

388
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,920
As soon as you left me,

389
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,320
you two came to live in the wood of the forest.

390
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,440
She noodles

391
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
A missing person

392
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,600
who lost the competition

393
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,840
is indeed more suitable to be a pawn.

394
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,680
Shen Jun also has his difficulties.

395
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,360
You brat.

396
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Do you know how worried I was about you?

397
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,320
You made me

398
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,520
have to pretend to be sick

399
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,160
and come out of the Fighters' Group to find you.

400
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,280
I've also taken care of

401
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,800
a lot of celebrities' chase along the way.

402
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,200
They want to chase me.

403
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,600
No way.

404
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,760
But when I came to the Starland,

405
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,040
I heard that Count Ji got married.

406
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,160
I didn't expect it even when I saw it.

407
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,720
It turns out that you,

408
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,600
got married to Count Ji.

409
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,000
What on earth is going on?

410
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,360
Can I not say it?

411
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,640
I suspect that

412
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,360
Ji Bozai's dream

413
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,680
is in his Lingxi Pavilion.

414
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,400
But I want to get into this Lingxi Pavilion,

415
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,240
I have to communicate with him.

416
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,280
Then I figured out a way

417
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
to marry him

418
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
and make him my new lover.

419
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,600
You brat.

420
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,680
You really came up with it.

421
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,920
You've been a good boy since you were a kid.

422
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,440
You always have a good idea.

423
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,560
Do you remember?

424
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,880
We have a lot in common.

425
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,400
But your idea is different.

426
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,560
In order to teach you,

427
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,680
I've learned a lot from you.

428
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,920
You also need to practice martial arts.

429
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,320
You can always come up with some strange moves.

430
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
I admire you.

431
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,200
You can only think of

432
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,880
a good dream

433
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,560
and fake marriage.

434
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,120
How is it?

435
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Can you get something now?

436
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Something?

437
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
What is it?

438
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,920
Ji Bozai is very anxious.

439
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,800
Although he is willing to marry me,

440
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,720
he doesn't want to get into my heart.

441
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,240
So I can't get into the Lingxi Pavilion.

442
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
What?

443
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,800
Master is a bit old.

444
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,960
Say something louder.

445
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
When will you get into the Lingxi Pavilion?

446
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,640
Ji Bozai is very suspicious.

447
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,920
Although he is married,

448
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,640
he didn't get into the Lingxi Pavilion.

449
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,200
He can't get in at once.

450
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,560
Why are you kicking me?

451
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
You...

452
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,040
You can't kick me for 18 meters.

453
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,240
You're so stupid.

454
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,440
Did you use it?

455
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,640
How many petals are left in the palm of your hand?

456
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Master.

457
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,440
You...

458
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,640
You've used five...

459
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,240
No, there are five times left.

460
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,640
Five petals haven't fallen yet.

461
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,440
You can't do it twice.

462
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
You...

463
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
You're really my good disciple.

464
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,760
Master Snake, don't worry.

465
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,560
Mingyi never said that

466
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,120
he can get the Yellow-Curved Dream

467
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,960
and repair the spiritual vein.

468
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,360
Yes.

469
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,000
Find a place.

470
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,480
Sure.

471
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,760
I don't care about that.

472
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Mingxi.

473
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
You...

474
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,960
I just want you to live well.

475
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,920
Even if everyone dies,

476
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,720
you have to live well for me.

477
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,560
You can't joke about your life.

478
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
Do you understand?

479
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,080
For you.

480
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,880
Okay.

481
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,600
NSC.

482
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Thank you, Cui Youbing.

483
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,880
I forgot.

484
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,440
He's going to see Zhang Tai.

485
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,240
What?

486
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,760
Didn't Mingyi say

487
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,600
he was being so mean

488
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,960
to enter the Lingxi Pavilion

489
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,040
and marry that bastard?

490
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,000
But I think his attitude

491
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,360
wasn't that fake.

492
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,360
Master Snake.

493
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,480
How can you

494
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,280
use your skills to listen to gossip?

495
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,320
You're so...

496
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,880
Well...

497
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,160
Do you think

498
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,480
they're really in a relationship?

499
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,800
You bastard.

500
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,520
You're going to kill him

501
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,320
after you kill that bastard.

502
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,720
Master Snake, don't do that.

503
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,640
Don't do that.

504
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
He didn't kill that bastard.

505
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,320
And if something happens to you,

506
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,800
I can't avenge you.

507
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,960
What if Ji Bozi

508
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,360
destroys the Hualian Tomb

509
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,200
and Mingyi is in danger?

510
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,560
You're right.

511
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,320
I can't beat that bastard.

512
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,840
Master Snake.

513
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,880
If you want to vent your anger,

514
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,120
you can scold him.

515
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
You can scold him very hard.

516
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,000
Like little rabbit,

517
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,480
little bastard, little bastard.

518
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,200
You can scold him however you want.

519
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,880
I'll scold him.

520
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,440
You think I'm like you?

521
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,200
How can I scold him

522
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,320
when he's being so mean?

523
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,000
Yes.

524
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,240
Mingyi really likes him.

525
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,520
Really?

526
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,160
Is he that bad?

527
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,480
Why doesn't he

528
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,760
learn from me?

529
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,480
Mingyi,

530
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,960
I owe you a big thank you.

531
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,040
Thank you for saving me

532
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
without any hesitation.

533
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,520
I'm trapped.

534
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,040
I don't know much.

535
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,840
But I know

536
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,520
I'm dead

537
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,880
without you and Ji Xianjun.

538
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
Why did you drink it first?

539
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,640
Xun Min's self-proclaimed love

540
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,480
not only killed Xianliu,

541
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,000
but also killed

542
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,160
other female immortals

543
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,040
who were captured by him.

544
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,640
It's a pity

545
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,440
that I only know

546
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,600
nothing about it.

547
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,800
I'm sorry.

549
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,640
I'm just a little chicken

550
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,040
without a pulse.

551
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,280
Otherwise, I'll make sure

552
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,240
to vent my anger

553
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,760
for them when Xun Min is alive.

554
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,480
If he knows you did this,

555
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,200
he'll be happy.

556
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,840
When he's alive,

557
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,040
he can't be free

558
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,960
as he wishes.

559
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,560
After he dies,

560
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
he'll be more desperate

561
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,880
to be called

562
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,800
a tool of love.

563
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,960
He and those innocent immortals

564
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,800
are both poor people.

565
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Luckily,

566
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,520
I have a good friend like you.

567
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,520
But he's useless.

568
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,840
He lost his life

569
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,520
in the despair of being alone

570
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,720
and couldn't avenge himself.

571
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,360
Xun Min

572
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,160
even said he loved Xingliu.

573
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,880
He didn't even clean

574
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,160
the weeds before he died.

575
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,960
What a man!

576
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,960
I'll go over there

577
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,000
and pick some flowers.

578
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,600
When Xingliu sees them,

579
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,640
he'll be happier.

580
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:29,920
When17

581
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,660
Xun Min

582
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,320
carved the tombstone for you,

583
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,760
he inscribed crunchy waiting festive reducing directly .

584
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,360
I think

585
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,960
he just wants to take the opportunity

586
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,320
to be independent

587
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,480
so you can remain his.

588
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,400
Who cares about his mind then?

589
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Now that

590
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,040
he successfully

591
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,440
the text mothers

592
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,680
cow up through the suicide tally

593
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,080
and saved the day,

594
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,080
Since you don't want to follow the path,

595
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,080
then just leave your original name.

596
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

597
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,080
This is the last piece of my sacred stone, the flower-colored testimony.

598
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
I hope it can help you.

599
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
I'm sorry.

600
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Since Han Feng Jun took over,

601
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
he has committed two crimes.

602
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,080
First, he's a monster with a long history.

603
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
He used the secret method of the back-office

604
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,080
to break the innocent soul of the forest and feed it.

605
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
The secret method is not good.

606
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,080
He knew that he would put the sect in the dragon-garden.

607
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,080
Second, he's a little innocent.

608
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,080
He must have committed a crime

609
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
and hit Chen Yuan to make Li Hentian.

610
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,080
Yao Guangshan, Chu Shui, Lingzhou, and Liu Bo Valley

611
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
all participated in it.

612
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
Han Feng Jun has a name for himself.

613
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,080
He's called Heng'er.

614
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Mu Qi Bai really raised a monster.

615
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
It seems that Chen Yuan's case is not that simple.

616
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
He even colluded with the upper three.

617
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,080
But why does this matter have something to do with Yao Guangshan?

618
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,080
It's not strange that someone from Yao Guangshan participated in it.

619
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,080
If Mu Qi Bai once wanted to sell Li Hentian to Yao Guangshan,

620
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,080
then the person who did it to you should be Yao Guangshan.

621
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Qu Bo Zai told me that he didn't poison Mingxian.

622
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,080
I believe he didn't.

623
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Then the most motivated person to set fire to Yao Guangshan

624
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,080
and want me dead is Mingxin and Mrs. Mo.

625
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
You two are so mean.

626
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
If Mingxin participated in it,

627
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
would you...

628
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
Don't think nonsense.

629
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,080
How could the god be able to tell right from wrong and turn the tables?

630
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
I'm not a black and white.

631
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
Mingyi, your spirit is broken.

632
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
It's really inconvenient.

633
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,080
How about this?

634
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,080
I'll go back to Yao Guangshan tomorrow

635
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,080
to inquire about Mrs. Meng and Mingxin's movements.

636
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080
Thank you, Master.

637
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,080
Be careful.

638
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,080
But I also need you to help me with a punishment.

639
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
I want to give this testimony to Qu Bo Zai

640
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
and use his hands to find out the truth.

641
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,080
But I can't let him know that the upper three also colluded.

642
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
I understand.

643
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Qu Bo Zai is from the Ji Xingyuan.

644
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,080
He won't care about the reputation of Yao Guangshan.

645
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
We need to find out for ourselves.

646
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
This is what I saw in his tomb

647
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,080
when I went to worship the starry willow with Zhang Tai.

648
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,080
I've already investigated Mu Qi Bai's dragon power platform.

649
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
I didn't find anything.

650
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
But now it seems that

651
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,080
he's hiding something even deeper than I thought.

652
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,080
I will definitely find another chance to investigate it.

653
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,080
What did you want to do to Mu Qi Bai?

654
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
The god's sleepwalking.

655
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
The blind knew that there was something wrong.

656
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,080
I wanted to start from this matter.

657
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,080
But I didn't know what to do.

658
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
I wanted to start from this matter.

659
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:22,560
I've been

660
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,080
the most fashionable hair and jewelry.

661
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Let's go and have a look.

662
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Do you like this?

663
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
I want this.

664
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
Okay.

665
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,080
These hair and jewelry are quite special.

666
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Yes.

667
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,080
Have you seen such a style in other places?

668
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
They are all made with gold.

669
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,080
There is only one style.

670
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Come.

671
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
This one is especially suitable for you.

672
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
This one is really beautiful.

673
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
Come.

674
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
I'll put it on for you.

675
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
Put it on.

676
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Then wrap this one for me.

677
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
Okay.

678
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Then I want this one.

679
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Okay.

680
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Thank you.

681
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Come again.

682
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
You.

683
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Let me try this one.

684
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
You really have the face to do business.

685
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
I have to thank you.

686
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
You really quit?

687
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
You left.

688
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
Can the moon and flowers live?

689
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
I have to ask myself to live.

690
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
I thought that

691
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
if I couldn't get real money on the night of the flower moon,

692
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
I could get some money.

693
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
But you said that

694
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
the flowers were all over the place.

695
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
I was so stressed.

696
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
Can I still think like that?

697
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Fortunately, you helped me think of a way to make a living.

698
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,080
This is your own contribution.

699
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
You are good at doing business.

700
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Why do you give me credit?

701
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Come.

702
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Thank you.

703
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Come again next time.

704
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Don't show off your talent.

705
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Yes.

706
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Close it.

707
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080
You still have to be bold.

708
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Yes.

709
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,080
Fairy.

710
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
It seems that this stall is selling.

711
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,080
The jewelry here is more exquisite than in the palace.

712
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Mingyi.

713
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Princess.

714
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Princess.

715
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Are you here to see the jewelry?

716
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
A lady of the Douzhe

717
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
sells jewelry here.

718
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
This is Zhangtai.

719
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,080
Zhangtai is the best sister of the flower moon.

720
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
This is her business.

721
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
But...

722
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
No.

723
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Fairy.

724
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Mingyi came here to help me.

725
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,080
You must know about the crime of murdering a civilian.

726
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,080
I lost my job.

727
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
I have to make a living.

728
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
That's why Mingyi came to help me.

729
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Princess.

730
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,080
These jewelry are made by Zhangtai himself.

731
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
If you like it,

732
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
you can take care of his business.

733
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
If you wear it,

734
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,080
the whole Ji Xin Yuan City will know

735
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Zhangtai's jewelry.

736
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
What business?

737
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
If you like it, take it all.

738
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
I didn't expect

739
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
you had a relationship with Hua Yeye's sister.

740
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
I thought

741
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Princess Tianji

742
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
could take the responsibility of the whole Shouhua Palace

743
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
with her own strength.

744
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
She shouldn't be a biased person.

745
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
But now it seems

746
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,080
that your words make people think

747
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,080
you still care about others' origin,

748
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
not the quality.

749
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
You...

750
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
You're right, Fairy Mingyi.

751
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
I'm narrow-minded.

752
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
Xiuyun.

753
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
I want all these jewelry.

754
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Okay.

755
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
I'm sorry.

756
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
You're too polite.

757
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
You're too polite.

758
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Why am I polite?

759
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
As long as I like it,

760
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
it's worth it.

761
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
You...

762
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
You...

763
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
I mean

764
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,080
the hairpin I like is not yours.

765
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
Is it pretty?

766
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
Yes.

767
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Wrap them up for me.

768
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
I'll send them to you tomorrow.

769
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
I'm so rich.

770
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Have a good talk.

771
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Princess.

772
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
You didn't sleep well today.

773
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
You shouldn't disturb me.

774
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
You're so afraid of me seeing my husband.

775
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
But you're afraid I'll leave any clues.

776
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
After my husband wakes up,

777
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,080
he'll find someone is so ambitious.

778
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Don't worry.

779
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
I won't act rashly.

780
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Now he's just sleeping.

781
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
If he's really that stupid,

782
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
he's not just sleeping.

783
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Sometimes I wonder

784
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,080
when my uncle wants our lives.

785
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Does your father want to give them to me?

786
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
I don't know.

787
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
But I'll do it.

788
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
I'll go.

789
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
I'll go.

790
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
You still like the star flower

791
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
as you used to do.

792
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
How dare you mention the past.

793
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
Nothing.

794
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,080
Just curious.

795
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,080
It sounds like you remember all my hairpin.

796
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
That's true.

797
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,080
This star flower is given to me by Lord Ji.

798
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,080
You've never seen it.

799
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
You don't care about it at all.

800
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,080
Otherwise, you can't stop him from getting married.

801
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,080
It's just because you don't really care about him.

802
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
Lord Yan,

803
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
why don't you ask yourself first?

804
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
Why do you have to confirm my feelings again and again?

805
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
You're just an idiot.

806
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
You're just a fool.

807
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
You're just a fool.

808
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
You're just a fool.

809
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I don't understand.

810
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
How can there be such a stupid guy like you?

811
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Why do you spread the news of Lord Ji's wedding?

812
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
After all, it's a big wedding.

813
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
It's great to have fun together.

814
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
I can't be wrong about that.

815
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,080
I thought I was a good cook.

816
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
I didn't expect that

817
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
there was someone who was more eager to fight for steamed buns than me.

818
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
No one.

819
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
What's the use of steamed buns?

820
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
You!

821
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Get out of here!

822
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Get out of here!

823
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
You're all useless.

824
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
I'm also...

825
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Especially you.

826
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Leave my sight quickly.

827
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Don't let me see you again.

828
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
Okay.

829
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,080
Then I don't have to attend the morning meeting tomorrow?

830
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
In case you see me again.

831
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,080
If it weren't for the Nine Immortals' family

832
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
and the Mu's Clan,

833
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:53,240
a stupid and

834
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
I'm going to use you.

835
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,080
I have to keep you as a stupid friend.

836
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
How dare you laugh?

837
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,080
If I didn't have Lord Hanfeng's support,

838
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,080
how can I stand here today

839
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
and help Lord Hanfeng?

840
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
My humiliation is all on the side of Lord Hanfeng.

841
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
That's enough.

842
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
Shut up.

843
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,080
The flying book of Lord Chengyun of Yaoguang Mountain?

844
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:29,600
The white cat of the famous

845
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,080
made me lie for more than a month.

846
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
He's in the Ji Xingyuan.

847
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,080
You must catch him.

848
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
This is really

849
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
good news from Yaoguang Mountain.

850
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Please allow me to serve Lord Hanfeng

851
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,080
to capture the famous pet.

852
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:30,080
Lying to yourself once is enough.

853
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Even if you have never been true to your promise.

854
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,080
From the starry sky to your heart,

855
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:45,080
how long will it take to replace it with tears?

856
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,080
And your tenderness to me

857
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,080
is all because of the love.

858
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,080
I will let go of my pain

859
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,080
and give you freedom.

860
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,080
Once I have love,

861
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,080
I'm willing to let go.

862
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,080
Behind the abyss, I struggle for a long time.

863
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,080
I want to ask the sky,

864
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,080
is it because of you that I'm always at home?

865
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,080
So what if I'm broken?

866
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,080
Fate has never been wrong.

867
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,080
The sun will eventually fall.

868
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:34,080
I'll fight against all the absurdity.

869
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,080
From the starry sky to your heart,

870
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,080
how long will it take to replace it with tears?

871
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,080
And your tenderness to me

872
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:52,080
is all because of the love.

873
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,080
I will let go of my pain

874
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,080
and give you freedom.

875
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Once I have love,

876
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,080
I'm willing to let go.
