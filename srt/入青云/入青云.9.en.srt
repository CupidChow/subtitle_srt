1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My memory is always about you

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The one I can't forget is that look

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The one I can't escape from is the love

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm hugging you, hugging you

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Loving you is like putting on a mask

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That kiss

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Love by Hypnotic

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Amazing!

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're so talented!

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've been in the night of the flower and moon for so many years

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I've never been out of the country for such a unique dance

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've practiced it for eight hundred times

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't remember all these moves!

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Master, you really put on such a cruel hand

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's not enough to be a good dancer

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're so good at dancing

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not a dancer

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm a dancer

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're so good at dancing

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not her fault

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's my fault

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I made a mistake when I taught her the moves last night

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Zhang Tan

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're the best dancer in this room

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You've never made a mistake

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're using this word to poison me

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You want to protect this heart

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You think I'll punish you if you look down on me?

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Go, go to the other room

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I just got better last month

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If I get sick again this month

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can't see me because of the late emperor, the good emperor, and the late emperor Liu

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't blame me for talking back to you

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You don't know the world anymore

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're so arrogant

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Master

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm not good at dancing

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's my fault for practicing

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hua Yueye always punishes and punishes clearly

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I shouldn't have broken the rules

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Qi Xianjun

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Qi Xianjun

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Qi Xianjun

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Qi Xianjun

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Qi Xianjun

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Qi Xianjun

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sorry, gentlemen

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm here to accompany

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Who is it?

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Who is it?

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who is it?

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is it her?

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Who is it?

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm here to accompany

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Mingyi Fairy to do business

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Really?

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll give you

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll give you

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So heartless

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can't buy it without human intention

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can't save it

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Eat some

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So beautiful

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So beautiful

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Zhangtai

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're so great

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Such a big pearl

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
These jade stones are so beautiful

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm getting married

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
General Xuming said that these gifts are up to you

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
General Xuming

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You said you were going to marry General Xuming

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why didn't you tell me?

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What did Qi Xianjun take?

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I brought it for you

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I brought it for you

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I brought it for you

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you, Qi Xianjun

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're welcome

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now my identity is not convenient to go to Hua Yueye

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But at least we know each other

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Even if we don't want to come together in the future

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have to say goodbye

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Zhangtai, your General Xuming is so nice to you

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No wonder you will be fond of him

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He is straightforward, honest, and loyal

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He is straightforward, honest, and loyal

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When did you praise men so much?

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When did you praise men so much?

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I praise him for everything

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He is so handsome

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He is so tall

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He is so rich

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I want him to draw my eyebrows

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Take your time

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I should go back to serve the general

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wait

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Zhangtai

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Zhangtai, is your wrist injury better?

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is your wrist injury better?

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you have the medicine I gave you?

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Much better, thank you, Mingyi

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mingyi, what's wrong with you?

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Zhangtai's wound

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Not on the wrist, on the waist

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He is not Zhangtai

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There is a puppet mark on his neck

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That person is not Zhangtai's real body

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That person is not Zhangtai's real body

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But a puppet like Zhangtai

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What about Zhangtai's real body?

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
To be similar to human

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You need to take out the air in the three-soul bubble

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
To make a delicate puppet

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But after the three-soul bubble is broken

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In 15 days

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He will die

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Mingyi, Ji Xianjun

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you have any way to save Zhangtai?

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He was the most righteous before

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Every time the landlord hit me

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He will be beaten for me

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He also took out the money when something happened to Xianxian's family

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Jingwen Clan has no one

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Zhangtai is innocent, we have to control him

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Must save him

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hurry up

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No, no

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm hungry

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hungry?

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Of course

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I haven't eaten for days

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why don't you eat?

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I have no money

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How come? You are the most rewarded

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Suddenly I don't like to eat

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You are lying

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You took me to the wedding dress

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You bought me that eyebrow pencil

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I said it was too expensive

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Did you spend all the money?

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You are so much better

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't you like him?

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Enough

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Stop talking

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You can talk about it

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you afraid of the itchy?

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Then what are you afraid of?

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm afraid

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm afraid of it

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have a backache

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Are you ok?

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You really hurt?

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I lied to you

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What is this?

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Green onion pancake

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't want to eat it

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What do you want to eat?

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I want to eat roasted duck

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are a bird, you can't eat roasted duck

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I have dreams

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll give you a duck leg

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm so hungry

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I want to eat

168
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Sir, I have a favor to ask you

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Last time I suffered from blood loss

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
To be honest

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I feel a little wronged

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So many jewelry

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You are not worth it

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't think I can have more

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Say it

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What do you want me to do?

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You are so smart

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You have guessed it

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I have a special gift for you

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll help you

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No need

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You are my brother

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You can't do this

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't need it

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have a special gift for you

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What is it?

187
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I have a special gift for you

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You want to save Zhang Tai

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
To the strongest fox

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I can't protect you

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I want to tear you apart

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You have a special gift

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,640
It's just a love story.

194
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,800
It's that important to you?

195
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,440
Yes.

196
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,920
Love is more important to me than mountains.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
My wife said that she wanted to marry me

198
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,840
and not want to see anyone outside.

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
But you said it,

200
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,840
I have to say yes.

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
General, I'm really worried about Zhang Tai.

202
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,880
I can rest assured if I see him.

203
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Please.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,640
Zhang Tai.

205
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,560
The guest is here.

206
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,240
Zhang Tai, we're here.

207
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,840
It's not convenient to see you.

208
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Look at me.

209
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
It's me.

210
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,040
I said it's not convenient to see guests today.

211
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,200
No matter who it is.

212
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,520
No, I have to talk to him.

213
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Yunyi, what are you doing?

214
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,960
Look, Zhang Tai is ignoring me.

215
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,400
I must be angry.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,840
He's not convenient to see you.

217
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,000
There must be a reason.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,600
I...

219
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,160
Stop it.

220
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
My wife has been killed.

221
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,800
I'm not going to see him.

222
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I'm not going to see him.

223
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm not going to see him.

224
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,400
My wife has been cut off from me.

225
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
You have to see him.

226
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
I let you see him.

227
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
Do you still want to get what you want?

228
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,800
General, of course not.

229
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,200
Sir, please help me persuade the general.

230
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,000
I want to see him.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,400
Yunyi, let me...

232
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,800
Shut up.

233
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,000
General,

234
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,800
maybe because my family

235
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,800
is hungry

236
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,200
and haven't eaten.

237
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,400
So the mood is unstable.

238
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I wonder if it's convenient for you to eat.

239
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
We'll leave after eating.

240
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,400
Right?

241
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,400
Okay.

242
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,400
Enjoy your meal.

243
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
After eating,

244
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
please leave.

245
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Thank you for your hospitality.

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Hurry up and eat, Mingyi.

247
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
Mingyi, aren't you hungry?

248
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Eat more.

249
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,800
Add some...

250
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,400
This.

251
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,200
You're worried about the food?

252
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
You can let me eat.

253
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,800
Come on.

254
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Let me feed you.

255
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Do you want to eat this?

256
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,200
Give me a piece of chicken.

257
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,600
You're so picky.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,600
You like it?

259
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,400
Open your mouth.

260
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Open your mouth.

261
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Give me a piece of meat.

262
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
Look at the fire.

263
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,400
General.

264
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,000
General.

265
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
What's going on?

266
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,000
Take it off.

267
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,000
Sir,

268
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,800
you're so skilled.

269
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,200
It's just fire.

270
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
Aren't you the most familiar?

271
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,540
The

272
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,400
Fire-resistant Spell has been done.

273
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's go.

274
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,000
General.

275
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,000
General.

276
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,400
You'll be unconscious

277
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
if you leave your master for too long.

278
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Isn't it too dangerous

279
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
to use the spell in such a close place?

280
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
Xun Mingyi is not jealous.

281
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I,

282
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,000
I want to ask as a matter of fact,

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
to be happy as a wife

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,800
to my commissioner.

285
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,400
Okay.

286
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,000
This batch

287
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,200
only has Mount Li,

288
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,000
Qi,

289
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and Er Po on it.

290
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,800
Xun Mingyi split up

291
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,000
all his three souls.

292
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,800
The snacks arePS

293
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,600
and the fox Spring.

294
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,040
I'm worried about Zhang Tai.

295
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,680
He can't be unaware of them.

296
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,240
Xun Ming used Zhang Tai

297
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,840
to lure him

298
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,000
and trapped him into his own environment.

299
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,120
If you're out of your mind,

300
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,720
I can use these two parts

301
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
to let you see Zhang Tai.

302
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,960
But you can't bring him out.

303
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,560
You only need to find Xun Ming's most real memory

304
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,640
and recreate it

305
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,960
to enter the real environment

306
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,120
and save Zhang Tai.

307
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,040
I can definitely get the most real memory

308
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,800
from Zhang Tai.

309
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But you have to know

310
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,600
that it's dangerous to use the original source.

311
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,240
I only have one incense stick

312
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
to open the formation.

313
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,240
You only need to say a few words to him.

314
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,160
If Xun Ming finds out,

315
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,720
I'll leave the formation immediately.

316
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,080
I won't bother you.

317
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,200
Please.

318
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,520
Watch out.

319
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,400
Zhang Tai.

320
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,080
How much?

321
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,840
Let's go check.

322
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,800
I can't tell you all at once.

323
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,520
Go back to my room.

324
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Zhang Tai!

325
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Zhang Tai!

326
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Is it Mingyi's voice?

327
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Mingyi, is it you?

328
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Mingyi!

329
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Mingyi, where are you?

330
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
I can't see you!

331
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Zhang Tai, stop struggling.

332
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Xun Ming has trapped your primordial spirit in the illusion.

333
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
I can only meet you through your two sides,

334
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
but I can't save you.

335
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
I can only restore the most real memories of the Yousu Hu Clan

336
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
so that I can open this illusion and rescue you.

337
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
So tell me,

338
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
what is Xun Ming's most important memory?

339
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Tell me everything that happened between you two.

340
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Okay.

341
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
When Xun Ming was in the Flower Moon Night,

342
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
he pulled me and I couldn't let go.

343
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
He looked at me in that way.

344
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
He looked at me in that way.

345
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
He looked at me in that way.

346
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
He looked at me in that way.

347
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Everyone in the family is different.

348
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
And you know,

349
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
he is tall and handsome,

350
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
and he looks rich.

351
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
I was naive at the time.

352
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
I found someone

353
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
who could be my partner for the rest of my life.

354
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
But after I married him,

355
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
I found out that he was different from others.

356
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
He's sick!

357
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
He always had to

358
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
hold a wedding ceremony with me at home.

359
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
He did it over and over again.

360
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
He didn't let me get any of the wedding rings.

361
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
There were at least 20 wedding ceremonies.

362
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
He even cooperated with me every time.

363
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
My hand was hurt.

364
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
He still had to continue.

365
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
He insisted on changing my name.

366
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
He insisted on changing my name.

367
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
He called me Mu Xin Liu.

368
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Mu Xin Liu?

369
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
I was wondering if he had a lover

370
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
who was called Zhen Ming.

371
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
But how could I be like him?

372
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
How could I be like him?

373
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
No, that's impossible.

374
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
No, that's impossible.

375
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
I don't believe it.

376
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
How could someone be as beautiful as me?

377
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
What's the most important thing?

378
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
What's the most important thing?

379
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
The most important thing?

380
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
I don't know either.

381
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
It should have something to do with his lover.

382
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
It should have something to do with his lover.

383
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Do you remember how you got locked in this place?

384
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
I...

385
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
I was thinking of going back to the Flower Moon Night to see everyone.

386
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Xue Ming was unhappy.

387
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
I locked him up for a drink

388
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
to coax him.

389
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
He had no idea how he and his lover

390
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
were getting along.

391
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
He ended up drinking too much.

392
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
He kept telling me

393
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
that no matter how sincere you are,

394
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
you're the only one in my heart.

395
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
He even kissed me after he finished talking.

396
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
He even kissed me after he finished talking.

397
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
He even kissed me after he finished talking.

398
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
It's fine if he kissed me for the first few times.

399
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
It's fine if he kissed me for the first few times.

400
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
He doesn't look embarrassed.

401
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
And I think he's pretty good.

402
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
But he kissed me for more than 20 times.

403
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
I'm numb.

404
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Chang Tan, time is limited.

405
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
I have to go out after a week.

406
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
I have to go out after a week.

407
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
I'm going to a wedding with him.

408
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
I'm going to a wedding with him.

409
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,520
It's the same process.

410
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
I don't want to talk anymore.

411
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
He just walked towards me.

412
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
He just walked towards me.

413
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
I'm going to faint.

414
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
If I open my eyes again, I'll be here.

415
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
In the forest?

416
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,520
In the forest?

417
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
In the forest?

418
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
What forest?

419
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
From my side,

420
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
you're locked in a forest.

421
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Where are you?

422
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,520
I'm in Xun Min's lantern cave.

423
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I...

424
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
I'm locked in Xun Min's wedding bedroom.

425
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
It's the same.

426
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
It's the same.

427
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Zhang Tai, listen to me.

428
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Zhang Tai, listen to me.

429
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
You should be locked in his fantasy.

430
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
You should be locked in his fantasy.

431
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Think about it.

432
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
Think about it.

433
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Think about it.

434
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
Think about it.

435
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Lin Yi.

436
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
There are many strange sounds here.

437
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
They're all women.

438
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Xun Min not only found me.

439
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Before I came,

440
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
he married many women

441
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
and they all died.

442
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,520
They all died.

443
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
I might also...

444
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
Lin Yi.

445
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
I might...

446
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
not be able to sing for too long.

447
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Lin Yi.

448
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,520
It's too late.

449
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Don't be angry like that!

450
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
What are you doing?

451
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
I was talking about yourpeople!

452
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
I will not do such a thing.

453
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
What's wrong?

454
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
It's not a nuisance.

455
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Let's just leave.

456
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Have you understood?

457
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Not at all.

458
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
You only respond to my people like that

459
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
and talk shit about your people?

460
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
What's the smell?

461
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
You'veoria it again?

462
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Who knows,

463
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,520
It's a fingers-이라는 case in the Bon cough.

464
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,440
How can you eat this much?

465
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,500
I may eat too much.

466
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,220
You done?

467
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,000
Here come ya.

468
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,560
Are you fine?

469
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,000
Thank you for your hospitality.

470
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,460
We're done with our supper for today.

471
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,540
Then I shall leave.

472
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,420
Thank you general.

473
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:21,980
Let's go.

474
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,800
You're so silly.

475
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,640
Zhang Tai doesn't know

476
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
what the most real memory of Xun Ming is.

477
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,120
But he guessed

478
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,760
it should be the lover

479
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,360
of the ancient star in Xun Ming's heart,

480
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
Mu Xing Liao.

481
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Mu's family?

482
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,480
There's a place

483
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,200
that might have clues.

484
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,680
So, Langhuan Pavilion

485
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,240
can be entered during the day.

486
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,720
But last time, it was too crowded.

487
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,280
Last time, it was a theft.

488
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,880
This time, it's a contract.

489
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,880
Can it be the same?

490
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,520
This is...

491
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
I've located it.

492
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,320
It's Ji Xing Yuan's Family's Tarture.

493
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,200
Bell man is so rigid!

494
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,280
Let me see.

495
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,700
The family preserved

496
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,200
only at Sipan Hall!

497
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,240
This is what happened

498
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,240
to His Lordship!

499
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,160
Who told him to click?

500
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,960
Have I care too much about him?

501
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,640
Even if you don't know this,

502
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,480
others willq

503
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,560
Everyone will inquire about this.

504
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,420
Now furnish the palace.

505
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,500
Is it contagious?

506
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,220
Calm down.

507
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,020
How can I explain to them

508
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,780
if I make a mistake?

509
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,140
This thing is nothing.

510
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,780
Are we going to the capital?

511
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,140
That's him.

512
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,340
underlying

513
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,420
Do you believe me?

514
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,180
do you believe me?

515
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:18,420
Together

516
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:18,660
Together

517
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:18,860
2

518
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,540
Do you believe me?

519
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,580
This is not your room.

520
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,060
What a coincidence.

521
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,020
Sister?

522
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,980
Sister?

523
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,460
You want to know something?

524
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,820
I can help you.

525
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,580
I can make others think

526
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,820
I asked for Sipan Hall to do that.

527
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,260
It's nothing special.

528
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,140
It's just that

529
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,460
Immortal Ji always takes me out for a walk.

530
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,220
I have a lot of unknown things.

531
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,740
He said that Sipan Hall

532
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,300
has a lot of books in the warehouse

533
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,340
that I can keep reading

534
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,380
to avoid making mistakes.

535
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,220
This book,

536
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,900
I can't open it.

537
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,420
You're the master of Sipan Hall.

538
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,620
You can open it, right?

539
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,460
I followed you

540
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,140
and then I found this book.

541
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,380
Sister follows Ji Bozai.

542
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,980
She should be responsible for her mistakes.

543
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,060
Why should she ask you to do something for her?

544
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,940
Thank you, Immortal Si Tu.

545
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,500
Please do me a favor.

546
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,260
Okay.

547
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,180
I'll help you if you need me.

548
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,740
But can you

549
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,620
not mention Ji Bozai in front of me?

550
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,580
Okay.

551
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,780
Okay.

552
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,300
Thank you, Immortal.

553
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,860
Do you want to investigate Han Feng Jun?

554
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,260
Investigate?

555
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,980
I don't think I need to.

556
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,420
I just think that Han Feng Jun has a high position.

557
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,820
I want to know more about him.

558
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,060
In the Wang's clan,

559
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,500
only a group of people from the Mu clan is recorded.

560
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,060
If they get married,

561
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,700
they won't be recorded.

562
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,820
What are you talking about?

563
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,020
I'm talking about Han Feng Jun.

564
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,540
Han Feng Jun is a noble person.

565
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,620
He's a noble person.

566
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,860
He's a noble person.

567
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,020
He's a noble person.

568
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,020
He's a noble person.

569
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,300
He's a noble person.

570
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
He's a noble person.

571
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
He's a noble person.

572
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,100
Does that mean he's not good enough?

573
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,500
I want to know about him.

574
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,900
He's a noble person.

575
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,980
You even want to入赫start with him.

576
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,320
Are you aware of that?

577
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,380
It's the rule that

578
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,660
once you generate her horoscope,

579
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,940
you donate her name

580
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,900
on your marriage certificate

581
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,900
to dream dream치를 at the Mengyuan hall.

582
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:58,000
A rare

583
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
Don't say that.

584
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,340
If others hear it,

585
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,780
they will suspect that

586
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,980
you are not from the Star-gazer.

587
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,060
It seems to be a little eerie.

588
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,780
Yes, it's a little cold.

589
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,380
This face...

590
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,060
What a coincidence!

591
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,900
You have been here all the time.

592
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,340
Why are you hiding?

593
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,380
I'm not hiding.

594
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,380
We are on a date.

595
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,580
I didn't expect someone to disturb me.

596
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,780
By the way,

597
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,980
you just called me sister Mingyi.

598
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,140
Since you want to be a family member,

599
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,740
you don't have to call me Zun Cheng.

600
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,900
Call me brother-in-law.

601
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,340
Why are you still shy?

602
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,740
We have some things to do.

603
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,420
We have to go.

604
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,100
Well,

605
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,180
thank you for coming today.

606
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,980
Let's go.

607
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,700
Let's go.

608
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,420
Let's go.

609
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,820
Let's go.

610
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,340
Let's go.

611
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,380
Let's go.

612
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,020
Let's go.

613
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,900
Let's go.

614
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,340
My shoes.

615
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,580
His Majesty went to the warehouse to check.

616
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,460
We haven't found the message of Huang Liang Meng.

617
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
What we know now is the old things.

618
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,980
The old house of the Doctor's Clan in Zhangwei Mountain was exposed.

619
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,860
Mu Qi Bai

620
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,220
took the opportunity to get the Doctor's Medical Manual.

621
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,300
But Huang Liang Meng's secret recipe

622
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,620
is indeed only in the silk.

623
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,100
Chen Yuan also failed to master it.

624
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,780
If I can't find Huang Liang Meng,

625
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,140
I will never have a child again.

626
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,420
Without the spiritual vein,

627
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,980
His Majesty also

628
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,300
has a thousand-fold skill.

629
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,020
But I can't take him to the Qing Yun Conference.

630
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,700
Don't be angry.

631
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,180
There are still a few people

632
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,380
who have Huang Liang Meng in their hands.

633
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,020
Huang Liang Meng has disappeared for a long time in the six realms.

634
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,860
Why is it him

635
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,460
who has the spiritual vein out of thin air?

636
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,620
Maybe he is related to the Doctor's Medical Clan.

637
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,180
Or maybe he is the descendant of the Doctor.

638
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,180
Why is he so hazy?

639
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,180
What?

640
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,980
Nothing.

641
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,580
It's just that the Qing Yun Conference is practicing medicine in Chen Yuan.

642
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,380
Then they have the prescription.

643
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,940
I was hoping to find clues

644
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
in the silk hall's book.

645
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
I can practice Huang Liang Meng or something by myself.

646
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,540
But I didn't get anything.

647
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,500
The fastest way

648
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,940
is to steal the things of Doctor Ji.

649
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,100
Fu Yuan, it sounds like

650
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,900
you are not so lucky.

651
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,740
I will steal the things.

652
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,180
I am not so lucky.

653
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,260
Is that okay?

654
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,580
By the way,

655
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,300
Fu Yue has checked for His Majesty.

656
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,780
After Ming Xian lost the last Qing Yun Conference,

657
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,140
he disappeared from Yaoguang Mountain.

658
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,180
There is news that he is a traitor.

659
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,460
As for why he changed back to a female body

660
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,860
and lurked by Doctor Ji,

661
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,060
I haven't found out yet.

662
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,780
You have found him?

663
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,300
Didn't His Majesty want to know about him?

664
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,700
But I didn't ask you to find him.

665
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,300
Fu Yuan,

666
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,420
you can't be so secretive.

667
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,020
Father.

668
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:21,180
Father.

669
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,260
Father.

670
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,300
After we found out,

671
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,680
Chu State

672
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,040
Half a cup of wine and half a cup of teaSt remained yo

673
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,440
y

674
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,280
you

675
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,720
captain

676
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,320
do you know with Su Consolidation

677
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,680
you have been knowing

678
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,960
jealous again

679
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,360
how is it

680
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,800
former!) Su usando demon hand

681
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,760
Thanks to him, the late king came.

682
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,080
It's not familiar.

683
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,800
Then why would he help you?

684
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,040
It was before.

685
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,520
He used Mu Xibai's magic

686
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,760
to investigate the Magic Circle.

687
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,680
He got into such a big mess

688
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,280
and let it go so easily.

689
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,720
Perhaps...

690
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,320
Perhaps he has taken a look

691
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,520
at me.

692
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,560
Ah...

693
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,720
Stay away from him.

694
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,320
Okay.

695
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,440
I'm afraid that you'll be caught in trouble

696
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,480
if you're caught.

697
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,320
I didn't ask you to explain.

698
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,920
I'm afraid that you'll be caught in trouble.

699
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,560
Your Excellency,

700
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,880
you're right.

701
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,920
That Mu Xingrou

702
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,760
is really Han Fengjun's cousin.

703
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,280
Xu Ming's wife,

704
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,040
according to Zhang Tai,

705
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,000
Xu Ming asked her to accompany him

706
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,680
to reenact the scene of the Su family getting married.

707
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,440
And she fell into a fantasy

708
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,400
when she was reenacting the wedding.

709
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,160
So I thought

710
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,000
it should be the wedding of Mu Xingrou.

711
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,920
To save Xu Ming's fantasy,

712
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,720
we need to reenact her wedding.

713
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,000
Okay.

714
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,360
If we want to reenact the Su family's wedding,

715
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,720
we can't find an outsider

716
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,960
to play the role.

717
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,400
Otherwise, the situation is too uncontrollable.

718
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,600
You're right.

719
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,280
How about you and Aunt Xun

720
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
hold a wedding?

721
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,640
We can also wait for the right time

722
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,680
when there's an accident.

723
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,560
But I'm so nervous

724
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,840
about Aunt Xun's wedding.

725
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,640
How do you think she'll come?

726
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,640
You're really willing to do it?

727
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,240
Is there a possibility

728
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,040
that Aunt Xun is not willing to do it?

729
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,080
Aunt Xun is not willing to do it?

730
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,240
If it's calculated like this,

731
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,320
the one who's most suitable for this fake wedding

732
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,800
is only Mingyi and His Majesty.

733
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,880
But you

734
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,480
don't trust her, do you?

735
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,440
During this time,

736
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,280
Mingyi has never been in contact with the outside world.

737
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,000
Besides, she has low spiritual power

738
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,080
and can't make any trouble.

739
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,040
When His Majesty enters the fantasy,

740
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
he'll eliminate Xu Ming.

741
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,320
Even if he finds out something,

742
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,360
it'll be easy to kill him.

743
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,000
But I have to remind His Majesty

744
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,520
that when necessary,

745
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,480
he must be cruel to Mingyi.

746
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,560
When it's time to sacrifice her,

747
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,440
she must not be soft-hearted.

748
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,200
Okay.

749
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,160
I'll tell him.

750
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,320
It's settled then.

751
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,120
I...

752
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,400
His Majesty's acting now is very good.

753
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,240
Now you can go to see Mingyi

754
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,760
and perform the real love song

755
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,800
to make her fall in love.

756
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,280
I have an idea.

757
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,320
Go ahead.

758
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,800
Let me think about it.

759
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Didn't His Majesty say

760
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,480
he would go to the night of flowers

761
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,760
to check if there's any information

762
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,920
about the missing of the living.

763
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,280
Are you really worried about Zhang Tai?

764
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,360
Of course.

765
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,960
Before I sent the illusion out,

766
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,680
Zhang Tai said he was almost dead.

767
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,920
His Majesty also said

768
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,480
after the three-soul seven-spirit was extracted,

769
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,120
he couldn't live more than 15 days.

770
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,840
His Majesty's acting now

771
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,000
is very good.

772
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,360
Now you can go to see Mingyi

773
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,000
and perform the real love song

774
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,080
to make her fall in love.

775
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,120
There's no need to hold a form of war

776
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,360
and not even a fight.

777
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,200
You just Music in the air can pass.

778
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,840
Performing the real love song

779
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,280
to make her fall in love.

780
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,560
It's simple, since I've trust you.

781
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,360
You just Music in the air can pass.

782
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,840
Performing the real love song

783
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,760
to make her fall in love.

784
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,960
You just Music in the air can pass.

785
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
It's simple, since I've trust you.

786
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
Performing the real love song

787
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,240
to make her fall in love.

788
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,040
But he have to give me the marriage request.

789
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:40,960
Master.

790
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:41,640
No?

791
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,140
It's easy to divide them apart.

792
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,600
One is enough to rope the line

793
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,000
and the other is too much.

794
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,200
And...

795
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,760
Great.

796
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,040
I know it.

797
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,000
You want me to hold the fake wedding

798
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,820
because you want to save dong Tais.

799
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,280
Rest assured.

800
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,800
The engagement will not be spiritual.

801
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,900
This wedding

802
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,500
I only invite Xun Ming.

803
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,900
We don't need to go to the hospital for a name-calling.

804
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,020
And we don't need to get any new seal.

805
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,860
Your reputation

806
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,060
will not be affected.

807
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,300
Sir, don't worry about me.

808
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,180
Actually, the name-calling

809
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,140
and the new seal...

810
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,620
That friend has sacrificed enough.

811
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,420
You can't sacrifice yourself anymore.

812
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,180
Trust me.

813
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,460
You are so thoughtful.

814
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,580
You didn't want to marry me before.

815
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,340
Why did you sacrifice so much for me?

816
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,260
Do you have any other plans?

817
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,500
I can only do it because I have other plans.

818
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,300
Thank you for your help.

819
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,540
You helped me out of your own will.

820
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,380
I won't let you suffer any loss.

821
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,540
After you get married,

822
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,940
you can split the money as you like.

823
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,740
Although I like you,

824
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,660
I won't let you die in vain.

825
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,180
Okay.

826
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,220
After you get married,

827
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,660
you can split the money as you like.

828
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,540
Although I like you,

829
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,500
I won't let you die in vain.

830
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,460
Is His Majesty thinking about

831
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,460
how to make Xun Ming come to the official ceremony?

832
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,380
I have my own way to make him come.

833
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,340
What is His Majesty thinking about?

834
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,860
I have no other plans.

835
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,860
I have no other plans.

836
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,860
I have no other plans.

837
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,860
I have no other plans.

838
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
I have no other plans.

839
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,860
I have no other plans.

840
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,860
I have no other plans.

841
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,860
I have no other plans.

842
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,860
I have no other plans.

843
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,860
I have no other plans.

844
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,860
I have no other plans.

845
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
I have no other plans.

846
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,860
I have no other plans.

847
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,860
I have no other plans.

848
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,860
I have no other plans.

849
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,860
I have no other plans.

850
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,860
I have no other plans.

851
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
I have no other plans.

852
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
I have no other plans.

853
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,860
I have no other plans.

854
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,860
I have no other plans.

855
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
I have no other plans.

856
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,860
I have no other plans.

857
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,860
I have no other plans.

858
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,860
I have no other plans.

859
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,860
I have no other plans.

860
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,860
I have no other plans.

861
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Please, go!

862
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,440
How could Ji Bozai

863
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,880
dare to trick him

864
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,360
in the stock market

865
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,300
of New Turkey.

866
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,140
Luo Shenglin.

867
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,780
It's also the place

868
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,460
where you and my sister are in love.

869
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,620
Since they chose to stay here,

870
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,380
it means that they've already calculated that you will definitely go.

871
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,900
You can go if you want to.

872
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,700
I won't stop you.

873
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,580
But you must remember

874
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,980
that you can't be swayed by this.

875
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
Don't worry.

876
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,380
I will definitely go.

877
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,180
I will definitely go.

878
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,340
I'm not that useless.

879
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,340
Sweet Combat

880
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,780
� Though We've Beenех

881
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,160
arya

882
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,500
result

883
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:39,860
When the clouds in the sky leave me

884
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,860
You are my soul, until I become weak

885
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,860
It's enough to lie to myself once

886
00:43:54,860 --> 00:44:00,860
Even if I've never been true to myself

887
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:08,860
From the stars to your heart, how long will it take to replace it with tears?

888
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:15,860
And the tenderness you gave me is all because of love

889
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:22,860
I'll drink down my pain, only to return your freedom

890
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:28,860
Once you have love, you are willing to let go

891
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:36,860
I want to ask the sky, who is struggling behind the abyss

892
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:43,860
But this armor is always for you, so what if I'm broken?

893
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:50,860
Fate has never been wrong, the sun will eventually fall

894
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:57,860
I'll fight against all the absurdity

895
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:08,860
From the stars to your heart, how long will it take to replace it with tears?

896
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:15,860
And the tenderness you gave me is all because of love

897
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:22,860
I'll drink down my pain, only to return your freedom

898
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:29,860
Once you have love, you are willing to let go
