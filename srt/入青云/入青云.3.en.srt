1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Your eyes are trapped in me

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's me

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's me

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Or the heat that will only be available in the wind and rain

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You are the warmth engraved in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Memories have been struggling with you from then on

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't forget those eyes

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't escape from the love that's entwined

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm hugging you, hugging you

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't forget those eyes

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The Love by Hypnotic

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Lord Ji, Lord Ji, you lost again

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The punishment is that the court can ask me to do something

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have nothing to say

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Good, that's good

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Lord Ji is good

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Then please ask Lord Ji to hit me

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is the rumor true?

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Have you really been hit by the yellow curtain?

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, yes

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Tell us

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Tell us

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The Ji Xing Palace has been spreading the rumor

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That your spirit energy is derived from Li Hen Tian

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You can survive with Li Hen Tian

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Could it be that you have the yellow curtain?

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm not going to lie

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I really don't have a spirit energy from birth

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But...

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's getting late

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Lord Han Feng, you know that

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In the Ji Xing Palace, the crime of committing a mistake

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Will be locked in the court

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
For a lifetime

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I've been in the court since I was little

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can't eat, I can't wear, I can't work

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have to work day and night

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's really too tiring

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In the end, I really can't stand such a hard life

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So I risked my life to escape from the court

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
In the end, I was too hurt and lost

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Lord Han Feng

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
When I woke up, I didn't know why

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My spirit energy suddenly grew out

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Maybe this is the result of the fire

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Lord Han Feng

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The reason I don't want to mention this to anyone

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Is because I don't want to

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Remember such a painful experience

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In the days of the court

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's really worse than death

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's really hard for you

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You...

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's really not easy

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Forcing you to open your mouth

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I understand

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
After all, the dream of the emperor is a good thing

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Everyone has to be careful

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But let's think about it

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If everyone has such a chance

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The six realms of the starry sky

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Isn't it a day to wait?

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you clearly have the news of the dream of the emperor

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But don't want to share

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Then you are not

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
A sinner who has become a star

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why are there so many people who are addicted to the dream of the emperor?

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So many

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's not over yet

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Who

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Who

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Is here

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Just found

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,360
Greetings, Lord Han Feng.

79
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,000
I didn't notice you for a long time.

80
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,600
You must not be an ordinary fairy.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,960
Could it be

82
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,760
that you were chosen by my brother

83
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,320
to be a fairy with a spiritual pulse

84
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,120
and stay by my side?

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What's wrong with you tonight?

86
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,520
You either asked me about my spiritual pulse

87
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,480
or you suspected that

88
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,600
I had a spiritual pulse.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,200
I asked him to come up first.

90
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,280
I didn't know that you would come tonight.

91
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,280
I asked him to hide first.

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,160
A moment of spring is hard to endure.

93
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm the one who's bothering you.

94
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,240
Brother Bo Zai,

95
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
take care of yourself.

96
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,360
Wait a minute.

97
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,400
I'll send you off.

98
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,520
No need.

99
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
This is the first time Lord Han Feng has visited.

100
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,240
I should send you off.

101
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,880
Wait for me.

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,640
All right.

103
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll send you off here.

104
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,360
You go ahead.

105
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,320
Take care.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,560
Alright.

107
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,120
Listen,

108
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,880
please give that organ back to me.

109
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,680
Michael is playing forever.

110
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,560
Take it.

111
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,920
It can't be occurred.

112
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,960
I Shirley sent it to Haha.

113
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,720
T克 Mu Ye Fan despise him to get the

114
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,960
sick Halloween stuff to give the sender.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,560
Look at you,

116
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
you are slim!

117
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,440
You look pretty and fine!

118
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm Miru,

119
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
a couple.

120
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
I knew you wouldn't come.

121
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,760
Shuna.

122
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:03,260
Is sheP Thirty-ş

123
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,320
Would be scared by 나왔

124
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
So late

125
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,060
Why are you hiding in my bed?

126
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,620
The hostess of Wugui Sea

127
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,660
can't go to your bed.

128
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,620
Sir, I...

129
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,220
He...

130
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,260
He touched...

131
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,660
He touched me?

132
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,140
Sir, why are you suddenly like this?

133
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,820
It seems that the Lianxiu Pouch is quite useful.

134
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,420
No.

135
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,020
I have to take back the initiative.

136
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,180
Sir, don't worry.

137
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,700
I know the rules.

138
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,100
Let me find it.

139
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,380
You can go now.

140
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,580
Sir, I've prepared it tonight.

141
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,140
After all, I'm looking forward to you.

142
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,020
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,900
Don't move.

144
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,900
My lord.

145
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,380
I don't like this dress.

146
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,580
We'll talk later.

147
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
What kind of dress do you like?

148
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,940
Why don't you like...

149
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,900
Wait.

150
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,060
There's an immortal with a spirit vein in the six realms.

151
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,860
He'll plant the Soul-guarding Cauldron

152
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,060
and seal the spirit vein as soon as he's born.

153
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,100
He was just

154
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,980
exploring if I had a Soul-guarding Cauldron.

155
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,380
My lord.

156
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,100
I got the sword leaf grass from Ruoshui.

157
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,260
Are you hurt?

158
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,540
No.

159
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,300
It's fragile.

160
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,100
You're usually very experienced.

161
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,380
You can walk around freely.

162
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,580
I'm not worried that you'll be noticed by him.

163
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,500
But you almost got noticed

164
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,180
when you showed up today.

165
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm incompetent.

166
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,260
It's okay.

167
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,460
Since you got the sword leaf grass,

168
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,380
it's time to go to the sword palace to find it.

169
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,420
Yes.

170
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,180
Jinli Palace

171
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,500
Jinli Palace

172
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:51,940
Ji Budai

173
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,220
Ji Budai

174
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,900
Qi Budai.

175
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,580
Ji Budai.

176
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,500
Ji Budai.

177
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,420
Ji Budai.

178
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,660
Ji Budai.

179
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,820
Ji Budai.

180
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,140
Ji Budai.

181
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,780
How dare you!

182
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,780
How dare you beg me here?

183
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,260
Si Pan Tang is missing.

184
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,860
When the wound is healed,

185
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,420
I'll see if you can handle it.

186
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,980
Do you really think you're that important?

187
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,340
Qian Ye Cao.

188
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,580
Qian Ye Cao.

189
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,260
How could you have her?

190
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,700
Where did you get it?

191
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,460
It's like the sword leaf grass that has been withered for a hundred years.

192
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,780
Lord Houshao.

193
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,060
Am I sincere enough?

194
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,580
Your daughter is weak.

195
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,340
She's about to have the battle of the five-thrower.

196
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,780
With her,

197
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,860
the wish of Lord Houshao

198
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,420
will come true, right?

199
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,860
No.

200
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,860
Stop. Stop.

201
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,260
As long as you give Qian Ye Cao to Ruo Shui,

202
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,860
I'll promise you everything.

203
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,260
I'll promise you everything.

204
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,780
What a loving woman.

205
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,300
I feel like I'm too despicable.

206
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,900
Okay.

207
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,100
Jin Bo Cai.

208
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Jin Bo Cai.

209
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,580
I promise you.

210
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,900
I'll give you

211
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
my memory.

212
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,620
Central Gods

213
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,380
have ordered the Void Lord in the yin Dark effort

214
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,700
to take all the memories.

215
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:34,020
Plus, the

216
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,940
Little Man and I

217
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,220
spent many years

218
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,220
hotshotbing

219
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,980
to Ruo Shui.

220
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,860
Yes.

221
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,460
How could His Majesty know it's him?

222
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,740
Have you really been poisoned by the yellow-billed dream?

223
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
Everyone thinks

224
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,660
the yellow-billed dream is a kind of pill

225
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,860
or a medicine.

226
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,940
But it's too good.

227
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,180
Why do you use the word poison?

228
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,780
By the way,

229
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,620
how did you find out the identity of Ming Yu?

230
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,940
Ming Yu did

231
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,020
the little girl who picked herbs from the fairy's house in the cold water.

232
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,460
After her parents died,

233
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,860
she came to the capital alone

234
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,820
to spend the night.

235
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,820
I found another thing.

236
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,260
Ming Yu's parents

237
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,020
often picked herbs near the garden.

238
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,220
I asked about their clothes.

239
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,340
It was the poison of the blood-pig flower.

240
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,700
Blood-pig flower?

241
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,560
(*Refer to fulfiller's clausel

242
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,700
Kow Conversation

243
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Kuow Here

244
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,760
A...

245
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,780
What a sad ending.

246
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:18,680
The next one is up to you.

247
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,340
Your Highness.

248
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,380
She found out about it.

249
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,820
I've cut off

250
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,340
the connection between Yu Chong and the original master.

251
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,540
From now on,

252
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
he only listens to you.

253
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,300
He will lead us to find the Yellow-Croaker Dream.

254
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,700
The Yellow-Croaker Dream

255
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

256
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,940
Lord Cheng Yun, please forgive me.

257
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,700
Stupid!

258
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,740
The Chasing Mirror

259
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,620
was touched by Ming Xian's mask.

260
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,100
How could it be?

261
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,700
I was unable to capture it.

262
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,980
I deserve to die.

263
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,700
But...

264
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,060
But the Chasing Mirror

265
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,420
was touched by a fairy.

266
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,100
But it was indeed a woman.

267
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,180
It can't be Ming Xian.

268
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,340
Fairy?

269
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,900
Where is she?

270
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,900
What's her name?

271
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,380
She...

272
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,740
She's in the Chasing Mirror.

273
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,900
Her name...

274
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,780
I don't know her name.

275
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,020
I just know that fairy

276
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,620
should be Ji Bo Zai's man.

277
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,700
Ji Bo Zai?

278
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,980
Five days later,

279
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,020
the criminal court

280
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,460
started to select the candidates

281
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,300
for the Summer Cloud Conference.

282
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
His Majesty hopes that the fairy will accompany him.

283
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,220
Fairy, please

284
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,340
learn the etiquette rules

285
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,540
from me this afternoon.

286
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,860
Don't be late.

287
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,140
Granny Xun is trying to test you.

288
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,140
If you fail,

289
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,340
we'll be in a tight spot.

290
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,420
It's because she tried to test me.

291
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,780
That's why I have to go.

292
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,260
But it's too dangerous.

293
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,220
We've released the Chasing Mirror.

294
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,380
We'll soon find

295
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,540
the whereabouts of the Yellow-Croaker Dream.

296
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,140
Give me five days.

297
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,700
I'll definitely get through it.

298
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,380
I'll test you today.

299
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,340
Do you know

300
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,060
what the Summer Cloud Conference is?

301
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,940
A thousand years ago,

302
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,020
the six realms

303
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,540
fought against the Heaven of Nine Heavens

304
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,340
to avoid too many casualties.

305
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,300
The six gods

306
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,460
signed an alliance with the Chasing Mirror.

307
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,020
Every year, the Summer Cloud Conference

308
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,900
is used to determine who will be the one.

309
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,940
With the memory of the last move,

310
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,820
the six gods

311
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,860
will be able to

312
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,900
tell usABout this day.

313
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,860
This moves

314
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,540
will tell us

315
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,700
who killed gesagt Fairy Apoi that day.

316
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,100
I've been waiting

317
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,780
What are you doing?

318
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,540
Give me your hand.

319
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,500
Who told you to hide?

320
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,500
Granny, stop it.

321
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:35,900
I...

322
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,740
I...

323
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,940
What are you arguing about?

324
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,380
Master, save me.

325
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,340
Granny Xun almost killed me.

326
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,460
Look at my hand.

327
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,820
I can't even wear the ring.

328
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,580
Granny Xun, what's going on?

329
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,740
Master,

330
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,820
I've been testing Mingyi

331
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,140
for some questions about the Qingyun Conference.

332
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,300
But I found that

333
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,100
she's too familiar with the rules of the Qingyun Conference.

334
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,460
She's far beyond the ordinary fairy.

335
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,580
I think Mingyi's identity

336
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,420
is very suspicious.

337
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,260
Please investigate it, Your Majesty.

338
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,260
Master,

339
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,100
don't you believe me?

340
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,220
Since Granny Xun said so,

341
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,980
I've been curious about it too.

342
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,220
The water of the Han River

343
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
is located on the mountain of Yaoguang.

344
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,300
It's on the border of the Qingyun Conference.

345
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,820
Most of the local people

346
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,340
are the fairy of the medicine.

347
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,700
They go out to collect the medicine every night.

348
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,780
It's very hard.

349
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,100
And you said

350
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,340
you have a poor family background.

351
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,860
But you

352
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,620
look like you're a rich man.

353
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,860
Although the Qingyun Conference

354
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,140
is a grand event,

355
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,940
the ordinary fairy

356
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,540
is not so familiar with it.

357
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,580
What's more, she knows it well.

358
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,820
The

359
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
The

360
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,340
It's 365 days a year.

361
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,220
My father is collecting medicine for 360 days.

362
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,620
His hands are black and red.

363
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,380
But he has no skin color.

364
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,100
I can't wash it no matter how I wash it.

365
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,420
I've been hoping that his hands would hold me since I was a child.

366
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,180
My mother

367
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,380
has been working as a embroidery shopkeeper for decades.

368
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,580
Her hands are always black and red.

369
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,020
But she kept stopping me from helping her.

370
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,780
It's them

371
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,020
who have cultivated the words of the adults

372
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,420
and respect me.

373
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,020
When they were alive,

374
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
I didn't take good care of them.

375
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,380
So I brought the Qingyun Conference

376
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,340
to the world.

377
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,780
I felt more pain than anyone else.

378
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,100
Because I don't want to leave any regrets.

379
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,780
Because

380
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,380
you

381
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,180
are the most important person to me now.

382
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,740
I want to know more about you.

383
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,940
Am I wrong?

384
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,140
Go on.

385
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,140
You want to

386
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,220
make her suspect on purpose?

387
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,780
Yes.

388
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,100
If you let down someone who loves you,

389
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,300
she will be ashamed.

390
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,020
You know this?

391
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,180
You think I'm a fool in the garden?

392
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,500
You're good at crying.

393
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,620
Come here.

394
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,820
Master,

395
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,580
what happened outside?

396
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,100
Nothing.

397
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,940
Go on.

398
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,660
Get away!

399
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,820
This hand...

400
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,540
Cut!

401
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,380
你看!

402
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,420
I... It's hurt.

403
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,500
No...

404
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,140
I

405
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,700
Giving you this portrait of Z Luxury

406
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,860
is a help to me.

407
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,520
You are going to

408
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,140
offer it to me?

409
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,780
My lord,

410
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,660
every year gala,

411
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,140
everyone gets ready self-entake Feudal Master's Salix.

412
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,700
But Kad信煒 isn't good at it.

413
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,860
That's ridiculous.

414
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,460
After steaming,

415
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,380
mix with the powder and sugar,

416
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,140
milk and other flowers.

417
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,140
After cooling, it will be ready.

418
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,860
Just like before,

419
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,620
you said less...

420
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,140
And the most important thing,

421
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,580
the meteor night.

422
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,620
The dew on the unique

423
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,260
fuxing flowers of the Heart-gathering Abyss.

424
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,020
How can I not remember

425
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,380
the recipe of the Heart-gathering Abyss

426
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,740
that all the gods know?

427
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,140
So,

428
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,460
you said it wrong on purpose.

429
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,500
Yes.

430
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,380
I know

431
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,620
that you and Granny Xun

432
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,100
don't believe me.

433
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,020
That's why

434
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,020
I keep saying

435
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,420
that I'm not right.

436
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,780
I've said it so many times.

437
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,180
I just want to find a chance to make it clear.

438
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,420
What do you mean by that?

439
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,740
I'm not right.

440
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,780
Get along well.

441
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,860
The plan

442
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,300
is the way to solve the problem.

443
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,940
Of course,

444
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,300
to solve the problem completely,

445
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,020
you need to give it a little more insight.

446
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,020
Then you clean it up.

447
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,820
Granny.

448
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,140
Ta-da.

449
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,660
Can you make a star-shaped cake?

450
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,020
What tricks are you playing?

451
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,740
I don't know how to do it.

452
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,900
I can do it

453
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
as long as you teach me.

454
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,100
And you're so tired today.

455
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,580
I have to show it to you.

456
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,500
I won't fall for your trick.

457
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,500
Granny is a snail.

458
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,460
She's like a leaf.

459
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,020
I added roses and fragrant leaves

460
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
to this star-shaped cake.

461
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,740
What do you think?

462
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,660
I don't want it. Get out.

463
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,260
Granny, don't do this.

464
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,780
Granny.

465
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,500
I really want to be your friend.

466
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,860
Look.

467
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,780
Mr. Ji left me here.

468
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,260
You suspect that I have a problem.

469
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,340
You'll report me if I make a small mistake.

470
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,220
It'll affect the adult world.

471
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,020
How about this?

472
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,260
Let's live in peace.

473
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,020
You should observe me more.

474
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,940
If I'm right,

475
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,020
then it's fine.

476
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,900
If I'm wrong,

477
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,940
you can catch me and drive me away.

478
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,100
It's a good idea.

479
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,860
Granny.

480
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,860
I just want to be good to Mr. Ji.

481
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Mr. Ji is born with a crime.

482
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,500
He has no confidant.

483
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,460
I think

484
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,300
you're also following him.

485
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,220
Why are you so loyal to him?

486
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,780
I'm not afraid to tell you.

487
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,300
He has been kind to me.

488
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,020
My ex-husband treated me very well.

489
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,900
I wanted to kill him

490
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,420
and live with him.

491
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,140
But he saved me by accident.

492
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,020
He even gave me a new path.

493
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,300
So I will never betray him.

494
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,300
It's the first time I've heard

495
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,860
you say so many words.

496
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,740
You have a good taste.

497
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,940
You're so generous.

498
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,380
The people around you

499
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,900
are as kind as me and Granny.

500
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,740
It's all yours.

501
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,180
Is it good?

502
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,180
You can have a taste.

503
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,140
My Lord.

504
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,820
The memory of the last move

505
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,300
won't be disturbed again.

506
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,500
Your Highness,

507
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,140
we have tried all kinds of ways.

508
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,700
That's what I had you to do.

509
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,260
Then tell me,

510
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,740
how should I punish

511
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,380
my lost쉬.

512
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,580
Your Highness.

513
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,180
how should I punish you?

514
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,060
Your Highness.

515
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,660
Let me teach you.

516
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,100
Do you know

517
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,940
what to do next?

518
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,220
Your Highness.

519
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,700
Give me another chance.

520
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:29,160
I'll find out exactly where her

521
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,920
Either)...

522
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,440
Or...

523
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,200
They almost killed her before I turned on the light,

524
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,760
Can't play with her?

525
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,160
Let's go.

526
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,480
Hurry!

527
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,000
Go!

528
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,480
Go!

529
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,060
Hurry!

530
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,780
Is he as Sri Lanka's Manta?

531
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,180
He was monsters from the people.

532
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,880
He was Human...

533
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,680
He was...

534
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,440
to attack Zhangwishan,

535
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,440
we only got half of the book.

536
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,400
If we don't get the whole book,

537
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,800
we can't make the lie.

538
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,440
Enough.

539
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,920
What are you talking about?

540
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,960
If you can't figure out

541
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,720
how to explain to Shang Ming,

542
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,240
no one can.

543
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,320
I have another trick.

544
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,160
The hook and the rope.

545
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,520
This trick is so vicious.

546
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,640
It seduces people and attracts them.

547
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,920
We have to reveal the truth.

548
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
If we can't figure it out,

549
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,600
it can only be Bo Yulan himself

550
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,960
who doesn't know where the medicine is.

551
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,320
As long as you give me the answer.

552
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,440
Master.

553
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,160
Your Highness.

554
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,040
General chasing Bo Yulan

555
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,360
with bribe of Afterlife.

556
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,320
He can't be taken.

557
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,440
He is no longer alive.

558
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:05,160
What's the problemberry taste

559
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
funding

560
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,840
higher

561
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,360
would like to

562
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,280
attend

563
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,160
did not

564
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,000
this

565
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,480
No.

566
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,200
Seems

567
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,440
he had a nightmare.

568
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,840
Brother Wei.

569
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,200
Master

570
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,560
was abused to death by them.

571
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,560
