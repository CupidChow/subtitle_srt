[Episode 28]

23
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,020
My Lord, did you drain your own power to refine

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,660
the Golden Millet Dream directly?

25
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,850
Planting the Golden Millet Dream within someone

26
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,180
takes an enormous amount of spiritual power,

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,620
and the process feels like being flayed alive.

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,690
You did all this so Ming Yi

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,210
could take it directly,

30
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,900
didn't you?

31
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,130
Did you really go that far?

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,850
Sorry, Master.

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,380
I made an oath

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,740
and promised you

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,570
not to let Golden Millet Dream appear again,

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,380
but

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,010
I must save her.

38
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,690
It's boring if you don't go crazy once.

39
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,340
I...

40
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,010
I really don't know what to say.

41
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,170
You said you'd use the Golden Millet Dream as bait

42
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,380
to avenge Fairy Bo,

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,610
so you hadn't used it on yourself.

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,890
And now, you suddenly

45
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,130
offered it to someone.

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,890
You exhausted a lot of your spiritual power,

47
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,780
so you probably cannot use the Spirit Well anymore.

48
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,100
I'm worried that you'd suddenly do something rash

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,170
at the Qingyun Tournament,

50
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,100
the Heavenly Grief in you relapse again suddenly,

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,570
but you can't even use the Spirit Well.

52
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,380
So you'll just die suddenly.

53
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,130
If I had known, I shouldn't have listened to you

54
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,980
and killed Ming Yi.

55
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,100
All right.

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,730
It's my first time hearing you say so many things.

57
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,250
Drink a little.

58
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,540
This is just temporary.

Spirit Well isn't gone.

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,220
I don't know what to say.

61
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,290
I don't agree

62
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,850
with you and Ming Yi being together.

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,900
Now that we have given her so much as the betrothal gift,

64
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,540
you must marry her no matter what!

65
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,250
Well said!

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,490
Do you think I was serious?

67
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,140
Of course.

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,850
I...

69
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,580
I'm sure she knows everything now.

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,930
I hope she is sensible

71
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,730
and will marry you immediately to repay you.

Besides,

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,170
why must she repay me?

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,980
Did you not even tell her that?

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,140
I...

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,370
You are not giving her an ordinary medicine.

You are giving her your life!

83
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,100
it was Situ Ling

84
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,290
who exchanged his heart's blood

Heart's blood

89
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,610
can only extend one's lifespan for a few hours.

90
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,610
Did she think

91
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,020
it could repair the spiritual veins destroyed by Heavenly Grief?

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,660
My Lord, Ming Yi isn't a fool.

93
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,810
Why would she believe that?

94
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,340
Situ Ling must have acted like a magnanimous savior too.

95
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,340
Oh, that was my heart's blood.

96
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,900
I stabbed myself for you.

97
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,900
Ming Yi was charmed.

And so touched she was that...

99
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,980
My Lord, have you told Ming Yi

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,540
about Situ Ling's real identity?

101
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,810
Not yet.

102
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,900
I understand.

103
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,250
I'll go and kill Situ Ling now.

104
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,250
What do you understand?

105
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,250
Come back.

106
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,540
You're not going to tell Ming Yi

107
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,660
Situ Ling's true identity

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,100
and you won't allow me to kill Situ Ling.

109
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,370
Now, you're letting Ming Yi

Ming Yi isn't that kind of person.

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,890
Forgive me for not welcoming you.

173
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,820
Since he's already here,

174
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,530
let's invite him to have a meal together.

175
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,180
Ming Yi,

176
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,370
why is he here?

177
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,610
He is here...

178
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,610
Of course, I'm here to accompany my wife.

179
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,490
What's wrong?

180
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,250
Ji Bozai.

181
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,010
I'm sure you haven't eaten yet, Ming Yi.

182
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,730
The teahouse has a few new dishes.

183
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,340
Let me treat you to a meal.

184
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,010
How can we let you treat us?

185
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,700
You are our guest, Immortal Situ.

186
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,980
I should be the one treating you.

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,980
What do you say, Ming Yi?

188
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,890
I...

189
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,940
I want...

190
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,580
I want

191
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,300
both of you to eat without me.

192
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,130
Are you not coming?

193
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,650
Fresh flowers!

194
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,300
Have a look at some fresh flowers, miss!

195
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,180
Have a look at the flowers.

196
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,580
Lanterns!

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,010
What a coincidence.

198
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,340
Did you come here to eat, too?

199
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,730
Let's eat together.

200
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,940
The new dishes taste better than the old ones.

201
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,340
Try them, Ming Yi.

202
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,650
Only two people can sit here.

203
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,770
Why are you still here then?

204
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,100
Don't you think you're a nuisance?

205
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,100
Here.

206
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,300
This is your favorite.

207
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,220
You should try this instead.

208
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,420
Something that you haven't tried before is always better.

209
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,250
Let me try it.

210
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,730
It tastes so bad.

211
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,770
It's rancid.

212
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,370
Fine.

213
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,530
Enjoy the food. Don't waste anything.

214
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,250
I'll be leaving.

215
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,180
They will pay for me.

216
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,370
Sure.

217
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,530
Immortal Situ, thanks for paying the bill.

218
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,580
However, I must remind you

219
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,490
that you know who you truly are.

220
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,650
If you insist on approaching my wife, Ming Yi,

221
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,530
and bring trouble to her,

222
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,820
I won't forgive you.

223
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,820
What do you mean?

224
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,130
Sir, pack them for me.

225
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,100
Sure.

226
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,850
Buy two, get one free!

227
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,820
Final two pairs!

228
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,420
Thank you.

229
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,250
Take care.

230
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,250
Sorry.

231
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,490
Watch where you're going!

232
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,420
Fresh flowers!

233
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,820
Take a look at some fresh flowers!

234
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,490

No matter how much I've done

and how long I've waited,

253
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,180
when I see her eyes again,

254
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,530
they

255
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,010
are still the same as before.

256
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,490
She does not see me.

257
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,330
My Lord,

258
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,570
I will never betray you.

259
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,330
If you want,

260
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,730
I can share my lifespan with you.

261
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,530
Is it worth it?

262
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,860
You did so much for Ming Yi, but it was all in vain.

263
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,570
Have you asked yourself the same question as well?

264
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,700
I thought it was worth it in the beginning.

265
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,940
But I asked myself again and again today,

266
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,090
what can I do for her

267
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,620
that I haven't done yet?

268
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,700
I could even give up my life,

269
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,380
but she still

270
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,380
doesn't care about me.

271
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,570
Who hurt you so badly?

272
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,290
She set up the Yaoguang Mountain Fire Array.

273
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,090
I duped her with a secret skill of Yousu Fox Tribe

274
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,490
and made a copy.

275
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,860
They won't find out.

[Bo's Medical Classics]

277
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,330
My Lord,

278
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,490
it's time to think about yourself now.

279
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,900
You can use this to complete His Majesty's mission

280
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,730
or use it to create the Golden Millet Dream.

281
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,730
I wanted to use the Golden Millet Dream

282
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,730
and grew spiritual veins in the past

283
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,420
for her.

284
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,940
If I can't be with her,
(Watch on www.kisskh,at to support Admin)

285
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,090
all of this is meaningless.

286
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,900
Only by obtaining spiritual veins

287
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,530
and rising to a high position

288
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,620
will we not be bullied by anyone else.

289

My Lord,

290
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,460
you can become the person you want to become

291
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,620
for your own sake.

292
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,900
Can I?

293
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,460
You're back.

294
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,730
Yes.

295
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,330
I followed Situ Ling

296
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,620
to the cliff by the border.

297
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,180
However, he used a spell

298
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,290
to cover all his tracks.

299
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,090
It's fine.

300
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,700
Go to the tea gathering with me after this.

301
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,420
Keep a close eye on Zhushui's and Yaoguang Mountain's movements.

302
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,730
Once they make a move,

303
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,700
they'll surely give themselves away.

304
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,530
We just need to wait for them to make a mistake.

305
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,620
At least for now,

306
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,250
Situ Ling bears no malice toward Ming Yi.

307
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,620
Maybe not toward Ming Yi,

308
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,980
but surely toward you.

309
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,940
You really are talking more and more now.

310
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,140
Isn't that good?

311
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,490
Good.

312
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,380
Very good.

313
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,940
You feel more human now.

314
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,090
My Lord,

315
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,700
did you experience something good today?

316
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,180
Even if you don't tell me, I can guess it.

317
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,900
I'm sure it's related to Fairy Ming Yi.

318
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,140
Did Fairy Ming Yi finally decide

319
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,180
to marry you?

320
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,010
I told you so.

321
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,900
Your previous method

322
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,620
of pretending to be cold won't work.

323
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,140
You need to tell her

324
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,860
so she knows your true feelings.

325
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,330
I want to tell her my feelings as well.

326
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,940
If only I had a chance.

327
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,980
What did you say, My Lord?

328
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,900
I said you were right.

329
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,050
You were right.

330
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,770
You haven't fallen for anyone before.

331
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,010
You are clueless about many things.

332
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,090
In my opinion,

333
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,620
you should meet some

334
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,460
female dragons,

335
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,140
butterflies,

336
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,180
or phoenixes.

337
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,050
Don't be so violent to the point

338
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,290
that you've turned into a fool.

339
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,440
Take a look.

340
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,700

Unless he's dead,

349
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,860
why would he reply to me with just a "I'm fine"?

350
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,860
He's mostly dead.

351
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,730
Tell me.

352
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,420
Do you think he is married already?

353
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,620
Or is he

354
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,620
cheating on me?

355
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,530
I'm Jixing Abyss's fairy.

356
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,420
Am I being lied to by this brat?

357
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,290
No.

358

You won't.

359
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,570
I asked you to drink

360
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,570
but I didn't ask you to get drunk.

361
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,010
- Slowly. - Be careful.

Chen Xi,

390
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,660
I've always wanted to ask you this.

391
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,250
I didn't take you in as my disciple.

392
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,980
Why do you keep calling me your master?

393
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,180
The Empress said

394
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,940
you came to Shouhua Academy

395
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,620
to teach me forging.

396
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,250
Therefore, you are my master.

Sit.

398

Why do you want to become a forger?

401
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,660
My brother was also a forger.

402
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,570
He was attacked by Gudiao

403
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,660
when he tried to save his friends

404
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,420
and died in the Qingyun Tournament.

405
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,660
Your brother might no longer be around

406
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,180
but the skills he taught you

407
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,530
allow you

408
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,860
to make more powerful weapons to help others,

409
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,730
so that those with weak spiritual powers

410
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,980
can protect the people they love.

411
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,050
From today onward,

00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,380
I will monitor you daily so you'll work hard

413

00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,700
I don't know

513
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,530
when Master She gave this to me.

514
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:09,820
This...

515
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,490
What is this?

516
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,530
Isn't this yours?

517
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:20,980
Why are you asking me?

518
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,380
I...

519
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,300
Why did I bring it from Yaoguang Mountain?

520
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,740
Twenty-Seven.

521
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,130
I saw that.

522
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,170
Why are you picking up random items all the time?

523
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,420
I haven't reprimanded you

524
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,420
for picking up Ming Xin's shoes.

525
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,690
What is this?

526
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,340
It looks nice.

527
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,820
See? You just pick up all kinds of junk.

528
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,940
Twenty-Seven brought it to me

529
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,010
at Yaoguang Mountain.

530
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,090
Cats like to pick up

531
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,490
shiny items.

532
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,900
I don't know what it is.

533
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:27,940
I...

534
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,420
Why do you have one as well?

535
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,420
This is a Recording Mirror.

536
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,980
I found my half at Dragon Carp Terrace.

537
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,980
After Buxiu's investigation,

538
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,980
the name list left behind by Mu Qibai

539
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,980
is this Recording Mirror.

540
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,260
When Mu Qibai made a deal with the Upper Three Realms,

541
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,260
he split a Recording Mirror in two.

542
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,740
They'll each keep one half

543
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,090
to keep each other in check.

544
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,460
Immortal Ji, are you saying

545
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,820
that the two pieces we have now

546
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,740
are the Recording Mirror?

547
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,940
Your half must be Mu Qibai's.

548
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,650
Mine is Ming Xin's.

549
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,170
Twenty-Seven is quite smart.

550
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,570
Did he just so happen

551
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,570
to steal this

552
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,420
from Ming Xin?

553
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,130
Who knows?

554
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,260
Perhaps it's because you are the owner.

555
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,380
The cat is just like its owner.

556
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,780
Although we are still missing one piece,

557
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,690
it's enough to see some things.

558
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,610
The Heavenly Grief you asked for.

559
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,090
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng.

560
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,130
With the Heavenly Grief,

561
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,530
Ming Xian

562
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,780
will no longer be the Warrior God of Yaoguang Mountain.

563
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,860
It was Ming Xin who made the deal with Mu Qibai.

564
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,740
I can recognize his voice even if he is mute,

565
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,690
let alone not seeing his face.

566
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,900
Twenty-Seven is an amazing thief.

567
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,090
He stole this.

568
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,300
Are you missing something?

569
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,260
It seems like Ming Xin

570
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,900
was the one who poisoned you with Heavenly Grief.

571
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,010
The truth is not surprising at all.

572
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,690
The missing piece of the Recording Mirror

573
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,130
is probably with Ming Xin.

574
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,820
I must get it during the tea gathering this time

575
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,460
so that I have complete evidence

576
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,090
to prove that it was Ming Xin who poisoned me.

577
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,610
Oh, one more thing.

578
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,650
You were grateful to Situ Ling for saving you

579
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,610
and didn't expose his identity.

580
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,010
I asked Buxiu to find out who he is.

581
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,980
You know everything now?

582
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,980
Yes.

583
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,780
I also found out

584
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,570
Situ Ling is the youngest son of Zhushui's Emperor,

585
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,380
Chao Yuan.

586
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,650
He came to Jixing Abyss for the Golden Millet Dream.

587
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,940
He saved me after I came out of Wugui Sea.

588
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,820
He told me honestly that he was from Zhushui Spiritual State

589
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,690
and that he came to Jixing Abyss for the Golden Millet Dream.

590
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,460
Moreover...

591
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,340
Are you all right?

592
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,490
We must leave here immediately.

593
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,980
Zhushui Spiritual State has a backup plan.

594
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,010
How do you know that?

595
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,780
No wonder he went to the Sunken Abyss that day

596
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,170
without waiting for us.

597
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,380
He even gave Master She the Bo's Medical Classics he found.

598
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,530
That was when Master and I started feeling suspicious.

599
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,090
In that case,

600
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,170
he is still a dangerous person.

601
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,130
You're back.

602
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,340
Father.

603
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,530
I've found the complete formula for the Golden Millet Dream

604
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,170
and all the herbs required.

605
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,940
However, the catalyst herb, Diwu tree's core,

606
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,050
has been extinct for 10,000 years.

607
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,740
I don't know where to find it.

608
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,820
Please aid me, Father.

609
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,530
Do you think I will have something

610
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,010
that has been extinct for 10,000 years?

611
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,300
If it cannot be found in Zhushui Spiritual State,

612
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,460
then there's no need

613
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:21,940
[Bo's Medical Classics]

614
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,460
for this formula to remain in this world.

615
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,170
Father,

616
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,300
I'm the only one who has read the whole book.

617
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,650
I remember

618
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,050
every word in it

619
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,460
and can copy it down any time.

620
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,090
Once I make this medicine,

621
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,820
I'll surely hand it over to you, Father.

622
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,860
Chao Yuan,

623
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,980
you've achieved this mastery with the Thousand Insect Spell.

624
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,980
You are also braver

625
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,740
than you were in the past.

626
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,260
You actually dare negotiate with me.

627
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,610
Great.

628
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,050
I like it a lot.

629
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,300
You've laid low for many years.

630
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,090
Tell me

631
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,130
what your ambition is.

632
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,650
I want to grow my own spiritual veins

633
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,820
and become the ruler of Zhushui Spiritual State

634
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,570
that everyone admires.

635
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,090
I want to become the heir whom you recognize.

636
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,650
I want you to tell me everything.

637
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,900
Under your arrangement,

638
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,570
what will become of Zhushui Spiritual State

639
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,980
and the Qingyun Tournament?

640
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,900
I want

641
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,820
to overcome destiny itself.

642
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,650
Among my sons,

643
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,690
you resemble me the most.

644
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,130
Two years ago, Jixing Abyss lost in the tournament

645
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,050
and had to offer a tribute to Yaoguang Mountain and our realm.

646
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,260
The rarest of the tributes

647
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,530
were two wilted roots of Diwu tree.

648
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,300
The one offered to Yaoguang Mountain

649
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,740
was stolen by Bo Yulan.

650
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,610
That was why

651
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,690
Bo Yulan was caught by Mu Qibai.

652
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,980
The remaining one

653
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,340
was sent to this realm.

654
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,690
It's up to you now

655
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,530
to nurture it back to health.

656
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,260
Thank you, Father.

657
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,460
Come out.

658
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,570
Your Majesty, congratulations on soon obtaining theGolden Millet Dream.

659
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,380
You may rule over the Six Realms.

660
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,980
There's no need to flatter me.

661
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,860
I summoned you here

662
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,380
