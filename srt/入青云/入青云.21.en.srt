00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,280
{\an8}LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

2
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,920
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
"LOVE IN THE CLOUDS"

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 21

4
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,520
Princess Tianji sent a missive

5
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,800
saying that Mu Qibai
had been incarcerated.

6
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,680
It is a great thing,

7
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,360
but I don't feel reassured.

8
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,600
If there's a mastermind behind Mu Qibai,

9
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,400
he won't live to see another day.

10
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,400
Yet he still lives now.

11
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,560
Perhaps he has a backup plan?

12
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
Your Lordship,
all the guards have been taken down.

13
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,600
Please come with me.

14
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,000
Ji Bozai has eliminated the netherbeasts.

15
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,280
Lord Jingxi also died in Jixing Abyss.

16
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,480
My Lord, what should we do now?

17
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,240
Let it be.

18
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,760
I never intend to work for
Zhushui Spiritual State anyway.

19
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,000
I just wanted to convince them

20
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,160
to entrust the task of
raising netherbeasts to me

21
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,280
so that

22
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,960
I can enact my own plan.

23
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Shao Qun.

24
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,560
<i>You're my only confidant now.</i>

25
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,680
<i>In this desperate time,</i>

26
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,880
<i>we must raise another</i>
<i>netherbeast as soon as possible.</i>

27
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,280
<i>Rest assured, My Lord.</i>

28
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
<i>The most dangerous</i>
<i>place is the safest place.</i>

29
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,880
<i>I shall raise it with my soul and flesh.</i>

30
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,440
<i>No one will find out.</i>

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,400
<i>My Lord, your ambition</i>
<i>will come to fruition.</i>

32
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,280
One last step now.

33
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,840
Shao Qun.

34
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,640
I didn't expect today to come.

35
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,760
My Lord, if you hadn't saved me,

36
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,320
I would have been
eaten alive by the hounds.

37
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,960
It is my honor to die
for your legacy, My Lord.

38
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,400
Shao Qun. When you're gone,

39
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,040
no one will protect me like you do.

40
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,760
Worry not, My Lord.

41
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,880
I will always protect you.

42
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,840
Take care, My Lord.

43
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,680
Something happened in the Sunken Abyss.

44
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,720
It must be the netherbeast army.

45
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,400
How come? Didn't we eliminate all of them?

46
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,480
It's Mu Qibai.

47
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,440
Mu Qibai somehow raised new netherbeasts.

48
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,880
It's too late to stop him now.

49
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
So he does have a contingency plan.

50
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,360
TIANJI: MU QIBAI FLED WITH
THE HELP OF THE NETHERBEAST ARMY.

51
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
Mu Qibai escaped
with the netherbeast army,

52
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
and he will be hiding.

53
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,920
The Prayer Night is around the corner.

54
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
The power of
the stars will be at its strongest,

55
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,880
but so will the power of the netherbeasts.

56
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
That is the best moment
for Mu Qibai to invade Jixing Palace.

57
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,680
I have a solution.

58
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,920
Ming Xian once invented
a demon-repelling parasol.

59
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,560
Yaoguang Mountain dislikes artifacts,

60
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,760
so the Emperor of Yaoguang Mountain

61
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,080
destroyed it before he even inspected it.

62
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,600
But I saw how he made it,

63
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,400
so I can replicate it.

64
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,559
Are you serious about
making the demon-repelling parasol?

65
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
Has it ever crossed your mind
that if someone from Jixing Palace

66
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,880
recognized your work,

67
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,039
your identity would be exposed?

68
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,040
The netherbeast army
threatens all Six Realms.

69
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,520
If we do not seal it,
many more innocent people will die.

70
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,520
Master also told us about the calamity

71
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,800
a century ago by the Spiritual Veins Fairy
who raised netherbeasts.

72
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
- Have you forgotten?
- Butâ€¦

73
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,920
But what if they find
out you're Ming Xian?

74
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,280
They will kill you
even if you save them. You know it.

75
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,040
But that hasn't happened.

76
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,640
The netherbeast
army is the current threat.

77
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,080
If I can help,
I mustn't stand by and do nothing.

78
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
How very characteristic of you,

79
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,080
Ming Xian.

80
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,680
Princess Tianji,
Immortal Ji, and Fairy Ming Yi.

81
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,880
I planted the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop
inside Immortal Ji.

82
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,640
{\an8}My act is inexcusable.

83
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,920
{\an8}LETTER OF REPENTANCE

84
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,560
{\an8}I was misled.

85
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,160
{\an8}Why would I fall for it, though?

86
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,680
It is inexcusable nonetheless.

87
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,040
I wonder if Tianji will forgive me

88
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,160
{\an8}once I give her this letter of repentance.

89
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,880
Why have you summoned me today,

90
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,320
Your Highness?

91
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,960
Immortal Yan.

92
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
After my uncle
raised the netherbeast army,

93
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,920
where did he go?

94
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,360
His Majesty has made a full recovery.

95
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,240
You have many ways to locate him.

96
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,400
Why consult a physician like me?

97
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
Because you will indulge me,

98
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,360
won't you?

99
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,000
Actually, I can also
give you what Lord Hanfeng

100
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,920
promised you.

101
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,840
You can't.

102
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,160
Lord Hanfeng may not inherit Jixing Abyss,

103
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,680
but it still needs a leader.

104
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,680
Your Highness,
do you still wish to marry Ji Bozai

105
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,160
so that he can run Jixing Abyss
as the prince consort?

106
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,360
Or, do you wish to run Jixing Abyss

107
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,600
as an empress?

108
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,720
Surprised?

109
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,680
You did not hide your ambition well.

110
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,040
You even doubt if you can make it.

111
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,600
That's why you play
it safe and look for a suitor

112
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
so that you can be the de facto leader

113
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,040
of Jixing Abyss behind your husband.

114
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,440
But Tianji,

115
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,320
you're not the only one

116
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,720
who is ambitious in this world.

117
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I am too.

118
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,280
Since you're so unsure of yourself,

119
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,640
why not marry me

120
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,120
and let me run Jixing Abyss instead?

121
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,880
What? You can't do it?

122
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,840
If you can't let go of your self-interest,

123
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,440
how can you convince
me to betray Lord Hanfeng?

124
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,400
Xiao, tell me.

125
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
What is my uncle going to do next?

126
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,400
I can give you anything you want.

127
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,920
Why would you

128
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,240
put something like this on the line?

129
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,240
Isn't this what you want, Yan Xiao?

130
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,680
To become more powerful,

131
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,000
you serve someone
who raised a netherbeast army.

132
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,200
So, let's go with your plan then.

133
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll marry you

134
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,040
and we'll work together.

135
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
What do you think?

136
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,960
Mu Tianji.

137
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,880
First, it was Ji Bozai.

138
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Now, it's me.

139
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,040
Anyone can be your husband, is that so?

140
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,080
Yan Xiao!

141
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,280
Of course, not.

142
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
After all, you weren't even
in my consideration in the past.

143
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,000
Your Highness, think it through.

144
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,160
Meng Yangqiu

145
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,120
is the best candidate
to be the prince consort.

146
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,720
After all, he worships

147
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,240
every word you say

148
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,120
and every line you speak.

149
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,440
Besides,

150
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,520
- he is incapable of betraying you.
- Yan Xiao, you jerk!

151
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,160
Do you think everyone is like you?

152
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,280
Iâ€¦

153
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,120
Tianji.

154
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm fine.

155
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm fine.

156
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,920
- Like this. Yes.
- Thank you.

157
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,400
- No worries.
- Take a parasol.

158
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,200
- Take a parasol.
- Thank you.

159
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,040
- Use it. Take a parasol.
- Thank you.

160
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,360
You're welcome.

161
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,880
- Come take your demon-repelling parasol.
- Sure.

162
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,080
Thank you.

163
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,040
Take it.

164
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

165
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,920
Here.

166
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,240
Sure.

167
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,360
- Take a parasol.
- Thank you.

168
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
You're welcome.

169
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,840
Here. Take a parasol.

170
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,040
- Come.
- Thank you.

171
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,680
- Thank you.
- Take a parasol.

172
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,000
I have some good tea inside.

173
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,240
- Try it.
- No, thanks.

174
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,800
- We need to hand out the parasols.
- Thank you. Come inside.

175
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,720
All right.

176
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,200
- Okay.
- Here.

177
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,120
Thank you.

178
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,839
Great timing.

179
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,319
Will you try
the demon-repelling parasol for me?

180
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,119
The artisans crafted
them using the blueprint

181
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,119
given by Ming Yi.

182
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,160
Tianji.

183
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,880
Is the parasol broken?

184
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,920
This parasol is amazing!

185
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,040
Spin it and its power will be activated

186
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,000
to create a defensive barrier.

187
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,800
Meng Yangqiu.

188
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,560
You'll have to train harder.

189
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,400
Perhaps

190
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,160
you can learn from Chen Xi.

191
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,200
Chen Xi.

192
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,600
Teach me how to do it.

193
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,560
Call me Master then.

194
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,440
I'll buy you candies.

195
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,920
Deal!

196
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,800
DEMON-REPELLING PARASOL BLUEPRINT

197
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,600
Is this for Zhang Tai?

198
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,880
She just learned to
use her spiritual veins.

199
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,520
I want to make
her an artifact that she can use.

200
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,720
Did you design that fan as well?

201
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,160
The demon-repelling parasols

202
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,160
can protect the vulnerable ones.

203
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,120
But to seal more netherbeasts,

204
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,160
we'll have to reinforce
the power contained in the artifact.

205
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
Once you're done,

206
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,800
I'll inject my power into it.

207
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
Your master is already head over heels.

208
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,440
Your master fell in love first.

209
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,040
As if she doesn't know
she already has a fiancÃ©.

210
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,480
- Youâ€¦
- Yes?

211
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,240
Your master did it first.

212
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,160
Look at him.

213
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
He developed feelings first.

214
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,000
No, your master couldn't control herself.

215
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,760
That's why they're
stuck in this situation.

216
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,640
She couldn't control herself?

217
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,960
Your master is way too shameless.

218
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,640
That's why they are stuck.

219
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,920
Stop it, you two.

220
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,120
Actually,

221
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,240
I do have a request, Immortal Ji.

222
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,080
The fan used by
Ming Xian is called Embers.

223
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,520
It is very powerful,

224
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,120
and can be used to subdue netherbeasts.

225
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,560
Embers?

226
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,160
So its name is Embers.

227
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,440
What a great name.

228
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,600
You want it back?

229
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,080
Can I?

230
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,840
Sure.

231
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,800
But I destroyed it already.

232
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,880
What?

233
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,040
Embers is myâ€¦

234
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,320
Ming Xian's most treasured artifact.

235
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,560
Do you have any idea how many netherbeasts
it can defeat?

236
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,120
What does it have to do with me?

237
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,640
Ming Yi.

238
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,400
We are spouses who share a heart imprint

239
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,720
and who had our names
carved on the Marriage Stone.

240
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,600
You're impossible.

241
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,040
What did I say?

242
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,960
Look at your master.

243
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,440
Look. Open your eyes.

244
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,720
Are you upset now?

245
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,520
Granny Xun. Quick. Help him.

246
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,160
Let me massage your dragon horns

247
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,120
- and save you.
- Go away.

248
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,000
Brush your cat whiskers instead.

249
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,760
You sure you don't want
to see how smitten your master is?

250
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,760
Are you sure?

251
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,520
My master couldn't
control herself, you said.

252
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,920
We don't know what will happen

253
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,760
when we fight Mu Qibai,

254
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,760
but I will protect you.

255
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,400
However,

256
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,400
you must be prepared.

257
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,000
If I survive,

258
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,440
you will not be able to escape from me.

259
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,120
What if I say,

260
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,960
instead of you protecting me,

261
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,080
why don't we protect each other?

262
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,120
Xun Ming mentioned
Heartbond Array in the Illusory Realm.

263
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
Ancient tomes also said

264
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,160
that it could seal netherbeasts.

265
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,840
During the netherbeast
calamity a century ago,

266
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,000
it was the Heartbond Array
that sealed them.

267
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,040
To use the array, the spellcasters
must be of one mind and one heart.

268
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
If not,

269
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,560
they will be caught in self-immolation.

270
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,320
And it's precisely due to this high risk

271
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,440
that no one has practiced it since then.

272
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,680
If that's what we have to do,

273
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,560
then it's not that complicated.

274
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,640
After all,

275
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,400
we are of the same mind.

276
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,000
<i>Aren't you in love with my niece?</i>

277
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,840
<i>What's love compared to power?</i>

278
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
<i>Princess Tianji is</i>
<i>incapable of leading Jixing Abyss.</i>

279
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,480
<i>Even if I side with her,</i>

280
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,720
<i>we will only become fodder</i>
<i>to the netherbeast army.</i>

281
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,680
<i>After I ascend the throne,</i>

282
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,880
the position of
Lord Hanfeng will be vacant.

283
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,240
In my opinion,

284
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,880
you are good enough to carry that title.

285
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,880
I promise you

286
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,000
that you will be a non-relative vassal,

287
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,840
the next Lord Hanfeng.

288
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,520
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng.

289
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,920
No.

290
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

291
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,040
At ease.

292
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,520
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

293
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,920
Even though Tianji can wake her father up,

294
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,840
the divine enfeebling
powder will still take effect.

295
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,120
Your Majesty
can nonetheless accede legitimately.

296
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,040
Now that my brother has
taken enough enfeebling powder,

297
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,560
fighting him during the Prayer Night
is the best option.

298
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,840
Then, we'll declare
that Jixing Abyss has a new emperor.

299
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,440
What do you think?

300
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,920
Wise choice, Your Majesty.

301
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,680
Lord Chengyun, you were
gravely injured in Jixing Abyss.

302
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,200
Now that you have recovered slightly,

303
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,000
you came to my state in private.

304
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,520
Your emperor might just hold
you accountable for your actions here.

305
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,960
I came

306
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,880
to negotiate with you, Your Majesty.

307
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,440
Negotiate?

308
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,880
How arrogant.

309
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,440
Your Majesty, surely you are aware

310
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,360
that Jixing Abyss is in turmoil lately.

311
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,800
First, Your Majesty was misled

312
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,600
into underestimating

313
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,160
Ji Bozai's power in
the Qingyun Tournament.

314
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,880
That already ruined your plan.

315
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,120
Then, came Mu Qibai,

316
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,960
who sabotaged your years
of effort in raising netherbeasts,

317
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,760
and even caused the death of Lord Jingxi.

318
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,840
Jixing Abyss

319
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,560
is digging its own grave.

320
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,680
I am offering my help

321
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,440
to get rid of Jixing Abyss.

322
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,640
In exchange,
I pray Your Majesty can aid me

323
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,960
in becoming
the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

324
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,840
My son, Chao Yu, died in Jixing Abyss.

325
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,320
Not only did Mu Qibai
fail to disclose this to me,

326
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,640
but he even harbored the netherbeast core

327
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,480
in an attempt to go against me.

328
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,320
I confer this important item to you.

329
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,840
We'll see

330
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,200
if you can make good use of it.

331
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,560
It is my honor to serve you, Your Majesty.

332
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,520
You will not be disappointed

333
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,080
for Jixing Abyss will be no more.

334
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,840
The Prayer Night is upon Jixing Abyss.

335
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,120
In these three long
nights, all plants will wilt.

336
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,320
After the Prayer Night,

337
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,800
the cycle begins anew.
Everything shall be reborn.

338
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,600
The emperor uses
his spiritual power as the foundation

339
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,080
to borrow the power of
the stars before praying for all beings.

340
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,640
May the benevolent
stars strengthen our power.

341
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,680
May the ones present live a long life.

342
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,880
May the light in
Jixing Abyss shine for an eternity.

343
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,160
I pray to you, the benevolent stars.

344
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,520
I pray to you, the auspicious emperor.

345
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,280
- Excuse me.
- This one is good.

346
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,920
- These ones are so pretty.
- What about this one?

347
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
Let me see the one on your wrist.

348
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,640
Check this out.

349
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,920
- It's so pretty.
- Let me see.

350
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,920
I love the color.

351
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,840
Look.

352
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,040
What is happening?

353
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,880
What is this?

354
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,840
Blessings to all beings!

355
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,480
Ming Yi.

356
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,360
Father,

357
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,240
are you all right?

358
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,080
Surprised?

359
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,120
Yuanfeng, you held the Prayer Night

360
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,320
so that you can fool everyone

361
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,520
into thinking that Jixing Abyss
is as prosperous as always.

362
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,640
But you should know

363
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,000
that the superficial
prosperity is meaningless.

364
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,520
What Jixing Abyss needs is real power.

365
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,160
Father!

366
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,800
Yuanfeng, you are poisoned.

367
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,480
When you invoked
your poisoned power to pray,

368
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,680
you incurred a great curse.

369
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,600
Even the strongest
warrior you have is powerless.

370
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,040
Lord Hanfeng is revolting.

371
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,280
Split into two teams.

372
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,480
One team to protect
the subjects of Jixing Abyss.

373
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,280
One team to head to Jixing Palace with me.

374
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,200
Noted.

375
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,920
Yuanfeng,

376
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,200
sign on this Abdication Decree

377
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,880
with your blood

378
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,960
so that I can run Jixing Abyss.

379
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,320
Then, I'll end everything.
What do you say?

380
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,080
You will be relieved of your heavy burden.

381
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,360
And I, as the only
person in the Six Realms

382
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,280
who can command the netherbeasts,

383
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,360
will lead the netherbeast army

384
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,080
to conquer Zhushui Spiritual State.

385
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Jixing Abyss will be one of
the Upper Realms forever in the future.

386
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,640
Resist no more, Yuanfeng.

387
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,960
The divine enfeebling
powder Yan Xiao gave you

388
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,240
is not an ordinary poison.

389
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,240
I did not wish to do this.

390
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,920
But your cowardice and risk aversion

391
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,480
turned what was strong into weak.

392
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,080
And the fitting ending for the weak

393
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,520
is death.

394
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,400
ABDICATION DECREE

395
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,200
You said you're
doing this for Jixing Abyss,

396
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,400
but the first thing
you do is to sacrifice our people.

397
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,680
They are our subjects!

398
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,880
You will be feared momentarily,

399
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,840
and hated for life.

400
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,120
Yuanfeng,

401
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,680
it doesn't seem like
we'll ever reach a consensus.

402
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,280
Mu Qibai.

403
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,000
Sorry for the long wait.

404
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
Aren't you supposed to beâ€¦

405
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,000
Father, are you all right?

406
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,720
All of you are supposed to be poisoned.

407
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,240
One must deliberately fall for the trap

408
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,720
before one can catch the ringleader.

409
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,880
Mu Qibai asked me to add

410
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,920
the divine enfeebling
powder to the emperor's medicine.

411
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,840
His Majesty will have
a damaged constitution within two weeks.

412
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,000
And as His Majesty

413
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,160
uses his poisoned power to pray
for everyone during the Prayer Night,

414
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,800
all beings will be poisoned.

415
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,000
Your decision to side with me seems final.

416
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,600
I thought
it was just another part of your plan.

417
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,320
Mu Qibai commands the netherbeast army.

418
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,680
He is more likely to win. I did waver.

419
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,760
But rest assured, Ji.

420
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,960
I crave power, but I do have a principle.

421
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,680
I know

422
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,280
right from wrong.

423
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,920
I'm curious.

424
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,120
Why me, Yan?

425
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,240
Why not work with your childhood
friend, Princess Tianji?

426
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,200
Mu Qibai

427
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,480
might be more terrifying than we imagined.

428
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
I must deceive Tianji too.

429
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,240
Otherwise, I won't be
able to earn Mu Qibai's trust.

430
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,480
Ji,

431
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,920
if things
do not turn out the way we anticipated,

432
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,240
please

433
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,080
do your best to protect Her Highness.

434
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,360
I suppose

435
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,760
there's no running away from the poison

436
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,880
Mu Qibai instructed you to put in us.

437
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,040
Uncle,

438
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,120
give up already.

439
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,200
Even if your plan works today,

440
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
your illegitimate coup d'Ã©tat

441
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,800
will not convince everyone to follow you.

442
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,560
Yuanfeng has been ill for a long time.

443
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,560
His days are numbered

444
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,040
but there is no clear heir in sight.

445
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,800
Jixing Abyss will have a leader.

446
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,400
I will carry this burden
as long as I still live.

447
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,640
I run the Shouhua Academy.

448
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,840
I can make sure
Jixing Abyss rises to the Upper Realms

449
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,320
without killing anyone.

450
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,920
I won't let Jixing Abyss return

451
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,960
to the days when
it had to kowtow to others.

452
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,360
Preposterous.

453
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,840
How naive of you to think

454
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,400
that faith alone can make
the other Five Realms submit to you.

455
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,080
Her Highness has her way.

456
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,200
She merely used faith to tell you

457
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,000
that one must lead
a realm with principles.

458
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,160
Do not twist her words.

459
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,640
Why? Do you think
she should learn from you,

460
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,920
who first colluded with Outer Realm,

461
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,840
and now relies on
a wild and volatile power?

462
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,160
You will only meet your own demise.

463
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,240
You know nothing.

464
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,200
Don't lose it.

465
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,000
Get in formation!
