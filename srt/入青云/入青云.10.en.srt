1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or the heat that will last only in the wind and rain

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are a warm feeling that is as warm as the heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Memories have been fighting for you since then

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The hero that I can't forget

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The one that I can't escape from is the love

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Love you so much that I can't forget

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This fresh fish head is really delicious

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This chicken is really delicious

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's really delicious

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's really delicious

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's really delicious

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Look at me

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Your music skills are really outstanding

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Lord of the Deceased has sent an invitation

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I also want to see your music skills

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He is now the key to my power

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You should know what to do

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Brother

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Do you want to refuse to share my worries?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I naturally want to share your worries

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's good

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Then go

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The Lord of the Deceased

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Do you know that my sister died because of you?

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Just let me die

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why do I want your life?

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My sister is already dead

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How can you come back to life after you die?

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Xu Ming

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You remember with me

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Your life is not yours

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's what my sister wants, it's what our family wants

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What you have to do in the future

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Is to continue to bring the demon beast back to life

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Otherwise, how can you do anything to my sister?

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The Lord of the Deceased

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The Lord of the Deceased

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The Lord of the Deceased

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't be your light

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Good day

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Very good

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The auspicious time is coming

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We choose this place

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Xu Ming will come

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He will come

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He knows this wedding is for him

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Wu Li is curious

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Even if he knows that there are tigers in the mountains

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He will want to know what trap he set for him

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
At that time, the chance to wake up

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Open his illusion

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Can save Zhang Tai

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How does it sound like many people?

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Lord Qi

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Lord Qi

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Lord Qi

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Lord Qi

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Congratulations, Lord Qi

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Congratulations, Lord Qi

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Lord Qi

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Congratulations

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Lord Qi

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Congratulations!

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Congratulations!

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Congratulations, Mr. Ji!

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Congratulations, Mr. Ji!

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Congratulations, Mr. Ji!

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Mr. Ji, you did a great job!

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why didn't you inform us about the wedding?

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Exactly!

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You did a great job!

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You made these tables look like a hole!

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Luckily, we got the news in advance.

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So we came here in time.

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
To help you have fun.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How did the guards know?

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't worry about that.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come on!

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Come on!

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Come on!

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Come on!

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Come on!

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come on!

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Come on!

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Come on!

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You two got married?

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I heard you didn't believe it.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But now it seems to be true.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The late emperor lied to us.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He said he would spend the rest of his life with us.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But he only married Mingyi.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's good to marry her.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But the wedding should tell us.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why didn't you tell us?

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay, okay.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I wish you a happy marriage.

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The wedding is ready.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Thank you.

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank you.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Mr. Ji, you didn't tell us.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Why are you here?

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Mingyi, why are you

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
having a wedding with Mr. Ji?

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Mr. Ji, did you think of a way to save Zhangtai?

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You are so close to Zhangtai.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You can't just ignore him.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Or is this one of your plans?

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Fine, I've arranged it.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
How do you know I'm going to marry him?

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Wait a minute.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I didn't tell you this.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's my fault.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But I have a question.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
How do you know I'm going to marry Mingyi?

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Of course I told you.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mr. Meng.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Mr. Ji, Mingyi.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You are so boring.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No matter how hasty the wedding is,

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you can't just send us a message.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Luckily, I have the news.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I went around and told everyone.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's why I told everyone.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Otherwise, your wedding

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
would be so cold.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But how do you know?

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Of course, I heard from Han Fengjun.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I know.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I know.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We both know.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Here.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
A wedding gift.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I was thinking

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that I can't

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
share this good news alone.

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll share it with everyone.

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right, Yan Xiang?

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Mr. Meng.

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Thank you for your kindness.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But we were in a hurry.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can see that.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Even the banquet was so little.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I understand you want to be low-key.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But you can't be slow in the wedding.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Wait.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll make up some more for you.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No need.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're welcome.

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm from the Jiuxian family.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm good at this.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Wait.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The princess is here.

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Tian Jing is here.

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Greetings, Princess.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You two come here.

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Give it to me.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll go.

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If it wasn't for Mr. Meng's notice,

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I wouldn't have known

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that the guests of Ji Xingyuan's inn would get married today.

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't think

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
anyone would agree to it.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
My husband is seriously ill.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No one would take me as a friend.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But don't forget.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I can give you the position you have today.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I can destroy you.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Many people

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
are addicted to the rumored dream of the Yellow Bracelet.

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But they don't dare to do it

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
because they love you

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and make Ji Xingyuan the top three courtiers.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If I tell the outside world

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
that you betrayed Ji Xingyuan,

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
guess

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
if other five courtiers

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
would agree to it.

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You can try.

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, I see.

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Princess,

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
you don't love Mr. Ji.

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You just need him.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No one cares about you in the palace.

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But marriage is not the best choice of alliance.

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's the interest.

195
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Sir, you did get the benefit

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
as a fighter.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Someone will support you in Ji Xingyuan.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's also true.

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Since everyone got the benefit

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and we need each other,

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
why don't we take a step back?

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
My wife is so smart.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sure

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
she can do it.

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Since we're on the same boat,

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Princess,

207
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
why don't you make a condition

208
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and not be so stubborn?

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Since you insist on marrying Mingyi,

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
fine.

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You can have the wedding.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I order you today

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to fight against Mr. Ji.

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You can't be so close to others.

215
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You can't be so close to others.

216
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Otherwise, you'll be affected.

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You'll be affected.

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Princess, you're so mean.

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Stop it.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Let's take a step back.

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Thank Princess Tian Ji.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Thank...

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Deal.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Xiuyun,

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
give my wedding gift to Mr. Ji.

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You can have the wedding.

227
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I won't attend.

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Are you satisfied now? Let's go.

229
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Everyone, look.

230
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Your Highness,

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
look at our clothes.

232
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
There are all kinds of clothes.

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Look.

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Look at this one.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It suits you very well.

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This sister must like it.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're the new merchant of the Ci Pan Hall,

238
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the chief disciple of Ci Pan, right?

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You bought so many things.

240
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Are you going to give them to Mr. Ji

241
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and his wife?

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Mr. Ji and his wife?

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Don't you know?

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Mr. Ji is going to have a wedding

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
with the fairy who brought back the flower leaves.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I saw you bought so many things.

247
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I thought you wanted to be more casual.

248
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's true.

249
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Where is the wedding?

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It should be true.

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I heard from others.

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The wedding is in...

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
in the Lusheng Forest.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mr. Ji,

255
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
you don't buy it?

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Now everyone knows it.

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How do you want to end it?

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Of course,

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
it's a beautiful scene.

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Madam,

261
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
the auspicious time has come.

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The flowers are so beautiful.

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You're really Mr. Ji.

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The wedding is different from others.

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So beautiful.

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I've never heard of this happy music.

267
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Right.

268
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Look at this.

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So beautiful.

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's like a wedding.

271
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Look at the fragrance.

272
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's really beautiful.

273
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Look.

274
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's so beautiful.

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's so beautiful.

276
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The marriage is destined.

277
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I hope we can be together forever.

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We are loyal to each other.

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The change is not easy.

280
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I hope we can be together forever.

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Good.

282
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Good.

283
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Good.

284
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's so beautiful.

285
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's so beautiful.

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's so beautiful.

287
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Congratulations.

288
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We are so happy.

289
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Thank you for coming.

290
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This place is very meaningful

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
to me and Mingyi.

292
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But it's not very friendly in the wild.

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Why don't you

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
have a look at the night view?

295
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The night view is so beautiful.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's so beautiful.

297
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This place is good.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I haven't had enough fun.

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Congratulations on your wedding.

300
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's go to the night view.

301
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I haven't had a wedding.

302
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Then let's go to the night view.

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Ji... Ji Xianjun, let's go.

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's so far.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
How can we go there?

306
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's a long journey.

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We will let you go.

308
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Of course we will arrange it.

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Come with me.

310
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Let's go.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's go.

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Why doesn't she respond?

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Is her true memory

314
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
not suitable for Xinliu's wedding?

315
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Today is the best time.

316
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We have to save Zhang Tai no matter what.

317
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We can't let them go.

318
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's go.

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Wait.

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
General Xun Ming is a rare guest.

321
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why don't you come with me

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
to the boat?

323
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What do you think?

324
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You are so free.

325
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You chose this place.

326
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You even arranged the wedding

327
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
according to the rules of the Yusuhu clan.

328
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Now you want to leave me alone.

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm afraid you have something on your mind.

330
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What are you talking about?

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's just a wedding.

332
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You have to come with me.

333
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Really?

334
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm afraid you

335
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
have to go to the east

336
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
for the sake of your hard work.

337
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Put flowers on the road.

338
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Send the bride to the temple.

339
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The Qin enemies will welcome you.

340
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You will have a fox wedding.

341
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You will enter my fox cave

342
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
to find out where Zhang Tai is.

343
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I allowed you to do that.

344
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Zhang Tai will tell you

345
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the wedding ceremony.

346
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You won't think

347
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
my most precious memory

348
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
is the wedding with my wife, right?

349
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Do you really think

350
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it's so easy

351
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
to enter my fantasy?

352
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So you let us

353
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
think so on purpose.

354
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Go ahead.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I won't stop you.

356
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But you must remember

357
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
not to be swayed by it.

358
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't worry.

359
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm not that useless.

360
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I heard from the owner of the flower garden.

361
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Ji Bozai

362
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
asked him

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
how to kill the Yusuhu clan.

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So I let him and Min Yijin

365
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
enter Zhang Tai's room

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
to make them think

367
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
my most precious memory

368
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
is the wedding with my wife.

369
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But they didn't know

370
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
the Yusuhu clan's

371
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
best way to kill people

372
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
was to trick others

373
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
into entering their fantasy.

374
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
By then,

375
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Ji Bozai would like to enter my fantasy

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
so that I can

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
use the chance to trick his mind

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
to find out where the dream is

379
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and kill him.

380
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Now,

381
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I can invite you

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
to enter my fantasy palace.

383
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Ji Bozai!

384
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Ji Bozai!

385
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ji Bozai!

386
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Where are you?

387
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Zhang Tai!

388
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Zhang Tai, are you there?

389
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Where are you?

390
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Answer me!

391
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Ji Bozai

392
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Min Yi

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Ji Bozai

394
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Master

395
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Master

396
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Master

397
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Great

398
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You're still alive

399
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'll take you out

400
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Ji Bozai

401
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You're doing all this

402
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
for me, aren't you?

403
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's good that you're alive

404
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's go, Master

405
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll take you to the upstairs

406
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
How are you going to take revenge for me?

407
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Revenge for me

408
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
is not that important

409
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Compared to this

410
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Tell me

411
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Did you hide the dream

412
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
safely?

413
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Tell me

414
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Where did you hide

415
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the dream?

416
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Ji Bozai

417
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Ji Bozai

418
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Ji Bozai, where are you?

419
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Where are you?

420
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Where are you?

421
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Damn it

422
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
This again

423
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Ji Bozai

424
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Tell me

425
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Where did you hide

426
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
the dream?

427
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Do you know

428
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I became like this

429
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
because of you?

430
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But Master

431
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I promised you

432
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The dream can't come true

433
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's all because of you

434
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's all because of you

435
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I died because I saved you

436
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Give me the dream

437
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I

438
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Give it to me

439
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Master

440
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Master

441
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Master

442
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm sorry

443
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Master

444
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm sorry

445
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You're not Master

446
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You shouldn't have become like him

447
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Master

448
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You don't let me

449
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
become like him

450
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I become like him

451
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Tell me

452
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Where is the dream?

453
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Come out

454
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Otherwise I'll kill

455
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
every part of you

456
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'll tie you up here with me

457
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You can't kill me

458
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
as long as you can't find my real body

459
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
No one can do anything to me

460
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
No one can do anything to me

461
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Because you never know

462
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
what is real

463
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
what is a fantasy

464
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Maybe

465
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
it's all fake

466
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's never

467
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's never been true

468
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Ji Bozai, don't struggle

469
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You can't get out

470
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Just get out

471
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Ji Bozai, don't struggle

472
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You can't get out

473
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's all fake

474
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's all fake

475
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's all fake

476
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's all fake

477
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's all fake

478
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's all fake

479
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Ji Bozai

480
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Ji Bozai

481
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Are you ok?

482
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Give up your dream!

483
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Give up your dream!

484
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Xifeng!

485
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
No, if this continues, he will be possessed.

486
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
He drank too much and kept telling me,

487
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
no matter if you really mean it or not,

488
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
you're the only one in my heart.

489
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
No matter if you really mean it or not,

490
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
you're the only one in my heart.

491
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
No, you're the only one in my heart.

492
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
No matter if you really mean it or not,

493
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
you're the only one in my heart.

494
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The End

495
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I actually let you find my most precious memory.

496
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Since you want to know so much,

497
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
then you should personally feel

498
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
everything I've been through.

499
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
This tune should be like a bird

500
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
flying freely in the air.

501
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But it sounds

502
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
so sad and sad.

503
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Young Master,

504
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
can you understand the meaning of the tune?

505
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Miss, don't be sad.

506
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The string is broken.

507
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You can continue.

508
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And the bird

509
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
will also fly away again.

510
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
General,

511
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
no matter if you really mean it or not,

512
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
you're the only one in my heart.

513
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The End

514
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
General.

515
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You're back.

516
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
General,

517
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
why do you always have a wound on your body recently?

518
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The wound is very strange.

519
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
What are you doing?

520
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Xin Liu,

521
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
you don't want to be a nun anymore,

522
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
don't you?

523
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I marry you

524
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
because I want to give you the freedom you want most.

525
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
General,

526
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I found this prescription from the Heart-wrenching Palace.

527
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's good for the wound caused by the shock.

528
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Thank you.

529
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
What happened to your hand?

538
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I... I slipped accidentally.

539
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Tell me.

540
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
What happened?

541
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You did all the evil things

542
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
for me.

543
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I did it willingly,

545
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
General.

546
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's good for you.

547
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
General!

548
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
General!

549
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
General!

550
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
General!

551
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Xin Liu,

552
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
how many times have I told you?

553
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Don't hurt yourself for saving me.

554
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Even if it's for me,

555
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
you have to drink it.

556
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
General,

557
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
drink it.

558
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I can't live without you.

559
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
General,

560
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
it's a monster.

561
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I can't control it.

562
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
No.

563
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Go.

564
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
No.

565
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Xiao Xue.

566
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I won't let you hurt him.

567
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
No.

568
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Xin Liu.

569
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Xin Liu.

570
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Xin Liu.

571
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Xin Liu.

572
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Xin Liu.

573
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Xin Liu.

574
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Xin Liu.

575
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's all my fault.

576
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I... I hurt you.

577
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You did everything to save me.

578
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Xin Liu.

579
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I won't let you hurt me.

580
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
No matter if you really want to,

581
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
in my heart,

582
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
you're the only one.

583
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm sorry.

584
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I didn't expect

585
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
he would help Mu Xi Bai

586
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
to raise the monster.

587
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
There's a story behind it.

588
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
This should be

589
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
his real fantasy.

590
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's said that the power of the Yusu Fox Clan is strong

591
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and makes people fake.

592
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It seems that

593
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
this is where the real hiding place of Xun Ming is.

594
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That was...

595
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
What?

596
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That was...

597
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It was me.

598
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I haven't asked what it was.

599
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Didn't you

600
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
see it?

601
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I did.

602
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I did.

603
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's a pity for Xin Liu.

604
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
He has a brother like him

605
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and Xun Ming's lover.

606
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm sorry.

607
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm sorry.

608
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm sorry.

609
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm sorry.

610
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm sorry.

611
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm sorry.

612
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'm sorry.

613
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm sorry.

614
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm sorry.

615
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm sorry.

616
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm sorry.

617
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm sorry.

618
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm sorry.

619
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm sorry.

620
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm sorry.

621
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm sorry.

622
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm sorry.

624
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm sorry.

625
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm sorry.

626
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm sorry.

627
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm sorry.

628
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm sorry.

629
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm sorry.

630
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm sorry.

631
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm sorry.

633
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm sorry.

634
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm sorry.

635
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm sorry.

636
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm sorry.

637
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm sorry.

638
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm sorry.

639
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm sorry.

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm sorry.

643
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm sorry.

644
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm sorry.

645
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm sorry.

646
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm sorry.

647
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm sorry.

648
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm sorry.

649
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,200
to my real body.

650
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,880
But in my fantasy,

651
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,680
your spiritual power will be reduced.

652
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,240
This is my fantasy that I saved for him.

653
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,320
You can't escape.

654
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,000
Xueming,

655
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,000
look at this.

656
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,880
In your most precious memory,

657
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,800
Xingliu Yi is telling you about his love for you.

658
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
But I have a question.

659
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,600
Why in your memory,

660
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,000
he has never been out of the Dengxuan Cave?

661
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,600
He has no freedom.

662
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,080
Why does he feel unhappy

663
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,600
when I feel it?

664
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,560
He left such a deep wound on his hand.

665
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,440
Did you hide something?

666
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,320
It's not like that.

667
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,640
Shut up!

668
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,240
Xueming,

669
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,440
why don't you dare to prove my problem?

670
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,680
Xingliu is not happy at all.

671
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,280
Yes.

672
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,360
He was used by the Muqi Sect.

673
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,640
He is unwilling to deal with it.

674
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,160
He is unwilling to come to the Song Dynasty.

675
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,080
So,

676
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,440
I married him.

677
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,720
I used the Beast of Illusion as a condition.

678
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,560
I changed Xingliu's freedom.

679
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
I'm willing to do anything for him.

680
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,520
Anything.

681
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,520
I can't take it anymore.

682
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,920
What did you say?

683
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,560
If you really want to exchange Xingliu's freedom,

684
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,120
why did you marry him?

685
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,320
You should let him go.

686
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,000
You trapped him in your Dengxuan Cave.

687
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,560
This is your so-called freedom.

688
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,440
That's because...

689
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,040
Because I...

690
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,720
Xueming,

691
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,960
the days he spent with you

692
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,480
are also torture for him.

693
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,080
You think your perfect love

694
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,640
is just a fake, right?

695
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,160
No.

696
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,600
It's not like that.

697
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
It's you.

698
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,480
It's you!

699
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,200
Why do you doubt my love?

700
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,200
Why do you doubt my love?

701
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,400
Why do you doubt my love?

702
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Why do you doubt my love?

703
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Why do you doubt my love?

704
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Why do you doubt my love?

705
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Why do you doubt my love?

706
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Why do you doubt my love?

707
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Why do you doubt my love?

708
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Why do you doubt my love?

709
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Why do you doubt my love?

710
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Why do you doubt my love?

711
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Why do you doubt my love?

712
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Why do you doubt my love?

713
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Why do you doubt my love?

714
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Why do you doubt my love?

715
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Why do you doubt my love?

716
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Why do you doubt my love?

717
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Why do you doubt my love?

718
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Why do you doubt my love?

719
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Why do you doubt my love?

720
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Why do you doubt my love?

721
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Why do you doubt my love?

722
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Why do you doubt my love?

723
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Why do you doubt my love?

724
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
Master Xie.

725
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Master Xie.

726
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
