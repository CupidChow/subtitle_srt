173
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,010
The so-called respected Empress must have told this lie

174
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,820
to secure her position.

175
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,730
She told everyone she had given birth to a son.

176
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,890
Then, she had her daughter disguised as a man

177
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,890
and deceived Yaoguang Mountain for 21 years.

178
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,420
Impossible.

179
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,650
He is my son.

180
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,340
He is not a girl.

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,770
I do not know

182
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,530
what evil trick the Empress used.

183
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,100
But Ming Xian worked with the rival realm

184
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,850
and lost on purpose during the Qingyun Tournament.

185
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,940
We then became one of the lower realms.

186
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,060
This is the truth.

187
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,100
I see.

188
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,250
I shall investigate thoroughly.

189
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,010
If Jing Shu truly committed such an atrocity,

190
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,250
I would revoke her title as the Empress.

191
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,420
I have one more favor to ask.

192
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,420
Father, after the tea gathering,

193
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,340
please hold the Crown Prince Conferment Ceremony

194
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,180
and appoint me as the crown prince.

195
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,700
His Majesty said yes?

196
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,700
The conferment ceremony will be held after three days.

197
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,370
Then,

198
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,340
I'll be the official crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

199
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,610
Great.

200
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,940
Great!

201
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,940
Xin.

202
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,850
Why do you look so worried?

203
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,250
Mother.

204
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,370
There's one more problem.

205
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,770
I procured the Heavenly Grief from Mu Qibai.

206
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,300
He recorded everything with the Recording Mirror.

207
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,370
And the mirror

208
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,130
is in Ming Xian's possession.

209
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,490
What?

210
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,420
Then...

211
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,010
Then you should get the mirror back from her.

212
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,300
But Ming Xian somehow got back her spiritual veins.

213
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,250
She's too strong for me.

214
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,490
But the Emperor of Zhushui

215
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,820
suspects Ming Xian of being the descendant of the Bo clan.

216
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,610
He asked me to capture her alive and bring her to Zhushui Spiritual State.

217
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,180
Assuming he is right,

218
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,010
then Ming Yi

219
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,130
does not carry the bloodline of Yaoguang Palace.

220
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,120
[Bo's Medical Classics]

221
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,530
Spiritual veins destroyed by the Heavenly Grief

222
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,700
may only be restored by planting the Golden Millet Dream in the victim.

223
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,010
There is no other alternative.

224
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,730
The Heavenly Grief in me suddenly went away.

225
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,220
The only possible explanation

226
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,820
is that you gave it to me.

227
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,420
But I had no idea at all.

228
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,650
It seems like you have dealt with Ming Xin swiftly.

229
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,420
It is unscathed.

230
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,820
To revive your companion beast,

231
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,370
you need to resonate with it using your spiritual veins.

232
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,130
It will be painful.

233
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,220
Let me stay here with you.

234
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,810
The black lingzhi mushroom is working.

235
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,380
If I nurture it for a while,

236
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,290
Twenty-Seven will return.

237
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,730
I finally did it.

238
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,900
What?

239
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,620
Won't you ask

240
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,700
what I did to Ming Xin?

241
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,980
After all, he was going to be

242
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,570
the crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

243
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,810
If I hurt him,

244
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,330
Jixing Abyss might be in trouble.

245
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,330
In trouble?

246
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,770
As in neither of us

247
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,090
can handle the consequences?

248
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,330
If you kill him, I'll bring you the blade.

249
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,250
If you spare him, I'll cover your tracks.

250
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,660
I have the Warrior Goddess with me.

251
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,860
What else is there to worry about?

252
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,900
I got the Recording Mirror,

253
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,700
but I spared Ming Xin.

254
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,290
He's going to reveal my identity to my father.

255
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,860
And you

256
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,140
already have a plan?

257
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,090
Yes.

258
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,460
But

259
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,700
there's one important thing

260
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,730
I need to check with you.

261
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,290
When did you give me the Golden Millet Dream?

264
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,180
Didn't you see me

265
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,530
destroy the Golden Millet Dream?

266
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,290
How could I possibly give it to you?

267
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,380
I undid the seal on Bo's Medical Classics.

268
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,700
The Golden Millet Dream

269
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,220
is the only cure for the Heavenly Grief.

270
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,530
You gave it to me.

271
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,620
Like I said,

272
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,490
I did not.

273
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,290
In Zhangwei Mountain, you asked if I was Ming Xian.

274
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,460
You said you'd only ask me that question one last time.

275
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,860
So today,

276

I'm asking you again one last time.

If you won't answer my question,

278
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,810

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,140
Only I can be the crown prince.

342
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,860
So his greatest fear

343
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,810
is you?

344
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,420
That's my loser of a brother for you.

345
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,380
Don't mind him.

346
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,490
Smiling? You have no right to be smug.

347
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,250
What did the Emperor tell me to do?

348
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,420
Listen carefully.

349
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,460
He told me to capture you alive and bring you to Zhushui Spiritual State.

350
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,570
You're an outsider.

351
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,980
You don't carry

352
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,220
the bloodline of Yaoguang Palace.

353
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,290
You

354
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,940
are a descendant of the Bo clan!

355
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,980
What did you say?

356
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,530
The elders in Yaoguang Palace claimed

357
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,460
that two wandering physicians once sojourned in Yaoguang Mountain.

358
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,770
One of them

359
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,940
fell in love and had a child with one of the local warriors.

360
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,330
Can you guess

361
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,490
if it's you?

362
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,940
The Emperor of Zhushui also said

363
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,140
that since you could enter the Zhulong Barrier,

364
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,770
it meant you were the descendant of the Bo clan.

365
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,180
Father. Mother.

366
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,140
Look.

367
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:58,090
The crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain can only be me!

368
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,490
Let me find out the truth in Yaoguang Palace.

369
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,050
Ming Yi.

370
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,490
Father has found out.

371
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,700
He has erected a barrier

372
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,020
so that I cannot return.

373
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,860
The barrier is now broken.

374
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,810
Guards will arrive soon.

375
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,090
Don't worry. I'll stand guard.

376
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,700
No one will bother you.

377
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,900
Ming Yi.

378
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,980
I can handle it.

379
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,570
You...

380
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,220
How did you come back?

381
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,460
How could they do this to you?

382
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,140
They know you're a fairy.

383
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,290
So they agreed to appoint Ming Xin as the crown prince.

384
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,660
You shouldn't have come back.

385
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,290
I'll take you away from this place.

386
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,570
Your father thinks you're a traitor.

387
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,860
Even you can't be sure that you can get out of this place

388
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,810
alive.

389
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,860
And you want me to come with you?

390
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,330
Do you think you can escape?

391
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,050
Master told me

392
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,620
that you were safe in Yaoguang Palace.

393
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,420
Look at you now.

394
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,810
I will bring you to safety even if it means

395
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,090
everyone will view me as an enemy.

396
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,620
Just go.

397
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,250
I will not leave with you.

398
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,980
Your Majesty, you won't come with me

399
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,010
because you don't think I can bring you to safety

400
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,050
or because

401
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,380
I am not your daughter?

402
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,250
What did you say?

403
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,140
Ming Xin was given the task of taking me back alive

404
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,660
by the Emperor of Zhushui

405
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,770
because the Emperor found out

406
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,730
that I do not carry the bloodline of Yaoguang Palace.

407
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,770
He said I was a descendant of the Bo clan.

408
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,810
No wonder you never called me Mother

409
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,220
after you barged into this place.

410
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,050
Master She.

411
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,460
Ming Yi wrote to me,

412
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,810
telling me that you gave the Golden Millet Dream to her.

413
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,980
I've never thanked anyone in my life.

414
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,660
But I'll make an exception today.

415
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,570
Stand upright.

416
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,940
Stand upright.

417
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,530
Master She.

418
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,490
Do not return the bow.

419
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,860
Rest assured.

420
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,810
I will repay the favor.

421
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,730
I will find the Diwu tree's core as soon as possible

422
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,490
and make the Golden Millet Dream for you.

423
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,460
Thank you, Master She.

424
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,700
No need.

425
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,860
Ming Yi also mentioned

426
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,180
that Ming Xin accused her of being a descendant

427
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,660
of the Bo clan.

428
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,810
Did that happen?

429
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,140
What else did Ming Xin say?

430
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,180
Tell us.

431
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,050
So where did the wandering Bo physicians go?

432
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,660
I was told one died from labor complications.

433
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,380
And the other one was last seen

434
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,730
leaving Yaoguang Palace

435
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,420
with a newborn baby.

436
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,620
You returned

437
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,770
to find the truth.

438
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,980
If I tell you the truth,

439
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,460
will you stop pestering me?

440
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,770
Have you ever wondered

441
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,090
why I have treated you so

442
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,010
ever since you were little?

443
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,460
You are smart.

444
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,330
You won every Qingyun Tournament.

445
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,220
You wouldn't even dare

446
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,140
to make a mistake or lose

447
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,010
in your training.

448
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,700
But I never cared

449
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,420
what you wanted,

450
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,420
or if you were hurt

451
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,050
or hungry.

452
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,900
No mother would ever

453
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,660
treat her child like this.

454
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,730
Given your intelligence,

455
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,330
I thought you'd have guessed it.

456
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,140
So...

457
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,980
So who am I?

458
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,940
Your father, the Emperor of Yaoguang,

459
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,050
and I do not love each other.

460
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,940
He took Madam Meng in as his consort one day

461
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,730
and showered her with affection.

462
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,900
Everyone in Yaoguang Palace said

463
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,660
that when Madam Meng gave birth

464
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,180
to a son with spiritual veins,

465
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,730
she would replace me

466
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,620
as the Empress of Yaoguang.

467
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,980
Therefore,

468
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,660
I must give birth to a son

469
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,460
with spiritual veins before she does.

470
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,960
[20 Years Ago]

471
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,900
There, there.

472
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,640
Good boy.

473
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,810
Baby. My baby.

474
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,010
Quick.

475
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,380
Bring me my baby.

476
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,980
My baby.

477
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,250
Impossible. This can't be right.

478
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,010
My son must have spiritual veins.

479
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,920
- Who would have thought - Impossible!

480
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,750
This is impossible!

481
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,250
The son whom I toiled so much to conceive

482
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,250
was born without spiritual veins?

483
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,290
Without spiritual veins?

484
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,700
Yes. The irony of it.

485
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,140
God took pity on me and gave me a son.

486
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,330
But in everyone's eyes,

487
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,180
he's just a useless person with no spiritual veins.

488
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,050
He can never be a crown prince.

489
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,090
He won't even be able to survive.

490
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,380
So

491
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,730
who am I?

492
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,090
The serendipitous but hapless victim

493
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,770
of this tragedy.

494
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,220
Coincidentally,

495
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,180
another baby was born

496
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,570
at the same time in Yaoguang Palace.

497
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,290
It was a baby girl

498
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,570
yet she was born with strong spiritual veins.

499
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,730
So I made the decision.

500
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,330
To save my son,

501
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,010
I took you, who were born on the same day, away

502
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,530
to replace my son.

503
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,700
Your Majesty, I'm begging you.

504
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,090
Yucen is already dead.

505
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,940
This is her only child.

506
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,660
Bo Yulan, you know very well

507
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,530
why your sister died from birth complications.

508
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,380
She was hunted down by Zhushui Spiritual State

509
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,380
and was gravely injured.

510
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,900
She was too weak to carry a baby,

511
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,220
yet she risked everything to deliver her baby

512
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,010
for the sake of love.

513
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,570
And her lover

514
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,050
couldn't do anything to protect her baby.

515
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,900
He is a warrior

516
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,460
but he consummated with a foreign fairy.

517
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,570
He is now imprisoned.

518
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,530
I felt bad for Yucen,

519
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,980
so I snuck her into the palace for her delivery.

520
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,340
Now that Yucen is gone,

521
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,300
do you think you can protect the baby?

522
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,460
This baby was born with unrivaled

523
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,090
spiritual veins and potentials.

524
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,820
She is destined to rise above all.

525
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,490
I know

526
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,170
your clan has something called the Veil of Illusion

527
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,300
that can conceal her gender.

528
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,090
You and your sister

529
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,940
used that technique to evade the manhunt

530
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,610
in Zhushui Spiritual State.

531
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,940
Tell me how to use the technique

532
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,170
and I'll release your sister's lover.

533
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,690
This baby

534
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,900
will be the respected crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

535
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,650
I will make her the ruler of Six Realms.

536
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,690
So,

537
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,380
I really am...

538
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,900
Yes, the daughter of Bo Yucen,

539
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,940
the descendant of the Bo clan.

540
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,420
Then, my father is...?

541
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,420
Master She.

542
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,740
I heard

543
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,210
that the ancestors of the Bo clan would leave behind portraits.

544
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,300
As long as someone pays respect to the portraits,

545
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,260
their divine consciousness

546
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,980
will remain in the Bo clan's ancestral home.

547
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,170
That day, in Zhangwei Mountain,

548
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,940
Ming Yi

549
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,650
saw another fairy from the Bo clan,

550
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,860
Bo Yucen.

551
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,780
She saw Yucen?

552
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,420
She truly saw Yucen?

553
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,820
So, you do know Bo Yucen.

554
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,490
Fairy Bo Yucen

555
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,610
said something weird to Ming Yi.

556
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,490
What did she say?

557
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,650
The Bo clan still has one descendant in this world.

558
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,740
And that's my child.

559
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,860
But I hope

560
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,650
no one will ever find out

561
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,210
about her identity

562
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,860
or whereabouts.

563
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,610
Oh, my baby.

564
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,530
Never have I ever imagined

565
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,570
that I would be able to see you again.

566
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,820
Ming Yi

567
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,940
didn't know what she meant.

568
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,260
But...

569
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,420
Master She, you must know.

570
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,300
I thought

571
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,780
that if Ming Yi could meet her,

572
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,860
it means someone is still paying respect to her portrait.

573
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,940
Is that you, Master She?

574
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,260
Master She,

575
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,260
I admit

576
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,530
that I once asked my companion beast to dig around your past.

577
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,490
Ming Xian became a warrior of Yaoguang Mountain at the age of 13.

578
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,050
And you

579
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,260
suddenly did everything you could

580
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,260
to be the venerable for Yaoguang Mountain's warrior ranks.

581
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,260
That's because

582
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,170
you want to tutor the crown prince, Ming Xian.

583
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,530
Well done!

584
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,570
Greetings, Venerable.

585
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,380
Your Highness.

586
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,170
No need to bow to me, Venerable.

587
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,300
I am now one of the warriors.

588
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,780
I should bow to you instead.

589
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,130
Your Highness,

590
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,530
your form was excellent just now.

591
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,340
Perhaps you shouldn't call me Venerable.

592
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,460
Let me be your master.

593
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,980
I'll take you in as my disciple.

594
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,780
You?

595
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,780
Why should I be your disciple?

596
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,090
What can you teach me?

597
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,820
Prideful, aren't you?

598
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,530
Let's have a match then.

599
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,050
If I win,

600
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,690
you'll have to call me Master.

601
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,650
Sure.

602
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,380
After Ming Xin

603
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,980
confessed,

604
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,530
you began to suspect me, didn't you?

605
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,610
I didn't mean to offend you.

606
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,980
All I'm after is the truth.

607
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,490
Will you tell me the truth, Master She?

608
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,460
Were you in love

609
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,300
with Fairy Bo Yucen?

610
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,490
Your father

611
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,420
was the warrior

612
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,130
of Yaoguang Mountain, She Tianlin.

613
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,530
So in the Bo clan's ancestral home, I met

614
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,050
my mother.

615
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,980
The one I've known since I was little,

616
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,010
the one who has been staying by my side,

617
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,170
the one whom I call Master is...

618
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,490
So Ming Yi

619
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,340
is your child with Fairy Bo Yucen.

620
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,010
When Yucen went into labor,

621
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,940
I was imprisoned by the Empress.

622
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,490
When I was released,

623
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,530
Yucen had already passed

624
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,980
from birth complications.

625
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,170
I couldn't even look at her one last time.

626
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:53,900
By then,

627
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,740
your daughter

628
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,460
had already become the son of the Empress.

629
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,210
I was at my wits' end.

630
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,090
I had no other option.

631
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,010
What can I do?

632
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,650
I was just an ordinary warrior

633
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,300
and they were the entire Yaoguang Palace.

634
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,050
Could I fight them all?

635
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,610
Could I fight the Empress?

636
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,650
I could only endure it silently.

637
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,860
Yucen's portrait

638
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,090
contains our shared memories.

639
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,050
For 21 years,

640
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,860
for all 21 years,

641
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,380
those cherished past memories,

642
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,530
and Ming Yi's future

643
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,650
have kept me alive.

644
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,900
For 21 years,

645
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,980
have you never intended

646
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,420
to tell Ming Yi the truth?

647
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,210
You would rather Ming Yi live

648
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,380
in deception forever?
