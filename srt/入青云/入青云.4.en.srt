1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
Princess.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,360
As long as you don't ask me

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,880
where my spirit vein comes from,

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm willing to fight for you.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,400
But I have a condition.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,480
If I can win the fame of Yaoguang Mountain,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,840
please remove my criminal status

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,840
and make me the late emperor.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,360
But what if

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,800
you lose too?

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,200
If I can't win the fame of Yaoguang Mountain

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,840
in this Qingyun Conference,

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,080
please remind me immediately.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,680
I'm willing to destroy my spirit

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,880
and leave the six realms.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,220
Your Majesty.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,520
Your Majesty.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,200
Father.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,320
You woke up.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,360
Well.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,880
fürата While I was in this world.

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,800
I was one of the gods who died.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,700
I didn't know that his Majesty was so festive and happy.

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,980
What if his Majesty hadn't tooWhite out at the time?

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,600
What?

26
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,020
They couldn't enter my house.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,760
What did I do?

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
I heard that they're still busy on duty.

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,120
But the time wasWhen it's not their duty,

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,560
I'm not going to let you go.

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,400
If you want to vent your anger on me,

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,240
I'll have to do it.

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,120
It's hard for you to be so loyal to my uncle

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
to get the position of a doctor.

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,360
Otherwise, where are you going to be now?

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,520
Did I ask you to get up?

37
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,080
After I became your doctor,

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,720
you've been sleeping longer and longer.

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
Tell me,

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,600
what's your plan?

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,440
Make you a puppet

42
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,200
and then kill me?

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
You're thinking too much.

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,480
His Majesty is ill.

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,640
Can sleep apnea cure him?

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,840
You're always so hypocritical.

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,560
You're so cruel.

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,520
But thanks to Lord Yanxian's comparison,

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
I found that

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,280
the man of the Jibo family is valuable.

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,120
It's more suitable for him to be my husband.

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,120
You have time to argue with me here.

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
You might as well...

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,120
You might as well

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,600
go and see if your backyard is in a mess.

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,800
What do you mean?

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,640
It seems that

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,400
you still don't know

59
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,680
that Wu Gui Hai has a new female master.

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,480
Lord Yanxian has been nagging for a long time.

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,640
How can you make a fool of him?

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,960
You're always bad at judging people.

63
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,520
You once liked me and deceived me.

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,880
Now you like Lord Yanxian.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,760
How can you be sure

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,400
that he's trustworthy?

67
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
Not everyone is as good as Lord Yanxian.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,680
He's always trying to get the upper hand.

69
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,760
I value Lord Yanxian.

70
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,800
I want to marry his wife.

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
But he has to rely on his own strength.

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,120
With that,

73
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,920
Lord Yanxian is far inferior to him.

74
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
Does he want to rely on himself

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,240
or does he think it's worthless

76
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,360
to marry a lost princess?

77
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
I'm grateful

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,480
that you won the honor of the upper realm for the Star-pumped Abyss

79
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,880
and helped me to sit on the throne of the Emperor of Shouhua.

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,240
But it's far from enough for you and me.

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,400
You and I are in a tight bond.

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,840
One day,

83
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,240
you can take charge of the Star-pumped Abyss,

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,840
but you can't know it.

85
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,080
Princess,

86
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,560
I risked my life to make a deal with you.

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,640
I said that I wanted to destroy Yuan Shen.

88
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,360
But I have to destroy Yuan Shen.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
You can't be so greedy.

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,880
You still want my freedom, right?

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
I don't want your freedom.

92
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,520
I'll give you my power.

93
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,040
Freedom?

94
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,880
I have it now.

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,920
But you don't have the power yet.

96
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
So why are you talking about this?

97
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,800
Lord Jinxian.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Ji...

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,360
Ji Bucai!

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,600
Mr. hypnotized Boss Don.

101
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Young Lord Dune.

102
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,280
Are you twenty years old?

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,400
Much younger than마

104
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
today?

105
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
It's morning.

106
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,520
I'm the one who defeated Sleeping Beauty,

107
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,960
all of you will be the same.

108
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,320
Master,

109
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:58,120
Li Duan ist ein

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,480
He wants to see you

111
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
You…you, who are you?

112
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
How did you get in?

113
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,280
Uncle Xu Xuan

114
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,560
I've got something to do, I'm leaving

115
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,400
You

116
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,880
What are you doing massive

117
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,040
Didn't you say you'd take me to see the Lord? Where is he?

118
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,880
I've already seen you.

119
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
The Lord of Shouhua's Rebellion,

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
Princess Tian Ji.

121
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Kneel down.

122
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,320
I can't kneel down.

123
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,880
Princess,

124
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,520
what can I do for you?

125
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,480
You mean it?

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,320
I do.

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,360
I order you to leave Lord Ji.

128
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
As long as you're willing to leave,

129
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,080
you'll get all the treasures.

130
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll also give you a thousand taels of silver.

131
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,160
How about it?

132
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,400
Well...

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,720
Why are you hesitating?

134
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,680
Think it over.

135
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
If you're willing to leave the Ji Xingyuan,

136
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
you'll get all these immediately.

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,140
Lord Ji's

138
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,840
Or...

139
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,920
What else do you want?

140
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,040
I'll arrange everything for you.

141
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
I want...

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,360
the Yellow-Curved Dream.

143
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,640
If you insist on not leaving Lord Ji,

144
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
then you'll have to

145
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,720
die here today.

146
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
The Yellow-Curved Dream

147
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
I don't like to see you either.

148
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,840
But I'm afraid that Lord Ji is really special to you.

149
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,280
I'll leave you.

150
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,400
No.

151
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000
Princess, it's a good deal.

152
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,040
It's not impossible to leave Lord Ji.

153
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,480
Princess,

154
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,640
you must think I'll say that, right?

155
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,760
I admit that a man

156
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,680
is not as precious as

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
these endless wealth

158
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,440
and even life.

159
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,160
But

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,320
since Lord Ji

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
saved me from the devil in the Flower Garden,

162
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,920
I've fallen in love with him.

163
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Now I'm

164
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,840
deeply in love with him.

165
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,200
I'll never stop.

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
The Yellow-Curved Dream

167
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
If that's the case,

168
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,560
you'll die.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,400
It'll be less troublesome.

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,680
Xiao Yun,

171
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,440
do it.

172
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,480
You got it this time, right?

173
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
You're so lucky.

174
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,800
Come on.

175
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,280
Little girl, I've seen you.

176
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,840
Come and save me.

177
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,000
You...

178
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,320
Lord Ji.

179
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,120
Why Your Highness scared them?

180
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,160
You scared them.

181
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,120
Princess Tian Ji,

182
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,880
even if it's you,

183
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,680
you can't make it hard for me, right?

184
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,000
Princess Hai Qi,

185
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,560
don't break us apart.

186
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,920
Did Lord Ji really decide to protect her?

187
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,120
Princess Tian Ji,

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
it's just a fair deal between us.

189
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,200
I've made it clear

190
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,200
that I won't involve her.

191
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
I've made it clear before.

192
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,080
But if you must

193
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,880
marry me and Lord Ji,

194
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,320
will you still resist?

195
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
You are always in a slumber.

196
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
Lord Han Feng is like the sun in the sky.

197
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,000
Now, the Ji Xing Palace is now

198
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,280
under the protection of Lord Han Feng.

199
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,120
I'm not talented.

200
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm a star.

201
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
The old princess

202
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,600
and the new one.

203
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,680
Tell me,

204
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,200
will Lord Han Feng

205
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
let you get this decree successfully?

206
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,400
Lord Ji,

207
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,920
don't forget

208
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,200
I asked you to get rid of your criminal identity.

209
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,160
Yes.

210
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,440
You are indeed kind to me.

211
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,560
But I won't help you with my cause.

212
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,840
I think for you,

213
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,520
a fighter who can win the Qing Yun Conference

214
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,440
is more important than finding a princess.

215
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,160
What do you think?

216
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,240
Of course.

217
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
Please grant me your blessing.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,960
I'll take her away.

219
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,640
Please don't scare Her Highness away.

220
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,320
But Ah' Abs jedoch

221
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,120
must become the plans of the streets

222
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,440
to seduce her!

223
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
I hope you can remember

224
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,920
that if someone dares to

225
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,280
make trouble upon my name

226
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,760
I'll kill him

227
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,760
even if I'm an imbecile!

228
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,120
and not rely on my uncle.

229
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,360
That's enough.

230
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,640
Lord Xian,

231
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,000
all the sisters here are here today.

232
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120
Who do you want to be the first?

233
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,880
I don't know.

234
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,200
Who are you

235
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
the friends of Lord Ji?

236
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,720
Zhao Qi.

237
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,440
Zhao Qi.

238
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,400
Zhao Qi.

239
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Zhao Qi.

240
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Zhao Qi.

241
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Zhao Qi.

242
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Zhao Qi.

243
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Zhao Qi.

244
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Zhao Qi.

245
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Zhao Qi.

246
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,080
Zhao Qi.

247
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,360
Zhao Qi.

248
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Zhao Qi.

249
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Zhao Qi.

250
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Zhao Qi.

251
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Zhao Qi.

252
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Zhao Qi.

253
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Zhao Qi.

254
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
It's really Zhao Qi.

255
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Zhao Qi.

256
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Zhao Qi.

257
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
It is said that

258
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
there was an immortal

259
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
chasing after a fairy on the night of the flower.

260
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
But he was stopped by Lord Ji

261
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,320
and said that it was his people.

262
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,160
Who is that?

263
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,680
I don't know.

264
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
If anyone of you can tell me

265
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,320
the name of that fairy,

266
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,600
it's all

267
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
his fault.

268
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm not sure about that.

269
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,080
All the fairies in this building

270
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,680
like Lord Ji.

271
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,840
Lord Ji is so friendly.

272
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,440
When you came,

273
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
you must have asked the housekeeper.

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,160
He didn't know.

275
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,480
How can we know?

276
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,400
Yeah, how can we know?

277
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,800
How can we know?

278
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
How can we know?

279
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
How can we know?

280
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
The fairy?

281
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,360
Wait.

282
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,760
You're looking at this?

283
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,400
Isn't this to deal with

284
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
the lamp master?

285
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Why don't you just give it to him?

286
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,440
I want to.

287
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,760
Who made him so cautious

288
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,960
and never eat anything out of the blue?

289
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,720
All right, all right.

290
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,560
Don't talk about me.

291
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,080
How are you recently?

292
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,520
Is your waist better?

293
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I'll give you the medicine.

294
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,200
How is it?

295
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Awesome, right?

296
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,200
You're still my sister.

297
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,720
What?

298
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,360
You're not up yet?

299
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
Help me.

300
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,760
My medicine can't get up.

301
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,120
It can't get up?

302
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,040
It hurts.

303
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,000
Bear with it.

304
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,640
Who told you to be so powerful?

305
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,400
I thought it was over.

306
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,080
I have something to tell you.

307
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Yesterday, there was a guest.

308
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,520
He didn't listen to the song,

309
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,880
didn't look at me.

310
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,680
Instead, he came to ask about

311
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,280
the day you were chased by two fairy kings.

312
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
What was he like?

313
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
He was tall,

314
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,840
handsome,

315
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,200
and handsome.

316
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,480
What's the use of saying that?

317
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,840
I didn't see him at all, okay?

318
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,280
He was so mysterious.

319
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,800
He hid behind the screen

320
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,560
and looked at me.

321
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,440
So,

322
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,840
I covered it up for you.

323
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Thank you.

324
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,040
He hid so well.

325
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,960
Could he be a fighter?

326
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,640
He should be.

327
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,440
If a fighter enters the outer world,

328
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,880
if he is found,

329
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,080
he will be killed.

330
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,840
Help me rub this part.

331
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,360
What's wrong?

332
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,320
Nothing.

333
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,720
He didn't drink that day,

334
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,120
but he took a bite of chestnut cake.

335
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,640
Chestnut cake.

336
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,440
He is really a fool.

337
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,920
I'm going back.

338
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,920
They are a perfect match.

339
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,400
The lotto game didn't start with me asking for his blessing.

340
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,480
Here he comes.

341
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,440
He comes to say farewell to His Lordship.

342
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,920
They don't need my blessing.

343
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,840
We are friends of the gameabout woman.

344
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,960
We are having a match for the first time.

345
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,400
I can attest to this logic.

346
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,680
It's good.

347
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,360
What is it?

348
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,480
It's...

349
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,840
The weather.

350
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,640
It's good.

351
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,680
What's good about it?

352
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,400
It's going to rain.

353
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,040
I'm going to get a thunder.

354
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,440
I'll play with you

355
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,240
before I get the jade bed.

356
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,960
Where on earth can you make a good story?

357
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,640
Congratulations to bolt apples to the sand!

358
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,120
The chef of the new ...

359
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,080
and bring joy and willing hybrid culture together.

360
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,960
God, army, and adepts shall forever attend you.

361
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,200
Finally, my little disciple.

362
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:26,400
This April Feng

363
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,720
you too

364
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,320
Look after him

365
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,000
The tea is really bitter

366
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,720
This is the hanshang empress' Droshing edition

367
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,920
and will be delivered suasysomeday

368
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,320
with aナmut

369
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
I am willing to help you

370
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,520
Little student, you have very good talents

371
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,920
you can pass all the sections

372
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,760
Yes.

373
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,320
With your help,

374
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,920
you can help me

375
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,600
to help Qi Xingyuan.

376
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,120
There's a rumor

377
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,240
since Qingyun's disappearance.

378
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,680
I've found out

379
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,480
that he and Chen Yuan are too close.

380
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,640
Maybe

381
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,960
his disappearance is related to Chen Yuan.

382
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,200
We need to find out the truth.

383
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
I've cleaned up the bedroom for you.

384
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,600
Go to have a rest.

385
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,520
You can order as many people

386
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
as you need.

387
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,840
Here.

388
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,840
I wish you...

389
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,160
Thank you, Lord Han Feng.

390
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,240
I'll leave you alone.

391
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,760
It's so bitter.

392
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,440
What's so bitter?

393
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,440
I'm going to the palace again.

394
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,240
It's really bitter.

395
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,840
Your Highness,

396
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,720
since Uncle Ji won the competition,

397
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,880
the passport has been missing.

398
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,000
We never

399
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,480
thought about these two things

400
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,320
together before.

401
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,960
I was the one who saw it.

402
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,800
I wanted to pull him in

403
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,400
and let him hand over the dream of the royal grain.

404
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,240
I forgot that

405
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,000
since he has the dream of the royal grain,

406
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,080
his relationship with Bo Yulan

407
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,320
must be very close.

408
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,680
Situ Ling is here.

409
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,880
His Highness is about to come.

410
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,680
Of course, he's going to invite someone in the middle of the night.

411
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,440
Why don't we invite Uncle Ji

412
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,880
to explain it to him

413
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,160
tomorrow?

414
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,640
If Uncle Ji

415
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,240
really has something to do with Bo Yulan,

416
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,360
we can't keep him.

417
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,240
I'll go.

418
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,000
Actually, you don't have to come tonight.

419
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,240
Han Feng Jun set up a banquet.

420
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,560
How can I not go?

421
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,480
I mean,

422
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,200
the previous private judge was missing.

423
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,400
Mu Xibai has been taking over the court.

424
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,080
Today,

425
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,800
it's just a small banquet.

426
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,480
I was on the boat,

427
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,000
and you told me this.

428
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,120
I thought you were worried about my situation

429
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,400
and told me in advance.

430
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,720
Well,

431
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,640
who is the chief of the private judge outside the city?

432
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,200
It's Situ Ling.

433
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,600
What kind of person is he?

434
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,000
I've never seen him before.

435
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,480
I heard he's just a little kid.

436
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,160
He should go to the banquet

437
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,720
today.

438
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,440
But he suddenly said

439
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,640
he was too tired from work today.

440
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,840
He can't drink and he can't have a wedding.

441
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,800
He's absent.

442
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,680
You should find an excuse to be absent.

443
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,320
I don't want to slip.

444
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,200
I have to face

445
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
what I have to face.

446
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,440
I understand.

447
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,040
You're worried that Han Feng Jun will set you up again

448
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
and bring me along.

449
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,120
Yes.

450
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,280
I don't like being set up by others.

451
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,000
I like to choose.

452
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,240
My Lord,

453
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,920
on the night when Han Feng Jun came to the Wu Gui Sea,

454
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,320
I accidentally met a box in your room

455
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,960
and found a broken iron fan inside.

456
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,560
I was wondering why you kept it

457
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,800
when it was so broken.

458
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,440
Could it be

459
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
a fairy's gift for you?

460
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
It's a magic weapon of Ming Xian.

461
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,480
Why did you keep it?

462
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Ming Xian lost the battle

463
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,200
and wanted to keep it as a gift.

464
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,800
Actually,

465
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,760
he's really like the rumored one.

466
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,080
He's a talented fighter.

467
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,240
I even thought

468
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,480
he might not be able to defeat me.

469
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
But I don't know why,

470
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,720
his spiritual power suddenly

471
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
has been reduced.

472
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,480
So I can hardly take back my spiritual power

473
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,960
and almost killed him.

474
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,200
Fortunately,

475
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,560
his magical power

476
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,520
saved him.

477
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,200
So I kept it.

478
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,480
I thought one day,

479
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,000
I could return it

480
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
to him when we meet again on the battlefield.

481
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,280
Why did you suddenly mention this?

482
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,240
You'd better pretend you didn't hear it.

483
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,680
He said it

484
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
as if nothing had happened.

485
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,120
Could it be that the one who made me leave the Heaven

486
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,120
wasn't him?

487
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,400
It wasn't him?

488
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,480
The one who poisoned me

489
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,640
was him.

490
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,920
Who could it be?

491
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,760
We're here.

492
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,080
How do you feel?

493
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
You're moving.

494
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,360
A little bit nervous?

495
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,040
Fishy.

496
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,440
Come.

497
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm not allowed to drink.

498
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,840
Mingyi doesn't allow me to drink.

499
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,040
How about

500
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,280
Mingyi drink this for me?

501
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,520
How can you let Lord Yan drink for me?

502
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,360
I should drink for Lord Yan.

503
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,920
I've never seen you outside.

504
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,320
Why?

505
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
What?

506
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,280
My lord eats like a pig every time on the night of the flower.

507
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,040
Look at him.

508
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,440
Cooperate with him.

509
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,600
Han Fengjun is here.

510
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,880
Han Fengjun is here.

511
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,640
Lord Han Fengjun is here.

512
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,960
Don't stand up.

513
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,720
Didn't we say

514
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,400
you should be like Brother Bozi?

515
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,280
Why are you still staring?

516
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,080
Put your hands down.

517
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,400
Put your hands down.

518
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,400
Today, you're going to serve the new Minister of Justice.

519
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,760
Guess what?

520
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
Ha convex piss ism

521
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,720
Due to some abnormea they couldn't be repaired until tonight's competition.

522
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,880
If they do not maintain wiped off clothes,

523
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,200
I'll ask

524
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,120
the forces of the Three Kingdoms Decree

525
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
to accompany them.

526
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,760
I don't know where he is.

527
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,360
Could it be that he eloped with the fairy?

528
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,280
Everyone, look.

529
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,120
See who can recognize the fairy in the painting?

530
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,720
What magic did he use?

531
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,440
He can move?

532
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,720
He must be a special person

533
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,680
to be drawn by this rare magic.

534
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,400
Which fairy is familiar with Ji Xiu?

535
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,320
Look.

536
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,120
Do you know him?

537
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,440
Even if I know many fairies,

538
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,760
it's in the past.

539
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,560
Now,

540
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,360
there's only one person in my heart.

541
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,920
Ji Xiu has changed.

542
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,640
He's back to the inside.

543
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,880
This fairy in the painting

544
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,040
looks like

545
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,040
Ji Xiu will like her.

546
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,920
Ji Xiu,

547
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,440
you really don't know him?

548
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,200
Ji Xiu,

549
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,600
look at it carefully.

550
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,000
You don't know him?

551
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,160
Let me see.

552
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,680
Is this fairy really Feng Yu?

553
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,080
Let me see.

554
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
If this eagle-hawks

555
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,160
can be so close to each other,

556
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,320
it's really not a bad thing.

557
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,880
Because

558
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,160
the miracle of fairies

559
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,840
can be done by a fairy in the painting,

560
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,800
it'd be much better

561
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
to change the position

562
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,280
to someone else.

563
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:22,960
Yes, that's true.

564
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,740
It seems to be much more difficult

565
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,560
to make friends like this with a great biennale.

566
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,320
No if.

567
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,200
It's a nightmare.

568
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
So I'm afraid

569
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,440
there are many chances

570
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,640
for the dessert to go out.

571
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
I'm so jealous!

572
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Mr. Sun, are you okay?

573
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,640
Drink less if you're not feeling well.

574
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,840
Who threw this cup?

575
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
You did it.

576
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Did you do it on purpose?

577
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,240
What?

578
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,840
You think you're right now?

579
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
And you're being so rude?

580
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,440
Get up!

581
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
What's going on?

582
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
What's going on?

583
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,640
Mr. Jin Xian,

584
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Sun Liao once had a meeting with you.

585
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Have you passed it?

586
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Why did I fall down and eat half a melon

587
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,040
and then fight?

588
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
I'm fine.

589
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Mr. Jin Xian,

590
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,640
you're so angry.

591
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Is it for your family

592
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
or for this Hua Zhong Xian?

593
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Lord Han Feng, it's all my fault.

594
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,640
I accidentally touched the cup

595
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,040
and made Sun Liao embarrassed.

596
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,440
It's none of your business.

597
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,240
It's all my fault.

598
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,440
I've disturbed everyone's mood.

599
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,840
Please forgive me.

600
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,440
Get up.

601
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
You're right.

602
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Why did you kneel?

603
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,040
Lord Han Feng, you've misunderstood.

604
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,640
I did it

605
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,440
to protect the one I love.

606
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
If Lord Han Feng meets the one he loves,

607
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
he'll understand.

608
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
A child without a son

609
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
is a poor man.

610
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
We'll leave it here.

611
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,640
Goodbye.

612
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
I'm sorry.

613
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm sorry.

614
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
I'm sorry.

615
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
I'm sorry.

616
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
I'm sorry.

617
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
I'm sorry.

618
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
I'm sorry.

619
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Actually,

620
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
I did it on purpose.

621
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
I know.

622
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
I know.

623
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Lord.

624
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
Don't move.

625
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Don't worry about that.

626
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
After I send you back,

627
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
I have something to do.

628
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,640
Have a good rest.

629
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,640
I think it's okay.

630
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Ming Yi.

631
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Don't be afraid.

632
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
The jade worm is reacting.

633
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Ji Bo is going out.

634
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Let's go.

635
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
This is the location

636
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
of the back hill building.

637
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
The back hill building?

638
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
You set the fire to burn that?

639
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
It's really burnt.

640
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
It's all gone.

641
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
The jade worm

642
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
brought us here.

643
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Nothing.

644
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Okay.

645
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
I'll do it.

646
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
I feel familiar.

647
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Ji Bo hid Lin Xi Jing here.

648
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
Lin Xi Jing?

649
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
Impossible.

650
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
He's really stronger

651
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,640
than I thought.

652
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,640
He's so strong

653
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,640
that he can turn Lin Xi Jing

654
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
into a stone.

655
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
He's just trying to

656
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
find a place to hide.

657
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,640
I've set the fire to burn.

658
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
Ji Bo didn't even mention it.

659
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
I'm sorry.

660
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
I'm sorry.

661
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
I'm sorry.

662
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,640
I'm sorry.

663
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
I'm sorry.

664
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
Ji Bo didn't even mention it.

665
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,640
He probably thinks that

666
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
we're not from here

667
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
and don't want to tell you in advance.

668
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Why didn't you mention it?

669
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
Didn't you send me away?

670
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
If it weren't for my smart talent,

671
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
I wouldn't have given you

672
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
such a useless

673
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
and useless

674
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,640
shit to wipe your ass.

675
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
This...

676
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
This...

677
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
This is Lin Xi...

678
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
This is Lin Xi Jing.

679
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Wow, Erqi.

680
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Now you've learned

681
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
to open the topic.

682
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
What?

683
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Xi. Xi. Xi.

684
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
The jade worm did get the knife.

685
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
That means the yellow-winged dream is here.

686
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,640
What should we do?

687
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
Unless we can communicate with

688
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Ji Bo,

689
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
no one can

690
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
get into his Lin Xi Jing.

691
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
But you're Ming Xian.

692
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
The most impossible person

693
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
to communicate with

694
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Ji Bo in the six realms.

695
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Ming Xian can't do it.

696
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
But you're the little fairy

697
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Ming Yi

698
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
that Ji Bo brought from the Flower Moon Night.

699
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
What do you want to say?

700
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
The six realms rules.

701
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
When the six realms are connected,

702
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
the newly-wed couple

703
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
need to make a new bond

704
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
through the marriage.

705
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
Then they can communicate.

706
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
You...

707
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Don't say that.

708
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
It's a trap.

709
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Right?

710
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Right?

711
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
It's simple.

712
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
Right?

713
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,640
And

714
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
you don't need to fight

715
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,640
or fight.

716
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Just get married.

717
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
It's simple.

718
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,640
I believe you.

719
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
You're the best.

720
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Wait. Wait.

721
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
If we get divorced,

722
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
it's simple.

723
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
I need to go back to the mountain.

724
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
Is it troublesome?

725
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Simple?

726
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Simple.

727
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
You two can decide

728
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
and just change your name.

729
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Okay.

730
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
I'll do that.

731
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
When did you know about this?

732
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
It doesn't seem like

733
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Ji Bo will marry you.

734
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
You're so stubborn.

735
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
It's hard for him

736
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
to take me back to the turtle sea.

737
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
He doesn't even want to marry the princess.

738
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
How can he let her marry me?

739
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
Ji Xianjun,

740
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
you're so angry.

741
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Is it for your family

742
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
or for the fairy in the painting?

743
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
At the party today,

744
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
Mu Qiba

745
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,640
took a picture of me.

746
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Ji Bo cared about it.

747
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,640
If I help him,

748
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
will he be moved

749
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
by my affection?

750
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
What do you mean?

751
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
Today,

752
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
we're going to talk about

753
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
the 13th time

754
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
that I broke into the private party.

755
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Let's go.

756
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Wait. Wait.

757
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,640
The claw.

758
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
There's a magic circle.

759
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
The private party

760
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
can be entered as it is.

761
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
The magic circle

762
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
will definitely

763
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
make your

764
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Li Henhua fall in half.

765
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
It's not worth it

766
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
for a painting.

767
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
Since Zhang Tai has mentioned it,

768
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
the star

769
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
is probably following me

770
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
to the chicken heart garden.

771
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
Then my whereabouts

772
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,640
can't be hidden forever.

773
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
We shouldn't

774
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
let him run away for nothing.

775
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,640
Let's give the star a big gift.

776
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
The star is here.

777
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Why don't we run away?

778
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
We can't avoid it.

779
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
We should hide for a while.

780
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Do you have that much time?

781
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Well,

782
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
I can't.

783
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
The 14th time.

784
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Let's go to the rich and noble

785
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
and the dangerous and loyal ball.

786
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
No.

787
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
What do you mean?

788
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
You're the rich and noble

789
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
and the dangerous and loyal ball.

790
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
You're the rich and noble.

791
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
I'm the middle ball.

792
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
I don't need to go anywhere.

793
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
I'll burn my hands.

794
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
Don't miss it.

795
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
Don't miss it.

796
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,640
The chicken heart won't be wrong.

797
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
The star must have run away to the chicken heart garden.

798
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
But I can't stay here for too long.

799
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
If my identity is exposed,

800
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
it'll be a problem.

801
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,640
Let's go.

802
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,640
Look.

803
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Pretty.

804
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Let's see.

805
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Step aside.

806
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Don't run.

807
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Let's see.

808
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Lord,

809
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
let me go to the temple.

810
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
If Mu Qi Bai set a trap,

811
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
I'll be arrested.

812
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
It's better than revealing

813
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
the relationship between you and Huang Liang Meng.

814
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
Mu Qi Bai will show us

815
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
his master's portrait.

816
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
It proves that he has guessed it.

817
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
If I can't even get a portrait,

818
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
I don't have to

819
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
get out of Chen Yuan's life.

820
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
I'll just be trapped

821
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
and make a crime.

822
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
But I have the responsibility to protect you.

823
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,640
I should be the one to go to the mountain and the sea for you.

824
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
I'm fine.

825
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
But if you're in trouble,

826
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
who else can bear it?

827
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Let me go.

828
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
It hurts. I don't look like you.

829
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
Enough.

830
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
His little trick

831
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
can't do me any good.

832
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
I'm sorry.

833
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
I'm sorry.

834
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
I'm sorry.

835
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
I'm sorry.

836
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
I'm sorry.

837
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
I'm sorry.

838
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
I'm sorry.

839
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
I'm sorry.

840
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
I'm sorry.

841
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
I'm sorry.

842
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
I'm sorry.

843
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
I'm sorry.

844
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
I'm sorry.

845
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
I'm sorry.

846
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
I'm sorry.

847
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
I'm sorry.

848
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
I'm sorry.

849
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
I'm sorry.

850
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
I'm sorry.

851
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
I'm sorry.

852
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
I'm sorry.

853
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
I'm sorry.

854
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
I'm sorry.

855
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
I'm sorry.

856
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
I'm sorry.

857
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
I'm sorry.

858
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
I'm sorry.

859
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
I'm sorry.

860
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
I'm sorry.

861
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
I'm sorry.

862
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
I'm sorry.

863
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
I'm sorry.

864
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
I'm sorry.

865
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
I'm sorry.

866
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
I'm sorry.

867
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,640
I'm sorry.

868
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
I'm sorry.

869
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
I'm sorry.

870
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
I'm sorry.

871
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
I'm sorry.

872
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
I'm sorry.

873
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
I'm sorry.

874
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
I'm sorry.

875
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,640
I'm sorry.

876
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,640
I'm sorry.

877
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,640
I'm sorry.

878
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
I'm sorry.

879
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
I'm sorry.

880
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
I'm sorry.

881
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
I'm sorry.

882
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
I'm sorry.

883
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
I'm sorry.

884
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
I'm sorry.

885
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
I'm sorry.

886
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm sorry.

887
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
I'm sorry.

888
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
I'm sorry.

889
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
I'm sorry.

890
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
I'm sorry.

891
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
I'm sorry.

892
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
I'm sorry!

893
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
I'm sorry!

894
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
I'm sorry!

895
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
I'm sorry!

896
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
I'm sorry!

897
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
I'm sorry!

898
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
I'm sorry!

899
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
I'm sorry!

900
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
I'm sorry!

901
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Senior,

902
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
I...

903
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
What are you doing here?

904
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
You're here to drink tea?

905
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
You?

906
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
I want to make coffee for you.

907
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
You are?

908
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
Keep closeChef's office until we're done.

909
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,640
Working on all Lian Huishan's works?

910
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
I work in your office.

911
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
What are you after,

912
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,680
This painting is of great significance to you, right?

913
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,400
I can tell it at a glance.

914
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,400
I was thinking that you took me in.

915
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,880
I have to do something for you, right?

916
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,120
So you came here.

917
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,120
I'm not as good as you.

918
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,600
How did you get in?

919
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,160
The barrier of the Rebellion Hall.

920
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,160
You're just an ordinary fairy.

921
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,000
You came in like this.

922
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,360
I'm not as good as you.

923
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,880
But I'm really a great person.

924
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
A great person?

925
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,520
You don't know me.

926
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,600
You took me in from the Garden of Flower.

927
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,400
That's it.

928
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,240
Brother.

929
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,120
Brother.

930
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,960
There's a wall in the Rebellion Hall.

931
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,120
My father was a seamstress when he worked ten years ago.

932
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,720
My mother and I came here to accompany him.

933
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,200
But I was too tired at that time.

934
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,640
So I forced my second brother's hand to press against the wall.

935
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,880
And I was beaten three times.

936
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,920
But today is the first day of their second brother's birthday.

937
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,200
I want to go in and see them.

938
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,960
I...

939
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,160
Then they gave me a pass.

940
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
So I came in.

941
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,400
That little boy did it.

942
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,520
Little cat.

943
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,040
If you really fall into my hands...

944
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,520
I'm thirsty.

945
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,280
Being stupid can get you killed.

946
00:44:59,360 --> 00:44:59,600
resume

947
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,640
I'll come back and take her away.

948
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,240
I'll give her

949
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,640
a fire-cracker.

950
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,440
Lift her up.

951
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,640
How do you know there's something on the wall?

952
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,720
It's a lie.

953
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,680
There's nothing.

954
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,480
Then they'll believe it.

955
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,920
I just

956
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,360
added some moves.

957
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,240
I just added some moves.

958
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,280
They'll believe it.

959
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:35,760
Enough.

960
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,320
Let's go.
