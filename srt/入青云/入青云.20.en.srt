23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,000
Your Lordship!

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,350
Your Lordship.

25
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,070
What is this?

26
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,790
What happened?

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,120
I killed him.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,470
What?

29
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,560
I killed him.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,000
Your Lordship,

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,520
even if you wish to help Ming Yi,

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,750
you must look after yourself.

33
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm fine, Fuyue.

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,470
Don't worry.

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,080
I'm perfectly fine.

36
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,560
Come on.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,310
Your Lordship,

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,030
you've opposed Mu Qibai time and again

39
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,150
for Ming Yi's sake.

40
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,030
I fear you've already become a thorn in his side.

41
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,360
Mu Qibai has more than one enemy.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,560
The enemy of my enemy is a friend.

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
Since that's the case,

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,710
I'll lend this friend a hand.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,120
The Judgment Hall reports

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,190
that you abducted Fairy Ming Yi

47
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,560
and even carried out a private punishment.

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,910
Is that true?

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,400
Through investigation, I discovered

50
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,030
that Ming Yi carried spiritual veins,

51
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,520
and Ji Bozai concealed and sheltered her,

52
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,710
so naturally, I had to get to the bottom of it.

53
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,800
It's true she has spiritual veins,

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,590
but the one who covered up for her wasn't Ji Bozai.

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
It was me.

56
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,000
I've long intended for her to serve at Shouhua Academy.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,750
Absurd!

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,910
A fairy born with spiritual veins

59
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,120
is a jinx,

60
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,430
yet you want to bring her into Shouhua Academy?

61
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,560
Such a foolish rule

62
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,870
should have been broken long ago.

63
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,830
Soon,

64
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,270
as the Venerable of Shouhua Academy, I will decree

65
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,480
that all women within Jixing Abyss who bear spiritual veins

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,550
need not hide any longer

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
and may compete to be warriors.

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,230
Uncle, instead of worrying

69
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,510
about such a trivial matter,

70
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,160
perhaps you should explain

71
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,360
why a charred corpse

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
found in this case

73
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,590
came from Zhushui Spiritual State.

74
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,030
He's dead?

75
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,470
Who

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,120
was he?

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,800
Whoever he was,

78
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,950
it's not your place to question me.

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,590
Then never mind

80
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,910
the corpse.

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
But think about this, Uncle.

82
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,120
Why did the Judgment Hall

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,390
report this matter to me so quickly today?

84
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,710
Uncle,

85
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,950
Jixing Abyss

86
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,710
is no longer yours to control alone.

87
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,470
Uncle Qibai is growing ever more brazen,

88
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,560
even consorting with people from Zhushui Spiritual State.

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,390
Your Highness,

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
what should we do next?

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,800
Now

92
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,320
that the Judgment Hall no longer obeys Lord Hanfeng,

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,590
can we not accuse him directly?

94
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,880
Though he is no longer what he once was,

95
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,390
it's still not easy to bring him down.

96
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,590
We must awaken my father,

97
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,950
no matter

98
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,760
what it takes.

99
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,470
You really don't understand your master.

100
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,560
He'd never turn his back on Ming Yi.

101
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,320
You're so loud.

102
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,080
Last night, His Lordship

103
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,950
took your master's fiancée

104
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,590
to the hot springs to heal and keep warm.

105
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,120
Instead of gossiping here,

106
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,640
you'd better keep an eye out

107
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,440
before your master ends up getting cheated on.

108
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,680
I can't be bothered.

109
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,950
It's not me who'll get cheated on.

110
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,390
Th... thanks.

111
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,320
You may dislike us most of the time,

112
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,640
but knowing the danger, you went with me

113
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,240
to Dragon Carp Terrace to rescue them.

114
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,390
You're actually a decent person,

115
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,710
loyal when it counts.

116
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,680
If you had gone alone and been caught,

117
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,000
you might not have withstood the torture

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,510
and revealed secrets about Wugui Sea.

119
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,470
That would've brought real trouble upon His Lordship.

120
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,680
Besides,

121
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,030
when His Lordship was struck by the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

122
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,590
Fairy Ming Yi helped us.

123
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
So by that reckoning,

124
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,200
I owe her one.

125
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,030
Then by your logic,

126
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,800
since you helped me beat Sun Liao,

127
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,800
I owe you a favor too.

128
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,630
- No need... - How about this?

129
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,350
I'll grant you three wishes.

130
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,880
No need.

131
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,200
Don't make a big deal out of it.

132
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,800
Tell you what,

133
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,950
for the first wish, I'll go fishing with you.

134
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,030
Sounds like you're the one who wants to fish.

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,120
And don't you dare

136
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,000
steal my dried fish again.

137
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,830
Fine.

138
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,270
That counts as the second wish.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,950
What?

140
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,200
Very well.

141
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,950
Then you'll buy the fishing rods.

142
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,950
I just sent a message to Master She,

143
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,590
asking him to study

144
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,640
the Soul-seizing Technique

145
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,470
to see if it can suppress the Heavenly Grief,

146
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,270
since you used your spiritual veins

147
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,510
but didn't suffer any aftereffects this time.

148
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,560
Thank you for worrying about me.

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Why are you being so polite?

150
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,200
You...

151
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,680
What's wrong?

152
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,760
Ming Yi,

153
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,120
no matter how much you like him,

154
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,350
stay focused on what truly matters.

155
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,830
You have only one life.

156
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,590
True.

157
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,080
If one dies,

158
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,680
any amount of love won't matter.

159
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
When I finally steal the Golden Millet Dream,

160
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,800
he'll think I've been lying to him all along

161
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,800
and will hate me for it.

162
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,080

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,230
Master.

173
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
After everything that's happened,

174
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,110
I find myself no longer concerned

175
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,680
about her past.

176
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,400
Her true identity

177
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,400
no longer matters to me.

178
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
As long as I know

179
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,110
she truly cares about me,

180
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,230
that is enough.

181
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,520
Whatever the future holds,

182
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,750
I trust her.

183
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,040
Your Lordship, though you've refined the netherbeast core successfully,

184
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,560
your body is also weakened by it.

185
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,590
Please take care of yourself.

186
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,350
Don't worry. I know my limits.

187
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,710
Sun Liao,

188
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,560
Jixing Abyss

189
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,440
had no chance in the first place.

190
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,160
If not for the miasma of the Sunken Abyss

191
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,750
perfect for breeding netherbeasts,

192
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,950
Father would never have entrusted such an important task

193
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,110
to Lord Hanfeng.

194
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,560
Now, the netherbeast army is gone,

195
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,520
and my elder brother

196
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,920
has died so strangely

197
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,350
in Jixing Abyss.

198
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,520
How am I supposed

199
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,830
to explain this to Father?

200
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Your Lordship...

201
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,630
Please,

202
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,350
I beg you to keep this matter secret!

203
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,470
Look,

204
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,080
your father has so many sons.

205
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,920
If they all stay alive,

206
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,800
how could he ever value you?

207
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,040
Don't you think so?

208
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,990
In our realm, brothers and friends respect each other.

209
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,920
But lowlifes like you have corrupted

210
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,990
our relationship.

211
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,750
Anyway, since the netherbeasts have already been refined by Ji Bozai,

212
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,110
it's time for your realm to fall.

213
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,920
Let's start with you.

214
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,800
Your Lordship, spare me!

215
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,750
Please spare me!

216
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,710
In fact,

217
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,860
Lord Hanfeng still has a trick up his sleeve.

218
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,040
He's secretly kept an unformed netherbeast.

219
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,440
Chao Yu hasn't returned to Zhushui for so long,

220
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,160
so Father sent me to check on the situation.

221
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,280
But who would've thought?

222
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,470
Chao Yu actually died.

223
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,750
What is this awful tea?

224
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,870
Anyway, this is a simple matter.

225
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,830
I can just go back and say

226
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,560
that to form a netherbeast army,

227
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,830
my elder brother unexpectedly

228
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,630
exhausted his spiritual power

229
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,870
and decided to make the ultimate sacrifice.

230
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,870
Touching, isn't it?

231
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,440
This will make

232
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,120
a great story to tell!

233
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,870
It will also solve a big problem for you.

234
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,750
I appreciate your kindness, Your Lordship,

235
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,990
but I'm afraid I don't understand.

236
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,870
The netherbeasts have been refined by Ji Bozai

237
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,040
and disappeared from the world.

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
How can we come up

239
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,830
with a satisfying explanation to your father?

240
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,110
Even now,

241
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,560
you are still lying.

242
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,870
Sun Liao already confessed.

243
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,200
Listen carefully.

244
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,160
Hand over the netherbeast you've hidden.

245
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,110
Only then can I cover for you

246
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,280
in front of Father.

247
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,950
Your Lordship,

248
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,560
you listen carefully.

249
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,350
The beast is in my hands.

250
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,710
If you want my help,

251
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,920
you should say "please."

252
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,200
"Please"?

253
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,110
You...!

254
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,110
Do you even know how to use

255
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,280
what I have?

256
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,920
If you cooperate with me

257
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,710
and pin everything

258
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,990
on that mute corpse,

259
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,920
once my great cause is accomplished,

260
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,400
everything in Jixing Abyss

261
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,560
will be credited to you.

262
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,590
Then you'd better hurry.

263
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,350
Father doesn't have my patience.

264
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,680
Where's the "please"?

265
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,080
Please hurry.

266
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,800
Ming Yi, how are you feeling now?

267
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm fine.

268
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,160
Thank you for your concern, Immortal Situ.

269
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,280
But I'm curious.

270
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,080
How did you know about it so quickly?

271
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,750
Even Princess Tianji and the others came.

272
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,440
I just regret I couldn't come sooner.

273
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,710
By the barrier,

274
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,750
they found

275
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,160
a body that couldn't be identified.

276
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,200
The Judgment Hall has examined it,

277
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,520
but we still can't confirm its identity yet.

278
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,630
Was there a wound on the wrist of that body?

279
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,560
I didn't see the person's face,

280
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,590
but I saw a cut

281
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,110
on his wrist.

282
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,560
Yes, there was indeed.

283
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,160
Right?

284
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,080
But I heard

285
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,470
the body was burned into a charred skeleton by magic.

286
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,470
Immortal Situ,

287
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,920
how could you tell there was a wound on his wrist?

288
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,920
Perhaps...

289
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,950
Ming Yi,

290
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,080
if I didn't kill him,

291
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,990
he would've killed you.

292
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,520
She cares about me after all.

293
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,040
[Notice: The Soul-hiding Nail law for women has been abolished in Jixing Abyss]

294
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,630
From now on, women with spiritual veins in Jixing Abyss

295
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,190
don't need to have Soul-hiding Nails anymore!

296
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,960
That's great!

297
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,760
Does this mean there will be female warriors?

298
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,430
The Princess did a great thing!

299
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,870
Madam, I'll take this one.

300
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,390
All right.

301
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,040
Thank you.

302
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,040
Zhang Tai,

303
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,040
you were gravely injured.

304
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,800
Are you really okay now?

305
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,910
Don't worry.

306
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,760
Princess Tianji treated my wounds.

307
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,040
You also had your young friend, Twenty-Seven,

308
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,760
send me medicine,

309
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,720
and I took it.

310
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,240
I've never felt better.

311
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,280
Don't worry about me.

312
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,910
Madam, I'll take this too.

313
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,430
Sure.

314
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,630
It was all my fault.

315
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,110
Thank you.

316
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,520
If something serious had happened to you,

317
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,390
I really...

318
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,760
Don't say that.

319
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,720
By the way,

320
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,040
did you notice

321
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,080
anything different about me today?

322
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,320
You've applied red blush

323
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
and painted your eyebrows dark green.

324
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,960
No, it's not that.

325
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,760
Look, I can use spiritual veins now!

326
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,110
After I got injured,

327
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,150
Princess Tianji's people treated me,

328
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,910
and they discovered my Soul-hiding Nail.

329
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,430
They asked if I wanted it removed,

330
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,800
and of course, I said yes.

331
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,830
So now,

332
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,830
I also have spiritual veins!

333
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,720
Although I can't break through to a higher stage,

334
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,000
my cultivation has still improved a lot.

335
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,960
In the future, making hairpins

336
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,430
will be much easier for me.

337
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,800
It must've hurt a lot to remove the nail, right?

338
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,720
At least now

339
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,560
you can do what you love.

340
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,110
All right, you've seen me.

341
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,280
Now hurry back.

342
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,720
Immortal Ji has been waiting for you for so long.

343
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,870
What's going on between you two?

344
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Oh, please don't ask.

345
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
I don't want to lie to you, but I can't tell you either.

346
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,960
I...

347
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,630
Actually, I've known for a long time

348
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,960
that you have many secrets.

349
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,560
I don't want to ask about them,

350
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,150
but I can tell

351
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,630
Immortal Ji really likes you

352
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,720
and treats you well.

353
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,000
Of course, that doesn't matter.

354
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,560
What matters is how you feel.

355
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,150
You like him too, don't you?

356
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Yes.

357
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,830
Despite everything, I've fallen for him.

358
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,240
But it won't last.

359
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,590
But Ming Yi,

360
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,520
you know what?

361
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,040
In this world,

362
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,760
moments of happiness are rare.

363
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,480
You may part ways in the future,

364
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,480
but you still feel overjoyed

365
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,150
to see him now, don't you?

366
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,590
Madam,

367
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,910
please wrap this up for me.

368
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,630
Sure.

369
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,760
It seems you're unwilling to do it.

370
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,670
No worries.

371
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,520
I won't force you.

372
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,150
After all, even if you don't do it,

373
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,590
I have other ways to get it done.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

374
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,350
But once it's done,

375
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,150
I will still tell everyone

376
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
that you did it.

377
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
You must be joking, Lord Hanfeng.

378
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,320
I am but a humble physician

379
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,630
with little skill.

380
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,720
If you spread such a story,

381
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,870
no one will believe it.

382
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,320
How could that be?

383
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,150
That's exactly what makes it believable.

384
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,670
You, a humble physician

385
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,870
with little skill, chose to serve me for your own good.

386
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,590
Then one day,

387
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,480
you made your move against the Emperor

388
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,870
to pledge your loyalty.

389
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,630
Doesn't that sound reasonable?

390
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,590
Since you'll end up the culprit anyway,

391
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,830
why not just do it

392
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,080
and take full credit for it?

393
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,320
Immortal Yan, the Princess wants to see you.

394
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,830
Immortal Yan, please go over there.

395
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,590
Your Highness.

396
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,000
Your Highness, why have you called for me today?

397
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,150
I'm feeling unwell,

398
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,240
so I want you to check on me.

399
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,720
You look fine.

400
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,830
How could you be unwell?

401
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,080
I had a nightmare.

402
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,520
I dreamt that you killed my father,

403
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,150
and it left me unsettled.

404
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,110
Your pulse is rapid and tense.

405
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,870
I don't think the nightmare caused it.

406
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,040
It's more like you are...

407
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,670
nervous.

408
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,520
Why would I be nervous?

409
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,630
I think you are the one who's nervous.

410
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,960
Did Your Highness summon me just to tease me?

411
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,080
You may leave now.

412
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,630
Father!

413
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,720
Your Highness, give it back to me.

414
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,800
What do you mean?

415
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,760
I don't understand.

416
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,150
You can play dumb now,

417
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,910
but I will report to Lord Hanfeng

418
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,760
and sabotage

419
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,560
whatever you plan to do.

420
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,800
Then go ahead and tell my uncle.

421
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,150
I will say

422
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,960
that you gave it to me willingly.

423
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,560
Take a guess.

424
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,830
With you leaving

425
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,480
my Jade Rabbit Hall at midnight

426
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,630
and me

427
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,630
looking so disheveled,

428
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,280
who will he believe?

429
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,080
Your Highness,

430
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,390
do you know what you're doing?

431
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,870
Do you think I'm too afraid to act?

432
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,910
I just miss my father too much.

433
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,870
What's wrong with that?

434
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,560
I will return it to you.

435
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,110
No one will know what happened.

436
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,320
Just help me this once.

437
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,910
Just once.

438
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,800
Please, Xiao?

439
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,670
Why?

440
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,520
Why are you doing this?

441
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,910
I trusted you!

442
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
You know full well

443
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,040
that Uncle Qibai caused

444
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,960
my father's unconsciousness.

445
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,960
He only assigned you to monitor my father's condition

446
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,000
so you could

447
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,670
keep him unconscious!

448
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
I know

449
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,760
most of Jixing Abyss now follows

450
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,320
Uncle Qibai's orders

451
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,430
because he can offer them a path to power

452
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,670
and keep them safe.

453
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,870
But that's their choice.

454
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,080
I don't care about what they choose.

455
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,110
But you can't do this to me.

456
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,190
Why are you doing this?

457
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,870
You can't do this to me!

458
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,590
Fine. I'll only ask one thing of you.

459
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,350
Sooner or later, Uncle Qibai

460
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,000
will take my father's life.

461
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,590
When that day comes,

462
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,430
please help me keep my father alive.

463
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,670
Will you do it for me?

464
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,520
I'm begging you, Xiao.

465
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,320
Your Highness,

466
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,630
you've overestimated me.

467
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,350
Yes, Lord Hanfeng made me His Majesty's physician,

468
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,150
but if he wants His Majesty dead,

469
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,720
what right do I have

470
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,960
to oppose his will?

471
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,190
I never thought

472
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,150
you'd be

473
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,350
so despicable and shameless,

474
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,350
only following the wind to gain favor.

475
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,670
You're truly pathetic.

476
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,870
I don't know anything.

477
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,680
I never came here.

478
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,540
[Granny's Eatery]

479
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,320
It's ready. It smells great.

480
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,080
Here, Wheat,

481
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,320
take it to the table over there.

482
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,110
Sir, here's your scallion pancake.

483
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,000
Please enjoy.

484
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,040
He's all you can see, huh?

485
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,720
Madam.

486
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,280
You've grown taller.

487
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,560
Go on. Go back to work.

488
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,630
Since you refined the netherbeast core,

489
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,560
Mu Qibai has been lying low.

490
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,720
I suspect he's up to something.

491
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,480
Be patient.

492
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,720
He's in the shadows,

493
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,240
but we're not necessarily in the light.

494
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,110
I've had Buxiu keep an eye on Mu Qibai.

495
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,830
We'll find out what he's up to sooner or later.

496
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,630
You said you brought me here to discuss matters,

497
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,870
but I feel like it's just an excuse.

498
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,080
Really?

499
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,480
In fact,

500
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,390
that night,

501
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,590
I was under the influence of the Soul-seizing Technique.

502
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,830
That's why I said things I shouldn't have.

503
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,190
Shouldn't we talk about serious matters?

504
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,910
Otherwise, it'll seem like I'm really after something else.

505
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,590
Father, you're awake.

506
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,560
Why have you lost weight?

507
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,150
In my dreams,

508
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,960
I kept catching you stealing candy.

509
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,800
That's not true.

510
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,790
Lord Ji, you suffered greatly

511
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,960
refining the netherbeast core.

512
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:17,040
The netherbeasts must have undermined your will, right?

513
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,590
They had been trying to tempt me

514
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,310
into accepting their power.

515
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,630
The netherbeasts are indeed tempting.

516
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,560
Whether it's Mu Qibai or the other realms,

517
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,270
none would willingly give up that power.

518
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,590
Without a strong will,

519
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,000
one would surely be corrupted by the netherbeast core.

520
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,790
Luckily, it was you.

521
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,150
Luckily, it was me?

522
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,520
Do you trust me that much?

523
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,080
Immortal Ji, His Majesty summons you.

524
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

525
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,630
You don't seem surprised

526
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,520
to have been summoned so suddenly.

527
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,480
Of course not.

528
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,590
I've been waiting for this day.

529
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,480
Tianji somehow cured

530
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,590
the illness that afflicted me.

531
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,230
Her Highness must have sensed the danger

532
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,400
and feared Your Majesty might be harmed.

533
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,750
Harmed?

534
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,840
Are you talking about Lord Hanfeng?

535
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,790
While Your Majesty lay unconscious,

536
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,920
Lord Hanfeng's intentions

537
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,310
became clear to all.

538
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,520
Your Majesty, you must've heard I refined the netherbeast core

539
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,080
and sensed Lord Hanfeng's moves.

540
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,710
Do you now see

541
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,590
how urgent it is

542
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,710
to root out these hidden dangers?

543
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,150
I beg you to be resolute.

544
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,310
Bai is my only brother.

545
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,590
Of course I know what he wants.

546
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,590
He's impatient

547
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,790
and often plots against me.

548
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,840
He even sent a physician to keep watch over me.

549
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,270
I know very well what he's been up to.

550
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,590
But when I remember

551
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,630
how naive and innocent

552
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,630
this younger brother of mine once was,

553
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,920
I can't bring myself to be harsh.

554
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,670
But never...

555
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,360
never did I expect...

556
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,960
Never did you expect him to be so driven by greed,

557
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,000
colluding with Zhushui Spiritual State,

558
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,520
breeding netherbeasts,

559
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,670
and endangering the Six Realms.

560
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,360
You have done much for Jixing Abyss,

561
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,040
and I'm deeply grateful.

562
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,520
But the netherbeast army was a direct threat

563
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,750
to the Six Realms.

564
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,560
Yet you handled it alone and did not report it.

565
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,190
Think of the consequences.

566
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Half of Jixing Abyss follows Lord Hanfeng.

567
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Immortal Ji was only trying

568
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,960
to prevent news from leaking.

569
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,270
Besides,

570
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,230
it was

571
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,360
precisely because you once let Uncle Qibai grow strong

572
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,710
that we are in this crisis now.

573
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,000
Under these circumstances, it was only natural

574
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,400
that Immortal Ji found Jixing Palace hard to trust.

575
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,880
I swore as a child

576
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,230
to do everything I could

577
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,880
to stop Uncle Qibai from harming you again.

578
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,440
Now, no one knows

579
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,920
what he will do next.

580
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,960
So,

581
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,790
no matter how reluctant you feel,

582
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,150
I ask you

583
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,310
to put Jixing Abyss first

584
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,110
and seize Uncle Qibai at once.

585
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,190
Immortal Ji, I'd also like to ask you

586
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,840
to trust us once more

587
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,110
and join us in protecting Jixing Abyss.

588
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,110
Jixing Palace is indeed hard to trust,

589
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,960
but

590
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,560
not all who hold power

591
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,360
are slaves to it.

592
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,230
For the sake of the Six Realms,

593
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,880
I'm willing to unite as many as I can.

594
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,920
But Mu Qibai has Zhushui Spiritual State behind him.

595
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,150
Alone,

596
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,270
we can

597
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,790
hardly rival them.

598
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,230
Please, Your Majesty, think about the people of Jixing Abyss

599
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,110
and order Mu Qibai's arrest.

600
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,190
Please, Father, arrest him at once.

601
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,190
Yuanfeng, you haven't fully recovered.

602
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,630
You should be resting.

603
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,480
If there's anything you need,

604
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,480
just have someone send word for you.

605
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,520
I've been hearing many disturbing rumors lately.

606
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,270
Most of them are about you.

607
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,880
Now that my condition has improved,

608
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,040
I'd like to hear the truth from you directly.

609
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,270
What rumors?

610
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,880
I'm being subtle

611
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,360
because you are my blood brother.

612
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,360
But if you still won't confess to forming a netherbeast army,

613
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,920
I will have no choice but to take action.

614
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,520
Who made up these rumors?

615
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,400
They're pure fabrications, nonsense!

616
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,920
Yuanfeng,

617
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,080
are you going to believe outsiders

618
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,190
over your own brother?

619
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,110
Qibai,

620
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,520
when did you become like this?

621
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,360
Like what?

622
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,310
You've been fragile since childhood.

623
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,270
You used to be gentle and considerate.

624
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,110
When we trained together back then,

625
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,400
you were so kind.

626
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,590
You'd rather get hurt yourself

627
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,560
than harm others.

628
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,190
"Rather"?

629
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,790
"I'd rather"?

630
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I couldn't, Yuanfeng!

631
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,360
If I'd been a bit stronger,

632
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,670
I wouldn't have always been defeated.

633
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,880
If my elder brother had been

634
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,880
a bit more decisive,

635
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,880
we wouldn't have been constantly hindered

636
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,630
by those old fools,

637
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,040
unable to clean up the rot!

638
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,840
If you had been

639
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,310
a bit more resolute,

640
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,310
Jixing Abyss wouldn't have kept ending up among the Lower Three Realms!

641
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,040
And even now,

642
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,880
you, my incompetent brother,

643
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,790
are still reminiscing

644
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,880
about my so-called kindness, gentleness, and mercy.

645
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,750
You don't deserve to sit in this chair at all!

646
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,400
Yuanfeng,

647
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,670
Jixing Abyss won't fall because of the netherbeast army.

648
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,630
It will fall because of people like you.

649
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,270
Chao Yu is dead.

650
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,590
The news of the nameless charred corpse at Dragon Carp Terrace

651
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,270
has already spread far and wide.

652
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,920
The Emperor of Zhushui will surely investigate thoroughly.

653
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,960
Your Lordship, be careful.

654
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,480
Don't let them find out.

655
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,710
Don't worry.

656
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,920
I won't.

657
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,150
To outsiders,

658
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,190
Mu Qibai is the one who last saw Chao Yu.

659
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,190
He is

660
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,710
the perfect scapegoat.

661
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,110
Besides, with the netherbeasts refined by Ji Bozai,

662
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,590
Mu Qibai no longer has value to them.

663
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,310
They won't let him off.

664
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,230
Today, the Emperor of Jixing detained Mu Qibai.

665
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,270
Today?

666
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,270
Yes.

667
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,360
It hasn't been officially announced.

668
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,440
It seems that Ji Bozai

669
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,790
has gained the upper hand in this game after all.

670
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,710
How could it have gone so smoothly?
