1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it the heat that will only be available in the wind and rain?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are a warm place that is as deep as the heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will fight for you from now on

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't forget your eyes

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can't escape from this love

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can't forget your eyes

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Love by Hypnotic

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 14

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The Love by Hypnotic

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My Lord, My Lord

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What is this?

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What happened?

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I killed her

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I killed her

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My Lord, even if you are helping Ming Yi, you must protect yourself

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm fine, Fu Yuan

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't worry about me, I'm fine now

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Come

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
My Lord, you have been helping Ming Yi to deal with Mu Qi Bai for five times

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm afraid it's already become his eyes

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:02,580
Mu Qi Bai is going to deal with the

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The Love by Hypnotic

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The Hall of Judicial Review reported that Han Feng Jun kidnapped the Immortal Ming Yi

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And he even committed a personal crime

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Is it true?

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I found out that Ming Yi has a spiritual vein

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Ji Bo Zai is hiding and covering up

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I naturally have to investigate it

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The Immortal Ming Yi has a spiritual vein

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But the one covering up him is not Ji Bo Zai

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's me

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I've been wanting him to serve the Hall of Judicial Review for a long time

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nonsense

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The Immortal has a spiritual vein, it's not good

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You actually let him enter the Hall of Judicial Review

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This ridiculous rule should have been broken a long time ago

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will order the Hall of Judicial Review soon

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All the Immortal with a spiritual vein in the Jixing Abyss

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No need to hide

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
All can participate in the fight

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Uncle, rather than paying attention to a little thing like an Immortal with a spiritual vein

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's better to explain

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There is a story in this matter

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why is the dead person from Zhushui Lingzhou?

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He died

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Who is he?

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No matter who he is, it's not your turn to question me

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can't find the story of Zhushui Lingzhou

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But uncle, you can think about it

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why is the Hall of Judicial Review so fast to report to me about today's matter?

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Uncle

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The Jixing Abyss is not something you can cover up

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Uncle is getting more and more crazy

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He even has something to do with Zhushui Lingzhou

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Princess, what should we do next?

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now the Hall of Judicial Review will no longer be used by the Han Feng Army

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Can't we just ask for punishment?

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Uncle, even if the gold is not as good as the heart

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not that easy to think about it

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now I have to wake up my husband

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Uncle

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No matter what way

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think you don't know your master at all

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He doesn't care about the name at all

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So noisy

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Last night, the master took your master's fiancee to soak soup to warm up

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You have time to talk here

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Why don't you go and keep an eye on it?

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
In case your master's head is bald

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't care

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not the one who's bald

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Thank you

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Although you have a hostility towards us

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But you know it's dangerous

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And you went to the dragon stage with me to save people

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're pretty good

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
At the critical moment

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I really want to be with you

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I really want to be with you

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If you go and get caught

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Can't stand the torture

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Tell the secret of the turtle sea

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Then the master will really have trouble

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,020
Besides, the master's

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have to pay you back

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't do that

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I promise you three requirements

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What's the first requirement?

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No need to make your own decision

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The first requirement is that I fish with you

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think you want to fish by yourself

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And don't eat my little fish liver

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
OK, that's the second requirement

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So perfunctory

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
OK, you buy the fish liver

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You buy the fish liver

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,640
Yes.

104
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,120
I just wrote a book for Master Snake

105
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,720
to study whether the method of seduction and separation

106
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
can suppress Li Hantian.

107
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,360
You used your spirit vein this time

108
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
to prevent counteraction.

109
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,560
Thank you for worrying about me.

110
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,600
You're so polite.

111
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,240
You...

112
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,720
What's wrong with you?

113
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,840
Mingyi.

114
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
No matter how much you like him,

115
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
don't be swayed.

116
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,960
You only have one life.

117
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,560
Yes.

118
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
If a person dies,

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,520
what's the point of loving him?

120
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,080
When I really steal Huang Lianmeng,

121
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,680
he'll think that I've been lying to him.

122
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,720
He must hate me.

123
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,920
Then it's over.

124
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
He's always so straightforward.

125
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,880
He'll forget me soon.

126
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,680
It's all an excuse

127
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,480
It turns out that the love of a star is a kind of me

128
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,520
You know how to forget me.

129
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,240
You'll make me lose myself

130
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,480
I've never thought about why I love you

131
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,040
I'd rather give up my home and forget freedom

132
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,000
I've never been loved like this

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,160
Only you know me

134
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,200
Master.

135
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,560
I've been through so much.

136
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,520
I don't care about his past.

137
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,080
It doesn't matter to me

138
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,360
what kind of identity he is.

139
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,120
As long as I'm sure he really cares about me,

140
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,240
that's enough.

141
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,600
No matter what happens in the future,

142
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,680
I'll believe him.

143
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,440
Master.

144
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,320
Master.

145
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,080
Master.

146
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,320
Although the master practiced LilinENNIS,

147
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,440
he still got worse by instance.

148
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,800
Master, you must be careful.

149
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,180
You didn't have any chance to get to the

150
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Pavilion of Pure Love.

151
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,760
If it weren't for Chen Yuan's war with the Demon Beast,

152
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,060
Father wouldn't have given such an important thing

153
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,220
to Lord Han Feng.

154
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,600
Now that the Demon Beast is gone,

155
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,600
my good brother

156
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,480
died in the Pavilion of Pure Love.

157
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,520
How can I explain to Father

158
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,860
about your task?

159
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,940
Your Highness.

160
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,260
Your Highness.

161
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,400
Please keep this a secret.

162
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,600
Look.

163
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,100
There are so many sons of the Demon Lord.

164
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,980
How can I see you

165
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,900
if I don't kill them?

166
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,980
Don't you think so?

167
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,100
I've been tortured

168
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,100
by a bitch like you

169
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,940
in the Pavilion of Pure Love.

170
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,780
Now that the Demon Beast is trained by Lord Han Feng,

171
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,100
you should be destroyed.

172
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,060
Let's start with you.

173
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:37,340
Har

174
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,100
OK.

175
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,100
Look.

176
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,700
How?

177
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Big Brother is dead?

178
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,900
What a bad time.

179
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,900
But it's simple.

180
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,900
I just need to go back and say

181
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
it's to raise the Demon Beast Army.

182
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
Big Brother sacrificed himself.

183
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,500
How can he use all his power

184
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,900
to decide to take the initiative?

185
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,900
How touching.

186
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
If this is passed on,

187
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,300
it can become a good story.

188
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,100
It can also solve the long-term problem of Han Feng Jun.

189
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Thank you for your kindness,

190
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,300
but I don't understand.

191
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,860
The Demon Beast has been purified by Ji Bo

192
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,300
and disappeared from the world.

193
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
What can we do

194
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,100
to explain to Lord Zhushui?

195
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,300
At this time,

196
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,900
Han Feng Jun is still in trouble.

197
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,100
Sun Liao has already explained.

198
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,100
I don't understand.

199
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,300
Listen carefully.

200
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,100
Give me the Demon Beast you hid.

201
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,100
So I can cover you

202
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,100
in front of my father.

203
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Your Highness,

204
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
listen carefully.

205
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,300
Now I have the thing.

206
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,900
If you want to ask for someone,

207
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,700
you have to say please.

208
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,700
You!

209
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
Do you know how to use

210
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,500
the thing in my hand?

211
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,100
If you are willing to cooperate with me

212
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,700
to push everything

213
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,300
to that dead man who can't speak,

214
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,300
in the future,

215
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,100
my great cause will be achieved.

216
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,500
Everything about the Ji Xing Yuan

217
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,700
is also your second Highness' contribution.

218
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,500
Then you'd better be quick.

219
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,500
Father is not as patient as me.

220
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,700
Please.

221
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,100
Then please be quick.

222
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Sister, how are you feeling?

223
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
I'm fine.

224
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,100
Thank you for your concern, Lord Situ.

225
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,500
I'm just curious.

226
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,300
How did you know it was so fast?

227
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,900
Princess Tian Ji and the others are here.

228
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,700
I just hate that I can't be faster.

229
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,100
Didn't you find a body

230
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,300
that can't be distinguished by the barrier?

231
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,500
The Bureau of Judicial Review checked it.

232
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,700
We can't confirm its identity for now.

233
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,900
Is the wrist of the body injured?

234
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
I didn't see the figure,

235
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
but I saw it

236
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,100
being scratched on the wrist.

237
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Yes, it is.

238
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,100
Really?

239
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,100
But I heard

240
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,300
the body was burnt into a burnt bone by magic.

241
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,300
Lord Situ,

242
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,900
how did you know it was injured?

243
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Maybe...

244
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,700
I'm so sorry.

245
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Sister,

246
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,700
if I don't kill her,

247
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,900
she'll kill you.

248
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
You...

249
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Sister,

250
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,100
do you still care about me?

251
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
What are you doing?

252
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I don't understand.

253
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
The women who have a soul in the ride

254
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,100
don't need to be stung by the ghost.

255
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,100
That's great.

256
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
There will be female fighters in the future.

257
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Princess is really powerful.

258
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
I want this, Your Highness.

259
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Okay, thank you.

260
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Zhangtai,

261
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
you're so hurt.

262
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Are you really okay now?

263
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Don't worry.

264
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Princess Tianqi healed me.

265
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
You asked your brother,

266
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
the medicine that 27 sent me,

267
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
I drank it.

268
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Now, my body is harder than before.

269
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Don't worry.

270
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Your Highness, one more of this.

271
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Okay.

272
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
I'm sorry to have you involved.

273
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Thank you.

274
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
What's the big deal?

275
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
I really...

276
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
You can't say that.

277
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
By the way,

278
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
do you think

279
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
I look different today?

280
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
You have the blush of the sea-bream,

281
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
and the eyebrows of the mountain.

282
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Not at all.

283
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
Look, I can use my spirit vein.

284
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
After I was hurt,

285
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Princess Tianqi ordered someone to treat my wounds.

286
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
They found my soul-sting.

287
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
They asked me if I wanted to pull it out.

288
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
Of course I would.

289
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
So now I have a spirit vein.

290
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,100
Although I can't break through any limits,

291
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
I've been through a lot of cultivation.

292
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,100
I can do more with my hairpin.

293
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,100
It must hurt to pull out your soul-sting.

294
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
It must hurt.

295
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Luckily, you can do what you like now.

296
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Okay.

297
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
You've seen me before.

298
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Go back.

299
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
The spirit vein is waiting for you.

300
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
What's wrong with you?

301
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Sister Hao, don't ask me.

302
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
I don't want to say it or lie to you.

303
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
I...

304
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Actually, I've known that

305
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,100
you have many secrets.

306
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,100
I don't want to ask you.

307
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
But I can see that

308
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
the Immortal Lord likes you very much.

309
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
He's nice to you.

310
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Of course it doesn't matter.

311
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
What matters is what you think.

312
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Actually, you like him too.

313
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Yes, I...

314
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,100
I didn't expect that I still like him.

315
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
I don't like him anymore.

316
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
But it won't last long.

317
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
But Mingyi, do you know that

318
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
in this world,

319
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
it's hard to find a happy ending.

320
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Even if you leave in the future,

321
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
won't you be happy

322
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
when you see him in the capital?

323
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Shopkeeper,

324
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
help me wrap this.

325
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Okay.

326
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
I'll go.

327
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
It seems that you don't want to do it.

328
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
It doesn't matter.

329
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,100
I won't force anyone to do it.

330
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,100
After all, if you don't do it,

331
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
I have other ways to do it.

332
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
But after the trial is over,

333
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I still tell everyone

334
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
that you did it.

335
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Han Feng, you're kidding.

336
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100
I'm a doctor.

337
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
I'm capable.

338
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
If you spread this story,

339
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
I'm afraid no one will believe it.

340
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
How come?

341
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
This should be more credible.

342
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
You're capable,

343
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,580
so you're humble and

344
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,100
you're a master.

345
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,100
One day,

346
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
you touched the Lord

347
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
and made a name for yourself.

348
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
It sounds reasonable.

349
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
Since the last number

350
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
is the first move,

351
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
then you should be grateful

352
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,100
whether you accept it or not.

353
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
I'm sorry.

354
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
I'm sorry.

355
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
I'm sorry.

356
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
I'm sorry.

357
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
I'm sorry.

362
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
I'm sorry.

363
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
I'm sorry.

367
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
I'm sorry.

368
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
I'm sorry.

370
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
I'm sorry.

375
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
I'm sorry.

376
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,100
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
I'm sorry.

378
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
I'm sorry.

379
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
I'm sorry.

380
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Lord Yan,

382
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
the princess wants to see you.

383
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Lord Yan,

384
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
this way, please.

385
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Lord Yan,

386
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
this way, please.

387
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Lord Yan,

388
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
this way, please.

389
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Lord Yan,

390
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
this way, please.

391
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Lord Yan,

392
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
this way, please.

393
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Lord Yan,

394
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
this way, please.

395
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,100
Lord Yan,

396
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,100
this way, please.

397
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Lord Yan,

398
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,100
this way, please.

399
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Lord Yan,

400
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
this way, please.

401
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
Lord Yan,

402
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
this way, please.

403
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
Lord Yan,

404
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,100
this way, please.

405
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,100
Lord Yan,

406
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
this way, please.

407
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Lord Yan,

408
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
this way, please.

409
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Lord Yan,

410
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
this way, please.

411
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
Lord Yan,

412
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
this way, please.

413
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Lord Yan,

414
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
this way, please.

415
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Princess,

416
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,500
What brings you here today?

417
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,580
I'm not feeling well.

418
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,780
So I want to ask you to check on me.

419
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,140
You look normal.

420
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,180
How come you're not feeling well?

421
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,580
I had a dream.

422
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,940
I dreamed that you killed my husband.

423
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,580
So I was worried.

424
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,420
I want to know

425
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,020
if everything is all right

426
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,460
before I have a dream.

427
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,460
You seem

428
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,300
a little nervous.

429
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,900
Why should I be nervous?

430
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,740
His Majesty will see her.

431
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,940
I think Lord Yan feels nervous.

432
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,460
You are just kidding.

433
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,660
You can go now.

434
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,940
I'm sorry.

435
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,100
Your Highness, give it back to me.

436
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,220
What did you say?

437
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,140
I don't understand.

438
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,540
Even if you want to pretend to be confused,

439
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,420
I can also tell Han Feng Jun

440
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,300
that what you want to do

441
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,100
will never be done.

442
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,740
Then you can tell Han Feng Jun

443
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,100
that you will

444
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,740
give me my words.

445
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,420
You guess.

446
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,820
At midnight,

447
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,300
you went out of my Yutu Hall.

448
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,500
Just in time,

449
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,500
I have a dress.

450
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,100
Who will he trust?

451
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,700
Your Highness,

452
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,020
do you know what you are doing?

453
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,540
Do you think I don't dare?

454
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,540
I just miss my husband.

455
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,500
Is there anything wrong?

456
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,220
I hope I can go back to my home country.

457
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,220
No one will know what happened.

458
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,460
Just help me once.

459
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,940
Just once.

460
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,460
Okay?

461
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,860
Yan Ke Ke.

462
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,700
Why?

463
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,580
Why do you do this?

464
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,980
I trust you so much.

465
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,020
You know it was my uncle who did this.

466
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,020
That's why my husband is confused.

467
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,820
Now he wants you to be in charge of the case.

468
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,820
He just wants you to keep an eye on him

469
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,660
and keep him awake.

470
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,140
I know

471
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,660
that my uncle is the one

472
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,180
who is responsible for all the people in the Ji Xing Garden.

473
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,700
Because my uncle can

474
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,220
give them a body-building class

475
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,580
and keep them in peace.

476
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,700
But they...

477
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,980
They don't care about me.

478
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,980
But you can't do this.

479
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,100
Why are you doing this?

480
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,940
You can't do this.

481
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,300
You will always be responsible.

482
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,300
Then I beg you for one thing.

483
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,900
Brother Yan.

484
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,540
Your Highness,

485
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,820
you have overestimated me.

486
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,580
Han Feng Jun ordered me to be His Majesty's physician.

487
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,420
If he decides to kill His Majesty,

488
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,980
what right do I have

489
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,220
to disobey him?

490
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,420
I never thought

491
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,060
you would be such a despicable,

492
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,140
shameless man.

493
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,260
You went to the Li's Manor.

494
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,500
You're so pitiful.

495
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,500
I don't know anything.

496
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,420
Just pretend I never came.

497
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,860
All right.

498
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,100
Come on, Xiaoman.

499
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,540
Take it to the table over there.

500
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:36,780
Brother,

501
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,460
the pancake you ordered is ready.

502
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,340
Please enjoy it.

503
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,260
You only think of me?

504
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,900
Sister.

505
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,460
You've grown taller.

506
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,260
Go back to your work.

507
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:47,900
Go.

508
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,840
You've got a

509
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,440
body.

510
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,900
You're happy.

511
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,020
If In 2nd're happy,

512
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,580
just call me.

513
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,700
In 3rd're happy.

514
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:13,980
In 3rd',

515
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,500
In 4th',

516
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,620
that's good.

517
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,700
Cut.

518
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,140
I'll competition against you.

519
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:21,940
Okay.

520
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,300
chuckles

521
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,020
No slurs.

522
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,440
I'll live

523
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,540
with only a milkman.

524
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,500
Don't you want it?

525
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,300
Holy Lord, you said you'd bring me to estembrory,

526
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,080
I think it's an excuse...

527
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,700
Really?

528
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,100
In fact...

529
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,020
In fact, that night

530
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,140
You didn't die you know

531
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,760
Why you are so afraid of me

532
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,240
I didn't even know, why I homemade you

533
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,680
Take me back

534
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,880
I will see you in the future

535
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,540
I will be there when you well

536
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,740
Dad

537
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,180
I don't wanna go back

538
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,220
Otherwise you will be my sister

539
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,860
Then I will leave

540
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,460
I'm so sorry

541
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,600
I really can't

542
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,780
Thanks

543
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,240
I will make you a big meal

544
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,280
My bad

545
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,200
For sure!

546
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,760
We couldn't find anything...

547
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,040
腺君,

548
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,520
you suffered a lot

549
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,920
when you were training in controversies.

550
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,040
That demon beast

551
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,120
must be affecting you.

552
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:49,080
A novo

553
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,400
You just trust me?

554
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,960
Lord Ji, Lord Shen, please.

555
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,240
Lord Shen.

556
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,680
I suddenly called you.

557
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,800
You seem to be not surprised.

558
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,520
Of course.

559
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,280
I've been waiting

560
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
for today.

561
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,520
I wonder what method Tian Ji used

562
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,880
to cure my illness.

563
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,520
You must be aware of the crisis.

564
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,640
But His Majesty is about to be in trouble.

565
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,080
In trouble?

566
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,160
You mean Lord Han Feng?

567
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,160
While His Majesty was in a coma,

568
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,260
His Majesty became

569
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,840
a metal item.

570
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,680
Lord Han Feng heard

571
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,200
I cured my illness.

572
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,560
He's already foreseen

573
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,680
concrete powers of Lord Han Feng.

574
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,160
Now, have you realized

575
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,960
I've had for a long time

576
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,000
that I'm dead?

577
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
I hope you can be cruel.

578
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Waner is my only brother.

579
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
I know what he wants.

580
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
He can't stand the temperament and actions.

581
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
He even arranged a doctor to be by my side.

582
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
I can see all of these.

583
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
But when I think of

584
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
how he was just my little brother

585
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
who didn't know the art of art,

586
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
I can't help but be angry.

587
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
But I never,

588
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
I never thought that

589
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,640
he would be so useful to Xun Xin.

590
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
He colluded with the bamboo water spirit boat

591
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
to raise the demon god.

592
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
He only left the peace and safety to the innocent.

593
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
You have done so much for the Jixing Garden.

594
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
You have done so much for the Jixing Garden.

595
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
I am very grateful for your efforts.

596
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
I am very grateful for your efforts.

597
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
But the Demon God is very dangerous.

598
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
But the Demon God is very dangerous.

599
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
You are carrying the burden alone

600
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
and don't want to report it.

601
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,640
You should think about the consequences.

602
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
The Jixing Garden is half of the Han Feng Army.

603
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
If you do this,

604
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
you will be exposed.

605
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
Moreover,

606
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
it's because you

607
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
raised your uncle's position in the past,

608
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
that the situation is like this.

609
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
The Jixing Palace is in this situation.

610
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
It's hard for you to trust me.

611
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
I have been thinking about it since I was a child.

612
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
I will do my best

613
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
to stop my uncle from hurting you.

614
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
Now no one knows what my uncle will do next.

615
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
So,

616
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
no matter how unkind my father is,

617
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
I beg you

618
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
to take the Jixing Garden into consideration

619
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
and arrest my uncle immediately.

620
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
I also want to ask Lord Ji Xian

621
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
to trust us again

622
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
and guard the Jixing Garden with us.

623
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
The Jixing Palace is not worth trusting.

624
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
But...

625
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
But not all the people in the palace

626
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
will be completely innocent.

627
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
For the sake of the six realms,

628
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
I am willing to unite all people.

629
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,640
But behind the tomb,

630
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
there is the bamboo water and the spiritual boat.

631
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Only we are alone.

632
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
We are too old

633
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
and unable to fight against each other.

634
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
I beg you

635
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
to take the Jixing Garden into consideration

636
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
and arrest Mu Qi Bai.

637
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
I beg you

638
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
to arrest my uncle immediately.

639
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,640
Brother, you haven't recovered yet.

640
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
You should have a good rest.

641
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
If you have something to say,

642
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
just ask someone to pass it on.

643
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
Recently,

644
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,640
I have heard a lot of rumors about people who harm people.

645
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
Most of them are about you.

646
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
Since my body is fine now,

647
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
I want to hear you

648
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
tell me the truth.

649
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
What rumors?

650
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
I won't tell you

651
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
because you are the one who killed my uncle.

652
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
I am not the one who killed your uncle.

653
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
I am the one who killed your uncle.

654
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
You are my close relative.

655
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,640
If you still insist on hiding the truth about the Beast Lord,

656
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I have no other choice.

657
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Who made this rumor?

658
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,640
It's useless.

659
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
Brother, do you want to listen to the rumors

660
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
and doubt your own brother?

661
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Qi Bai,

662
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,640
when did you become like this?

663
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
What do you mean?

664
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
You have been weak since you were a child.

665
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
You have been gentle and considerate since you were a child.

666
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
When we were training together,

667
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
you were so kind.

668
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
You would rather get hurt

669
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
than hurt others.

670
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Not willing?

671
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,640
What a bad person.

672
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
I can't do that, brother.

673
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
If I can be stronger,

674
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
I won't always fail.

675
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,640
As long as my brother can be more decisive,

676
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
I won't be beaten by those old guys

677
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
and can't be defeated easily.

678
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
As long as our God Lord can be more decisive,

679
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,640
the Ji Xing Yuan will be in the lower three realms.

680
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Even at this moment,

681
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,640
my useless brother

682
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
is still praising me

683
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,640
for being gentle, kind and considerate.

684
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,640
You don't deserve to be in this position.

685
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
Brother,

686
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,640
Ji Xing Yuan won't be destroyed by the Demon King.

687
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,640
It will only be destroyed by someone like you.

688
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
The Demon King is dead.

689
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
Long Li Tai is known to be a place of unknown history.

690
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Many people have already known about it.

691
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
The God of Boiling Water will definitely investigate it.

692
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Remember, Your Majesty,

693
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
you mustn't be discovered.

694
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Don't worry.

695
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
I will be discovered.

696
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
I will be able to see the Demon King

697
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
and the Demon King's face.

698
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
I will be able to see the Demon King's face.

699
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
I will be able to see the Demon King's face.

700
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,640
I will be able to see the Demon King's face.

701
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,640
I will be able to see the Demon King's face.

702
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
It seems that

703
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Mu Qi Bai is the last person to meet with the court.

704
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
It's better to give him the goods.

705
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Besides, the monster has been trained by Ji Bo Zai.

706
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Mu Qi Bai has no use value.

707
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
They won't let him go.

708
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Today, the God of Star is suppressing Mu Qi Bai.

709
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
Today?

710
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Yes.

711
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
It hasn't been passed on yet.

712
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
It seems that this game of chess

713
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,640
is more difficult for the loyal Ji Bo Zai.

714
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
How can it be so easy?

715
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,640
The God of Star

716
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
is my soul

717
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
until it becomes weak.

718
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,640
It's enough to lie to myself once.

719
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,640
Even if I have never been true to myself.

720
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
From the starry sky to your heart,

721
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,640
how long will it take to have tears?

722
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,640
The tenderness you gave me is all because of love.

723
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,640
I will drink up my pain

724
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,640
and exchange it for your freedom.

725
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
I am willing to give up

726
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,640
all that I have for love.

727
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,640
Struggling behind the abyss,

728
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
I want to ask the sky,

729
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,640
why am I always struggling for you?

730
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,640
Fate has never been wrong.

731
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,640
The sun will eventually fall.

732
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,640
I will fight against all the absurdity.

733
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
From the starry sky to your heart,

734
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,640
how long will it take to have tears?

735
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:16,640
The tenderness you gave me is all because of love.

736
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,640
I will drink up my pain

737
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,640
and exchange it for your freedom.

738
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,640
Once love has, I would rather give up.

739
