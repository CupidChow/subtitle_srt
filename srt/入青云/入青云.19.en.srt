1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or the heat that only exists in the wind and clouds

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You are a warm place that is as warm as the stars

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Memories have been fighting for you

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The hero that I can't forget

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The love that I can't escape from

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I love you so much that I can't forget

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Love of Dream

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Zheng Nan

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you have tea?

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Zheng Nan

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Please

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Take care

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you have tea?

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Have some tea

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Please sit inside

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Chai Yueye, did you see Zhang Tai?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Him?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He was here this morning

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He didn't see him this afternoon

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He went that way

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
In the alley?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thank you

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ladies, please come inside

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Zhang Tai

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Zhang Tai

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Zhang Tai

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Zhang Tai

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Zhang Tai

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Zhang Tai

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why are you so hurt?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Who did this?

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Come on

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's go

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll take you

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So touching

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He's quite strict

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You should be good sisters when you get down there

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Mu Qi Bai

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I know what you want

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let him go

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You come at me

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Tell me where Ji Bozai is

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll let you go right away

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're dreaming

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Then don't blame me

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll go

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Brother, I beg you

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let him go

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Kill me

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You should worry about yourself

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You want to run?

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Tell me

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Erqi

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mingyi

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Take him away

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll go with you

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Go

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Go

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Go

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Go

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Go

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Go

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Go

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have to save you

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No one can leave today

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Mingyi

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Tingli, go

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Go

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mingyi

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Mingyi

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Go

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You let them go

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're as stupid as a pig

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You go

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Chief

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Chief

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Chief

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I didn't expect that Ji Bozai's side of Mingyi's son

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
is still with the spirit

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I underestimated you

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I've sealed your spirit power

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You can't escape from our palm

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can't suffer much if you tell me directly

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Brother, I beg you to let him go

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I beg you

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I beg you

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I beg you

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I beg you

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Please let him go

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I beg you

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We used the black grass to find him

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ji Bozai is not in the turtle sea

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Tell me

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Where is Ji Bozai now?

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where is the dream of the emerald in his hands?

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Where is Ji Bozai?

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why would he tell me?

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We've been in the same bed for a long time

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He never believed me

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You've got the wrong person

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If Ji Bozai doesn't trust you

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How could he risk to hide a woman with a spirit

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
who hasn't been stung by the spirit nail

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Give him a lesson first

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Watch the play

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Watch the play

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Feng Xiepan

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You need the help of the bad guys to deal with me

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sister Feng

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The one who used the spirit nail to kill me

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and was killed by the head

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and didn't dare to show up

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who is the culprit?

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He dared to jump on the stage

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
but you didn't do anything

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It seems that it's the one who colluded with Chen Yuan

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the late emperor from Shangjing

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're so smart

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't want to kill him anymore

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Tell me

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Where is Ji Bozai?

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Still not telling me

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Where is he?

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Where is he?

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Brother

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm begging you

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let him go

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let him go

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll do it if you have any problem

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I won't do it

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're just a mule who is willing to kill anyone

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Do you still want to struggle?

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Are you not mules?

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Feng Xiepan

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You have been attacked by those people

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and have been exposed to the outside world

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They used Chen Yuan to train demons

149
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
to support the beasts

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
They thought they could get their support

151
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and replace Ji Xing

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But Chen Yuan was sealed

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and the demon spirit was changed by Ji Bozai

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Han Feng Ju is losing

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He can't catch Ji Bozai

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He wants to kill me

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I can't stop

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Han Feng Ju is just a good dog

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In the end, they will be in danger

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're so stubborn

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Poor thing

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Brother

163
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm begging you

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let him go

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Interesting

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Grandma

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Mingyi was caught by Mu Xibai

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know who set the barrier in advance

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I really can't get in

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Grandma

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Tell Ji Xianjun

172
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
that I'm begging him to save Mingyi

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Just tell him

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm begging him to save Mingyi

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Just tell him

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Grandma

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm begging you

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Tell him

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm begging you

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Tell him

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm begging you

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm begging you

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is the trap set by Mu Xibai

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The purpose is to lure the master out

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and kill himself

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Now is the time to break the demon spirit

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If the master is out now

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
not only all the efforts before will be wasted

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
the master will also be severely injured

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't want Mingyi to be in danger

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But you also know where he is now

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Ji Xianjun is going to be the demon-slayer

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's the best choice to make him stay in the dark

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
In order to avoid exposure

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
it's the best choice to stay in the dark

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I know all these

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But Mingyi is my family

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have no choice

200
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Thank you

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This place

202
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
is not for them

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Ji Bocai

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
How did they treat you?

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Kill your master

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Torture, burial, and death

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You and I are one

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You have the strongest power in the world

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Kill the gods, kill the gods, kill the gods

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Those who are sorry to you

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
can no longer block your way

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We are one

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We are one

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We are one

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You are really a devil

216
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Stop

217
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Stop

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This barrier is a little strange

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You are a demon

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
These people are not human

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You are a demon

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This is not over

223
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Sit down

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Come on

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I told you to say it

226
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Say it

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You are really a hard bone

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You are really a demon

229
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You blocked the spiritual power

230
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and forced the blood to flow

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Interesting

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Can you leave this hairpin as a souvenir for me?

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This is my powder

235
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You are not worthy of your own power

236
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Mingyi

237
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You can't save yourself

238
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can't save him

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You are not dead

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You are not dead

241
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What are you doing behind me?

242
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I will give you a chance

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:17:13,980
I will let you be a pair of

244
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What are you doing?

245
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Mingyuan is not here

246
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It doesn't matter

247
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We will play slowly

248
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Fairy Mingyi

249
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Have you thought it through?

250
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This seduction

251
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
will make people suffer

252
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and reveal the truth

253
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I will be the one to do it

254
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I will be the one to do it

255
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I will be the one to do it

256
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I will be the one to do it

257
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If you are so worried

258
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You should tell the truth

259
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't know

260
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It doesn't matter if you don't tell me

261
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You have feelings for the heart of Count Ji

262
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I want to see

263
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
if he will abandon his wife

264
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Tell me

265
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Where is Ji Bocai?

266
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I was wrong

267
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I know I was wrong

268
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I can win

269
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I will always win

270
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will always win

271
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I will always win

272
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I will always win

273
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I will always win

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I will always win

275
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I will always win

276
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I will always win

277
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm sorry

278
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm sorry

279
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm sorry

280
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sorry

281
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Tell me

282
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Where is Ji Bocai?

283
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't know

284
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't know

285
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
How did I teach you in the past?

286
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You are the crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain

287
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You want to fight for the honor of Yaoguang Mountain

288
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Do you know

289
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Ji Bocai

290
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
is the enemy of Yaoguang Mountain

291
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm sorry

292
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm sorry

293
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I know I was wrong

294
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I was wrong

295
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Believe me

296
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You lost to Ji Bocai

297
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You lost to Yaoguang Mountain

298
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Now you still have to protect him

299
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Are you really going to betray the country?

300
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm sorry

301
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm sorry

302
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry

303
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Still not willing to say

304
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I want to see how long your mouth can last

305
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm sorry

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm sorry

307
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't know

308
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't know

309
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't know

310
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't know where he is

311
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sorry

312
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I really don't know

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Where is he?

314
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm sorry

315
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't know

316
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Meiyi

317
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm sorry

318
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sorry

319
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't know

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I really don't know

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Say

322
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Where is the dream of the desolation?

323
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I said it before

324
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't know

325
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's useless to kill me

326
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's a big price to protect a person unconditionally

327
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Stop dreaming

328
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
No one

329
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Will sacrifice himself for another person

330
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I said I don't know

331
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You didn't kill me

332
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't know

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't know

334
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This Ji Bozai is really cold-blooded

335
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Even his wife has become like this

336
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Can also be unquestionable

337
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Really from the abyss

338
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Step by step

339
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
A little fairy

340
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Even if he has a spiritual vein

341
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It is impossible to bear the seduction and shoot

342
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Unless

343
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He really doesn't know anything

344
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Dear brother

345
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You don't think

346
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Just a hairpin

347
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Can kill me

348
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
No

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Big brother

350
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I just want you to be distracted

351
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I don't know

352
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I don't know

353
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't know

354
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't know

355
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I don't know

356
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I don't know

357
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I don't know

358
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I don't know

359
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
How can I get through?

360
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Sister

361
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You wait for me

362
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Since Ji Bozai has given up on you

363
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Why don't you stand by my side

364
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't know

365
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't know

366
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I don't know

367
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I don't know

368
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't know

369
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't know

370
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't know

371
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You stand by my side

372
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
As long as you tell me

373
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Ji Bozai hid the imperial dream there

374
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I promise you

375
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I will definitely let you go

376
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Good child

377
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Don't you want me to hug you?

378
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
As long as you tell me the whereabouts of the imperial dream

379
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Then I will always treat you well

380
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay?

381
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Come

382
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Child

383
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Child

384
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Mother

385
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
As long as I tell you the whereabouts of the imperial dream

386
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Can you get those?

387
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yes

388
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
As long as you say

389
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I can promise you anything

390
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Tell me

391
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Where is Ji Bozai hiding the imperial dream?

392
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Tell me everything you know

393
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Imperial dream

394
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Imperial dream

395
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
In

396
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
In

397
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
In

398
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Where

399
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Where

400
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
In

401
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Ji Bozai

402
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
He never had a imperial dream

403
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You really don't know anything

404
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
This seduction is a waste on you

405
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Anyway, Ji Bozai won't come to save you

406
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What's the use of keeping you?

407
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Ji Bozai

408
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Ji Bozai

409
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Kill him

410
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You've always wanted to take revenge

411
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Take revenge

412
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Ji Bozai

413
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Ji Bozai, don't be controlled

414
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Ji Bozai

415
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Ji Bozai

416
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Ji Bozai

417
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Ji Bozai

418
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Why did you stop?

419
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
No

420
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Do it

421
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Ji Bozai

422
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Ji Bozai, don't be controlled

423
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Ji Bozai

424
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Such a good opportunity

425
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
What are you waiting for? Ji Bozai

426
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Ji Bozai

427
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Ji Bozai, don't be controlled

428
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Ji Bozai

429
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Ji Bozai

430
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Ji Bozai

431
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Ji Bozai

432
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
No

433
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Ji Bozai

434
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
No

435
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Ji Bozai

436
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Ji Bozai

437
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Ji Bozai

438
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Please don't be controlled by him.

439
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Please.

440
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Please.

441
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Please.

442
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Please.

443
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Please.

444
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Please don't be controlled by them.

445
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Please.

446
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Uncle Gao...

447
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Qin Fangcai.

448
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Qin Fangcai.

449
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You can do it.

450
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Stop it.

451
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Qin Fangcai.

452
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Qin Fangcai.

453
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Qin Fangcai.

454
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Stop it.

455
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm here to help you.

456
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You're my last hope.

457
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Uncle.

458
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Qin Fangcai.

459
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Qin Fangcai.

460
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Qin Fangcai.

461
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
A'Du.

462
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Qin Fangcai.

463
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Mother.

464
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Please forgive me.

465
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'll do whatever you say.

466
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I never dare to disobey you.

467
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But this time...

468
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Fine.

469
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I've raised you for so many years.

470
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You betrayed me for the sake of Ji Bozai.

471
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Fine.

472
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Then you'll stay here forever.

473
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Forever.

474
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
No relatives.

475
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
No friends.

476
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Don't go.

479
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Don't go.

480
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yunyi.

481
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Don't go.

482
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yunyi.

483
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm wrong.

486
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Let me out.

487
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm really wrong.

488
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm wrong.

489
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I regret that I was wrong.

492
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Don't go.

493
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm really wrong.

494
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm so cold.

497
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm so cold.

498
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm so cold.

502
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yunyi.

503
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'll take you home.

504
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Hong Long.

512
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's all my fault.

514
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
If I had practiced the Long-Terminus earlier,

515
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
you wouldn't have suffered anymore.

516
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It's warm.

517
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Mingyi.

518
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's so warm.

519
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You're awake.

520
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's so warm.

521
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Mingyi.

522
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You're not awake enough.

523
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You'll get used to it.

524
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You'll get used to it.

525
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Mingyi.

526
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Mingyi.

527
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Mingyi.

528
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Mingyi.

529
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Mingyi.

530
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Mingyi.

531
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Mingyi.

532
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Mingyi.

533
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Mingyi.

534
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Are you feeling better?

535
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You've been doing this

536
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
just for the sake of the Spirit-Dream.

537
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Isn't that right?

538
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm not.

539
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I'm not.

540
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm not.

541
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm not.

542
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm not.

543
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm not.

544
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So,

545
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
you've been lying to me.

546
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm afraid to face you,

547
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
but I'm afraid to face myself.

548
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You have no idea

549
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
what I really want to hide from the Spirit-Dream.

550
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm not.

551
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Mingyi, look at me.

552
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You're so heavy.

553
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
How could you become like this?

554
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Just bear with it.

555
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It'll be over soon.

556
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Mingyi,

557
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
have you ever

558
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
loved me at all?

559
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I've never loved you at all.

560
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
What did you say?

561
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I love you more than anything.

562
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I love you more than anything.

563
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I love you more than anything.

564
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Did you use magic

565
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
when we were in the Spring-Spring Street?

566
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
No.

567
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Never.

568
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm not.

569
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
If you're in love,

570
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
you'll be in love with each other.

571
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Please come up.

572
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
This is the place

573
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
where lovers of the six realms will get married.

574
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
There's a divine order.

575
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
All the six realms are not allowed to interfere.

576
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
If lovers enter the love world,

577
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
the birds of the seven heavens will come in the dark.

578
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You can stay in the love world for the rest of your life.

579
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
We don't have any feelings.

580
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The birds of the seven heavens won't come.

581
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Let's just stay in the love world.

582
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That's weird.

583
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
If you're not in love,

584
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
you can't get through the love world.

585
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What you said

586
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
is true.

587
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I do have you in my heart.

588
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Ji Boca,

589
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
you don't even know

590
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
how much I care about you.

591
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Ji Boca

592
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Mingyi,

593
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
look carefully.

594
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm in front of you.

595
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You can only be me.

596
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Ji Boca

597
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The Love by Hypnotic

598
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The love by Hypnotic

599
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The love by Hypnotic

600
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
What's wrong with my heart?

601
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Fate has never been wrong.

602
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The sun will eventually fall.

603
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I desperately resist all the absurdity.

604
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
From the starry sky to your heart,

605
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
how long does it take to shed tears?

606
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
The tenderness you gave me

607
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
is all because of love.

608
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'll ease my pain

609
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and exchange for your freedom.

610
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Once love has a place,

611
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I'll let go of it once and for all.

612
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The Love by Hypnotic

613
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The Love by Hypnotic
