1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it the heat that will last only in the wind and clouds?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are a warm feeling that is as warm as the heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Memories have been fighting for you since then

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The hero that I can't forget

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The one that I can't escape from is the love

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Love you so much that I can't forget

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Love by Hypnotic

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Episode 14

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You want to eat?

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But look at it clearly

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My dogs are more noble than you

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You can kneel down and eat

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No kneeling

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you kneel?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No kneeling

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You don't even want your parents

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You are a dog that is abandoned on the border

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Do you know that?

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you dare to offend me again, I will break your legs

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I... I'm not abandoned on the roadside

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I... I'm not

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I must leave here alive

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Go over there

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Or you will run away

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Go

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This painting is right here

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There is no mechanism on this road

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The defense is a little unusual here

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm afraid it's not useless

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's just that it hasn't started yet

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Waiting for us to surrender

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm afraid it's not useless

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's just that it hasn't started yet

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Waiting for us to surrender

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Sir

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I have a responsibility to protect you

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I should go first and thunder

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I... I don't care what happens

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But if you have something, who will support this family?

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let me go for you

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You go

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let me go

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You are so mean

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I... I...

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's okay

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I came here for you

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I... I

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I brought your things

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Go

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,980
Sir

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go

57
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,880
Let you see

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,600
my dependency four- muit

59
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:46,980
Sisexual shine

60
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,620
Oldrecord,

61
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,120
we came today for a group dance.

62
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,060
What about any other activities?

63
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,320
No more anyways.

64
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,640
No.

65
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,480
I'm fine.

66
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,120
If this thing doesn't die,

67
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,520
you'll have no place to run.

68
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,680
Your hand?

69
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,300
Get up now.

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,060
We've already reserved a place

71
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,920
for you.

72
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,800
What happened,

73
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,520
Oldrecord...

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm fine.

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You must be heartbroken.

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There's more?

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Be careful.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm fine.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm fine.

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm fine.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm fine.

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm fine.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Be careful.

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Be careful.

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you alright?

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're hit by a sword.

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Come with me.

88
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Come back with me.

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sir.

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Take all the valuable things away.

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I can buy them for you later.

92
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come with me.

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No.

94
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We still need to fake the scene.

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The more real, the better.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I know what you mean.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The picture of the late doctor's wife

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
is still under your eyes.

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Little Situ.

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're new official.

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You made such a big mistake.

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You must find out.

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The operation of the private court

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
still depends on you.

105
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Whatever you need me to do,

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
just arrange it.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll be there.

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll be there.

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll be there.

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll be there.

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll be there.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll be there.

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll be there.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll be there.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll be there.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Just arrange it.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I appreciate your honesty.

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
At the party yesterday,

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I saw that you were very interested in the painting.

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If the private court can investigate the turtle sea

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and clear up the Ji Xianjun,

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
it would be even better.

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Ji Xianjun is a war criminal.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have no evidence.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I just lied to you

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and I just searched the turtle sea.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you want to argue with me,

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have no position.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm not good enough to stand on the upper side.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why are you so rash?

131
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You went to the turtle sea

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
to find out if there were any thieves

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to break in and protect Ji Xianjun.

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He has a spiritual vein,

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
but I don't.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You say it's the opposite of who protects whom.

137
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Didn't you just say

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you wanted to listen to me?

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You arrange it.

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But I didn't say I could do it.

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How dare you talk to His Highness like this?

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Forget it.

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yan Xiao.

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You go.

145
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes, Your Highness.

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yan Xiao.

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What's the matter

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
with Yan Xiao's visit?

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't know.

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,580
Last night, the

151
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,000
Sipan Hall was robbed.

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was ordered to investigate it.

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Sorry to bother you.

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What does the Sipan Hall

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
have to do with the turtle sea?

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Besides,

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
there is a new Sipan Hall.

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Who is this monkey?

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Who is the dog?

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The thief not only stole the treasure,

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
but also took the portrait of the fairy

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
shown at the banquet of the Han Feng Army.

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He was beaten by a Shiling Sword

164
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
for that worthless thing.

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The new official took three jobs.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Sipan ordered me to investigate it.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I saw that painting

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
at the banquet last night.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm just a little doctor.

170
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I can't leave.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Investigate it.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The magic weapon of Yan Xiao

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
is for our brother Ji.

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Now it can prove

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
that I didn't get hit by anything.

176
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's the Shiling Sword, right?

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Of course.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:13,200
That's the

179
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Brother Yan is a morning god.

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're talking nonsense.

181
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How can you believe that a little fairy

182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
can enter and exit Sipan Hall?

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Brother Ji, you don't know that

184
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the magic array at the front door of Sipan Hall

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
was forced to be broken last night.

186
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Before the restoration,

187
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
anyone can enter and exit at will.

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So,

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
even if it's a fairy with no spiritual connection,

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the Situ Fairy King

191
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
is not allowed to let go.

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Why is there someone

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
who will delay my good news in the early morning?

194
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Didn't I ask you to wait for me in the room?

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Why are you here?

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I waited for you for a long time.

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I didn't come back.

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I was in a hurry.

199
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why are you in a hurry?

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's a coincidence that the Immortal Mingyi came.

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Lord Yan Xian got up early.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No wonder Lord Yan Xian is alone.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Of course,

204
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
some things can't be disturbed.

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Lord Yan Xian, what do you want to test?

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hurry up and test it.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't delay my good news.

208
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This is a test of magic.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If you hit the Shiling Sword,

210
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you will suffer from bone pain.

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If there is no sword,

212
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
you won't feel anything.

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Just test it.

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Test it and pull it down.

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Why are you nervous?

216
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm kidding.

217
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What?

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I can break into the Four Great Halls, right?

219
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm kidding.

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm kidding.

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm kidding.

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm kidding.

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm kidding.

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm kidding.

225
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm kidding.

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm kidding.

227
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm kidding.

228
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm kidding.

229
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm kidding.

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm kidding.

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm kidding.

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm kidding.

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm kidding.

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm kidding.

235
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm kidding.

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm kidding.

237
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm kidding.

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm kidding.

239
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm kidding.

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm kidding.

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm kidding.

242
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm kidding.

243
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm kidding.

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm kidding.

245
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm kidding.

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm kidding.

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm kidding.

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's enough.

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If you're done testing the Seven Clouds,

250
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
isn't it enough?

251
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why don't you go back

252
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and tell me

253
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
your real seed directly?

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's easier for me

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to realize your dream

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Excuse me.

257
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's so sour.

258
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's go back.

259
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Where are we going?

260
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm scared to death.

261
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yan Xiao is really going to investigate me.

262
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
How are you?

263
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Sir, I'm really fine.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Thanks to you using magic to hide the wound in advance.

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yan Xiao and the others can't see it.

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
They can only use that broken magic to test me.

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
How powerful I am.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I can bear it.

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Wei Ying.

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ming Yi.

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Ming Yi.

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's okay.

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's just a magic weapon.

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's just a magic weapon.

276
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
When did you get hurt more than this in the Qing Yun Conference?

277
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Ji Bo Zai, this little bastard.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He let me go to the Fourteenth Pan Tang's?

279
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How cruel he is.

280
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But

281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's worth it to use such a small price to exchange Ji Bo Zai's trust in me.

282
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Although this injury made you closer to the Yellow Lotus Tomb,

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
you can't do that next time.

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Someone is coming. Hurry up and hide.

285
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I know.

286
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Ouch.

287
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If I knew it wouldn't be cloudy, I could have painted it myself.

288
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Sir.

289
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You can tell me.

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What's wrong?

291
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Every time I got hurt,

292
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I was never allowed to complain.

293
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This is the first time someone told me that.

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You suffered in the Flower Garden.

295
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You don't have to go back anymore.

296
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Sir, what medicine did I use?

297
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It doesn't hurt so much when I close my eyes.

298
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Blood pill.

299
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Blood pill?

300
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Such a precious medicine.

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're going to die.

302
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Don't move.

303
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm so drunk.

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You don't have to do this for me.

305
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're hurt because of me.

306
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

307
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What's wrong?

308
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This medicine has a counter-effect.

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm hungry.

310
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Come and have a look.

311
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Thank you, sir.

312
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you for the cabbage.

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Come and have a look.

314
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Come and have a look.

315
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Come and have a look.

316
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Do you want a good silk?

317
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Have a look.

318
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Have a look at the cat.

319
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Sir.

320
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This is interesting.

321
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Zhang Tai used to bring me here.

322
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Look at those monsters.

323
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
They're all human.

324
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This is interesting.

325
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Have a look at the cat.

326
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Have a look at the cat.

327
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
All these things.

328
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Miss, the lady next to you has bought flowers.

329
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I didn't expect that.

330
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I couldn't buy it without you.

331
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You bought a lot this time.

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes, my husband asked me to buy it.

333
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Put the lid on.

334
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's not good if it gets cold.

335
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The owner of the shop.

336
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What would you like to eat?

337
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Two fried pancakes.

338
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Here you are.

339
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Thank you.

340
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What's the matter?

341
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Aren't you hungry?

342
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Fried pancakes.

343
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What?

344
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I can't taste it.

345
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,840
Aren't you hungry?

346
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,320
I love the cake the most in the world.

347
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,640
I wonder if you like it.

348
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,680
You remember it?

349
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,680
I never forget it.

350
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,600
It's so easy to make you happy.

351
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,240
It's just a cake.

352
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,680
Eat it. It's cold.

353
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,920
This is the cake that Jun He asked me to bring.

354
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,240
Your favorite, green onion pancake.

355
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,880
Wish you a great success.

356
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,040
Your Highness.

357
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Your Highness.

358
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,120
Your Highness.

359
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,080
We'll wait for you to come back.

360
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,280
You can do it.

361
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
I'll eat it.

362
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,800
We'll wait for you to come back.

363
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,960
I wonder how Mother is doing.

364
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,400
I must detoxify early

365
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,320
and go back to Yaoguang Mountain.

366
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,560
Mei Yi.

367
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,360
What's wrong?

368
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Your wound still hurts.

369
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,360
Let me see.

370
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,680
Isn't it better?

371
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,560
Although...

372
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,400
What's wrong?

373
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,280
Your Highness, why are you so nice to me?

374
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm just a fairy in the night.

375
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,360
I can be in the sea of ​​the turtle

376
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,880
and the turtle's nest.

377
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,960
It's already a dream for me.

378
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
If Wu Gui Han

379
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,960
really becomes the female master,

380
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,800
he will definitely go to save her.

381
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,360
Why do you still remember

382
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,960
what I like to eat?

383
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,800
Can't you just put it in my head?

384
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,080
He really treats me like this.

385
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,560
I...

386
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,440
When did I say I wanted to kiss you?

387
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,640
Then...

388
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,880
Then you mean

389
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,440
you won't be separated from me?

390
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,320
Is that right?

391
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,080
I...

392
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,840
I know.

393
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,640
We won't be separated.

394
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,080
What?

395
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,720
I...

396
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,720
After Yunulating always becomes a good child,

397
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,360
Yun首 indeed will be an illustrator.

398
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,080
I will stay and work for his good.

399
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,000
Mingyi is rich and virtuous.

400
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,160
It's done.

401
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,360
Fairy Ruoshui has taken the grass of the night.

402
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,360
She's recovered.

403
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,640
Did you go to the temple with Mingyi just now?

404
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,440
When Mingyi was praying for me,

405
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,320
she took the treasure on purpose.

406
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,920
It's more like a bribe.

407
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,520
The grass in the house was covered by the barrier I found.

408
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,720
There are no clues in the silk hall.

409
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,640
We can only end it temporarily.

410
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,080
But Yan Xiao is still sending someone to watch.

411
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,280
It's good for them to misunderstand me

412
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,080
and just think about it all day.

413
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,720
I understand.

414
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,160
But...

415
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,280
I don't want to report the revenge.

416
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,340
My map!

417
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,040
When I was cleaning the concerns.

418
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,860
I saw thesestudies of yours?

419
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,640
These are the full one Marquis Franca ex technologies used in Yuthu cliff shop.

420
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,580
He sooll disliked to see it.

421
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,320
Marquis F Guard?

422
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,100
Do you mean the marquis Yuxiao?

423
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,140
When Lord Yan was a guard at the Jade Rabbit Palace,

424
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,540
he was favored by the princess.

425
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,500
Later, he learned medical skills and passed the first exam.

426
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,500
He was also assigned to the high position of Lord Han Feng.

427
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,220
He changed after he got promoted.

428
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,580
He even hid the status of the divine king from the princess.

429
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,580
The princess obviously hates him more and more.

430
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,780
Isn't the princess going to see the divine king?

431
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,140
Let's go.

432
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,900
How dare you!

433
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,780
The princess wants to see the divine king.

434
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,620
Move aside.

435
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,860
The divine king is quiet.

436
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,980
No one is allowed to disturb her.

437
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,500
Please go back, princess.

438
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,060
My husband has been sleeping for a long time.

439
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,740
Who else is allowed to disturb her?

440
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,260
Lord Han Feng?

441
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,540
Did he decide to take charge of the Jade Rabbit Palace?

442
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,260
Princess, please go back.

443
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,420
I will take care of the palace today.

444
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,260
Move aside!

445
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,260
Princess.

446
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,220
You here?

447
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,220
I'm the male teacher at Gixing Palace's Imperial College.

448
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,140
My son is my student.

449
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,140
I can't control the people in front of the Lord's Hall.

450
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
But you can.

451
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,140
The Lord indeed needs to rest.

452
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,140
Perhaps the Princess has been coming too frequently lately.

453
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
They are afraid that they will disturb the Lord.

454
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,140
The people below don't know the situation.

455
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
I will take care of them.

456
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,140
The people below?

457
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
You deserve to say that.

458
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Stop.

459
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,140
No one can enter without the Lord's order.

460
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
I'm here to deliver the letter.

461
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,140
I'm just going to pick it up.

462
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,140
Pick it up?

463
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
The people who followed us before

464
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,140
learned that they can fly in the air after reading a few books.

465
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,140
With you?

466
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,140
You want to be a doctor?

467
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,140
You are really a dreamer.

468
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,140
The fight will be over in three days.

469
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,140
You have to get to the Lord's Hall.

470
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,140
Hurry!

471
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,140
Hurry!

472
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Hurry!

473
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Hurry!

474
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
Hurry!

475
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,140
The Lord has chosen Jingxue.

476
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,140
Did you come for this?

477
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,140
With the medical skills of Lord Yan Xian,

478
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,140
my husband must still be in the mud.

479
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,140
Why am I important?

480
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,140
After all, Lord Yan Xian is the one who decides

481
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,140
whether my husband can wake up and participate in the election.

482
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,140
Isn't it?

483
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,140
You are joking.

484
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,140
Jingxue is a big thing.

485
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
The Lord will not be absent.

486
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,140
Thank you, Lord Yan Xian.

487
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,140
In the future, I and Count Ji's wedding,

488
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,140
if I want to win my husband's heart,

489
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,140
I have to rely on Lord Yan Xian.

490
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,140
God bless you.

491
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,140
The body of the Lord will definitely recover.

492
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,140
But your wedding with Count Ji,

493
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,140
will it be held?

494
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,140
I heard that

495
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,140
Lord Ji has already refused.

496
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,140
Yes.

497
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,140
This is more challenging.

498
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,140
So I must fight hard

499
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,140
to win the heart of Count Ji.

500
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,140
The matter of the Princess

501
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,140
is not that she doesn't want to marry.

502
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,140
What else?

503
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,140
Who else should I marry?

504
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,140
You?

505
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,140
Lord Yan Xian, don't be too confident.

506
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,140
I used to

507
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,140
care for your appearance.

508
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,140
But now,

509
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,140
it looks like

510
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,140
I am not that good.

511
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,140
I even have some good looks.

512
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,140
Marrying Count Ji,

513
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
doesn't mean you can

514
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,140
control the Beast Flower Sect forever.

515
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,140
She is just a fighter.

516
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,140
Why do you...

517
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,140
I like her?

518
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,140
Don't you understand?

519
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,140
If I really like her,

520
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,140
how can I be able to make up for my own grudges?

521
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
If I really like her,

522
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,140
I can be like Count Ji,

523
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,140
arrogant, arrogant, and annoying.

524
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,140
How can I bear her?

525
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,140
Enough.

526
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Aren't you the best at disguise?

527
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,140
I don't even look like you anymore.

528
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,140
Brother Yan!

529
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
Brother Yan!

530
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,140
Brother Yan!

531
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
Brother Yan,

532
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,140
you must have waited for me for a long time.

533
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,140
I haven't grown up yet.

534
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
When I grow up,

535
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,140
I will marry you.

536
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,140
Okay?

537
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,140
I want to be loved by you.

538
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,140
Only you know

539
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,140
how I feel.

540
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,140
Not yet.

541
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,140
You haven't finished yet?

542
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Stop meowing.

543
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,140
Come in if you want to.

544
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
I will lock the door later.

545
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
Don't be late.

546
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,140
What are you doing?

547
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
Meow.

548
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
Stop meowing.

549
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,140
I have something to tell you.

550
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,140
I don't want to talk to you.

551
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,140
What good news did I bring you?

552
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,140
Meow.

553
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,140
The first thing is

554
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
your brother is a star.

555
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,140
He was carried back to Yaogong Mountain.

556
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
I guess he won't be able to get out of bed for a month.

557
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,140
Really?

558
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,140
Why is he more useless than before?

559
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
I don't want to talk about your brother.

560
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
But it's good.

561
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,140
At least no one is looking for me these days.

562
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,140
The second thing is

563
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,140
I have something to tell you.

564
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,140
This is a portrait

565
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,140
you made with your memory.

566
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,140
I found it.

567
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,140
Do you know who is in the painting?

568
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,140
You can't guess who it is even if you beat to death.

569
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,140
Stop talking.

570
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,140
Say it.

571
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,140
I'm not not saying it.

572
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
The fairy in this portrait

573
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,140
is called Bo Yulan.

574
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,140
Born in the Six Realms

575
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,140
and once lived in the West.

576
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,140
Born in the Six Realms

577
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,140
and once lived in the West.

578
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,140
The famous doctor.

579
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,140
Doctor's pulse.

580
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,140
Doctor's pulse?

581
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,140
Isn't it the one that made Li Hentian and Huang Lan Meng?

582
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,140
The reason why that portrait can move

583
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,140
is also the special door of the doctor.

584
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,140
I went to Langhuan Pavilion

585
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,140
to check the book.

586
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,140
They said the doctor's pulse

587
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,140
has been hidden in Zhang Weishan for generations.

588
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,140
Zhang Weishan

589
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,140
was in a fire

590
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,140
twenty years ago.

591
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,140
He was in a big trouble.

592
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,140
The doctor's pulse disappeared.

593
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
What fire?

594
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,140
Someone was trying to kill Li Hentian and Huang Lan Meng.

595
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,140
My master

596
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,140
studied the doctor's family.

597
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,140
He told me not to believe what the book said.

598
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,140
The doctor's death

599
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,140
is probably a crime.

600
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,140
Someone is thinking about their medicine.

601
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
This doctor's death

602
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,140
is related to Bo Yulan.

603
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
No wonder he has Huang Lan Meng.

604
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,140
But isn't he the doctor's descendant?

605
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
It makes sense.

606
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,140
Why

607
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,140
would Bo Yulan's portrait

608
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,140
be in Mu Qi Bai's hand?

609
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,140
Could it be

610
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,140
that Mu Qi Bai gave Bo Yulan to him?

611
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
If I were a chicken,

612
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,140
I wouldn't eat fish

613
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,140
and take revenge.

614
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
How did

615
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,140
Bo Yulan get into the prison?

616
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
He did a lot of things.

617
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,140
I mean

618
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Bo Yulan was wronged.

619
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
Think about it.

620
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
He was a big

621
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
when he got into the prison.

622
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,140
He must have learned to walk

623
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
and commit crimes.

624
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,140
If Bo Yulan was wronged,

625
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,140
the people in the prison

626
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,140
are really

627
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,140
the poorest.

628
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,140
I'm late.

629
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
Please forgive me.

630
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,140
How was the investigation yesterday?

631
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,140
Was the person who stole the painting

632
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,140
Ji Bo?

633
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
He didn't show the wounds of the Shiling Sword.

634
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,140
Could it be

635
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,140
that Si Pan Tang lost

636
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
a lot of treasures?

637
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
Maybe it's just a painting.

638
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Maybe he went there for that painting.

639
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
I'm sorry.

640
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,700
Do you find any

641
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
of the grass in the turtle sea?

642
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,140
Han Feng Jun saw it personally.

643
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
When I left the turtle sea,

644
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Ji Bo did only these.

645
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,140
Sir, can you slow down?

646
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,140
I'm happy.

647
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:37,800
Wild if you there

648
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,020

649
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:47,480

Your Highness.

655
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,240
I'm afraid that you've already noticed.

656
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Go and find Xun Ming.

657
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Yes.

Daji Shifu, please accept the bow through my disciple.

660
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,200
I hope you won't regret

661
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
that you worshiped me as your master.

662
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,320
Master is kind and kind.

663
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,640
I'm grateful for your help.

664
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,400
I won't regret it.

Hand이� rho

668
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,240
Master,

669
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,360
within three days,

670
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,000
I'll offer you the first HTML to siellä my set magnify,

671
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,680
for the kelp festival.

672
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:12,040
asileri

673
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,840
I have to prepare for these two days

674
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,160
to spend together.

675
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,120
So let's...

676
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,920
There's still no difficulty.

677
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:53,940
I'm a five-time

678
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
is his partner.

679
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,660
We three are related.

680
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,100
According to the mortal world,

681
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,140
we should be called

682
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,820
the childhood friend.

683
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,420
He Sha's son.

684
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,660
How can you be the son of me and Tian Ji?

685
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,940
How can I and Tian Ji

686
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,980
be related?

687
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,980
What are you talking about?

688
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,780
Sometimes I really envy you.

689
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,940
You know nothing.

690
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
How can I not know?

691
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,340
I know everything about Tian Ji.

692
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,420
As the emperor,

693
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,540
there are still many people

694
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,540
who don't admit it.

695
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,340
If Ji Bo Zai doesn't come,

696
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,340
the emperor will definitely

697
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,500
come to support Tian Ji.

698
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,860
Tu Zi Da,

699
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,980
you like him the most.

700
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,940
The first half of the game is over.

701
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,020
Please wait for the second half.

702
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:01,940
Princess,

703
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,380
the first half of the game is over.

704
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,860
Lord Ji is still not here.

705
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,940
Lord Ji is here.

706
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,500
Lord Ji is here.

707
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,340
Who is this?

708
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
Who is this?

709
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Who is this?

710
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,340
Who is this?

711
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,340
Who is this?

712
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,340
Who is this?

713
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Who is this?

714
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,340
Who is this?

715
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
This is the little fairy of the night.

716
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,340
She even brought a female partner.

717
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,340
She really doesn't care about the princess.

718
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,340
What's going on?

719
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,340
As I know,

720
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,340
Lord Ji was in a meeting.

721
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,340
I don't want to see it today.

722
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,340
The two feelings are enviable.

723
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,340
But today is a competition.

724
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Do you need a female partner?

725
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,340
That's right.

726
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
The princess is not strict at all.

727
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
Didn't you also bring the child

728
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,340
to give you a talisman?

729
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
I'm...

730
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
This is my talisman.

731
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,340
The sky is clear.

732
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,340
The clouds are clear.

733
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,340
The sky is clear.

734
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,340
The clouds are clear.

735
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,340
The clouds are clear.

736
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,340
The clouds are clear.

737
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,340
The clouds are clear.

738
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,340
The clouds are clear.

739
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,340
The clouds are clear.

740
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,340
The clouds are clear.

741
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,340
The clouds are clear.

742
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,340
The clouds are clear.

743
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,340
The clouds are clear.

744
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,340
The clouds are clear.

745
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,340
The clouds are clear.

746
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,340
The clouds are clear.

747
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,340
The clouds are clear.

748
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,340
The clouds are clear.

749
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,340
The clouds are clear.

750
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,340
The clouds are clear.

751
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,340
The clouds are clear.

752
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
The clouds are clear.

753
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
The clouds are clear.

754
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,340
The clouds are clear.

755
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,340
The clouds are clear.

756
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,340
The clouds are clear.

757
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,340
The clouds are clear.

758
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,340
The clouds are clear.

759
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,340
From the sky to your heart,

760
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,340
how long will it take to cry?

761
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,340
And all the tenderness you gave me

762
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,340
is the only thing I want.

763
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,340
I put down my pain,

764
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,340
only to return your freedom.

765
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,340
Once you have love,

766
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,340
you are willing to give up.

767
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,340
I want to ask the sky

768
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,340
what's wrong with me

769
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,340
fighting for you

770
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,340
in the abyss?

771
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,340
Even if I'm a A-list,

772
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,340
I'll fight for you.

773
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,340
Fate is never wrong.

774
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,340
The sun will eventually fall.

775
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,340
Talented and righteous,

776
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
however,

777
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,340
being a A-list

778
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,340
is the most powerful way of aspiring success.

779
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,340
From the sky to your heart,

780
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,340
how long will it take to cry?

781
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,340
And all the tenderness you gave me

782
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,340
is the only thing I want.

783
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,340
I put down my pain,

784
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,340
only to return your freedom.

785
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:19,340
Once love has, I'd rather let go
