after you took it away.

31

You said Yaoguang Mountain despised all artifacts.

to protect Yaoguang Mountain.

Given that I served you as a child for 20 years

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,420
I need to reassure everyone.

174
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,460
Ming Yi, your hand...

175
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,370
I must

176
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,700
tell you all something.

177
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,340
Actually,

178
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,180
I am Ming Xian.

179
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,580
My dear son is finally back in Yaoguang Mountain.

180
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,730
Your Majesty, no need to act like a benevolent father.

181
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,460
Ming Xian was your son for 20 years,

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,850
yet you discarded him

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,460
after he lost the Qingyun Tournament once.

184
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,700
And I'm

185
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,890
a son who just came back.

186
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,370
I came

187
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,340
to negotiate with you.

188
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,610
I fail as a father.

189
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,490
The two previous crown princes were incompetent,

190
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,130
and the one before me

191
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,700
wants to negotiate with me.

192
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,420
You don't care who your real son is.

193
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,650
You just want someone

194
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,940
who can make Yaoguang Mountain stronger.

195
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,180
As expected of someone carrying my bloodline.

196
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,220
Yes.

197
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,220
Who Ming Xian is doesn't matter.

198
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,340
What I want

199
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,650
is a warrior who can win in the Qingyun Tournament

200
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,980
and a crown prince who commands the people's respect.

201
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,580
I'm doing this

202
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,700
for the prosperity of Yaoguang Mountain.

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,730
Speak.

204
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,180
What can I offer to convince you

205
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,890
to be the crown prince?

206
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,980
One, I will join the warrior ranks.

207
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,420
I will command all warriors.

208
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,010
Sure. That is rightfully yours anyway.

209
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,610
Two, the Empress, Jing Shu, shall live.

210
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,820
Granted.

211
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,490
She is my first wife.

212
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,220
I promise that she will be cared for.

213
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,340
Three,

214
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,530
forget past grudges with Jixing Abyss.

215
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,100
Do not hunt down anything

216
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,490
or anyone with no relevance.

217
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,130
Are you doing this for Ming Xian?

218
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,060
Like I said,

219
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,700
it's time to turn the page.

220
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,610
Let it go now, Your Majesty.

221
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,580
So Ji Bozai and I were swapped at birth.

222
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,820
My birth mother

223
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,130
is a descendant of the Bo clan in Zhangwei Mountain of Jixing Abyss.

224
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,980
In a sense,

225
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,730
you can say I'm from Jixing Abyss too.

226
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,610
Lord Chengyun committed a crime,

227
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,850
so he cannot be the heir apparent.

228
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,130
Yaoguang Mountain now needs

229
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,940
a new crown prince to appease everyone.

230
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,530
But knowing him,

231
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,850
he won't even bat an eye even if someone

232
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,100
hands him Yaoguang Mountain for free.

233
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,850
I'm guessing

234
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,370
that with us in Jixing Abyss, and him in Yaoguang Mountain,

235
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,300
we have the power of two realms

236
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,530
against Zhushui Spiritual State.

237
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,060
And perhaps he wants to be cautious

238
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,420
so he didn't tell us about his plan.

239
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,730
- Look. - What does it say?

240
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,610
The Emperor of Yaoguang hereby declares to all Six Realms

241
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,340
that Ming Xin, Lord Chengyun,

242
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,730
defied the law

243
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,610
and will be deposedf.

244
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,530
The Emperor's eldest son, Ji Bozai, shall be the crown prince

245
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,180
to restore law and order.

246
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,580
- He is the crown prince? Impossible. - I can't believe it.

247
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,890
There's no way Ji Bozai is the emperor's son.

248
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,610
Can you believe it?

249
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,370
It's like a joke.

250
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,490
Ming Xin should abdicate.

251
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,850
But Ji Bozai cannot be the crown prince either.

252
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,580
- Is this true? - Let's go.

253
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,730
Let's ask the authority.

254
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,650
How come Ji Bozai

255
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,130
is the son of the Emperor of Yaoguang?

256
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,820
What about Ming Xian?

257
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,770
- Exactly. - They didn't mention Ming Xian.

258
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,420
He must be punished.

259
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

260
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,060
You must be decisive.

261
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,340
He cannot get away with it.

262
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,820
- Exactly. - This is not right.

263
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,580
Your Majesty.

264
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,100
I urge you to make the decision

265
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,850
to hunt down Ji Bozai!

266
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,800
This is urgent, Your Majesty. Do not dally!

267
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,340
[Ji Bozai sided with Yaoguang Mountain]
This is from Immortal Tai.

268
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,980
[and should be stripped of his title.]

269
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,420
Ji Bozai sided with Yaoguang Mountain

270
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,130
and should be stripped of his title and hunted down.

271
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,580
[Memorial]

272
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,220
This is from Immortal Lun'an.

273
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,980
Ji Bozai infiltrated Jixing Abyss and colluded with our enemy.

274
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,460
He committed a great crime.

275
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,730
Our warriors must be gathered to hunt him down.

276
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,650
This is from Immortal He.

277
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,370
Enough.

278
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,420
They are all probably asking me to hunt Ji Bozai down.

279
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,420
In Mingshi Hall today,

280
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,820
the immortals have already questioned Her Majesty

281
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,140
about Ji Bozai.

282
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,220
Can you believe it?
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

283
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,620
Has it not crossed their minds

284
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,660
that Ji Bozai was the one who defeated Ming Xian in the tournament

285
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,290
and won the Blessed Rain for Jixing Abyss?

286
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,980
If Ji Bozai was working with Yaoguang Mountain,

287
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,090
why would he win in the tournament?

288
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,980
Being a warrior in Jixing Abyss and being a crown prince in Yaoguang Mountain

289
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,090
are two different things.

290
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,530
They don't know Ji Bozai.

291
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,290
They only view him as Jixing Abyss's weapon.

292
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,530
Now that they know

293
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,620
Ji Bozai is the crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain,

294
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,660
the citizens fear

295
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,050
that this weapon

296
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,810
will be directed at them.

297
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,330
It is understandable.

298
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,140
Right.

299
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,980
And as the Empress,

300
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,330
I have the duty to reassure my subjects.

301
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,620
So Tianji,

302
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,220
what will you do now?

303
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,980
The memorials are piling up.

304
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,770
Your Majesty, I believe

305
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,290
you know what decision you should make.

306
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,530
What does this mean?

307
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,290
Why are you nodding your head?

308
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,660
Do you get it?

309
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,010
Even though I'm clueless,

310
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,420
I believe

311
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,940
Her Majesty will make the decision

312
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,860
that benefits Jixing Abyss.

He is a traitor.

320

- Exactly. - The way I see it...

321

Yes!

By the way,

443
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,090
His Lordship wrote back

444
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,330
and said he knew what he was doing.

445
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,980
He told me not to worry.

446
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,380
But His Lordship always leaves the bad news out.

447
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,770
How can I not be worried about him?

448
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,940
I overlooked this

449
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,010
and forgot to brief you in advance.

450
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,050
Everyone is saying His Lordship is a traitor outside.

451
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,490
Of course, I don't believe those idiots.

452
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,180
His Lordship risks his life for Jixing Abyss.

453
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,380
We all saw that.

454
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,140
But how can the Empress be so gullible

455
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,660
and trust those fake rumors?

456
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,980
She even put up a notice in the Parade Bureau

457
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,420
to strip His Lordship of his titles as the warrior and the honorary warrior.

458
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,180
Her decision is...

459
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,140
is very disheartening.

460
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,220
Ji Bozai

461
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,620
has now joined the warrior ranks

462

of Yaoguang Mountain.

463
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,530
As the Empress, Tianji has to reassure

464
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,810
everyone in Jixing Abyss.

465
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,770
If Ji Bozai were in Tianji's shoes,

466
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,700
he would have done the same.

467
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,140
I understand the burden

468
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,290
on Her Majesty's shoulders.

469
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,140
But this is a cruel joke.

470
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,940
I feel bad for you and him, who are supposed to be together.

471

00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,220
Who knows what the future holds?

473
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,460
But right now,

474
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,530
exposing what the Emperor of Zhushui did

475
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,700
is what he and I want to do.

476
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,700
We will persevere.

477
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,010
Ji Bozai wants to bring peace to the Six Realms.

478
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,490
He is determined. That won't change.

479
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,330
I believe in him.

480
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,180
I see.

481
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,220
I will look after His Lordship's home

482
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,900

Thank you, Granny Xun.

484
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,380
It's a new recipe.

485
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,140
You made this?

486
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,620
Let me smell it.

487
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,490
It'll cool you down.

488
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,330
It smells amazing.

489
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,860
Let me take a bite.

490
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,620
Do you like it?

491
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,420
It has six flowers in it.

492
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,140
A minimum of four warriors

493
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,460
is required to take part in the Qingyun Tournament.

494
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,220
Now that Ji Bozai has joined the rival realm,

495
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,420
we won't even have four warriors.

496
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,010
How are we supposed to scout out the tournament arena now?

497
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,460
What about promoting one from the shortlisted candidates?

498
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,220
Worry not.

499
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,980
I've told them

500
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,530
that we would gather enough warriors before the tournament.

501
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,980
Therefore, they won't

502
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,010
disqualify us for now.

503
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,290
Furthermore, Ming Yi also agreed

504
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,860
to scout with us as a Forger

505
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,810
representing the Shouhua Academy.

506
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,900
Great!

507
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,730
If other immortals raise dissenting opinions,

508
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,140
don't worry or be affected

509
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,570
by them.

510
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,530
I'll handle them for you.

511
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,620
Great!

512
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,490
Great!

513
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,620
It's on.

514
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,700
I didn't know

515
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,700
that you could use a fire-igniting artifact for barbecue purposes.

516
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,330
Only a genius like me

517
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,700
can come up with such a great idea.

518
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,620
Right. This is almost burned.

519
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,530
Eat some, Twenty-Seven.

520
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,380
Yan Xiao. Eat with us.

521
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,530
You can train later!

522
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,490
This seems like the right time

523
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,570
to tell you that you should rest.

524
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,050
But?

525
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,490
But

526
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,940
the two-realm tournament is about to begin.

527
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,810
We should all train harder.

528
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,490
Therefore, I brought you an ointment.

529
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,330
Do you feel better now?

530
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,730
Yes.

531
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,050
Meng, you are smiling.

532
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,570
Do not laugh at me.

533
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,700
Truth be told,

534
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,090
I like them this way.

535
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,530
I like Tianji.

536
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,860
I like her a lot.

537
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,090
Even now.

538
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,490
But my feelings toward her

539
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,770
are that I just want her to be happy.

540
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,010
Meng.

541
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,380
I salute you.

542
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,940
Do not steal my sweet potato.

543
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,380
When we were in Yaoguang Mountain,

544
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,010
we had to abide by strict rules.

545
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,770
The juniors had to serve the seniors.

546
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,810
And even among peers, the strong would bully the weak.

547
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,860
Back then, I dreamed

548
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,140
of meeting a trustworthy ally.

549
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,900
And to my surprise,

550
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,290
I found people whom I can fall back on

551
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,700
in Jixing Abyss.

552
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,530
All participants,

553
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,620
following the order set down

554
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,050
by the previous Qingyun Tournament,

555
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,620
you may now enter the Zhuojin Tower to inspect the arena.

556
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,380
Without Ji Bozai, I highly doubt Jixing Abyss

557
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,140
can send in any competent immortal

558
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,140
at all.

559
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,330
So not only do they have an empress,

560
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,900
they also have a female warrior now.

561
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,860
What?

562
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,090
Are you trying to lose again for the next seven years?

563
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,330
Can't expect anything decent from your foul mouth.

564
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,620
I see you spent most of your time

565
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,290
sharpening your tongue, not your blade.

566
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,980
If you have nothing nice to say,

567
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,530
say nothing at all.

568
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,700
Warriors of Yaoguang Mountain, please enter.

569
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,940
Immortal...

570
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,420
Long time no see, Immortal Ji.

571
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,220
Alas, we are now competing

572
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,570
against one another.

573
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,940
Indeed. We now represent different realms.

574
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,860
See you in the arena.

575
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,090
See you.

576
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,570
What?

577
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,810
What is going on?

578
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,460
Where did she go?

579
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,620
- What's going on? - It's so sudden.

580
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,570
I'm in the secret chamber of Dragon Carp Terrace.

581
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,980
Did you truly believe you could kill me

582
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,170
after you kidnapped me here

583
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,570
with your spell?

584
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,940
The Ultimate Punishment hasn't taught you anything, it seems.

585
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,610
You're as foolish as ever.

586
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,490
Oh, really?

587
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,090
Look closely.

588
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,740
Ming Yi, can I keep this hairpin as memorabilia?

589
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,860
It's my...

590
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,420
Situ Ling used his heart's blood

591
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,420
to save you.

592
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,010
Perhaps you ought

593
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,650
to return the favor to your savior.

594
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,130
I don't believe you.

595
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,940
And even if you did capture him,

596
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,130
I can kill you now

597
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,980
before rescuing him.

598
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,820
Ming Xian.

599
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,650
Ming Yi. Run.

600
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,300
Don't worry about me.

601
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,650
Ming Xian,

602
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,820
with one snap of my finger,

603
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,210
I can suffocate him.

604
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,900
Try me if you dare.

605
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,420
And this time,

606
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,340
I will kill him

607
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,420
before you make a move.

608
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,570
Run, Ming Yi.

609
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,170
What do you want?

610
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,780
Put the Embers down.

611
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,610
No, Ming Yi.

612
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,940
Don't drop your weapon.

613
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,460
Ming Xin will kill you.

614
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,420
Quiet!

615
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,490
I will not leave you to die.

616
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,860
Ming Yi,

617
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,210
you still care about me, don't you?

618
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,380
Now, kneel.

619
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,860
No, Ming Yi. Do not kneel!

620
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,380
Ming Xian.

621
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,420
Kneel now.

622
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,130
Ming Xin.

623
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,650
Are you out of your mind?

624
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,980
What makes you think you can make her kneel?

625
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,170
Kneel.

626
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,210
Kneel!

627
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,090
I told you to kneel! Did you hear me?

628
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,170
Ming Xin.

629
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,530
Even until now,

630
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,380
you're still using the power of Yaoguang Mountain.

631
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,530
That means

632
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,460
you still want to fight for Yaoguang Mountain.

633
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,610
You ingratiated yourself

634
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,530
with the Emperor of Zhushui.

635
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,820
Do you feel no shame?

636
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,530
Have you forgotten that every technique you're using

637
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,490
comes from me?

638
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,170
Shut up!

639
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,980
I don't care what your motive is now.

640
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,130
But back then,

641
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,610
I truly viewed you as my younger brother.

642
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,300
We joined the warrior ranks together.

643
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,010
I wanted to guide you to the proper path.

644
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,010
I taught you everything I know.

645
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,940
Now that you have mastered those techniques,

646
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,690
you've forgotten

647
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,610
what it means to be a warrior.

648
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,900
Shut up!

649
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,940
You have no right to patronize me, Ming Xian.

650
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,300
You outdo me in every regard.

651
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,780
Even if I put in ten times or a hundred times more effort,

652
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,090
Father won't even look at me.

653
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,940
But you!

654
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,050
You're just a mongrel!

655
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,050
Why must I suffer?

656
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,050
Why must I let an outsider

657
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,460
steal my thunder?

658
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,690
Today,

659
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,570
I will break your knees

660
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,820
so that you may never stand before me!

661
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,340
Watch out, Ming Yi!

662
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,380
Why would you risk your life

663
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,300
for an informant from Zhushui Spiritual State?

664
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,420
Situ...

665
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,380
Prince Chao Yuan once saved my life.

666
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,820
I cannot leave him to die.

667
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,300
You found out?

668
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,010
Your Highness.

669
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,650
How eager of you to dispose of him.

670
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,300
Why? Is he about to snitch you out?

671
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,860
Ming Yi, I just want to protect you.

672
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,530
Chao Yuan.

673
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,380
Ming Xin said

674
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,820
you once saved me with your heart's blood.

675
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,860
Of course, I'm grateful for you.

676
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,460
But he wouldn't have known about it

677
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,650
if you hadn't told him.

678
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,380
Also,

679
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,900
were you the one who taught him the art

680
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,490
of illusory assassination?

681
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,860
Your Highness.

682
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,610
I see you feel spiteful after receiving

683
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,050
the Ultimate Punishment.

684
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,170
So now, you want to get out of Yaoguang Mountain

685
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,530
to kill Ming Xian?

686
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,210
We had a deal that day.

687
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,900
You wanted me to bring Ming Xian to you,

688
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,010
and I didn't divulge it to your father.

689
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,380
If you truly care so much about that wretched woman,

690
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,210
I suppose

691
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,300
I can leave her cold dead body for you.

692
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,690
I just gave you

693
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,940
Zhushui's secret art of illusory assassination.

694
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,340
While the warriors are scouting the arena,

695
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,690
you can use it to kidnap her from Zhuojin Tower.

696
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,340
She is stronger than you.

697
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,210
And you're weakened by the punishment.

698
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,490
You can't defeat her.

699
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,940
But you can tell her

700
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,380
that you're holding me hostage.

701
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,780
After all, I saved her once.

702
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,650
And show her this keepsake.

703
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,130
That way,

704
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,570
she won't kill you right away.

705
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,650
The records say

706
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,130
that to master the art of

707
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,050
illusory assassination,

708
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,860
the practitioner has to kill at least ten people.

709
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,860
You've decided to be Chao Yuan,

710
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,940
and not Situ Ling.

711
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,090
Is that so?

712
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,740
Ming Yi,

713
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,460
whatever I did,

714
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,940
it's for you.

715
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,420
Why? Why the obsession?

716
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,530
You don't trust me.

717
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,460
No matter what I did,

718
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,460
you still won't trust me.

719
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,170
Yet you trust Ji Bozai wholeheartedly.

720
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,940
Why must it be him?

721
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,090
All I know is that

722
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,090
even if you're no longer the Situ Ling I know,

723
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:25,940
I

724
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,260
will still do everything I can to stop Chao Yuan

725
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,940
just like how Situ Ling did everything

726
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,490
to save me.

727
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,130
Give up while you still can, Chao Yuan.

728
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,300
You mustn't be like your father.

729
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,300
It's too late.

730
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,980
