1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Your light is trapped me

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's you

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's you

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Or the heat that will be owned by the wind and clouds

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You are the warmth that is engraved in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Memories have been touched by you

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't forget your eyes

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't escape from the ten thousand love letters

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm hugging you, hugging you

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I love you like the clouds

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I, the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain,

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
have been attending the Qingyun Camp since I was thirteen years old

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to celebrate Yaoguang Mountain's seven years of victory.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I've been dressed as a man since I was little.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm a man in the eyes of outsiders.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They all say that I'm the best warrior in Hexu.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They say I'm a hero.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not a hero.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm just afraid to let go of my hand at any moment.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Because the blessings of winning are my strength.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
From this moment on, I'm asked to be able to win.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm asked to be able to win.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I must win in place of my command.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I told you that there's still hope for the fall of the king.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why didn't you use your move?

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Are you going to break through this wall to seize the throne?

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh dear.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Where's the issue to register?

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How dare you go ahead and ask?

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
See, the support is at lower level.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Please control the situation here!

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay...

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's okay.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's okay.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
At this moment, it's at this stage...

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My friendship with the Helmsman.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I can't even maintain my power in this space.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This person is not simple.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The Taoist of the Heart-wrenching Abyss has this kind of power.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Who are you?

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're all trapped in my Spirit-Blooming Mirror.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How can you say that?

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Even if I'm in your Spirit-Blooming Mirror,

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I can still defeat you with my weak spirit.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm not afraid of you.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can still defeat you with my weak spirit.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is that so?

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The Taoist of the Heart-Blooming Mirror

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You really are a God of War.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You actually used your blood to change your weapon.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I only know...

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I only know this one thing.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Everyone can lose.

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why can't it be you?

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The Taoist of the Heart-Blooming Mirror

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The Taoist of the Heart-Blooming Mirror

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This time, the two realms have won.

61
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The star of the seven stars is the upper realm.

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The mountain of the night sky is the lower realm.

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The blessing will descend.

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Princess, we won.

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I really didn't see the wrong person.

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is...

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Fu Ze!

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Fu Ze!

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is Fu Ze!

70
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's been seven years!

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's been seven years!

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Fu Ze has finally arrived at the Seven-star Garden!

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're still so shameless after losing.

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's right.

75
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're shameless.

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If Fu Ze is gone, then it's over.

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Without Fu Ze, the mountain of the night sky will be dark.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The ground will be dry.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Without Fu Ze, even the spirit masters can't draw it out.

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How can we live?

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're not worthy of being our God of War.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
God of War!

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How can you be so heartless?

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I am the famous princess of Yaoguang Mountain.

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I started to participate in the Qingyun Conference when I was thirteen.

86
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I've won seven years in a row.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I've never won.

88
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You always sound so real and clear- тутive!

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I've become the person you call you.

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
People from this world do not know that I used to be a princess.

91
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If you want to find fulfiled the requests,

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
then you should tort key and reward men.

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If you want to find fulfilment,

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
then you should percent the amount of blood you have to offer a second time.

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I really can't do it.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If you keep doing this,

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
then you'll become a мы091 in our family.

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But before I could give you my pen fish,

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,480
His meridians are broken.

100
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,120
How come?

101
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
It looks like he's poisoned.

102
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,000
He's poisoned so badly.

103
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,400
It's him.

104
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,720
He forced Xiao Ren.

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,320
He's poisoned so badly.

106
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,600
Mother.

107
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,560
I order you to leave Yao Guang Mountain now.

108
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,640
Mother, are you trying to kill me?

109
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,960
Your meridians are broken.

110
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,040
Do you want to die in the hands of the crown prince

111
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,760
if you want to stay at Yao Guang Mountain?

112
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,120
Mother, I can definitely repair the meridians.

113
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,640
I'll get back the thousand and ten thousand times

114
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,100
that I lost in the

115
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,600
Qing Yun Conference in Yao Guang Mountain.

116
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,520
It will definitely be useful to you.

117
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
Don't drive me away.

118
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Ning Xian, listen carefully.

119
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,040
I'm not driving you away.

120
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,280
I want you to live well.

121
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,360
It's ridiculous that I've been busy with

122
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,800
and been busy with many things.

123
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,640
I taught you to use the Five-Faith Technique

124
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,160
to play the crown prince since you were born.

125
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,120
You could have been

126
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,040
an ordinary fairy

127
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,640
if you had been a man.

128
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,360
This strong and secretive

129
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,080
Five-Faith Technique

130
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,120
makes you a man

131
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,120
in the eyes of everyone.

132
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,240
But now your meridians are broken.

133
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,040
Everything is empty.

134
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,520
Ning Xian, staying at Yao Guang Mountain

135
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
is not a way out.

136
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,600
I let you go.

137
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,760
You withdraw the Five-Faith Technique

138
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,160
and recover your original appearance.

139
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,680
No one can recognize you.

140
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
Live well.

141
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,680
Don't come back forever.

142
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,760
Mother, don't worry.

143
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,160
I will repair the spiritual vein

144
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,880
and return to the Qiyun.

145
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,420
Long Long Island

146
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,960
Immortal Ji.

147
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,400
I want to meet another Immortal.

148
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,540
Don't do that.

149
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,280
Immortal Ji,

150
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,600
you are really getting the love of your life.

151
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,560
You liked Qiyun

152
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
since the ceremony.

153
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,320
You stayed longer

154
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,800
than I did here.

155
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
I came here desperately

156
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,360
You just want to get what you want for today.

157
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,960
It's clearly what I want.

158
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,640
What do you want?

159
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,400
Really?

160
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,360
Then you...

161
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,680
What do you want?

162
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
Lord Qi, have some grapes.

163
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,600
On the night of the full moon,

164
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,560
so many fairies are waiting for me.

165
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,320
I can't wait to see them.

166
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,560
Thank you, Miss.

167
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,520
My Lord, please.

168
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,560
The King of Qi,

169
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,160
after winning the full moon,

170
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,520
he's been enjoying himself

171
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,800
in the garden every day.

172
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,640
He's really a despicable villain.

173
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,560
I can't get close to him for two months.

174
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,040
Today, he's been named

175
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,120
the King of Qi.

176
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,480
He's been practicing for a long time.

177
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,520
I must get him

178
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,720
and get him closer to him.

179
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,760
I'll get him.

180
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,840
I'll get him.

181
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I'll get him.

182
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
I'll get him.

183
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
I'll get him.

184
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
I'll get him.

185
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
I'll get him.

186
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
I'll get him.

187
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I'll get him.

188
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
I'll get him.

189
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
I'll get him.

190
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:41,280
I've heard the strings bottle

191
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,000
has been broken off in the garden.

192
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,440
I heard they've discussed

193
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,880
the luck of the Anyway Fairiesstanding,

194
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
and you know,

195
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
like this,

196
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,000
a battle like this

197
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,880
might easily be made public.

198
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,640
No.

199
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,120
Lord.

200
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,840
Lord Ji is talking nonsense.

201
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,680
This...

202
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,720
What does this have to do with Lord Ji?

203
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,640
Then why did you say that to me?

204
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,240
Lord, you misunderstood.

205
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,440
I just...

206
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Right now.

207
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,960
Let's lure him to save the beauty.

208
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,840
Then I'll approach him.

209
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,520
Excuse me.

210
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
You're not going to eat this?

211
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,960
Do you think you can find Lord Ji

212
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,160
to support yourself?

213
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Lord Sun, you misunderstood.

214
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Lord Ji didn't tell me anything about you.

215
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,000
Don't blame him.

216
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,000
Ji Bozi,

217
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,920
did you spread the news about me at Qingyun Conference?

218
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,080
You're a criminal.

219
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,560
You got a spiritual vein the day after tomorrow.

220
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,720
And you became a fighter for Princess Tian Ji.

221
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,840
What?

222
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,520
You only dare to talk behind my back.

223
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,840
You can't be so rude.

224
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,040
Sun Liao,

225
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,280
you're quite good.

226
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,960
Blame Mingxian for being faster.

227
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,600
You...

228
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,000
What a pity.

229
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,760
You're a little bit slower.

230
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,000
You...

231
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,760
Why did you see Brother Ji

232
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,720
fighting for a little fairy again today?

233
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,000
Did you fight with him?

234
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,400
Sun Liao,

235
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,560
today is Lord Ji's celebration.

236
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,720
Don't mess around.

237
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,560
You're lucky.

238
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,080
This guy is so hard to approach.

239
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,200
I have to think of another way.

240
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,200
Lord Ji,

241
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,440
the food is ready.

242
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
You can start the feast.

243
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,720
Congratulations, Lord Ji,

244
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,960
on winning the Qingyun Conference.

245
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,920
May I propose a toast to you?

246
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,000
Lord Ji,

247
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,400
your performance at the Qingyun Conference

248
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,520
is so impressive.

249
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,280
I'm so happy.

250
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,320
Your performance at the Qingyun Conference

251
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,120
is so brave.

252
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
You won the blessing for us.

253
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,240
It's rare to see you today.

254
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,640
I propose a toast to you.

255
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,520
Master said

256
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,520
I don't have much time left.

257
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,400
Tuo,

258
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,960
show me your wound at the Qingyun Conference.

259
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,640
Master,

260
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,880
I don't know what poison I was poisoned with.

261
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,720
My spiritual vein is broken.

262
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,960
Listen to me.

263
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,000
The poison you were poisoned with is called

264
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,840
Li Hentian.

265
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
After being poisoned,

266
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,440
the spiritual vein will be lost

267
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,240
and the one without it

268
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,400
will be lost.

269
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,280
From now on,

270
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,640
you can't push the spiritual vein.

271
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,240
Otherwise, it will speed up the poison.

272
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,680
This mark is called Li Henghua.

273
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,360
It's your soul's secret

274
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,480
to wait for the seven-part-all-dead-vomit.

275
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,880
So,

276
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
within a year,

277
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,960
you must find the antidote,

278
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,440
the dream of the emperor,

279
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,400
and take it to repair the spiritual vein

280
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,680
to keep the soul.

281
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,240
Since it was poisoned by Lord Ji,

282
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,800
then he might have the dream of the emperor.

283
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,200
You go to the Qingyun Conference to find Lord Ji.

284
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:54,780
After the

285
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I'll come to you.

286
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,920
He doesn't eat food

287
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,640
because he's afraid of being poisoned.

288
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,560
He's really a dark-hearted person.

289
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,480
He can do anything.

290
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,680
Lord Han Feng is here.

291
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,760
You don't have to bow.

292
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,560
I hate these trivial things.

293
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,320
Put your hands down.

294
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,000
From now on, you're all like Brother Bo.

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Wherever you see me,

296
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,880
you're like an old friend.

297
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,000
How nice it is.

298
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,120
Lord Han Feng is pointing at me.

299
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,400
I dare not make a fool of myself.

300
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,840
When I was drunk,

301
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,760
I didn't kneel down to your spiritual favor.

302
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Now that I'm done,

303
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
I just pray that you don't bow.

304
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,400
I like your temper.

305
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,480
Today is the good day

306
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,360
for Brother Bo to be the winner of the Qingyun Competition.

307
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,000
I brought some gifts

308
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,720
to show my gratitude.

309
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
Your turtle-head is a cool person.

310
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,640
You're old enough to serve me.

311
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,560
How can you do this?

312
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,040
My niece, Tian Ji,

313
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,200
is also a little ignorant.

314
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,280
Although she's in charge of the Shouhua Rebellion of the Ji Xing Yuan,

315
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,920
she still can't be the honorific.

316
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,480
She doesn't know how to arrange a person for you.

317
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,960
Today, I brought you two maids.

318
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,320
From now on, you can tell them

319
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,400
to manage the accounts.

320
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,800
Are you satisfied with my gift?

321
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,000
Lord Han Feng is so close

322
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,080
to the

323
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,920
Ji Xing Yuan's internal affairs.

324
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,440
It's not that I don't appreciate it.

325
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,160
The banquet was also held by Princess Tian Ji.

326
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,400
But Lord Han Feng suddenly brought two people here.

327
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,720
If I take them,

328
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,280
wouldn't it be a disgrace to Princess Tian Ji?

329
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,880
You don't dare to take the honor of Princess Tian Ji.

330
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,320
You're not afraid of offending me.

331
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,400
Brother,

332
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,960
are you really not taking this gift?

333
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,040
Lord Han Feng gave it to me.

334
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,640
Ji Xian Jun didn't take it.

335
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,560
He refused.

336
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,960
Isn't it a shame for him?

337
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Here comes the opportunity.

338
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,600
No.

339
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
Lord Han Feng just promised me

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,600
to take me back to Wu Gui Hai.

341
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
Did I just say that?

342
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,880
Yes.

343
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,320
Maybe I promised too much before.

344
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,400
I don't remember it.

345
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,400
How about Brother Ji

346
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
taking these three people back together?

347
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
It's a good idea.

348
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,280
Yes.

349
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,480
It's a good idea.

350
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,680
This is a good idea.

351
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,920
I think it's a good idea.

352
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,760
This is a good idea.

353
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,720
I'll send a boat

354
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,880
to take you back together.

355
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,280
Great.

356
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,080
Take them back.

357
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,560
Yes.

358
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,360
Take them back.

359
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,320
Yes.

360
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,360
No.

361
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,480
We can't take them.

362
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,200
Although Wu Gui Hai is a land land,

363
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,000
it's a gift for Ji Xian Jun.

364
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,280
It's a good opportunity.

365
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,160
I think

366
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,080
it's a good idea to have more people.

367
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,320
Yes.

368
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
This is a good idea.

369
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,680
It's a good idea to take Ji Xian Jun back.

370
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,480
Yes.

371
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Don't do this.

372
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,720
Yes.

373
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,480
Wait.

374
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,840
Everyone.

375
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,880
I'm not a fish pond.

376
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,160
Besides, I have limited energy.

377
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,000
How about this?

378
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,080
Three fairies.

379
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,560
I have a question.

380
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,400
Whoever answers it

381
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
is most suitable for my heart.

382
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,040
I'll take someone away.

383
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,200
What do you think?

384
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,000
This is a good idea.

385
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,760
Great.

386
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,440
Yes.

387
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
This is a good idea.

388
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,120
Since you're here to serve me,

389
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
what kind of spirit beast

390
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
does my Wu Gui Hai have?

391
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,640
How should you take care of him?

392
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,240
Wu Gui Hai is a dead water.

393
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
What can it be?

394
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,440
But if I answer it correctly,

395
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
it doesn't seem that I'm prepared.

396
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,960
You go first.

397
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,040
I'll save you.

398
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,720
Wu Gui Hai...

399
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,600
The big and small fish pond in the river and lake

400
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,000
must be some...

401
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,480
Wu Gui...

402
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,720
Fish... shrimp...

403
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,680
Something.

404
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,200
My Lord.

405
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,960
My heart for you

406
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,520
is deeper than the water of Wu Gui Hai

407
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,280
than the water of the spirit beast and the central city.

408
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,960
You go.

409
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,160
Wu Gui Hai is a dead water of the Gixing Abyss.

410
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,320
It can't be fed.

411
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,280
There's not even a spirit beast

412
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,600
in the whole house.

413
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,280
What a ignorant fairy.

414
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,040
Do you really know the Lord of the Gixing Abyss?

415
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,240
Do you know his hobby?

416
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,800
My Lord.

417
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
If you give me another chance,

418
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,440
I'll definitely answer it correctly.

419
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,320
Nothing is different.

420
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,320
If you give me another chance,

421
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,200
it's also a shrimp.

422
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,040
My Lord.

423
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
There's still a chance.

424
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,560
This fairy has been entangled in the Gixing Abyss.

425
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,280
Could it be...

426
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,960
The Gixing Abyss...

427
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
I don't like them.

428
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,160
Those two fairies are so interested in the Gixing Abyss.

429
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
They must be them.

430
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,560
Han Gong Jun chose the right person.

431
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,040
I choose...

432
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,600
her.

433
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,560
She's so good.

434
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,600
How did you know?

435
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
I didn't know.

436
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
How could she be her?

437
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,320
That's right.

438
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,680
I was born with a sin.

439
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,120
I know better.

440
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,640
There are so many things in the world that are all false.

441
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,080
Only the true heart can't be convinced.

442
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,480
This one...

443
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,440
This one...

444
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,120
Ming Yi.

445
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,840
Ming Yi.

446
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,880
This fairy Ming Yi

447
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,360
is my favorite person.

448
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,120
She's so loyal to me.

449
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,360
How can I fail her?

450
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,720
Don't worry.

451
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,840
I won't let you down.

452
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,080
Those two fairies

453
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,800
will only blame us for not being fated today.

454
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,000
It's hard to deal with.

455
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,320
But is this a success?

456
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,680
I'm at my wit's end.

457
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,600
Your Majesty.

458
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,280
Meaningfulmaker won't be in pain?

459
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,920
Your Majesty.

460
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,160
But why?

461
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,040
I like it.

462
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,560
Your crowd have joined.

It's getting dawn out.

467
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,180
Take it from me

468
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
Master

469
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,700
Yes.

470
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,260
Yes.

471
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,060
You've worked hard tonight.

472
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,140
You broke out Yuchi Gu Family's statue.

473
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,180
Come with me back to vertebrate back to corners.

474
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,300
You were invited.

475
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,700
My Lord,

476
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,540
do you know?

477
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,260
You've worked hard.

478
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:45,660

I'm afraid you won't be able to

483
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,660
have a good relationship with Sun Liao.

484
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,260
It's too much for you to say that.

485
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,180
You shouldn't, you shouldn't.

486
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,980
Listen to Sun Liao.

487
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,020
He's sincere.

488
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,300
That's true.

489
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,980
Can you help me solve this?

490
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,380
I don't like this.

491
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,380
You're always questioning me.

492
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,540
Answer my question.

493
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,220
What's the reason?

494
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,620
Is it the truth that

495
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,580
you like to issues about

Sir, I want to go back to the turtle sea with you.

505
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Isn't it a very common thing?

506
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
I'm drunk and I'm in a fight.

507
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,260
You are the myth of the heart.

508
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,260
You are the most respected person of Hua Yue Yue.

509
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
I'm only thinking about you.

510
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,260
But you are so cold to me.

511
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
This is so annoying.

512
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,260
Don't do this again.

513
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,260
You.

514
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,260
Call me Ming Yi.

515
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,260
You have the name of Ming Yue in your heart.

516
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,260
You are the Yi of my Yi Zhongren.

517
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Why did you come to Hua Yue Yue?

518
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,260
You still want to give birth to me.

519
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,260
You said too much.

520
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,260
You have to think of a way to stop him.

521
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,260
My family used to eat medicine to be healthy.

522
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,260
I'm not lying.

523
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,260
After my parents died,

524
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
I came to Hua Yue Yue.

525
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,260
Then you...

526
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,260
You asked me so many questions.

527
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,260
But I think you don't like me.

528
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
Then why did you take me back to the turtle sea?

529
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Are you okay?

530
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
I don't like others being too proactive.

531
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,260
No way.

532
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
So aggressive.

533
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,260
Fine.

534
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
I'll go.

535
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
What's wrong with my hearing?

536
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
Why is it still not good?

537
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,260
It's on fire outside. I'll go check.

538
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
Sir.

539
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,260
What's going on?

540
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,260
What's going on?

541
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,260
What's going on?

542
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,260
What's going on?

543
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,260
What's going on?

544
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
My lord,

545
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
The building in the back is on fire.

546
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,260
Please check it.

547
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,260
I have to check it.

548
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
How can I let you go with me?

549
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,260
You don't know the turtle sea.

550
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,260
What can we do except being a corpse?

551
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Nothing will happen.

552
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
This is the barrier.

553
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
No one can enter the barrier

554
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
except me and Granny Xun.

555
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,260
And you can't get out.

556
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,260
I'll check the back.

557
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,260
No one can enter the barrier.

558
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,260
And you can't get out.

559
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
Then you won't be in danger.

560
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,260
Wait for me.

561
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
You brat.

562
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,260
You brat.

563
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Your spiritual vein is broken.

564
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,260
You can only use simple magic

565
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,260
with a small amount of power.

566
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,260
Don't force yourself.

567
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
I know.

568
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,260
Are you okay?

569
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Master Snake said

570
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
you can't use your spiritual vein.

571
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
What if the spiritual vein is broken?

572
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Only with this little power

573
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,260
can you not push your spiritual vein.

574
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
This barrier is complicated.

575
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,260
I can only help you.

576
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,260
I'm just helping you make some noise

577
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,260
to stop it from flowing.

578
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,260
Why are you so serious?

579
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,260
I'm also wondering.

580
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,260
I just followed what you said.

581
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,260
In the building far away,

582
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,260
I used some magic

583
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
and lit a small fire.

584
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
I don't know why,

585
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
but the fire got bigger.

586
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
I was thinking

587
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
that it shouldn't be like this.

588
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,260
Alright.

589
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
Let's do it while he's not home.

590
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
Where's the thing?

591
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,260
This happened in the name of the fire?

592
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Don't worry, Master.

593
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
I'll check the fire and the cause of the danger.

594
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
No need.

595
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
It's just a fire.

596
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
No need to harm others.

597
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
I don't like others being too proactive.

598
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
I have to deal with it for a while.

599
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,260
Why are the clothes so dirty?

600
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,260
Why hasn't the fire got better?

601
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,260
It's over.

602
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,260
In the two months in the Star-sweeping Abyss,

603
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
we've investigated that

604
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
the spiritual vein of Count Ji

605
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,260
was generated by Li Hentian.

606
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
If Li Hentian

607
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,260
doesn't cure the poison of the dream,

608
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,260
he'll die.

609
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
I'm sure that

610
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,260
Li Hentian

611
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,260
will die if he doesn't cure the poison.

612
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
Since that guy is still alive,

613
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,260
he must have a dream.

614
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,260
He's not here.

615
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,260
He's not here either.

616
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,260
Where is he?

617
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
Li Hentian and Huang Liang Mu

618
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,260
are two-time poison antidotes.

619
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,260
With your poison blood,

620
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
the magic gas that was produced

621
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
shouldn't be found.

622
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,260
Go over there and check.

623
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Master, be careful of the steps.

624
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,260
They're coming back.

625
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
Hurry up and find the clothes.

626
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
You ran away by yourself?

627
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,260
You ran away by yourself?

628
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
You ran away by yourself?

629
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
We've been out for so long.

630
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,260
I wonder if the little fairy

631
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
is waiting for us.

632
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,260
The barrier of the forbidden area is broken.

633
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,260
The barrier of the forbidden area is broken.

634
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
Master, he's not in the room.

635
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
The barrier of the forbidden area is broken.

636
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Master, you're awake.

637
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,260
You're awake.

638
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
You're awake.

639
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
You're awake.

640
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,260
You're awake.

You're awake.

You're awake.

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,260
You're awake.

645
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260

You're awake.

650
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,260
You're awake.

651
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,260
You're awake.

652
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
You're awake.

653
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
You're awake.

654
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,260
