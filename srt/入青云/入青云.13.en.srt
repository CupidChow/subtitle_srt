1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or the heat that only exists in the wind and clouds

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are a warm feeling that is engraved in my heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Memories have been struggling because of you

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't forget your eyes

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can't escape from this love

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Love you like the cloud in the sky

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
One more hour

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No one is supervising

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why do you give yourself an extra hour

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Since it's my fault

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mother should punish me

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I just ran out to buy some pancakes

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Mother is right

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can't let go of my blood

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As the Crown Prince

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I should be like a Crown Prince

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on, come on

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll buy you pancakes later

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If one is not enough, I'll buy you two

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Come on, come on

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What is this?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Twenty-seven

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was recognized today

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How is it possible

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
As long as there are no secrets

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What they see is you

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a boy

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How can they recognize you

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And the boy does not look like you

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Anyway, it won't leak.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't try.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How could anyone recognize me?

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No one knows who I am.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ming Xian.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ming Xian?

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Is this name referring to me?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What else?

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain,

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
God of War, Ming Xian,

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
are all you.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You have won and won many battles.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You have no king or king.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And there is an invincible student, 27.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How can you listen and be so good?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Here, a little one.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't look so sad.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What matters is to be happy every day.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I am here to do things.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Do you understand?

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Erqi.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you think the list of names in the heart

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
will be hidden in the abyss?

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How about I go to the abyss?

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The sooner I know who is in Yaoguang Mountain

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and who is in contact with Mu Qi Bai,

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the sooner I can find out the person who poisoned you.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't do it yet.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Although Uncle Ji has used the weak water

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
to expose the dark side of the abyss,

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
it seems that the abyss has been cleared.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But...

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I will go to the abyss.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I think Mu Qi Bai

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
can't just leave like this.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm afraid there is still danger.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you afraid of?

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm fine.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Who can find me?

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No, you wait for me to think about it.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This child.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm here.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm here.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm here.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm here.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm here.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm here.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm here.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm here.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm here.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm here.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm here.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm here.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm here.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm here.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm here.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm here.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm here.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm here.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm here.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm here.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm here.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm here.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm here.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm here.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm here.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm here.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm here.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm here.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm here.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm here.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm here.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm here.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Caught you.

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
A little cat named Ming Xian.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,500
Say it!

111
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,060
does your Dong descend to the gout?

112
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,880
This drum must be really strong

113
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,320
Stop pretending to be dead.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Did I really die?

115
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,840
Where are you !

116
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,360
Something's wrong.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,520
I think

118
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,560
Er climbing doesn't axe anything wrong

119
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,780
Er Uhh

120
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Er轻

121
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,360
Erqi! Erqi!

122
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,920
Erqi!

123
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,840
Erqi!

124
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,440
It's okay.

125
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,080
I'm here.

126
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,160
It's okay. I'm here.

127
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,840
Don't be afraid.

128
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,240
It's okay.

129
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,960
It's okay.

130
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,760
Mingyi, I'm sorry.

131
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,080
I was hurt by them.

132
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't say sorry.

133
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,320
Erqi, don't say anything.

134
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,200
I'll treat you.

135
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
You can't be hurt.

136
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,240
You...

137
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,480
You can't use your spirit power.

138
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,320
It's okay.

139
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,440
It's okay.

140
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,160
I have nine lives.

141
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,520
You'd better be okay.

142
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,120
Let go.

143
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,080
Let go!

144
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,560
Erqi.

145
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,560
It's okay.

146
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,320
It's okay.

147
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I'll take you back.

148
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,080
Okay.

149
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,560
You're all here.

150
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,280
You didn't hurt me.

151
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,280
I don't want to leave.

152
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Han Fengjun.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,240
Are you going to kill me

154
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
while His Majesty is still in the Shouhua's palace?

155
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
I'm here.

156
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
Don't come in.

157
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,880
Granny, you're mistaken.

158
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,960
I received a message

159
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
and found out the name of Yaoguang Mountain.

160
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,120
I broke into the Jixing Abyss.

161
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,000
We searched everywhere in the Jixing Abyss.

162
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,640
We caught the

163
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,040
The cunning man wanted to escape.

164
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,320
But he didn't know

165
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,520
that his ability

166
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,400
to break into the Longlitai

167
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,720
was Han Fengjun's benefit.

168
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,160
Han Fengjun just wanted to see

169
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,040
where he hid in the Jixing Abyss.

170
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
What a coincidence!

171
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,800
The beast

172
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
escaped to the Wu Gui Sea.

173
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:21,560
Here you are,

174
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,960
Granny.

175
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Immortal Ming Yi is the one who disguised as Ming Xian of Yaoguang Mountain.

176
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
How... How is that possible?

177
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,360
uan

178
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,560
It's still early.

179
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,600
Why are there so many m忻a snapchates walking through the city?

180
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,000
It feels like it's useless

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
because this is a Brad守派堂

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't have time to find medicine now.

183
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,520
Guards!

184
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,720
Guards!

185
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,400
Thank you.

186
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,400
Go find some guards who are on duty.

187
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,800
Help the judge

188
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,600
to put these documents on the contract.

189
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,400
I know you have your own business.

190
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,480
But those brothers who are on duty are different.

191
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,800
They are on duty,

192
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,760
which is a station.

193
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,840
Come in and have a cup of tea.

194
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,760
Take a rest.

195
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,840
You can help me.

196
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,760
But there is no one in the court.

197
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,360
Really?

198
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,960
They are even more than me?

199
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,920
No, no.

200
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,240
They are actually quite polite.

201
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,560
They are just showing off their talents.

202
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,400
Tan Feng Jun took away the guards

203
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,920
and went to Wu Gui Hai to arrest them.

204
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,120
Showing off their talents?

205
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,960
When did that happen?

206
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Ming Yi, what's going on?

207
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,200
It's really surprising.

208
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,160
Not long ago, Lord Ji

209
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,000
just got together with the late Lord Ming Yi.

210
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,600
But now,

211
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,440
not only did Ming Xian's subordinate

212
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,920
escape to Wu Gui Hai,

213
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,480
but also the person who is directly behind the scenes.

214
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,080
I feel sorry for him.

215
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,120
He is your subordinate after all.

216
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
It's just a pity

217
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,560
that the evidence is now like a mountain.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,520
I have to believe

219
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,440
that our proud warrior, Lord Ji,

220
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,040
colluded with Yao Guang Shan secretly

221
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,680
to hide the dead enemy of the Ji Xing Yuan, Ming Xian.

222
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,080
Sun Liao, take it down.

223
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,480
I'll see who dares to do it.

224
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,600
This is the mechanism and the key.

225
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,800
This is the full appearance of Zhuo Jin Tai.

226
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,680
Every year at the Qing Yuan Conference,

227
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,120
there will be a problem with the Gu Diao on the battlefield.

228
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,800
Many fighters died because of it.

229
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,120
This is...

230
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,480
a way to deal with the Gu Diao?

231
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,200
Let them learn it.

232
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,720
Cai Chun should learn it too.

233
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,480
Your Highness.

234
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,640
What are you doing?

235
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
We are here to arrest

236
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,240
Ji Bo Zai, under Lord Han Feng's order.

237
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,040
You are here for me again.

238
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
What crime did Lord Han Feng

239
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,840
commit this time?

240
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,160
Lord Han Feng has found out

241
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,760
that Ji Bo Zai and Wu Gui Hai

242
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,360
are hiding the name of Yao Guang Shan

243
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,400
and disguised as a woman

244
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,280
to take the name of Ming Yi.

245
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,400
What?

246
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
What is this?

247
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
What is this?

248
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
What is this?

249
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
What is this?

250
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
What is this?

251
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
What is this?

252
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
What is this?

253
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
What is this?

254
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Ming Yi

255
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
is Ming Xian's.

256
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,160
When did Lord Han Feng

257
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,320
make up this story?

258
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
If he made it up,

259
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,720
you would believe it too.

260
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,880
Are you guys

261
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,240
out of your mind?

262
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,720
How can you

263
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
say such ridiculous things?

264
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,320
All the six realms know

265
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,440
that Ming Xian's pet is a white cat.

266
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,840
And that cat

267
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,800
was caught in Wu Gui Hai.

268
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,720
And Lord Han Feng has

269
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,040
a tracking mirror

270
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
that can detect Ming Xian.

271
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,680
You guys can guess

272
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,040
whether the needle in this mirror

273
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
points to who?

274
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,760
This fairy is suspicious.

275
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,560
She made us

276
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
track the scene.

277
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Please step aside.

278
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,400
Lord Han Feng will take Ming Yi to interrogate.

279
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
When he explains,

280
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,640
we can figure out

281
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,440
whether Lord Ji

282
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,920
has the name of Ming Xian.

283
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,080
But in this situation,

284
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,960
Lord Ji has the suspicion of colluding with the enemy.

285
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,680
It's really not suitable to stay in the Shouhua Pan Palace

286
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,760
and continue to be the leader of the fighters.

287
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,920
Please cooperate, Lord Ji.

288
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Everyone,

289
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Ming Xian and his pet are willing to resist.

290
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,840
I have to kill them all.

291
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,800
As for Lord Ji,

292
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,360
he's hiding the trouble

293
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,640
and secretly colluding with the enemy.

294
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,520
The evidence is solid.

295
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,000
It's not a crime

296
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,600
to take his identity as a fighter.

297
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,680
Ming Yi is just a little fairy

298
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,520
with no power to fight.

299
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,240
It's not easy to defeat Cheng Zhao.

300
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
You guys

301
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,960
just want to pour the dirty water

302
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,440
onto Lord Ji.

303
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,960
Lord Han Feng is going to pour the dirty water onto Lord Ji.

304
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,840
Then you have to ask me first if I agree.

305
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,960
Granny, are you

306
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,760
willing to go to the Imperial Plains first

307
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,520
and wait for Lord Ji to come down to find you?

308
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,120
It's really touching

309
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,800
to see such loyalty.

310
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,680
Then I will

311
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,440
fulfill your wish.

312
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,360
Where is She?

313
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,120
Where are they?

314
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Where are they?

315
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,920
Wu Gui Hai...

316
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,280
if you can make my heart's desire will be realized

317
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,320
there I will Canvas

318
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
Yes, my Lord.

319
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,640
I am at your service, too.

320
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,800
Ah werden.

321
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,800
You can surrender now.

322
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,280
I will go and gather you.

323
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,160
Work for me.

324
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

325
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,040
Did you avoid chance,

326
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,600
as you want to Hai mere History?

327
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,520
Tony rendezvous?

328
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,320
Yes, Lord.

329
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
You're not wronged, are you?

330
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
I don't want to talk to you.

331
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Wait.

332
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Uncle.

333
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
What's going on?

334
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Mingyi is a common female fairy.

335
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,320
How could she be the old thief of Ming County?

336
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Since the people of Shouhua's rebel group have arrived,

337
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,320
it's good that I'm here to make it clear.

338
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,320
Today, a young man broke into the city and was caught alive by Sun Liao.

339
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
That's him.

340
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Do you know that he's a common female?

341
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Common female?

342
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
He's really a white cat.

343
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Why is the common female of Ming County in Lenghui?

344
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Could it be...

345
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
What is the common female of Yaoguang Mountain?

346
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
You should all know it very well.

347
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
In the six realms, there are common female and white cats.

348
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
The common female can also be a human.

349
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
The common female can also be a human.

350
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
There is only a common female.

351
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
This is indeed a common female of Ming County.

352
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:21,580
But why would her common female appear in the

353
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,580
Your newly-wed wife is even more interesting.

354
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:49,700
She's holding on to the famous

355
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,580
Uncle, I think there's a misunderstanding.

356
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Ji Bozai has nothing to do with Ming County.

357
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,580
In my opinion, this common female is either a bad person or a bad person.

358
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,580
She's just wandering around and has escaped to the Wu Gui Sea.

359
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,580
Sun Liao wants to use this to frame Ming Yi as a fairy and call him Ming County.

360
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,580
It's really absurd.

361
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Besides, you don't care about Ming Yi at all.

362
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,580
You just want to drag the Ji County's army into the water.

363
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Princess, I...

364
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Uncle, what do you think?

365
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,580
You're not going to choose the path, but you choose the Wu Gui Sea.

366
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,580
This is a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

367
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Besides, there's this.

368
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,580
This is a magic instrument made by Ming County.

369
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,580
It's a tracking mirror.

370
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580
As long as Ming County appears nearby,

371
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,580
this mirror will immediately see the scenery and indicate its direction.

372
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,580
This is a good idea.

373
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,580
It's really like her.

374
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
It's really like her.

375
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
It's impossible.

376
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,580
But she's obviously a woman.

377
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,580
Ji Bozai's newlywed wife is not a fairy at all.

378
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,580
I'm afraid it's Ji Bozai who learned evil from somewhere.

379
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,580
He disguised Ming County as a woman and hid her identity.

380
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Ji Bozai, you colluded with the enemy and the evidence is solid.

381
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,580
Why don't you just surrender?

382
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
Why did it turn back?

383
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,580
I didn't expect Han Feng's army to be in such a big circle.

384
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580
It seems to be going to surrender.

385
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,580
Ji Bozai, are you crazy?

386
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,580
How dare you manipulate the tracking mirror?

387
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Yes, I did it.

388
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Since this tracking mirror is so easy to be affected,

389
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,580
can you also use it against her?

390
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,580
Besides, with such a broken mirror,

391
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,580
who do you think she can identify?

392
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Such a broken thing,

393
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
you want to pour dirty water on me?

394
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,580
Han Feng, I think you're crazy.

395
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,580
This mirror was made by Ming County.

396
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
When Ming County was 16,

397
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,580
after the fourth silver cloud conference,

398
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
they developed this magic instrument.

399
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
If there is a crime,

400
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,580
this mirror can be used to detect the objects used.

401
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,580
It can identify the crime.

402
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
So it's called the tracking mirror.

403
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,580
The one who confessed to Yao Guangshan

404
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,580
was the one who committed the crime.

405
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
Yao Guangshan's Mingxin of the Cloud Army

406
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,580
used this mirror to humiliate Ji Xingyuan.

407
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,580
He used the instrument,

408
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,580
but he couldn't even make a good tracking instrument.

409
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,580
The record is not different.

410
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,580
I used the tracking mirror to record this.

411
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,580
I've seen the tracking mirror in the tracking mirror.

412
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,580
It's really the real thing.

413
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,580
Although the record is a big crime,

414
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580
it's a good thing.

415
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
If not,

416
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,580
you've really framed Han Fengjun.

417
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580
Ji Bozai,

418
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,580
what else do you want to say?

419
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
I have a question.

420
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,580
The tracking mirror has always been in Yao Guang Palace.

421
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,580
How did Han Fengjun get it?

422
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
He said Ji Bozai was an enemy,

423
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,580
but Han Fengjun who held the tracking mirror in Yao Guang Mountain

424
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,580
is more suspicious.

425
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,580
Si Tu Ling,

426
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,580
why are you questioning me?

427
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,580
It's really the game of Mingxin.

428
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Even a loser like me

429
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,580
can easily use this mirror

430
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
to make some tricks.

431
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
It's too easy.

432
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
Si Tu Xianjun,

433
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
what are you going to do?

434
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,580
Of course, I'm going to find out the truth.

435
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
Today,

436
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
Han Fengjun didn't ask me,

437
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,580
and he transferred all the guards of the Si Pan Hall.

438
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,580
It's so strange.

439
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,580
The Si Pan Hall should have been the independent court,

440
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,580
but Han Fengjun ordered the people to follow you.

441
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,580
They have Ning Chen Yao,

442
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,580
who has been here for seven years

443
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,580
and is the only one who has defeated Mingxin.

444
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,580
I'm so useless in the Si Pan Hall.

445
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,580
Interesting.

446
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
You didn't tell the truth,

447
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
and you forced a woman

448
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
to be the Crown Prince of Yao Guang Mountain.

449
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
You even framed me

450
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,580
and hid this Mingxin.

451
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,580
Okay,

452
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,580
I admit it.

453
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,580
Mingxin was so angry that she wanted to collude with me.

454
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,580
She insisted on being my enemy,

455
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,580
so that Yao Guang Mountain would lose Fu Ze,

456
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,580
and she even wanted to marry me.

457
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,580
She played a big game.

458
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
Right?

459
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,580
Uncle, please make it clear.

460
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,580
Who gave you this tracking mirror?

461
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,580
He must be the culprit

462
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,580
who colluded with Yao Guang Mountain.

463
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
Uncle,

464
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,580
please don't be blinded by the traitor.

465
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Don't worry.

466
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,580
I won't let anyone

467
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
get away with this.

468
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
But now,

469
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
we should first confirm

470
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
the identity of Immortal Ming Yi.

471
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,580
If Mingxin really used some evil method to transform,

472
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,580
and Immortal Ming Yi insisted on protecting this young man,

473
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,580
there must be something wrong.

474
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,580
I have to take him back to interrogate him.

475
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,580
I think we should make it clear.

476
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,580
Okay.

477
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Bai Qian!

478
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
Uncle Ji, what are you doing?

479
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
That day,

480
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,580
after I defeated Mingxin,

481
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,580
I took his pet as a gift.

482
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,580
This cat is the owner now.

483
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
It's me.

484
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,580
That's why he returned to Wu Gui Sea after being hit hard.

485
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
Han Feng Jun,

486
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,580
the one you slandered before you got the evidence

487
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
is the Crown Prince of Yao Guang Mountain.

488
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,580
He said I was letting you take my pet.

489
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,580
But I had no place to chase him

490
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,580
in the Star Abyss.

491
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
Ridiculous.

492
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,580
I've never seen you take Mingxin's pet

493
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
at the Qing Yun Conference.

494
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,580
You even want to protect a pet.

495
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,580
Uncle Ji,

496
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,580
you still say you have no problem?

497
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,580
Uncle Ji is from the Abyss.

498
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,580
Since I dared to use him,

499
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
I've already figured out the bottom line.

500
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,580
If you don't believe me,

501
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,580
I can guarantee you.

502
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,580
If you just suspect Ming Yi and that pet,

503
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,580
just take them away.

504
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,580
Why do you have to pour this dirty water

505
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,580
onto the person I chose?

506
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Fine.

507
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,580
I have a way to get rid of him.

508
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,580
I'll figure out who he is.

509
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,580
Ming Yi is my confidant.

510
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,580
I know who he is better than anyone else.

511
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,580
If you dare to touch him today,

512
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,580
I'll make sure you don't have a tomorrow.

513
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,580
Since you're a person from the Abyss,

514
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
I have another way

515
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,580
to prove your identity.

516
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,580
The Stone of Fate.

517
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
The Stone of Fate?

518
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,580
That's a good idea.

519
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,580
The Stone of Fate is ancient sacred stone.

520
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,580
It can prove your identity.

521
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
All living things have their own names.

522
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
They need to be in line with their real names

523
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,580
to give their names to the sacred stones.

524
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Since you're not a fighter,

525
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
you shouldn't have colluded with other people

526
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,580
to get the sacred stone.

527
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,580
But since you trust Ming Yi so much,

528
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,580
I think

529
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,580
this way of proving your identity

530
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,580
is also a good idea.

531
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,580
Fine.

532
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,580
I'll prove it to you.

533
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,580
I'll make up for what I owe you.

534
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
If you have a lover,

535
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
please look at the bridge.

536
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
Please go up the bridge.

537
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,580
The Stone of Fate

538
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,580
The Stone of Fate

539
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,580
Did they really pass

540
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Meng Yun Tan's sister?

541
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,580
How come?

542
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,580
Why did they go to the stone?

543
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
Go.

544
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:09,580
Before they came,

545
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,580
Great Lei containing the Go file

546
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
were absent

547
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,580
so wePlayed my Thanks for Stopping You From Goingies

548
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,580
Herr J 경

549
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,580
I come to help you.

550
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,340
The new device

551
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,500
was revealed.

552
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,540
My uncle should have known

553
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,220
that only lovers

554
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,060
can get deep into this barrier.

555
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,300
They should have

556
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,060
crossed the Jiaojian Bridge

557
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,940
This doesn't matter.

558
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,800
I'll kill the Cas surrender before His Majesty ask for it.

559
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,100
Yes.

560
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,580
If you have a love sword, you can only accept true love.

561
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,580
If you have a fake one, you will be punished by heaven.

562
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,580
If you are light, your spirit will be broken.

563
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,580
If you are heavy, you will be destroyed.

564
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,580
You don't want to live anymore?

565
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,580
You stopped me because you were afraid that I would kill you if I knew the truth?

566
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,580
Do you want to kill me?

567
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
No matter who you are,

568
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
it's all as you wish.

569
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,580
Now we are on the same boat.

570
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
I can't prove your identity.

571
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
I have my own problems.

572
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,580
No one can stop me from doing what I want.

573
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
You are the same.

574
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,580
You are wrong.

575
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,580
It's true.

576
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
The wedding of the Star-shrouded Abyss is a secret.

577
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,580
The lovers will find the auspicious day and the auspicious place first.

578
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Then they will make a wish to each other and stay together forever.

579
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,580
If the wedding bells ring,

580
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580
they will be very lucky.

581
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,580
Then,

582
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,580
under the witness of the bird,

583
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,580
they will be blessed with a marriage.

584
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
If the wedding bell rings,

585
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
they will be very lucky.

586
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
If the wedding bells ring,

587
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,580
they will be very lucky.

588
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
If the wedding bells ring,

589
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
they will be very lucky.

590
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,580
Someone is being considerate.

591
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,580
This is the wedding bell of the Star-shrouded Abyss.

592
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,580
The lovers will make a wish to each other

593
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,580
and stay together forever.

594
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,580
The Star-shrouded Abyss

595
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,580
The Star-shrouded Abyss

596
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,580
The Star-shrouded Abyss

597
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,580
I've been hurt by the Star-shrouded Abyss

598
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
I've been hurt by the Star-shrouded Abyss

599
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
He has been hit by the Star-shrouded Abyss so many times.

600
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
He still won't give up.

601
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,580
He's tired.

602
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,580
Forget it. Let him be.

603
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,580
The Star-shrouded Abyss

604
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,580
The Star-shrouded Abyss

605
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
The Star-shrouded Abyss

606
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,580
The Star-shrouded Abyss

607
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,580
Congratulations, both of you.

608
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,580
The two of you will be married.

609
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
You will be together forever.

610
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,580
Let's go.

611
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,580
Let's go out first.

612
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
Since the Star-shrouded Abyss,

613
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
it's the first time

614
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,580
I've ever wanted to believe someone.

615
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,580
How ridiculous.

616
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
You've been lying to me

617
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
since the beginning.

618
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,580
Until today.

619
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,580
I will never leave you again.

620
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,580
You've come true.

621
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,580
You're very happy, aren't you?

622
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
Look at me.

623
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,580
I'm being cheated by you every day.

624
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
You're happy, aren't you?

625
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
No.

626
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,580
In your eyes,

627
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,580
I...

628
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,580
How stupid am I?

629
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,580
I'm sorry.

630
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
I'm sorry.

631
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,580
I'm sorry.

632
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,580
I'm sorry.

633
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,580
Enough.

634
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,580
No matter what you want,

635
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,580
I won't give you

636
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
this life.

637
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,580
I don't owe you anything.

638
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,580
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,580
Actually, I...

640
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,580
Mingyi.

641
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
If I feel pain,

642
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
I won't let you live well.

643
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,580
Congratulations to the new person for giving the guest his name.

644
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,580
I, Mingyi, am proud of Tian City

645
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
and will live a long and happy life.

646
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,580
It seems that the ancient gods

647
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,580
have verified the name of Mingyi.

648
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,580
Lord Han Feng saw it with his own eyes.

649
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
Now I should be relieved.

650
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
If there are any more despicable people

651
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,580
who will spill dirty water on the body of the immortal,

652
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
I, Si Pan Tang, will not be lenient.

653
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,580
Good.

654
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,580
Si Tu Ling,

655
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,580
you're very good.

656
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
Lord Han Feng,

657
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
are you satisfied?

658
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,580
Remember,

659
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,580
from now on,

660
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
no one

661
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,580
will question my wife's identity again.

662
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
I'm sorry.

663
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
I'm sorry.

664
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,580
I'm sorry.

665
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,580
I'm sorry.

666
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,580
I'm sorry.

667
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,580
I'm sorry.

668
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,580
I'm sorry.

669
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,580
I'm sorry.

670
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
Of course.

671
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,580
Congratulations to Lord Ji and Lord Mingyi

672
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,580
for verifying the name.

673
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,580
Lord Si Tu,

674
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,580
we still need to enter the Si Pan Tang's plan.

675
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,580
Why don't I go back to the Si Pan Tang with you?

676
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,580
I'm sorry.

677
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,580
I'm sorry.

678
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,580
I'm sorry.

679
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,580
I'm sorry.

680
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,580
I'm sorry.

681
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,580
I'm sorry.

682
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,580
I'm sorry.

683
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,580
I'm sorry.

684
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,580
I'm sorry.

685
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,580
I'm sorry.

686
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,580
I'm sorry.

687
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,580
I'm sorry.

688
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,580
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,580
I'm sorry.

00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,580
I'm sorry.

691
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,580
I'm sorry.

692
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,580
I'm sorry.

693
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,580
I'm sorry.

694
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,580
I'm sorry.

695
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,580
I'm sorry.

696
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,580
I'm sorry.

697
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,580
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,580

I'm sorry.

00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,580
I'm sorry.

714
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,580
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,580
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,580
I'm sorry.
