EPISODE 27

3
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,120
- Show me your hand.
- What for?

4
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,840
I didn't do anything wrong today.

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,440
If I wanted to hit you,
would I go for your hand?

6
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,680
- What is it?
- Strange.

7
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,480
After your trip to Zhangwei Mountain,

8
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,280
the Heavenly Grief in
you stopped spreading.

9
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,800
Sometimes I can't even detect it at all.

10
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
- Now this hand.
- Really?

11
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,920
Could the feng shui at
the Bo clan's ancestral home

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,720
have somehow helped me?

13
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,040
You might be right.

14
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,120
The Bo clan

15
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,840
created both the Heavenly Grief
and the Golden Millet Dream.

16
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,720
And Fairy Bo herself was your…

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,360
My what?

18
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,560
Your benefactor,

19
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,840
of course.

20
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,120
She gave
you the Golden Millet Dream recipe.

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,800
Even if we still need to
find the Diwu tree's core,

22
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,320
the fact that she gave you the recipe
already makes her your benefactor.

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,880
It's a pity Ji Bozai destroyed
the Golden Millet Dream.

24
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
Otherwise…

25
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,520
It's not over yet.

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,280
Though the Diwu tree's
core hasn't been seen for ages,

27
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,120
the Bo clan still managed to make

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
the Golden Millet Dream and
the Heavenly Grief a century ago.

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,200
Since the Golden Millet Dream Ji Bozai had
was made by Fairy Bo Yulan,

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,920
she must have found a core.

31
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,720
That's my disciple. Smart as ever.

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
If they could find it, why can't we?

33
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,720
What matters most is the Diwu tree's core.

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,880
The rest of the ingredients,
like Ostrich Rat, mesona,

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,200
and turtle shells,

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
are easy to get.

37
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
Ming Yi, don't worry.

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,240
- With me here, there's nothing to fear.
- I know.

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,280
When you're here, Master,

40
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,160
I feel safer
than when my father was around.

41
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,480
What's wrong?

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,880
You're getting more sentimental

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,000
with age, aren't you?

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,360
If you want to cry, go ahead.
Here, my shoulder's free.

45
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,160
What are you doing? I'm your master.

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,400
Show some respect.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,440
If we really manage to
make the Golden Millet Dream,

48
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,440
I'll not only reenter
the Qingyun Tournament,

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,240
but I'll also win
it for another seven years.

50
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,400
Is this the time
to be thinking about that?

51
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,640
But you're right.

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,240
No matter how hard it is,

53
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,680
we'll find those ingredients.

54
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,720
I can't stand
watching you suffer any longer.

55
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,800
Show some respect.

56
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,280
You cheeky brat.

57
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,800
The last ingredient for the Golden
Millet Dream is the Diwu tree's core?

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
How could we possibly find that?

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,160
The Diwu tree's core
has vanished from the world,

60
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,880
but I can't just watch her die.

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
Fuyue,

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,280
the Yousu Fox Tribe can seal a primordial
spirit within an Illusory Realm,

63
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,600
which is considered a form of immortality.

64
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
So I wonder,

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,880
could this technique

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,840
be used to keep Ming Yi alive for now?

67
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,880
Have you lost your mind, Your Lordship?

68
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
You know full well

69
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,600
that using the technique like that

70
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,160
inflicts burning pain to the bone.
One mistake,

71
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,760
and you'll lose your mind completely!

72
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,680
You're only talking
about the consequences.

73
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,400
That means

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,720
the method itself can work.

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
Am I right?

76
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,960
- Please…
- Your Lordship!

77
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,400
Please.

78
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,840
I'm begging you.

79
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Your Lordship.

80
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,280
<i>This fox spell can lure</i>
<i>souls into an Illusory Realm.</i>

81
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,640
<i>It can strip a being of</i>
<i>their three souls and seven senses</i>

82
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,000
<i>and weave an Illusory Realm.</i>

83
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,160
<i>Within that Illusory Realm,</i>
<i>the spell can be reversed</i>

84
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,280
<i>to extend her life with</i>
<i>someone else's lifespan.</i>

85
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,000
<i>I can capture some</i>
<i>wandering spirits without families.</i>

86
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,680
<i>They have no ties in this world.</i>

87
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,960
<i>Killing them won't cause any trouble.</i>

88
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,320
<i>We can't do that.</i>

89
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,480
<i>If I stain my hands</i>
<i>with the blood of the innocent,</i>

90
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
<i>Ming Yi will never forgive me,</i>

91
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,520
<i>and I'll lose any</i>
<i>chance of a future with her.</i>

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,640
<i>Even now,</i>

93
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,960
<i>Your Lordship still can't bring yourself</i>

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,000
<i>to lie to her?</i>

95
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,640
<i>This is my only wish.</i>

96
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,680
<i>I have deceived her before</i>

97
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,280
<i>and done many things I can never undo.</i>

98
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
<i>But in the end,</i>

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,560
<i>I must become someone like her</i>

100
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
<i>to be worthy of standing by her side.</i>

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,480
<i>Three souls and seven</i>
<i>senses, enter the endless Illusory Realm.</i>

102
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,000
<i>Burn the heart and refine the blood.</i>
<i>Cross the heavens and the netherworld.</i>

103
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,120
<i>With my bare body and organs,</i>

104
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,120
<i>I offer all my life's fortune</i>

105
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
<i>to lengthen her years</i>

106
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,760
<i>and extend her life.</i>

107
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,200
- Ming Yi!
- Immortal Situ.

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,720
I found a way to save you.

109
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,880
Take this medicine.

110
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,320
What is it?

111
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,120
Ming Yi, just take it.

112
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,680
Tell me what it is.

113
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,520
I learned a technique
that refines the blood of my heart.

114
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,080
This way,

115
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,760
I can trade my lifespan for your time.

116
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,720
Ming Yi, I told you,

117
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,920
I won't let you die.

118
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,160
Ming Yi.

119
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,640
You…

120
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,120
Immortal Situ!

121
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,720
You…

122
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
You're awake.

123
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,360
How do you feel?

124
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,400
Have some water.

125
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,640
Here.

126
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,040
Ming Yi, you know

127
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,400
I did this willingly.

128
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,120
Immortal Situ,

129
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,880
when I took you to
the Qingyun Tournament years ago,

130
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,920
it was just a small favor.

131
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,480
Why are you so fixated on it

132
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
that you went this far for me?

133
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,800
Ming Yi,

134
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,520
this is the first time

135
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,760
you've acknowledged
who you truly are to me.

136
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,120
I always knew,

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
but hearing you admit it yourself

138
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,880
means so much more.

139
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,560
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,760
You see me as your sister,
yet I kept secrets from you.

141
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
You've held no grudge

142
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,920
and helped me again and again.

143
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,240
I truly don't know how to repay you.

144
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,720
In fact, I was already

145
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
in deep despair back then.

146
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,000
If you hadn't taken me
to that Qingyun Tournament,

147
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,720
stood on the Totem Platform with my badge,

148
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,840
and said those words to me,

149
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,120
I don't think I could've kept going.

150
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,560
So,

151
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,160
no matter how much lifespan it costs,

152
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,560
I'm willing to give it.

153
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,960
Ming Yi,

154
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,720
without you,

155
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,640
I would've given up on my life long ago.

156
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,920
So,

157
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,080
think of this as me fulfilling my wish.

158
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,120
This time,

159
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,880
let me be the one to keep you alive.

160
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
You can't make
someone else your purpose in life.

161
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,080
You should live for yourself.

162
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,000
Immortal Situ,

163
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,920
in truth, I'm the one who owes you.

164
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,480
In that case,

165
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,560
promise me one thing.

166
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
I haven't decided what it will be yet,

167
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,160
but you'll do

168
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,400
whatever I ask for me,

169
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,880
won't you?

170
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,760
Your Lordship!

171
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,880
Your Lordship.

172
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,160
Your Lordship,

173
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
you're suffering
the aftereffects of reversing the spell.

174
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,760
If you give in,
you'll lose your mind completely.

175
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,680
Hang in there.

176
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,880
Fox blood can ease the pain for now.

177
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,800
Your Lordship.

178
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,120
Your Lordship.

179
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,120
It doesn't hurt.

180
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,440
Old Man She! Old Man She!

181
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,440
Look! They're back!

182
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,240
Just now, they suddenly recovered!

183
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,440
- What did you say?
- My spiritual veins! Look!

184
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,240
All right.

185
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,320
- Stop using your spiritual power.
- No, look. They're really back. Look.

186
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,280
And the Grief Blossom
isn't showing itself.

187
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
You're better.

188
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,600
You've really recovered.

189
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,720
I knew you wouldn't die!

190
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,240
I was so worried!

191
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,040
All right.

192
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,440
This is good news. Why are you crying?

193
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,360
Did it just ring?

194
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,680
Your spiritual veins have recovered.

195
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,040
Of course Twenty-Seven would sense it.

196
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,840
Your companion beast will return soon.

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,520
A companion beast
comes into being when a cultivator

198
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,800
reaches the Transcendent Stage.

199
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,200
With your spiritual veins restored,

200
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,680
Twenty-Seven's
lingering divine consciousness

201
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,640
will also grow stronger gradually.

202
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,680
Soon, you'll be able to bring him back.

203
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,280
Twenty-Seven.

204
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,640
You said Immortal Situ
refined his heart's blood

205
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,800
and traded his lifespan for yours?

206
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,200
He said it was
a secret technique of his clan.

207
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,040
I never knew

208
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,720
that Zhushui Spiritual State
had such a powerful clan

209
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,440
with mastery of such a rare art.

210
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,080
He sacrificed so much to save me.

211
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,920
Even if he's keeping secrets from me,
I have no right to question him.

212
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,040
To be honest, Immortal Situ
has really treated you well.

213
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,760
I owe him so much I don't even know
how I could ever repay him.

214
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,720
Stop thinking about it.
I'll make us something to eat.

215
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,360
Let's celebrate properly tonight.

216
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,200
I'm off.

217
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
- Don't make too much.
- Don't worry.

218
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,040
Ming Yi.

219
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
From the sound of it,

220
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,160
he only managed to keep you alive for now.

221
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,280
What about the Heavenly Grief inside you?

222
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,760
How do we get rid of it completely?

223
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,760
Still,

224
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,760
we should thank Situ Ling properly.

225
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Yes. I owe him too much.

226
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,400
What do you plan to do next?

227
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,319
Master,
let's return to Yaoguang Mountain at once.

228
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,000
No way.

229
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
What are you thinking?
What's in that head…?

230
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,320
Ming Yi,

231
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,720
right now, Madam Meng and
Ming Xin control Yaoguang Mountain.

232
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,880
If you rush back there,
you'll fall straight into their trap.

233
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,760
We must first find proof
that Ming Xin used poison

234
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,680
and reveal what truly happened.

235
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,440
Only then can you reclaim
the title of Crown Prince with honor.

236
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,680
Though Father has
named Ming Xin Crown Prince,

237
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,400
the investiture
ceremony hasn't taken place.

238
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,160
He still doubts
whether Ming Xin is truly worthy

239
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,640
of the position.

240
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,520
If Ming Xin fails

241
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,840
to represent Yaoguang Mountain as
Crown Prince in the two-realm tournament,

242
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
he'll lose all face.

243
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,840
The tea gathering.

244
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,320
Before the two-realm tournament,

245
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
Father plans to test
Ming Xin through the tea gathering.

246
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,320
Here, Your Lordship.

247
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,000
{\an8}<i>"My spiritual veins have</i>
<i>recovered, and I am well again.</i>

248
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,320
{\an8}<i>I offer you my deepest thanks.</i>

249
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,960
{\an8}<i>I will never forget</i>
<i>the promise I made to you.</i>

250
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,400
{\an8}<i>If you are ever in need,</i>

251
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,360
{\an8}<i>I will come to</i>
<i>your aid without hesitation,</i>

252
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,720
{\an8}<i>no matter what it takes.</i>

253
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,720
{\an8}<i>Ming Yi."</i>

254
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,040
{\an8}Your Lordship has
sacrificed so much for her,

255
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,600
yet she treats
it merely as a debt of gratitude.

256
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,440
Will she treat Ji Bozai the same way?

257
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,560
Enough.

258
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,720
As long as she's
safe, that's all I care about.

259
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,680
Really?

260
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,080
Search your heart, Your Lordship.

261
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160
Do you really only want her to be safe?

262
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,200
Can someone from Zhushui Spiritual State
really be such a fool for love

263
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,120
- who expects nothing in return?
- Fuyue,

264
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,320
I will never become
like my father or my brothers.

265
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Never.

266
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,240
Are you saying that to me

267
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,120
or to yourself?

268
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,480
Your Lordship.

269
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,880
Your Lordship.

270
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,720
You won't become like them, Your Lordship.

271
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,200
I know you won't.

272
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,760
How did Ming Yi's
spiritual veins get restored?

273
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,800
Didn't you say

274
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,000
this technique
could only prolong her life?

275
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,120
Her spiritual veins were
destroyed by the Heavenly Grief.

276
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,920
Only the Golden Millet Dream
can heal them.

277
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,480
I…

278
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,840
You may go back.

279
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,320
After some rest,
I'll return to the Judgment Hall.

280
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,520
- Your Lordship…
- Don't worry.

281
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,400
I'm fine.

282
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,400
<i>Chao Yuan, was it really worth it?</i>

283
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,120
<i>Open your eyes and see.</i>

284
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,640
<i>You gave her everything.</i>

285
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
<i>You almost died.</i>

286
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,120
<i>But has she ever cared for you?</i>

287
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,840
<i>Has she ever truly seen you?</i>

288
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,160
<i>Have you forgotten how you came this far?</i>

289
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,840
<i>Did anyone ever show</i>
<i>you the slightest respect in the past?</i>

290
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>Have you forgotten it all?</i>

291
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,600
- Get in there!
- Get in there!

292
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,760
Let me out!

293
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,520
Here they come.

294
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,680
- Come on out! Come out!
- How do you like that?

295
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
- These are all prepared for you!
- Let me out!

296
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
- Come out!
- Let me out!

297
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,360
Come out if you can!

298
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,600
<i>- Get in yourself.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

299
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,320
Save us the trouble of beating you up.

300
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,200
- Good boy.
- What a good boy.

301
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,200
Why is he so quiet this time?

302
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,000
- Now he's crying.
- That's more like it.

303
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,840
<i>As expected, one</i>
<i>without spiritual veins is worthless.</i>

304
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,240
<i>You'll never crawl out of there yourself!</i>

305
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,680
After all these years,
he's still the same.

306
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,600
This is no fun.

307
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
That's enough for today.

308
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,040
<i>What are you still struggling for?</i>

309
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,640
<i>You've never truly forgotten that pain.</i>

310
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,360
<i>The Situ Ling everyone else sees is a lie.</i>

311
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,000
<i>All that talk about willingness</i>

312
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,040
<i>and selflessness is a lie!</i>

313
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,920
<i>You are Chao Yuan.</i>

314
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,800
<i>You're just like your father and brothers.</i>

315
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,040
I'm not.

316
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,360
I'm not!

317
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,280
The tea gathering is near,

318
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,800
yet His Majesty passed so suddenly.

319
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,040
The future of Jixing Abyss is uncertain.

320
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,040
Yes.

321
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,040
Are we really going to
let the Princess inherit the throne?

322
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,600
What a disgrace.

323
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,920
Never in history

324
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,520
has a princess become the ruler.

325
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,080
How are we supposed to hold on

326
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,320
to our position among
the Upper Realms this year?

327
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,520
- Right.
- Exactly.

328
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,600
Meng Yangqiu,
what is the punishment for speaking ill

329
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,480
of Her Majesty in private?

330
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,480
According to the laws of Jixing Abyss,
30 lashes

331
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,360
as a warning.

332
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,640
Thirty lashes? That's fair.

333
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,320
It's enough to break some bones,

334
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,160
but not enough to cripple someone.

335
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,640
Some people,

336
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,920
born so lowly,

337
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,760
only managed to crawl their way up
by clinging to others.

338
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,640
You…

339
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,000
Under a female monarch, I'm afraid
our realm will lose all decorum.

340
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,360
Do we really need to wait

341
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,800
for the law to punish
those who speak ill of our ruler?

342
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,360
I spent most of my life imprisoned.

343
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,000
I barely know anything about the law.

344
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,440
If anyone keeps speaking filth before me,

345
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,760
I'll kill them on the spot.

346
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,080
Her Majesty is here!

347
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,880
Whether you accept it or not,

348
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,160
I am now the new ruler of Jixing Abyss.

349
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,160
She…

350
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,520
You all have ears and eyes.

351
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,960
You can hear and you can see.

352
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,640
Judge for yourselves

353
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,360
how I rule from this day on

354
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,840
and whether I am worthy of this seat.

355
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
Today, I give you my word:

356
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,880
I will lead Jixing Abyss

357
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,440
to win the Blessed Rain
at the Qingyun Tournament.

358
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,280
If I fail,

359
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,400
I will step down of my own accord.

360
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,000
We'll see if she keeps her word.

361
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,600
- Can she do it?
- Fair enough.

362
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,440
I think you were right.

363
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,400
About what?

364
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,840
When the water is too
clear, no fish can survive.

365
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
If one seeks an uncorrupted rule,

366
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,440
perhaps the first step

367
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,960
is to cast away purity itself.

368
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,240
Life and death are forever intertwined.

369
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,080
Only by emerging from filth and decay

370
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,840
can one reach true
benevolence and the Way.

371
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,880
In all honesty,

372
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,200
if possible,

373
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,120
I'd still rather see you
stand in the light.

374
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,440
That's my selfish wish.

375
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,160
Tianji,

376
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,800
you can leave

377
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,600
all the dirty work to me.

378
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,280
I'm willing to be your blade.

379
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't need someone
to soil their hands for me.

380
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,760
I will never be that kind of ruler.

381
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,280
I will bear both the good and the bad

382
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,360
of Jixing Abyss

383
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,160
myself.

384
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
But I do have one question.

385
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,360
Immortal Yan,

386
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
would you walk this path with me?

387
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,200
With unwavering devotion.

388
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,520
Good.

389
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,040
May stars and
blessings forever grace the Abyss.

390
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,720
Greetings, Your Majesty.

391
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,880
It seems

392
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,760
that among everyone
today, only you and Xiuyun

393
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,280
saluted me with sincerity.

394
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,880
Ming Yi,

395
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,800
do you believe I can be a good ruler?

396
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,080
Whether others believe in you or not
means nothing.

397
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,680
Follow your words with
actions and see them through.

398
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,360
Sooner or later, all will

399
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,000
bow before you.

400
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,360
You're right.

401
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,400
If they refuse to submit,

402
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,600
they can try to take
this seat for themselves.

403
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,640
Let's see

404
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,040
if they're capable of that.

405
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
With such resolve,

406
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,160
Your Majesty will
surely achieve greatness.

407
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,880
I look forward to witnessing it.

408
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
Come, sit with me.

409
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,640
Ming Yi, have you heard?

410
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,280
I made a promise

411
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,520
to lead Jixing Abyss
to victory in the Qingyun Tournament.

412
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,560
If I fail, I'll abdicate the throne.

413
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,040
So,

414
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
I want your help.

415
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,000
Ji Bozai can't forge artifacts,

416
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,720
yet in the battle against
the netherbeast army on the Prayer Night,

417
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,000
he wielded a demon-repelling parasol.

418
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,520
That must have been your work, right?

419
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,040
So, Ming Yi,

420
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,240
join Shouhua Academy.

421
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,600
If I refuse,

422
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,160
what will you do, Your Majesty?

423
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,080
At first, I thought about
threatening you with your life.

424
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,720
Later, I considered other ways.

425
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,880
But in the end, I came to a realization:

426
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,200
you made the demon-repelling parasol
to protect the innocent.

427
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,360
I shouldn't pressure someone like you.

428
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,560
So please, Ming Yi, I'm begging you.

429
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,960
I know you've been
staying at Zhang Tai's place lately.

430
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,680
Something must've
happened between you and Ji Bozai.

431
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,480
I get it. Married couples
shouldn't be apart for too long.

432
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,480
But there are only
four people at the Academy.

433
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,680
I really need you.

434
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,600
Chen Xi is still young.

435
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,960
However talented he is,
he needs proper guidance, doesn't he?

436
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,520
We lost seven years in
a row. Our best talents all left.

437
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,480
We are falling far behind
the other realms in forging.

438
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,520
Yet people still call Jixing Abyss
a land of master Forgers.

439
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,200
It's embarrassing just to hear it.

440
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,600
Ming Yi, if you don't help me,
we're doomed!

441
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,240
Please.

442
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,640
You're the Empress now.

443
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,160
- Can you act like one?
- No.

444
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,560
My dignity doesn't matter.

445
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,840
As Empress, my top priority is to find
a great Forger for Shouhua Academy.

446
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,680
Politics, pride…

447
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,280
None of that works on you anyway.

448
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
- Let go.
- No.

449
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,680
- Let go!
- Not until you say yes!

450
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,000
What brings you here, Yan?

451
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,160
This year's tea gathering will
be held at Yaoguang Mountain,

452
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,600
which puts
Jixing Abyss at a great disadvantage.

453
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,400
So I came to ask if you'd be willing
to move into Shouhua Academy for now.

454
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,280
It'll give us more time to train together,

455
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,840
and it'll boost morale.

456
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,960
Of course.

457
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,400
As a warrior of Jixing Abyss,
that's my duty.

458
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,120
I appreciate it, Ji. Farewell.

459
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,000
Your Lordship,

460
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,280
you asked me to look into the message
that lured you to Zhangwei Mountain.

461
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,480
I couldn't find the sender.

462
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,520
MING YI HAS GONE TO THE ZHANGWEI MOUNTAIN

463
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,120
TO OBTAIN THE SECOND
HALF OF "BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS"

464
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,040
Your Lordship,

465
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,800
the sender didn't leave their name,

466
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,800
and the handwriting has been altered.

467
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,440
The sender deliberately
lured me there to rescue Ming Yi

468
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,200
but set no traps.

469
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,800
Only Situ Ling would
do something like that.

470
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,080
Did you find anything about him,
as I asked?

471
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,800
I located the head of the Situ clan.

472
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,680
After Mu Qibai's death,
he feared he might be implicated,

473
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,800
so he went into hiding.

474
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,040
I found him

475
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,000
and told him he'd be spared
if he told the truth,

476
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,760
so he confessed everything.

477
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,960
In fact, he forged Situ Ling's identity.

478
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,120
The Situ clan
never had a long-lost younger son.

479
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,000
Situ Ling's true identity

480
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,080
is Chao Yuan, the son
of the Emperor of Zhushui.

481
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,800
He's the son of the Emperor of Zhushui?

482
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,800
Then why did he infiltrate Jixing Abyss

483
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,679
in the first place?

484
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,520
Judging by his actions,

485
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
it doesn't seem like
he was on Mu Qibai's side.

486
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,440
I went to Zhushui Spiritual State
and learned

487
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,000
that Chao Yuan had no spiritual veins
and was never favored by his father.

488
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,239
He'd long been
bullied by his elder brothers.

489
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,400
He most likely escaped on his own.

490
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,239
- When did he come to Jixing Abyss?
- It's been some time.

491
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,840
The head of the Situ clan

492
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,960
said that at first,
he stayed with their clan,

493
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,480
claiming he was there on a mission.

494
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,000
He also inquired about the Sunken Abyss.

495
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,520
After last year's Qingyun Tournament,
he assumed the identity of Situ Ling,

496
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,320
took Jixing Abyss's Immortal Examination,
and joined the Judgment Hall.

497
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,040
He must have learned in Zhushui Palace

498
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,520
that Mu Qibai was using the Sunken Abyss
to refine medicine.

499
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,640
I went to the divine capital

500
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,880
after last year's Qingyun Tournament.

501
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,200
He must've come

502
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,000
for the Golden Millet Dream.

503
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,120
You did it again!

504
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,680
Calm down. Look, you even
made dust fall into my bowl.

505
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,880
I'm not taking an official
post at Shouhua Academy.

506
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,040
I'm just teaching forging.

507
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,720
That way, I can go to
the tea gathering with them

508
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,520
without raising suspicion.

509
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,760
I will only agree to
your request verbally.

510
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,480
You grant me the Blessed Rain,
and I'll teach Chen Xi how to forge.

511
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,760
But I have two more conditions.

512
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,800
Sure.

513
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,680
Shouldn't you hear them first
before deciding whether to agree?

514
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,400
I've seen the demon-repelling parasol.

515
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,800
No one in Jixing Abyss
can match your forging skills.

516
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,720
If you agree to teach at the Academy,

517
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,040
I'll meet any condition you name.

518
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,920
First,

519
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,160
I want to accompany the warriors
to the tea gathering.

520
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,440
No problem.

521
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,800
Second, I want Your Majesty to promise

522
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,320
to give it your all while
preparing for the Qingyun Tournament.

523
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,760
When the Six Realms gather,

524
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,680
you must expose the crimes

525
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,760
of the Emperor of Zhushui
and his followers before everyone.

526
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,160
Agreed.

527
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,200
That's what I've always intended to do.

528
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Now,

529
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,480
welcome to Shouhua Academy, Fairy Ming Yi.

530
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,240
So that's your plan.

531
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,760
If you can't outsmart Ming Xin,
at least you'll have helped form a force

532
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,240
to stand against Zhushui Spiritual State.

533
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,800
Since I've already
stepped down as the Venerable,

534
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,960
I'll use this time

535
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,680
to search for the ingredients
needed to make the Golden Millet Dream.

536
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,040
Honestly,
I still can't tell if the poison in you

537
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,320
is truly gone.

538
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,280
While I'm out looking
for the herbs, remember to…

539
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,560
I can take care of myself.

540
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,280
Be good, or else…

541
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,240
What are you? A three-year-old?

542
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,200
Oh, right.

543
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,600
Every year, there's a spiritual power
contest at the tea gathering,

544
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,240
followed by a travelers' competition.

545
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Anyone besides the warriors can join.

546
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,600
It's meant to let
ordinary people of the Six Realms

547
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,920
test their skills against each other.

548
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,920
I've heard this year's prize

549
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,240
is a black lingzhi mushroom.

550
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,600
It can help companion
beasts regain their form.

551
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,560
So it can bring Twenty-Seven back?

552
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,720
- Smart girl.
- Really?

553
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,360
With that mushroom,
you can speed up Twenty-Seven's revival.

554
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,800
Twenty-Seven, did you hear that?

555
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,880
There's a way to bring you back.

556
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,520
Just wait for me, all right?

557
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,240
The Tiger-Subduing Shield.
Strong in both offense and defense,

558
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,400
especially the latter.

559
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,320
It suits you, Meng Yangqiu.

560
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,600
Thank you, Fairy Ming Yi.

561
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,440
This is the Lvqi Zither.

562
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,680
It has a quick attack speed
and can amplify healing effects.

563
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,360
Yan Xiao, this one's for you.

564
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,960
Thank you, Fairy Ming Yi.

565
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,240
This is the Haotian Staff.

566
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,800
Once you channel spiritual power into it,
you can strike enemies

567
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,560
from 100 chi away
and knock down everyone in its path.

568
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,080
- Thank you, Master!
- Did I say you could have it?

569
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,200
Just kidding. It's yours.

570
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,640
Here, take it.

571
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,760
Ji, come and try these artifacts.

572
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,440
With your strength
and Ming Yi's craftsmanship,

573
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,360
no one in the Six Realms
would be able to rival you.

574
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,320
What are you doing here?

575
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,200
By order of Her Majesty,
I've joined Shouhua Academy

576
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,920
to teach Chen Xi forging.

577
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,160
You didn't know Fairy Ming Yi

578
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,040
had joined Shouhua Academy?

579
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,040
- Actually, Immortal Ji and I…
- Come with me.

580
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,080
Wait, I wasn't finished.

581
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,200
Did Immortal Ji and Fairy Ming Yi

582
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,720
have a fight?

583
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,120
Come back… Children shouldn't
meddle in adult matters.

584
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,480
Just stop here. There's no one around.

585
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,360
Why are you really here?

586
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,120
I want to go to the tea gathering

587
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,320
to find proof that Ming Xin poisoned me.

588
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,040
If I wait until my father
holds the investiture ceremony

589
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,880
to name him Crown Prince,

590
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,360
- it'll be too late.
- Staying at Shouhua Academy

591
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,400
could easily expose your true identity.

592
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,520
I don't even know much about forging,

593
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,880
yet I saw the similarities
between the Nirvana and the Embers.

594
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,480
Do you think I'm an idiot?
That I'd forge weapons

595
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,480
for everyone
that look just like the Embers?

596
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,360
You've only seen
a fraction of my forging skill.

597
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,960
The artifacts I create
are far beyond your imagination.

598
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,240
So don't worry.
No one will find out who I really am.

599
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,480
Fine.

600
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,600
Since you dared to
come to Shouhua Academy,

601
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,400
does it mean
your spiritual veins have healed?

602
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,720
Thank you for your concern, Immortal Ji.

603
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,240
Yes, they have,
perhaps through divine mercy.

604
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,560
I also owe it to the elixir
Immortal Situ refined for me.

605
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,480
Otherwise, I wouldn't have survived.

606
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,880
Immortal Situ?

607
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,720
Situ Ling?

608
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,560
Yes. And my master

609
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,520
also transferred half his power to me.

610
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,920
But I'm not sure
whether the poison's been purged

611
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,120
or if it's just a temporary recovery.

612
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,840
Either way, I'm not in pain now,

613
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,600
and I'm safe for now.

614
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
How did he save you?

615
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,240
With his heart's blood.

616
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,760
He gave me some of his lifespan.

617
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,680
I owe him a great debt.

618
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,880
What's wrong?

619
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,000
Congratulations.

620
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Wait! I owe you too, Immortal Ji.

621
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,800
Even though
the Golden Millet Dream's recipe

622
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,000
never came into use,

623
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,520
without your help,

624
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,680
I would've died searching for it.

625
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,160
Thank you, Immortal Ji.

626
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,160
I'll take my leave now.

627
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,800
Did you really give
the Golden Millet Dream to Ming Yi?

628
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,000
Are you slamming the table at me?

629
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,640
Does that even matter?
You should be worrying about yourself now!

630
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,160
Do you not value your own life at all?

631
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,040
Have you forgotten
that the Heavenly Grief in you

632
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,520
was never truly purged?

633
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,680
<i>Back then, because</i>
<i>there was no catalyst herb,</i>

634
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,840
<i>Fairy Bo had to use</i>
<i>her clan's secret technique</i>

635
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,880
<i>and combine other</i>
<i>ingredients of the Golden Millet Dream</i>

636
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,200
<i>to suppress</i>
<i>the Heavenly Grief in your body.</i>

637
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,400
But it could relapse at any time.

638
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,400
Later, Fairy Bo made
the complete Golden Millet Dream

639
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,520
and left it to you.

640
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,320
But now you've given it to Ming Yi.

641
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,360
If you suffer a relapse someday,
what will you do then?

642
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,480
Buxiu, I know what I'm doing.

643
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,840
Do you?

644
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,320
Then why did I sense

645
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,560
the Spirit Well you formed
with your spiritual power has closed?

646
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,440
Did you drain your own power to refine
the Golden Millet Dream directly?

647
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,720
Planting the Golden Millet Dream
within someone

648
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,560
takes an enormous
amount of spiritual power,

649
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,800
and the process
feels like being flayed alive.

650
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,440
You did all this so Ming Yi
could take it directly,

651
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,560
didn't you?

652
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,880
Did you really go that far?
