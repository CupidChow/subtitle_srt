1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it the heat that will last only in the wind and rain?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are a warm feeling that is as warm as the heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Memories have been fighting for you since then

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The hero that I can't forget

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The one that I can't escape from is the love

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Love you so much that I can't forget

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The One and Only

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Where did the 27-year-old go?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why hasn't he come back yet?

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I finally met someone

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You two, are you...

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,860
Amatric starting to fall asleep

18
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,500
They look like they ALL died from poison

19
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
The King's Avatar

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
The moon is flying in the sky.

21
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
The arena is so big.

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Only the last fighter has a solo seat.

23
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Be serious.

24
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
My lord.

25
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Everyone has no objection to me.

26
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
If you bring me here today,

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
everyone will have some opinions about me.

28
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
I'd better wait for you outside.

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Wait.

30
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
The Amulet of the Mountain.

31
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Take it off.

32
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
I said,

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
take it off.

34
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
What a bad joke.

35
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Take it off.

36
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
I promise to watch it with you.

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Since you said so,

38
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
please keep it for me.

39
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
It's so bad.

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
How can it be like this?

41
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
It's so bad.

42
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
It's so bad.

43
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
It's so bad.

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
It's so bad.

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
It's so bad.

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Princess,

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
how about taking a rest?

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Yeah.

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
It's so bad.

50
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Yeah.

51
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
It's so bad.

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
It's so bad.

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Yeah.

54
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Li Yilian is so mean.

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
He is so rude.

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Yeah.

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
He deserves to be punished.

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
What's wrong with him?

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
He's been bullied by the princess.

60
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
He's been bullied.

61
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I've never seen anyone like him.

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Tianji.

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Tianji.

64
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
This is your favorite candy in that shop when you were a kid.

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
If Han Fengjun didn't tell me,

66
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
they would go back to the market again.

67
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
I can't buy it.

68
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
After eating this,

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
you may feel better.

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Well,

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
you don't want to eat the candy?

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
I'll go and catch Ji Bozai and beat him up.

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I'll make you angry.

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Enough, Meng Yangqiu.

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
He didn't cry.

76
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
If he can control Shouhua and Pan Gong by crying,

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
it's too easy for him.

78
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
I'm talking to Meng Yangqiu.

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Do I need you to talk to me?

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I was just kidding.

81
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Don't be angry.

82
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Thanks.

83
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
I like it.

84
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
No.

85
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
When did you see me angry?

86
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
I was angry.

87
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
But I haven't seen you happy for a long time.

88
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Xiuyun, keep the horse.

89
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Okay.

90
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
The four-star fairy is so powerful.

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Qi Xingyuan is a talented person.

92
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Even Sun Liao is powerful.

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Princess Tianji is so ugly.

94
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
It's easy to make me happy.

95
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
For example,

96
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
you

97
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
and her

98
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
participate in the contest.

99
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Then I'll be happy.

100
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Okay.

101
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Why?

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
I'm just a fairy.

103
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
I have no spiritual connection.

104
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
How can I be a contestant?

105
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Besides,

106
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
we all have different lives.

107
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Why don't you know?

108
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Are you sure

109
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
you want to use me?

110
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Qi Xingyuan is a talented person now.

111
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I have no choice.

112
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
So,

113
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
do you two

114
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
want to help Qi Xingyuan?

115
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I

116
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
and her

117
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
we all want to.

118
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Please forgive me.

119
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
I

120
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
won't

121
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
accompany you.

122
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Tianji,

123
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
what's wrong with you?

124
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Tianji.

125
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Tianji.

126
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Oh, no.

127
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Princess is poisoned.

128
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Let's go and have a look.

129
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Hurry.

130
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Go and find someone to help.

131
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Hurry.

132
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Yan Xiao,

133
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
how is Tianji?

134
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
She's poisoned.

135
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Poisoned?

136
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
She's poisoned.

137
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Poisoned?

138
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Poisoned?

139
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Poisoned?

140
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Sugar?

141
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Is it sugar?

142
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
If Lord Han Feng didn't tell me

143
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,520
they went back to the

144
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
I can't buy it.

145
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Xiuyun, sugar.

146
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Sugar.

147
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Here it is.

148
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Sugar is fine.

149
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Great.

150
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
No.

151
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Tianji is not well.

152
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
What did Tianji touch just now?

153
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
That hairpin.

154
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
She touched the hairpin just now.

155
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
She's starting to feel bad.

156
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Lord Han Feng,

157
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
is he trying to

158
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
honor the Lord?

159
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
He was not so polite to Tianji.

160
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Princess is poisoned.

162
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Why don't you go and have a look?

163
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
There are too many scenes to watch today.

164
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
This is not bad.

165
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
What scene?

166
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Have you heard

167
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
the story of a fox being cheated by a rabbit?

168
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
No matter how cunning the fox is,

169
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
as long as it's soft-hearted,

170
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
it's destined to be crushed by a moth.

171
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
In the end, the rabbit was killed by a moth.

172
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
If Ji Bo is really poisoned,

173
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
what should I do?

174
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Although I have no pulse,

175
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
even if there is a chance of one in ten thousand,

176
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
I will kill it at all costs.

177
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Is it?

178
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Tianji, you're awake.

179
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Tianji woke up!

180
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Let's wake up now.

181
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:41,500
человек

182
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
well indeed

183
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
the whole seven gaps

184
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
not to mention that Ji Bo

185
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
cannot be pushed out on you one by one,

186
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
I'm afraid that Uncle will kill me

187
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
and I'll be punished.

188
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
After all,

189
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
it means that you've lost his trust.

190
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
You've heard it, right?

191
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Meng Tianji,

192
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
you're not the only one who's lost his trust.

193
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
You're the only one who's lost his trust.

194
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
You're the only one who's lost his trust.

195
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
You're the only one who's lost his trust.

196
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
It's already late.

197
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Meng Tianji!

198
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
You're using your body as a child's play.

199
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
You're so stupid.

200
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Master Yan, you...

201
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Where's the antidote?

202
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Take it out and eat it.

203
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
There's no antidote.

204
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Princess.

205
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
No, I have to find someone else to check on it.

206
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
I'm really helpless.

207
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
I'm not good at medicine.

208
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
I'm really helpless.

209
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Yan Xiao, save Tianji.

210
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Master Yan.

211
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Master Yan.

212
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
The poison is gone.

213
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Don't do it again.

214
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
The contestant has finished his election.

215
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
The contestant has finished his election.

216
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Now, the list of candidates is announced.

217
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Before announcing the list of candidates,

218
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I have something important to announce.

219
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
The candidates today

220
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
are not the final candidates.

221
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
The final candidates are the ones who will be selected.

222
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
What?

223
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
What do you mean?

224
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
How can this be?

225
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
That's right.

226
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
What are we?

227
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
That's right.

228
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
That's reasonable.

229
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
That's right.

230
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Shouhua, Pan Guang,

231
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
continue to welcome the talented and brave to sign up.

232
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
We will get the contestant

233
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
until we find the most perfect contestant.

234
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
We will go to the next Qingyun Conference together.

235
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
That's right.

236
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Now, the list of candidates is announced.

237
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
The contestant is

238
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Ji Bozai.

239
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Qian Dun, Sun Liao.

240
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Sun Liao is really good.

241
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
The assistant is Chen Xi.

242
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Chen Xi?

243
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Chen Xi is not him.

244
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
That's right.

245
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Although he is talented in magic,

246
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
he is still a child.

247
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
That's right.

248
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
He is too young.

249
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
How can he be him?

250
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
The assistant is Meng Yangqiu.

251
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Meng Yangqiu?

252
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Meng Yangqiu?

253
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
He is a smart and strong person.

254
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
He is a fool.

255
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
That's right.

256
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
The doctor is

257
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
How can he be him?

258
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
He is a fool.

259
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Yuan Xiao.

260
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Although the doctor is talented,

261
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
he doesn't have a spiritual vein.

262
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Isn't he going to die?

263
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
That's right.

264
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
That's right.

265
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Your honor,

266
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
I don't have a spiritual vein.

267
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,500
This doesn't meet the rules of the contestant.

268
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
The medical skills of the doctor,

269
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
no one can stand up when he sees Ji Xingyuan.

270
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
No one is more suitable than you.

271
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
As Shouhua Pan Guang's doctor,

272
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
you are going to fight for the Qingyun Conference

273
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
and fight for Ji Xingyuan.

274
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
But how can I change my position?

275
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
All the rules

276
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
are to make Ji Xingyuan better.

277
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
If the old system can't help Ji Xingyuan

278
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
win the Qingyun Conference,

279
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
then I,

280
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
the head of Shouhua Pan Guang,

281
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
will change it.

282
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
This doesn't meet the rules.

283
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
How can we choose them?

284
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
The princess is too bold.

285
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I've never done this before.

286
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
How can the princess make such a decision?

287
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Last time,

288
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
the princess disobeyed the old system,

289
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
and she appointed me as the contestant.

290
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
She's too bold.

291
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
She's too bold.

292
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
She's too bold.

293
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
The last criticism was even more shocking.

294
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,500
But the result is clear.

295
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
So,

296
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I will take all the doubts.

297
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Your honor,

298
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
among the contestants,

299
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
the medical skill is better than mine.

300
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
It's not up to me.

301
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I can't take the responsibility.

302
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Really?

303
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
In the contest,

304
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
I was poisoned.

305
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
It's hard to mix seven poisons.

306
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I asked all the doctors there.

307
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
No one could help me.

308
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
But you, Lord Yan Xiao,

309
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
in a short time,

310
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
made the antidote for the seven poisons.

311
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,500
You all were convinced.

312
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Yes.

313
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
I saw it with my own eyes.

314
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
They saw it too.

315
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Yes.

316
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
We can do it.

317
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Don't forget your country.

318
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Yes.

319
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Although you have no spiritual connections,

320
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
you will be able to win

321
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
if you have a chance.

322
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Right?

323
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
The God of the Seven Stars is here.

324
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Greetings, God of the Seven Stars.

325
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
My husband.

326
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
My husband.

327
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
My husband.

328
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
My husband.

329
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
In the Qingyun Contest,

330
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
the God of the Seven Stars is the best.

331
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,500
But I believe it's just the beginning.

332
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Lian Sheng is waiting for us.

333
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Today,

334
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,500
I'm willing to fight for the God of the Seven Stars.

335
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
I'm very grateful.

336
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
I hope we can do our best

337
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,500
to protect the glory of the God of the Seven Stars.

338
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,500
We will do our best to protect the glory of the God of the Seven Stars.

339
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Brother,

340
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
you must be well.

341
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
You'd better go back and rest.

342
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Let's go back.

343
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
What's going on?

344
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
It's her.

345
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
It's her.

346
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
It's her.

347
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
It's her.

348
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Why did she appear suddenly?

349
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,500
The late God of the Seven Stars is here to see the God of the Seven Stars.

350
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Didn't she say that she was missing?

351
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
She appeared suddenly.

352
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
What's going on?

353
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
It's her.

354
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
It's her.

355
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
She came here by mistake.

356
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
The late God of the Seven Stars is guilty.

357
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
She came here by mistake.

358
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
The late God of the Seven Stars is guilty.

359
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
We can't let her go.

360
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Please kill her.

361
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
The late God of the Seven Stars,

362
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
you've been missing for a long time.

363
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
You left the Four Treasures Sect and didn't hear anything.

364
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Now you're going to the late God of the Seven Stars.

365
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
What's your motive?

366
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Guards.

367
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Yes.

368
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Take the late God of the Seven Stars away.

369
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Yes.

370
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Yes.

371
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Wait.

372
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Thank you for protecting the late God of the Seven Stars

373
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
and giving me the memory.

374
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Otherwise, I would have to put more effort

375
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
to find the person I want to deal with.

376
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Don't forget what I told you to do.

377
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
The late God has been in a coma for many years.

378
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
But there are some occasions

379
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
when he has to be present.

380
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Every time,

381
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
he wakes up as promised.

382
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
This year's winner, Lin Xuan,

383
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I don't think it will be an exception.

384
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
At that time,

385
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
you will go to the late God

386
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
and confess your crime publicly.

387
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
The late God of the Seven Stars

388
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
uses the personal judgment to judge the duty.

389
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
He secretly made the dream of the late God and the late God.

390
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
What?

391
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
The late God and the late God?

392
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
The late God and the late God?

393
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Now you know your crime.

394
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
You're willing to confess your crime.

395
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
You only ask for punishment.

396
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
The late God and the late God?

397
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Isn't that the doctor who gave birth to the spirit?

398
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
The late God has been missing for hundreds of years.

399
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Yes.

400
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
How could he have it?

401
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
How could someone

402
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
secretly make the dream of the late God?

403
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Twenty-two years ago,

404
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
I accidentally got the medical records

405
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
left by the doctor's family.

406
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
I used the place of the abyss

407
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
and the labor of the crime

408
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
to secretly make the dream of the late God.

409
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
But the operation was a disability.

410
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
For many years,

411
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I only made the dream of the late God.

412
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
I didn't get the dream of the late God.

413
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
If it's really as the late God said,

414
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Han Fengjun,

415
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Chen Yuan is under your control.

416
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Do you have any explanation?

417
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Brother, you're wise.

418
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
During the time when my brother was in charge of Chen Yuan,

419
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I've never heard such a ridiculous thing.

420
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Hao Zhao,

421
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
you have to think about this thing clearly.

422
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
There must be evidence.

423
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
You can climb the roof at will,

424
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
but it will cause trouble to the whole clan.

425
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Yes, Hao Zhao.

426
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Han Fengjun never participated in the operation.

427
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
You must make it clear

428
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
and testify for him.

429
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
It's me.

430
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Everything was done by Hao Zhao.

431
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
During the time when Chen Yuan was in charge,

432
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I forged the handbook of Han Fengjun.

433
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
I used the place of the abyss

434
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
to force Chen Yuan to commit the crime

435
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
and make the dream of the late God.

436
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Hey,

437
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Mr. Hao Zhao.

438
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Where are the people who came to me to find the medicine?

439
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Here.

440
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Here.

441
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Hurry up, don't dawdle.

442
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Go over there.

443
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Hurry up.

444
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Hurry up.

445
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Hurry up.

446
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Go over there.

447
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
You dare to be lazy and not do the work?

448
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Hit me first.

449
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
You always give me the medicine

450
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
for these low-level crimes.

451
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Don't even think about going out in your whole life.

452
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Lord Situ,

453
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
if the late God's words are true,

454
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
how should we make the decision?

455
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
This case is very important.

456
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I have to make the decision.

457
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
I have to make the decision.

458
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
I'm afraid I need to investigate this case

459
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
and find out the truth before I can sentence him to death.

460
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
What the late God said

461
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
is all true.

462
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Good.

463
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
From today on,

464
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
the post will be taken to the prison of the Sipan Hall.

465
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
After the investigation of the truth in the Sipan Hall,

466
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
it will be released.

467
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Good.

468
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Good.

469
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
God is wise.

470
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
I will definitely go to the Sipan Hall

471
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
and find out the source.

472
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Wait.

473
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
I have something to report to you

474
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
about the crime of the late God's edict.

475
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Don't worry, Lord.

476
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
You and I have saved lives.

477
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Ruoshui will definitely repay you.

478
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
What is this?

479
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Be careful.

480
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
I will clean up the maids of the Maids of the Flower Moon Night.

481
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
I'm willing to be punished for the crimes I committed.

482
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
I will tell the late God

483
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
with my weak body.

484
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
What?

485
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Really?

486
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
What are you here to tell me?

487
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
God is wise.

488
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
This matter

489
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
is not as simple as the late God said.

490
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
The so-called crimes of helping him to make medicine in the Chenyue

491
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
are actually

492
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
innocent immortals who were led by him.

493
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Help!

494
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
He used the evil name to make the medicine

495
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
and forced the late God to make the hard work.

496
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
The poisonous water of the medicine

497
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
polluted many villages nearby.

498
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
The late God knew this,

499
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
but he was stubborn.

500
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
How could this be?

501
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Fairy,

502
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
how do you know this?

503
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
What is your relationship with the late God?

504
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
I

505
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
am the daughter of the late God's illegitimate daughter.

506
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
The illegitimate daughter?

507
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
You just said

508
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
the late God is your biological father.

509
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Then why did you report him?

510
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Yes.

511
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
He is the father of the late God.

512
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Why don't

513
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
the late God tell us the whole story?

514
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
We can decide on the punishment.

515
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Ruoshui,

516
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
it was my father's fault

517
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
to abandon you and your mother.

518
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I have been trying to make up for it.

519
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
I beg you not to scold my father again.

520
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Ye Pei,

521
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
what kind of father are you pretending to be now?

522
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
When he helped you to see me when I was born,

523
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
he had a crybaby.

524
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
It was the martial arts.

525
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
You abandoned me and my mother without hesitation.

526
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Mother,

527
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
I am so guilty.

528
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
I am so guilty that I died of illness.

529
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
The cycle of heaven is so cruel.

530
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
You abandoned your mother

531
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
and only wanted a healthy child.

532
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
But your late god's blood

533
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
died of the crybaby.

534
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Only me

535
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
can live to this day.

536
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
If it weren't for this,

537
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
how could you remember that you still have a daughter?

538
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
How could I not hate her

539
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
for being so heartless and ungrateful?

540
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Even so,

541
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
if you were the only one to testify,

542
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
I'm afraid it's not enough.

543
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
God,

544
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
I have no one to testify

545
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
except myself.

546
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
There is someone else.

547
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
It's Mingyi.

548
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
I didn't have any relationship with Mingyi

549
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
on the night of the flower moon.

550
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
But I know that

551
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
his parents are all the magicians

552
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
who are on the edge of the heart-wrenching cold water.

553
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Mingyi,

554
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
have you ever seen your parents die?

555
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Yes.

556
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
My lord,

557
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
the water in our house has been deep for generations.

558
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
We can only survive by picking herbs.

559
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,900
This is my bodyguard.

560
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,140
You've played a great game.

561
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,340
Even I'm your pawn.

562
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,780
I've borrowed the identity of Ming's daughter.

563
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,100
Today,

564
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,940
I'll be the one to defend them.

565
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,060
When my parents died,

566
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,340
they were all pale.

567
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:36,340
They were covered in blood.

568
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,580
It was painful.

569
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,740
Yunyi,

570
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,180
why didn't you tell me

571
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,660
about your parents' death?

572
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,620
You've used up all your interests.

573
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
Stop pretending.

574
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,820
May I ask

575
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,460
what the symptoms are

576
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,220
of Ming Yi's parents?

577
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,180
Yes.

578
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,140
Doctor Yan Xiao,

579
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,420
tell me what the symptoms are.

580
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,900
Such a death

581
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,180
should be a long-term exposure to blood

582
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,420
and toxic substances.

583
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,260
As far as I know,

584
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,100
the medicine fairy who was in the cold water

585
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,820
was picking up medicine near the garden.

586
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,140
She drank the water in the garden and died.

587
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,620
The toxic substance in the water

588
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,500
is the toxic blood

589
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,100
of the flower.

590
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,940
I know.

591
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,460
I'm sorry for your loss.

592
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,180
I, Ming Yi,

593
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,100
am also a weak girl.

594
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,460
I'm sorry for your loss.

595
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,260
I'm incompetent.

596
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,100
I didn't know

597
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,620
my parents died until today.

598
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,020
I wonder how many innocent people

599
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,180
in the cold water

600
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,620
are like my parents

601
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,820
who were forced to live

602
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,700
in the garden

603
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,420
to pick up toxic water

604
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,420
and die.

605
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,220
Today,

606
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,060
I dare to tell you

607
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,860
that I will pick up medicine to clear the name of Ming Yuan.

608
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,100
Your Majesty,

609
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,420
I was released from the garden.

610
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,380
I was beaten every day

611
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,380
and only got blood on my hands.

612
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,060
I can prove it.

613
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,500
Ming Yi,

614
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,220
don't worry.

615
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,100
I can be your witness.

616
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,540
Your parents will not die in vain.

617
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,420
Trust me.

618
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,340
Uncle Ji,

619
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,380
the big event is coming.

620
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,460
Think it over.

621
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,660
Please be serious.

622
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,820
Did you get caught

623
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,300
and imprisoned

624
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,580
for nothing?

625
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,140
You've been talking about my past behind my back for so long.

626
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,500
Didn't you notice one thing?

627
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,380
I've been in the garden

628
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,980
since the beginning of the Ji clan.

629
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
I dare to ask

630
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,340
what crime I committed.

631
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,300
So,

632
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,740
you've always known

633
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,260
that you're innocent.

634
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,980
Have you ever thought about

635
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,460
taking revenge?

636
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,260
The little fairy Ruoshui

637
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,420
has been in the Ji clan for a long time.

638
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,860
She never thought of taking the blame.

639
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,500
She was encouraged by someone

640
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,020
and she took the risk to stand up.

641
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,740
Han Feng, you seem to have not figured out the point.

642
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,420
Why are you so concerned about

643
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,300
the reason why Ruoshui was accused of being innocent?

644
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,780
Now you've figured out

645
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,700
why Ruoshui was exposed.

646
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,860
Or you want to find out the truth about Chen Yuan?

647
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,620
Uncle,

648
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
I think

649
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,260
you're right.

650
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,860
By the way,

651
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,300
I think there's another question.

652
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,380
There's actually no reason

653
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,480
to let the

654
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,820
boy beings side with you.

655
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,580
I think

656
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,700
your mlod

657
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,420
.)

658
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,820
How can one,

659
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,400
who only has an trick left,

660
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,820
handle such a big matter?

661
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,820
Xfar,

662
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,140
did anyone tell you to report and kill you behind your back?

663
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,300
Just say it today.

664
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,420
I'll ensure that you remain alive.

665
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,740
Say it!

666
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,740
Say it!

667
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,580
Say it!

668
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,040
Nonsense!

669
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,280
Tell us about it!

670
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,820
Speak it out!

671
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,360
Nonsense!

672
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,420
Just say it!

673
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,500
Say it!

674
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,300
Say it!

675
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,340
Say it!

676
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,300
Why don't you say it?

677
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,220
Say it!

678
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,180
You're hurting us!

679
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,820
Say it!

680
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,380
What's the reason?

681
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,980
Say it!

682
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,820
Say it!

683
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,740
Why don't you say it?

684
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,660
Say it!

685
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,460
Say it!

686
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,700
Say it!

687
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,340
Say it!

688
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,780
Actually...

689
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,420
Say it!

690
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,460
You're dead!

691
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,980
Lord!

692
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,620
Lord!

693
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,380
Yan Xiao, look what happened to him.

694
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,020
Yes.

695
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,300
Lord, what's going on?

696
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,300
How is he?

697
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,060
He's too worried.

698
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,580
He'll rest in the palace.

699
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,300
Take him back to the palace.

700
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,100
My husband.

701
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,100
Tian Ji.

702
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,740
If you're worried,

703
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,020
why don't you go with me?

704
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,300
No need, uncle.

705
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,660
Thank you for saving my life.

706
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,940
Since the truth has been revealed,

707
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,820
and you're not well,

708
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,780
I can only temporarily

709
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,020
hold you responsible for the funeral.

710
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,940
I'm here to take the death sentence.

711
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,020
The late emperor will be sentenced

712
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,580
to death

713
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,940
by the thunder of heaven

714
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,980
and his soul will be destroyed.

715
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,180
Great!

716
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,700
Great!

717
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,580
Great!

718
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,220
Yes!

719
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,020
Yes!

720
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,700
Yes!

721
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,420
Yes!

722
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,300
Great!

723
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:05,980
Yes!

724
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,020
Yes!

725
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,980
Yes!

726
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,740
Yes!

727
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,220
Yes!

728
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,660
Great!

729
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,260
Yes!

730
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:10,900
Great!

731
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,860
Thank you for your help, Lord Han.

732
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,140
I'm wronged.

733
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,500
No need.

734
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,700
Don't worry.

735
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,300
I'll let the late emperor help you

736
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,940
and give you justice.

737
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,860
Fairy Ruo Shui.

738
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,340
Who sent you here today?

739
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
Don't be afraid.

740
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,460
I just want to

741
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,420
protect you and the people behind you

742
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,300
better.

743
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,540
Thank you, Lord Han.

744
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,540
But

745
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,620
no one sent me here.

746
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,220
I have to take responsibility for it.

747
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,540
Really?

748
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,860
You've been in the Flower Moon Night for a long time.

749
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,260
Have you ever seen Fairy Ruo Shui

750
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,580
and anyone else?

751
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,580
Flower Moon Night?

752
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,140
There are so many people there

753
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,780
who deserve my respect.

754
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,780
Fairy Ruo Shui.

755
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,260
You're indeed a little familiar.

756
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,940
Besides, I haven't been there for a long time.

757
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,460
Now

758
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,460
I have a reputation.

759
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,220
I have to go there to work.

760
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,900
What do you think?

761
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,500
Lord Han Feng.

762
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,260
If my lord

763
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,140
harasses a fairy

764
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,500
at Flower Moon Night,

765
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,620
you have to tell me.

766
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,540
I must make him look good.

767
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,980
Fairy, you're worrying too much.

768
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,860
I and Lord Ji

769
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,540
are just discussing some official matters.

770
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,180
You two are brave

771
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,940
but you can't break the law.

772
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,740
You still have to

773
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,420
be punished for your behavior.

774
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
I understand.

775
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,900
Lord Ji.

776
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,420
I want to discuss

777
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,580
serious business with you.

778
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,220
Can I have your permission?

779
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,860
Serious business?

780
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,340
Sure finish.

781
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,220
Mm.

782
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,900
Good.

783
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,860
Oh, my goodness.

784
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,300
Fine, you cutie.

785
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,900
You must lick your head when you go out.

786
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,260
And your shoes will drop on the way too.

787
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,380
And you won't Whoa your rest even you get a meal.

788
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,300
Well...

789
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,300
Zero-sounding fairy.

790
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,340
Fairy Mingyi,

791
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,020
Ji Xianjun is a good person.

792
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,260
Don't scold him.

793
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,020
You think he's good?

794
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,140
You've seen him

795
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,220
hugging and hugging

796
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,820
on the night of the flowering moon.

797
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
Don't be silly.

798
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,100
I'm serious.

799
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,660
Don't believe it.

800
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,540
He was so innocent

801
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,700
with those fairies

802
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,980
on the night of the flowering moon.

803
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,580
Nothing happened.

804
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,300
He's a really good person.

805
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,780
Don't misunderstand him.

806
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,900
I didn't.

807
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,060
He lied to you.

808
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,100
You think he's good to you.

809
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,700
He's just using you.

810
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,100
Don't think he really cares about you.

811
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,780
I said, Qi Bai,

812
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,260
you've been drinking tea

813
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,060
over and over again.

814
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,500
I wonder what's wrong

815
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,700
with your so-called big thing.

816
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,700
You're so stupid.

817
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
You're so stupid.

818
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,700
You're so stupid.

819
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
You're so stupid.

820
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,500
What's wrong with you?

821
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,300
Maybe you have a cold.

822
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,420
Let me go back and rest for a while.

823
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,220
We'll talk another day.

824
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:12,820
Wait.

825
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,500
The doctor is here.

826
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,500
I sent someone to get you some medicine.

827
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,100
It's good to cure your cold.

828
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,540
The mask incident

829
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,980
really hurt people.

830
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,500
It's my fault.

831
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,900
I didn't care about the water in the cold.

832
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,820
I'm so sorry for you.

833
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,500
Today is a good opportunity.

834
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,820
I want to

835
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,100
communicate with you more.

836
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,620
In case

837
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,780
such a tragedy happens again.

838
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,100
You're right.

839
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,900
But...

840
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,620
I've been thinking about it

841
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,300
since I left my little fairy.

842
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,660
Wait.

843
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,460
Ji.

844
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,260
This Si Pan is so tired.

845
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,820
He's so tired

846
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,220
that he has to get a certificate.

847
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,420
Those fairy in the flower garden

848
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,020
are so quiet with him.

849
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,140
Is it reasonable?

850
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,460
Is he sick?

851
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,220
I don't think so.

852
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,900
Is he sick?

853
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,900
Forget it. You're young.

854
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,780
Just remember.

855
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,060
Ji Guo Zai

856
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,100
wants to

857
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,500
treat everyone as his pawn.

858
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,220
He wants to trick everyone.

859
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,420
Xiao Qi.

860
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,220
It's a monster.

861
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,460
How could it be?

862
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,140
Someone, there's a monster.

863
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,260
No.

864
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,420
I can't kill him

865
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,620
with my magical power.

866
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980
I have to use my strength.

867
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,420
No.

868
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,740
I can't kill him

869
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,940
with my magical power.

870
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,300
I have to use my strength.

871
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,140
Let's go.

872
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,780
I'll send him down tonight.

873
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,100
Yes.

874
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,580
Ji.

875
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,540
What's happened?

876
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,900
Let's go and see.

877
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,260
Yes.

878
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:24,940
Yes.

879
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
until it becomes soft

880
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,500
It's enough to lie to myself once

881
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,500
Even if I've never been true to myself

882
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,500
From the stars to your heart, how long will it take to have tears?

883
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:30,500
And all the tenderness you gave me is the poison of love

884
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,500
I've healed my pain, only to return your freedom

885
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,500
Once you have love, you're willing to let go

886
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,500
Behind the abyss, I struggle for a long time, I want to ask the sky

887
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:58,500
But this life is always for you, so what if I want to break free?

888
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,500
Fate has never been wrong, the sun will eventually fall

889
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:12,500
I'll fight against all the absurdity

890
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:20,500
From the stars to your heart, how long will it take to have tears?

891
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:27,500
And all the tenderness you gave me is the poison of love

892
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:35,500
I've healed my pain, only to return your freedom

893
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Once you have love, you're willing to let go

894
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:48,500
From the stars to your heart, how long will it take to have tears?
