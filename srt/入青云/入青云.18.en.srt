1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it the heat that will last only in the wind and clouds?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are the warmth engraved in my heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Memories have been built by you

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The hero that I can't forget

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The one that I can't escape from is my love

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Loving you is like a thousand years of long night

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 14

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Are you okay?

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why are you alone?

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Where is Mingyi?

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How is Chusheng?

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
His hidden demon energy has been removed

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But his inner and outer demons are running away

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He will lose his rationality at any time

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Be careful

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mingyi

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm fine

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm fine

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm fine

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm fine

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Mingyi

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Chusheng

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Chusheng

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Wake up

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What's wrong with him?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Chusheng, you are weak now

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You finally let go of your evil dream

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And you are still able to live

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is the evil dream a long-term dream?

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Chusheng told me that he was able to survive in the smoke

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Although it made him feel that he was better off dead

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He thought that because of those weapons and medicine, he was able to barely survive

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But he was able to meet Bo Yulan and saved him

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's okay

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm here

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's okay

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's okay

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's okay

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's okay

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's okay

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's okay

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's okay

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's okay

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's okay

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's okay

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's okay

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's okay

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's okay

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's okay

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's okay

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's okay

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's okay

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's okay

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's okay

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's okay

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's okay

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He woke up

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He finally woke up

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,200
Mo Yang Qiu said Mu Qi Bai's mistake

66
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
caused me to be poisoned by the Yin-Demon.

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,880
Mu Qi Bai should be here soon.

68
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,080
He blamed me for what he said.

69
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,680
I'm fine now

70
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,720
because of you.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
Bu Xiu went to the Dragon Pagoda first.

72
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,200
He delayed the time,

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,240
so I went there.

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,000
We're allies.

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sure I have to persuade the late emperor.

76
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,080
I think

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
a great power

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,920
will rise by an ear not by you.

79
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,320
The day before yesterday in the reincarnation palace,

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,760
everyone said that I was lucky,

81
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,360
but you didn't suspect

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,520
I would divide the influence of the evil

83
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,360
instead of minuscule them.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I didn't use the Yin sign on Mingxian.

85
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
I believe you.

86
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,120
You've entered my Lingxi Jinglang.

87
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,480
Yes.

88
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,480
You knew it?

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,960
Yes.

90
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
I know that the late emperor

91
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,800
hid the dream of the late emperor in Lingxi Jinglang.

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,280
The six realms have been in the dream for a long time.

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,120
You have the chance to get it.

94
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm still Mingxian's biggest opponent.

95
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,600
You have the chance to get rid of me.

96
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
It's a long story.

97
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,720
I was injured yesterday.

98
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,640
But I can feel that

99
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:03,760
it's the spirit of the

100
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,440
Ji Xingyuan.

101
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,960
It's a magic.

102
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
You have the ability to hide it.

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,840
Why didn't you use it before?

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,120
I lied to you.

105
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,440
I was too tired.

106
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,280
So I don't want to lie to you.

107
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,480
Will you lie to me in the future?

108
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,640
Do you really

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,360
love me?

110
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,280
Your Majesty.

111
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,160
Han Feng and Lord Situ are here.

112
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
Mo Xibai is here too.

113
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,160
Do you have the power to see him?

114
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,080
I'll deal with him.

115
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,440
Lord Situ is not active in the palace.

116
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
He is not active.

117
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,600
But as long as it's about Wu Guihai,

118
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
you're always the first one to arrive.

119
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,080
Who is this for?

120
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,320
What are you talking about?

121
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,080
It's the duty of the Bureau

122
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,040
to handle the case.

123
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
No matter what,

124
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,360
I have to investigate it first.

125
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,960
Why do you appear again

126
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
You accused my husband

127
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,160
with a broken jade die

128
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,520
and come here today?

129
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,240
When Chief got angry

130
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,680
Our emperor doubts

131
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,920
anyone isoli robot

132
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,240
The investigation revealed

133
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,400
Now the evidence is confirmed.

134
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,480
Evidence is confirmed?

135
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,360
Then tell me

136
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,960
how to confirm it?

137
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,000
Meng Yang, Qiu Wei, and Ji Bozai

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
planted the Yin-Demon Ji Li.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It spread demon aura all over.

140
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,560
Shouhua and the rest of the rebels

141
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,200
saw it with their own eyes.

142
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
It's so easy to see it.

143
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,920
Do it.

144
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,040
Wait.

145
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
As we all know,

146
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,160
those who keep the demon beast

147
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
will never lose their demon aura.

148
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,840
So let's test it again.

149
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,760
As long as it has no demon aura,

150
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,920
it can prove its innocence.

151
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,680
This Yin-Demon Ji Li

152
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
is the evidence

153
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,040
that the rebels collected

154
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,440
from Shouhua and the rebels

155
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,320
after Ji Bozai died.

156
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,800
The Yin-Demon Ji Li taken from Ji Bozai

157
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,920
can give it to me?

158
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,240
I can make it lose its magic power

159
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,760
and can't test anything.

160
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,720
It disappeared when I took it away.

161
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
I couldn't keep it.

162
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,760
Don't worry.

163
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,360
I'll find a way

164
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,880
to prove Ji Xianjun's innocence.

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,720
Thank you.

166
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,040
How can you prove

167
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,600
that Yin-Demon Ji Li

168
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,240
hasn't been touched?

169
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,880
I'll check it.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,520
Han Feng, please check it.

171
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,960
The one who keeps the demon beast

172
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,160
will never dare to check it.

173
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,160
Si Tu Ling is lying.

174
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,800
Yin-Demon Ji Li.

175
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,840
Is the Yin-Demon Ji Li

176
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,040
really the previous one?

177
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,080
If it's true,

178
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,480
how can you just take it?

179
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Yin-Demon Ji Li can test the demon aura.

180
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,600
But it has no harm.

181
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,840
Of course it can be touched.

182
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,880
Really?

183
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,320
But Han Feng clearly told me

184
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,600
that Yin-Demon Ji Li

185
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,240
can't be touched directly.

186
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,120
So...

187
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,440
Mo Yangqiao.

188
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,240
What's wrong with him?

189
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,840
Mo Yangqiao.

190
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
What's wrong with him?

191
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,440
Mo Yangqiao.

192
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
What's wrong with him?

193
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,960
Mo Yangqiao.

194
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,600
Mo Yangqiao.

195
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
What's wrong with him?

196
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,200
Mo Yangqiao.

197
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,760
Mo Yangqiao.

198
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
What's wrong with him?

199
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,920
Is he having a heart attack?

200
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,520
Mo Yangqiao.

201
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,720
Yan Xiao.

202
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,080
Look at what's wrong with Mo Yangqiao.

203
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,520
I feel that Mo Yangqiao

204
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,720
is about to die.

205
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,560
You should hurry up and check it.

206
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,640
Yes.

207
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,760
Look at his strength.

208
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
He's so good.

209
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,840
Mo Yangqiao.

210
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,600
Mo Yangqiao.

211
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,440
Why didn't the Azeroth faster?

212
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,160
see wild and white?

213
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
Perfect.

214
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
What does it mean?

215
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
It means...

216
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Kill and kill.

217
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Brother Bo,

218
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
what do you mean?

219
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Jin Bo,

220
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
there's a demon on his face.

221
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
It's a demon!

222
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
If His Majesty really brought a demon to life,

223
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
and was attacked by a demon,

224
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
he should have lost his mind

225
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
and be fooled by a demon.

226
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
But now he's awake,

227
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
and he's standing in front of you.

228
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
What else do you have to say?

229
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Isn't it just another time to lure the demon to attack?

230
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I'll come in person.

231
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Jin Bo,

232
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
you're awake.

233
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Jin Bo,

234
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
you're awake.

235
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Jin Bo,

236
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
you're awake.

237
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Jin Bo,

238
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
you're awake.

239
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Jin Bo,

240
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
you're awake.

241
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Jin Bo,

242
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
you're awake.

243
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Jin Bo,

244
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
you're awake.

245
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Jin Bo,

246
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
you're awake.

247
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Jin Bo,

248
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
you're awake.

249
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Jin Bo,

250
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
you're awake.

251
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Jin Bo,

252
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
you're awake.

253
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Jin Bo,

254
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
you're awake.

255
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Jin Bo,

256
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
you're awake.

257
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Jin Bo,

258
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
you're awake.

259
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Jin Bo,

260
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
you're awake.

261
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Jin Bo,

262
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
you're awake.

263
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Jin Bo.

264
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
You're awake.

265
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Jin Bo,

266
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
you're awake.

267
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
.

268
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
You're awake.

269
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Jixian Army even dared to hurl a hawk hood,

270
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
they don't look exactly like事。

271
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,100
Si Tu Ling,

272
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
you dare prank me?

273
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
That hawk hood

274
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
can not detect anything!

275
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm not afraid of death.

276
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,320
You're not afraid of death,

277
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,560
but you're afraid of death.

278
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,280
How come?

279
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,400
Your Highness.

280
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,800
Why is there a demon's mark on Lord Han's body?

281
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,640
Why is there a demon's mark on his body?

282
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,320
Yes.

283
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,160
How come?

284
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,640
Why is there a demon's mark on his body?

285
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,240
There's a demon's mark on his body.

286
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,960
I've released the demon's mark

287
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,680
on my body

288
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,600
from the previous Yin-Demon Pavilion.

289
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,120
I believe that Lord Han

290
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,600
is familiar with this method.

291
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,040
But Lord Han

292
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,760
used a lot of demon's mark.

293
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
So I've been

294
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,800
unable to recover my original appearance.

295
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,880
Everyone saw it.

296
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,000
My husband

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,400
didn't raise a demon beast at all.

298
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,280
The problem is

299
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,720
that it's always this Yin-Demon Pavilion.

300
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Meng Yangqiu was deceived by Lord Han.

301
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,880
In fact,

302
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,800
Lord Han

303
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,760
tampered with this Yin-Demon Pavilion.

304
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,400
If you want to frame me through Meng Yangqiu,

305
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,440
I'm just using the way of the Qi people

306
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,160
to return the body of the Qi people.

307
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,240
If you don't believe me,

308
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,360
why don't Lord Han and I

309
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,120
go to the Yin-Demon Pavilion

310
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,480
to investigate it?

311
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,560
Yes.

312
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,480
Yes.

313
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,360
Let's go and investigate it.

314
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,880
Yes.

315
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,560
Let's go and investigate it.

316
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,080
Yes.

317
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,760
Let's go and investigate it.

318
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,360
Yes.

319
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,840
What?

320
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,400
Lord Han, you don't dare to do it?

321
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,360
Then Lord Han and Lord Ji Xian

322
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,760
please go back to the Yin-Demon Pavilion with me.

323
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,000
I will find out the truth

324
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,480
and find out who has the demon's mark on his body.

325
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
The Bureau of Judicial Review has been enforcing the law.

326
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,160
Lord Han Feng is trying to defy it.

327
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,400
The Immortals are watching.

328
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,760
It's me.

329
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,720
I accidentally killed Lord Ji Xian.

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Please investigate it clearly.

331
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,440
It's all my fault.

332
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,760
His Highness doesn't know anything.

333
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,720
You wanted to kill Ji Bozai?

334
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,160
Since Ji Bozai was sealed by the Immortals,

335
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,840
the Ji Xin Yuan has been in chaos.

336
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,760
So I wanted to use the Yin-Demon Pavilion to test him.

337
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,640
But that Yin-Demon Pavilion

338
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,220
belongs to the first

339
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,760
and I'm afraid it was touched by the Immortals.

340
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,960
It's all because of my negligence

341
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
and it has nothing to do with Lord Han Feng.

342
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,800
Please punish me, Your Highness.

343
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,960
You didn't know it was touched by the Immortals

344
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,800
but you knew you couldn't touch it with your hand.

345
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,560
It's all my fault.

346
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Please investigate it clearly.

347
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,360
Lord Han Feng,

348
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,640
I think you should raise a dog.

349
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,680
Otherwise, it's really useless.

350
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,480
How dare you?

351
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,000
It's my fault.

352
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,840
You raised these

353
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,640
ungrateful dogs.

354
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,840
I was irresponsible

355
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
and you got hurt

356
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,160
and hurt yourself.

357
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,320
Since he has confessed his crime,

358
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,280
please investigate it clearly.

359
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,040
Of course.

360
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,240
Perfect.

361
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,240
Meng Yang Qiu.

362
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,680
He was

363
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,280
the reason of the additional city's Dragon-Devotion.

364
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,880
Take him away.

365
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,920
and would kill me

366
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,400
If this was really true

367
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,140
then we wouldn't have disturbed,

368
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:41,780
Oh, right, the

369
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,460
machine vehicle is innocent,

370
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm sorry machine vehicle now it was our misunderstanding,

371
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,640
our misunderstanding,

372
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,320
The Envoy has to find it,

373
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,960
I will.

374
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,080
I will invite you two

375
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
to come to the coffin ceremony.

376
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,320
Great.

377
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,360
Uncle Xuan.

378
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,120
Yes.

379
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,240
See him off.

380
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,920
Let's go.

381
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,280
The

382
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,200
These people finally left.

383
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,360
How did you suddenly think of

384
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,840
putting the drinking medicine

385
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,720
on Mu Qi Bai?

386
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,760
Si Tu Ling's plan

387
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,000
is just to use the drinking medicine

388
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,280
to solve the problem.

389
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,560
But for the people who want to frame me,

390
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,600
they always have new tricks.

391
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,280
So,

392
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,920
why don't you mix the water

393
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
and they can't do anything to me.

394
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,320
What's wrong with you?

395
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,400
What's wrong with you?

396
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,880
I guess the Flower of the Ghost is back.

397
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,440
The Flower of the Ghost is back.

398
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,440
It's a bear's tail.

399
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,440
Let me show you.

400
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,200
No.

401
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,600
I...

402
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,720
Mu Qi Bai just lost a game.

403
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,840
I guess he will find a way to get it back.

404
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,480
Lord, please go to the Lotus Garden.

405
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,720
I'm going back.

406
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,040
I'll just take a nap.

407
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,720
You should pay attention to the Lotus Garden.

408
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
I'm really sorry, Lord.

409
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,960
I'm sorry.

410
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,160
The Shao Xun has given up.

411
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,320
The Four Rebellions Hall

412
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,800
can only follow the law.

413
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,640
So I'm here to take you away.

414
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,760
What's wrong?

415
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
You see, I'm like this now.

416
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,080
You must be laughing at me.

417
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
It's not necessary.

418
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,920
Let's go.

419
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,440
But Yan Xiao,

420
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,280
I really can't figure it out.

421
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,160
What's the matter?

422
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,560
Ji Bo Zai is innocent.

423
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,080
Han Feng Jun's subordinate wants to frame him.

424
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,960
But why does he want to frame him?

425
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,320
What does Han Feng Jun think?

426
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,960
And...

427
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,600
Tian Ji will never forgive me.

428
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,960
How am I supposed to explain it to him?

429
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,680
Yang Qiu.

430
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,240
How can Tian Ji forgive you?

431
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,320
You and I are all Han Feng Jun's people.

432
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,720
Since we're Han Feng Jun's people,

433
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,960
we're like water and fire to Tian Ji.

434
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm Han Feng Jun's man?

435
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,320
When did I become Han Feng Jun's man?

436
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,320
You've always been.

437
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,120
Why?

438
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,880
I just have a little relationship with him at home.

439
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,720
When Tian Ji was young, I was familiar with him.

440
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,600
He often took me to play with him.

441
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,200
That's how I got to know him.

442
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,440
Isn't Han Feng Jun

443
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,040
a relative of a housekeeper?

444
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,880
So every time you have a meeting,

445
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,000
like a meeting of money and the meeting of the meeting,

446
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,680
you can take me with you.

447
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Why am I...

448
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,000
I seem to be a big man.

449
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,800
So you're also a Han Feng Jun's man?

450
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,040
Let's go.

451
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,720
Yeah.

452
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,400
You were just a little guard.

453
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
Han Feng Jun helped you become a doctor.

454
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,640
No wonder Tian Ji was unhappy every time he saw you.

455
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,880
You have to latest it up.

456
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,080
Exactly.

457
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,920
Yang Qiu.

458
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,180
Do you

459
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,560
practice recently?

460
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,720
Oh, no.

461
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,120
I'm anту I can't get near Han Feng Jun color Grown-up.

462
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,400
Yan Xiao.

463
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,840
Did he give you the color of stone?

464
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,400
Did he let you kill me?

465
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,560
I'm right this time.

466
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,160
I'm your brother.

467
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,360
He let you kill me.

468
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,120
You're not going to follow him like this, are you?

469
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,640
You never thought

470
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,840
I would really kill you?

471
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,360
Of course not.

472
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,880
I don't know you yet.

473
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,120
Although Han Feng Jun was good before,

474
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,040
but now he's so cruel.

475
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,720
You still follow him.

476
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,920
What do you want?

477
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,520
You want to be a doctor, too?

478
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,440
You're really talking about your dreams.

479
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,640
What are you doing?

480
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,720
Han Feng Jun.

481
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I promoted you.

482
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,280
What?

483
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,760
Is this how you protect His Majesty?

484
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,760
You rely on your co-workers?

485
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,160
I would never dare to do that, Han Feng Jun.

486
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,280
Go pick up the books for him.

487
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,320
Yes.

488
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,560
Remember.

489
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,680
No one is allowed to bully Lord Yan Xiao again.

490
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,720
Yes.

491
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,720
Han Feng Jun.

492
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,040
You know me?

493
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,720
The Ji Xing Palace is 9,000 steps away.

494
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,680
I remember everyone's names and backgrounds.

495
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,480
Thank you, Han Feng Jun.

496
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,360
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,240
I'm sorry.

499
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,480
Thank you for your help.

500
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,200
You're in a low position,

501
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,720
but you're still so diligent.

502
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,840
If Ji Xing Yuan's juniors can do that,

503
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,080
I won't worry about them anymore.

504
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,240
In the future, I'll allow you to freely enter the Wolf's World Pavilion

505
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,440
and read the medical books.

506
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,520
I hope one day,

507
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,280
you can get the position of First Immortal.

508
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,680
Han Feng Jun.

509
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,160
My ambition is to make Ji Xing Yuan

510
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,520
no longer bullied.

511
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,640
I hope that the juniors of Ji Xing Yuan

512
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,000
won't be bullied.

513
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,600
You can walk that path

514
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,280
on the Internet.

515
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,480
Right?

516
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,960
I won't let Han Feng Jun down.

517
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,960
I'll go.

518
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,040
Do you have any difficulties?

519
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Why do I have to have difficulties?

520
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,480
Yang Qiu.

521
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,640
Listen to me.

522
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,840
I chose Han Feng Jun.

523
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,960
I just want to make it clear.

524
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,360
Don't be surprised.

525
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
Meng Yang Qiu.

526
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,760
You're from the Nine Immortals.

527
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,520
No matter what,

528
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
you can be a Immortal in Ji Xing Palace.

529
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,680
But what about me?

530
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,280
I'm so ignorant.

531
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,840
No one outside has the right to judge

532
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,960
how I should be promoted.

533
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,040
Only the rich and the poor

534
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,280
can care about my attitude.

535
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,320
Let's go.

536
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,000
Let's go.

537
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,360
Let's go.

538
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,240
Yan Xiao.

539
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,880
Yan Xiao.

540
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,520
Young Master.

541
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,280
Greetings, Han Feng Jun.

542
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,720
It's time to find a chance

543
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,520
to make the God take him down.

544
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Why did you get your hands dirty?

545
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,040
You're old and weak.

546
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,560
Let him go.

547
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,840
God will...

548
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,480
I'll take care of him.

549
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,880
I'll take care of him.

550
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,480
I'll take care of him.

551
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,080
I'll take care of him.

552
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,520
I'll take care of him.

553
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
This is my favorite jade tree.

554
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,960
After he died,

555
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,800
I tried many ways to save him.

556
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,080
But he's weak.

557
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,840
No matter how hard I try to take care of him,

558
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,680
I can't do anything.

559
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,760
I'd rather take him out

560
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,160
and turn him into a foreign tree

561
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,280
with the plants

562
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,600
that can't grow up.

563
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,560
Maybe he can come back to life.

564
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,760
He'll grow up to be a god-given tree.

565
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,920
There must be a way.

566
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,600
If Han Feng Jun wants to save this jade tree,

567
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,160
I'll go back to get it.

568
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,600
Maybe there's still a way.

569
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,800
Even if you're a god-given tree,

570
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,600
you can't solve the problem.

571
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,600
Yan Xiao,

572
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,280
you're the one who has to make the choice.

573
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,400
Do you want to save this person

574
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,720
or tens of thousands of people?

575
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:37,960
The Demon Realm

576
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,640
Lord Ji Xian,

577
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,240
the Demon Realm is constantly deteriorating.

578
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,160
We have to train again as soon as possible.

579
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,920
You were forced to leave the Pass.

580
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,600
If you leave the drinking demon's lair,

581
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,280
your body will become weak.

582
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,600
The demon beasts will easily get you.

583
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,760
You have to keep your nature.

584
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,600
Don't let the God of War down.

585
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,040
Are you really going to train us?

586
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,080
Ji Bu Cai,

587
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,440
I can give you the most powerful power in the world

588
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,920
to make you the best of the six realms.

589
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,720
Let's work together.

590
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,240
King цел

591
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,400
Don't get in the bed, Georgi.

592
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,360
Ming Yu purposefully saved Bu Xiu

593
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,920
The counterattack has only started now.

594
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,960
What a tough opponent.

595
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,520
It's already a good thing

596
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,760
that you didn't get caught by Ji Bo.

597
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,240
It took me a whole day

598
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,760
to cure the counterattack.

599
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,440
Do you think

600
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,800
the more petals fall,

601
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
the more serious it is?

602
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,880
You know that.

603
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,920
Mingyi,

604
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,240
we are going to kill the Beast Army.

605
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,560
But you know the situation now.

606
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
I know.

607
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,200
We don't have much time left.

608
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,720
So,

609
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,120
listen to me carefully.

610
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,800
If anything happens,

611
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,280
you have to break off the main shop and contact with me in advance.

612
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,880
We can live together.

613
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,720
Do you have a conscience?

614
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,000
I treat you as my family.

615
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,320
You treat me as an outsider.

616
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,080
I'm telling you the truth.

617
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm telling you the truth.

618
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,440
Isn't it?

619
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,920
I said just in case.

620
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,200
There's no such thing as just in case.

621
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,600
The main shop is far away from Lianhua.

622
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,600
I sent a prescription to you.

623
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,840
I told my teacher to buy some herbs

624
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,480
and take care of Mingyi.

625
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,320
Here.

626
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,520
Wu Gui is so busy.

627
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,240
He has a visitor again.

628
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,520
I'm going to go to see him.

629
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
I'll go with you.

630
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
I'll go with you.

631
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
I'll go with you.

632
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
I'll go with you.

633
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
I'll go with you.

634
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
I'll go with you.

635
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
I'll go with you.

636
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
I'm coming.

637
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,800
Sister, you spent too much energy yesterday.

638
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,520
I made this jade deer drink.

639
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
I'll take the advantage.

640
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,040
Thank you, Immortal Si Tu.

641
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,640
Since yesterday,

642
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,080
you've helped me twice.

643
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,920
I don't know how to repay you.

644
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
If you're willing,

645
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,280
then let's get married.

646
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
I'm joking.

647
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,440
I won't repay you

648
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,240
for anything I do.

649
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,000
Immortal Si Tu, I...

650
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,200
I just hope

651
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,120
you can come to me

652
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800
when you leave the Ji Bo Village.

653
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,400
Immortal Si Tu,

654
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,200
first of all,

655
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,840
I'm not the person you think I am.

656
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,200
Even if I am,

657
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,240
you don't have to be like this.

658
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,080
Sis.

659
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,080
In the past,

660
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,080
I was walking over a dead end

661
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,040
but I couldn't see any hope.

662
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,480
I could only show up

663
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,640
if I meet you.

664
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,320
What you've done for me

665
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
is more important

666
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,400
than you think of me.

667
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,840
If the two of us

668
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,680
can be together

669
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
for a lifetime...

670
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,720
is more important to me.

671
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,640
This...

672
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,360
This...

673
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,120
Can you leave this hairpin

674
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,520
as a memento?

675
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,680
This is my...

676
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,160
Current boyfriend

677
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,120
Heaven has done everything it could to mend it's ways

678
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:14,140
Has

679
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
faith

680
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,160
He did master the real Lingxi Mirror.

681
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,440
He hid the dream of the Yellow-Birds in it.

682
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,440
That's why Mingying was supposed to marry Ji Bozai

683
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
to get the heart and to communicate with the God.

684
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,440
He also found the dream of the Yellow-Birds hidden in the Lingxi Mirror?

685
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,440
He and Ji Bozai communicated with each other.

686
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,440
But why hasn't he entered the Lingxi Mirror yet

687
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
and got the antidote?

688
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,440
It must be because Ji Bozai is very scheming.

689
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
He hid the dream of the Yellow-Birds in a more secret place.

690
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
There's another possibility.

691
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,440
He's soft-hearted and doesn't want to take the dream of the Yellow-Birds.

692
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
Impossible.

693
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Only those who communicate with each other can enter the Lingxi Mirror.

694
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
His Majesty can't get the dream of the Yellow-Birds for now.

695
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,440
But the bodyguard has already discovered His Majesty's whereabouts.

696
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,440
For His Majesty's safety, I might as well kill him.

697
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,440
He once had feelings for me.

698
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,440
I'll see to it.

699
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
He won't set a trap.

700
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Fu Yan, I don't need you to do this for me.

701
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
This is our fate.

702
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Tomorrow, you'll meet me.

703
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Listen, I'll go to meet him.

704
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
Not you.

705
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
This time, you attacked the Ghost Sea

706
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,440
and you've done nothing.

707
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
If it wasn't for the Situ Ling coming out to mess up,

708
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
he would have done as planned.

709
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,440
The Situ Family has always been loyal to me.

710
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,440
I don't know what's wrong with his son.

711
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,440
But it's a bad thing that happens again and again.

712
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
I've sent someone to investigate.

713
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
Enough.

714
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
You're as stupid as a pig.

715
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Now that things have come to this,

716
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
you still can't tell Situ Ling's identity?

717
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
He...

718
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Leave it to me.

719
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Yes.

720
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
This time, although it's not as I wished,

721
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,440
Yin Yao Ji Li has caused a great deal of harm to Ji Bo Zai.

722
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
He must have restarted the secret passage

723
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
and re-changed the demon source.

724
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
If we can find his hiding place,

725
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
we can definitely break through it.

726
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
You have a plan?

727
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
I do have a plan.

728
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
You know too little about Ji Bo Zai.

729
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
That's why you're making a mistake.

730
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
I hope Your Highness can enlighten me.

731
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Yesterday, Ji Bo Zai was seriously injured.

732
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
His life was not supposed to be able to return.

733
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
But his Silver Dragon

734
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
defeated you all.

735
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Do you know the reason?

736
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Yesterday, I saw a woman with a spiritual vein

737
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
in your mansion.

738
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
She defeated you.

739
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Ming Yi.

740
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
I remember that

741
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Lord Han Feng can use the skill of seduction

742
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,440
to break someone's heart

743
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
and reveal the truth.

744
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Do you know what to do?

745
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Tomorrow, you must lure Ji Bo Zai out.

746
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Look.

747
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
Hurry up.

748
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Look, Miss.

749
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
This is pretty good.

750
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
This is good.

751
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
I want this.

752
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Okay.

753
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Here you go.

754
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
Thank you.

755
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
Come again.

756
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
I didn't expect you to be a martial artist.

757
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
You're quite tough.

758
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
As long as you pretend to be natural

759
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
and lure Ming Yi over,

760
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
it's that simple.

761
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Why do you have to suffer so much?

762
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
It's a dream.

763
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Give it back to me.

764
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Give it back to me.

765
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
What do you want?

766
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Lord Han Feng.

767
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
I'm sorry.

768
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
I'm sorry.

769
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm sorry.

770
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
I'm sorry.

771
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
I'm sorry.

772
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
I'm sorry.

773
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm sorry.

774
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
I'm sorry.

775
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
I'm sorry.

776
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Let me drink.

777
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm sorry.

778
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
I'm sorry.

779
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm sorry.

780
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
I'm sorry.

781
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
I'm sorry.

782
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Please.

783
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
No.

784
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
I'm sorry.

785
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
I'm sorry.

786
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Lord Han Feng.

787
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
I'm sorry.

788
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Fine.

789
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,800
to say these words?

790
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,720
No.

791
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,480
He was bullied by

792
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,920
a few brothers in his family.

793
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,800
I took him to see the marriage meeting

794
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,640
to comfort him.

795
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,600
He probably has a gratitude in his heart.

796
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,120
Looking at the present,

797
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,240
he should have mixed

798
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,200
gratitude and feelings.

799
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,840
He will understand

800
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,720
in a few years.

801
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,400
Didn't you say

802
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,840
you are not Mingxian?

803
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,320
Then he is still so persistent

804
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,040
and helps you over and over again.

805
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,920
He is such a stubborn boy.

806
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,000
What if he can't get over it?

807
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,400
Then I...

808
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,160
I have something to discuss with you, Zhang Tan.

809
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,160
Fu Yue,

810
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,880
arrange someone to put the court to trial.

811
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,720
I'll do it myself.

812
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,060
Check into

813
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,720
I'm afraid

814
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,760
not all of us

815
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,800
will know how bad 18th Prince is.

816
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,840
But since

817
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,460
you feel like

818
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,280
taking risk,

819
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,240
I've decided that

820
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,680
first he

821
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,000
shouldn't make any trouble

822
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,440
for those old brothers.

823
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,360
I've arranged the 사진

824
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,280
for you.

825
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,200
That's thoughtful.

826
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,400
I should report it to my family.

827
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,000
I'll put this just between us two.

828
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,920
I'll be ex particulary on you and the court.

829
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,920
You can kill me

830
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,760
by tricking me here.

831
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,920
You're so blind.

832
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
You're just like your mother

833
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,160
who was born lowly.

834
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,240
You don't deserve to live in this world.

835
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,720
According to the plan,

836
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,600
we'll attack the crown prince

837
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,280
and Han Feng's army.

838
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,240
The day

839
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,520
when you and Ming Yi

840
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,520
were enemies with me,

841
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,520
do you remember?

842
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,160
I saw your face

843
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,440
and I knew you liked him.

844
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,200
You useless thing.

845
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,320
You like a woman with a husband.

846
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,600
I'll let you see

847
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,760
what your lover

848
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,560
will suffer.

849
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,560
Zhao Yu.

850
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Zhao Yu.

851
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
Zhao Yu.

852
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
Zhao Yu.

853
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
Zhao Yu.

854
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,560
What do you want?

855
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
How dare you touch him?

856
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,080
Then you can look forward to it.

857
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
The Clouds In The Sky

858
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,560
When the clouds in the sky

859
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,560
leave me

860
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,560
My heart is my soul

861
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,560
until it becomes weak

862
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
Lying to myself that

863
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,560
one love is enough

864
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,560
One love is enough

865
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,560
One love is enough

866
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,560
One love is enough

867
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,560
One love is enough

868
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,560
One love is enough

869
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Even if no sincerity

870
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,560
is promised

871
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
From the sky to your heart

872
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
there is always a tear

873
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
How long will it take

874
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,560
And your tenderness to me

875
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,560
is all the poison of love

876
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,560
I have healed my pain

877
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,560
I only return your freedom

878
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,560
Love is a courage

879
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,560
I am willing to give up

880
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,560
Behind the abyss

881
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
I struggle for a long time

882
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,560
I want to ask the sky

883
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,560
But this moment

884
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,560
I'm always for you

885
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,560
So what if I'm not

886
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,560
Destiny has never been wrong

887
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,560
The sun will eventually fall

888
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,560
I will listen to your every lie

889
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
From the sky to your heart

890
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
there is always a tear

891
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560
How long will it take

892
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,560
And your tenderness to me

893
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,560
is all the poison of love

894
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
I have healed my pain

895
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,560
I only return your freedom

896
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,560
Love is a courage

897
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,560
I am willing to give up
