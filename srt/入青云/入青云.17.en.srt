1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it the heat that will last only in the wind and rain?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are a warm place that is as deep as the heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Memories have been fighting for you since then

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The hero that I can't forget

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The love that I can't escape from

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I love you so much that I can't forget

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The last step of the Flower Trap

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
is when all the beasts and primates are absorbed into your body

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and you can only subdue them after seven days of training

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But this is also where it's fatal

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The so-called training

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
is actually to suppress and merge each other

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In the end, it's not you who will subdue them

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but they will subdue you

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Ji Bucai, you have been training us all this time

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and you are still being manipulated by the world

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Are the people of the Seven Stars Courtyard really worth it?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, they are

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They are

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Brother

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The seven stars are as weak as a puppet

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Nothing can be changed

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The people of the Flower Trap have your ability

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but they are not asking about your past

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do you still want to hurt yourself for them?

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You are too stupid

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why does Ji Bucai have to be locked up and trained?

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Princess, Ji Bucai is now fine

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He will be released soon

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Mingyi, Ji Bucai has promised me

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He will discuss with me

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why did he hide it again?

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If that's the case

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I really have to suspect him as a ally

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry, Princess

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ji Xianjun didn't mean to hide it

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but this matter really involves too much

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Please trust him again

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I heard about the Princess's case in the Flower Trap

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I didn't expect the Princess to stabilize the situation in this way

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's all thanks to you

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What Sun Liao did was obviously done by Uncle

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Including the last time he was in trouble with you

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The purpose was to get rid of Ji Bucai's fighting identity

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ji Bucai was born to be a god because of the battle in the Seven Stars Courtyard

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If he doesn't work for the Flower Trap anymore

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't think I have anything to worry about

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ji Bucai used to love fighting alone

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He was not serious in the Shouhua Pan Palace

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
When Sun Liao provoked him

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
the whole Shouhua Pan Palace was really dissatisfied with Ji Bucai

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The Princess had to send someone

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
to temporarily abolish Ji Bucai's position as a war guest

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
so that he could suppress everyone

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The Princess simply gave this position to Sun Liao

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He was a war guest and was very popular

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He even used Han Fengjun's plan to fool the people

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You don't know how much I have to face Sun Liao

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I know

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I understand

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I understand everything

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Can you tell me when he will be released?

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's okay to fight with Sun Liao

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If the Seven Stars Courtyard is in trouble

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't handle it

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Besides, it's because of Ji Bucai's appearance

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that the Seven Stars Courtyard saw hope

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The fighters who participated in the training this year

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
are many times older than before

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It can even be said that

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
they came because they admired Ji Bucai

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Mingyi

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What should I do about the disappointment

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
of these people to Ji Bucai?

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hold on

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What's wrong?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm too tired

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can't do it anymore

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Xiao Chen Xi

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Your cultivation is not good

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
As you wish

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Today everyone

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
will be killed

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Everyone

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
will be killed

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Everyone

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Everyone

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Everyone today

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
will be trained for an hour

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's right

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's right

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't want to live

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's right

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's right

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Get up

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It has nothing to do with you

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's him who wants to be the emperor

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Zunzhe, please

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Zunzhe

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's still not dawn yet

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have already started training them

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If this continues

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We will definitely be able to hold the Star Cloud Conference

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Immortal Liao is really capable

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I just let you be a war guest

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This Shouhua Fat Palace is in a daze

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I still have to work today

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's too noisy outside

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why don't you rest first

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Zunzhe

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Who told you to train so early

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Who

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Who

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Isn't it you

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You shut up

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Everyone heard it clearly

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Dissolve

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
All disbanded

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't understand any rules

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What if you find Zunzhe

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll do it

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Done

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Zunzhe

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Uncle Ji

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Really not as good as you

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
When my husband wakes up

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I must tell him everything you do

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I believe my husband is also willing

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hand this Star Cloud Conference

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
To the real excellent person

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Zunzhe

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Sun Liao Wu Du

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I just move

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Who

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Who did it

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't let me catch you

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Otherwise, I will not peel your skin

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Pull your blood

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hide

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did you do it

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Sun Xiong

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What happened

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Wait

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sun Xiong

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You are

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is the water of five poisons

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Five poisons

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Will make the whole body and skin rot and die

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Will it rot

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Will

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What to do

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't worry, Sun Xiong

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I just have the antidote

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
As long as you go

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Just eat it

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's inevitable that the six meridians will be weak

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Can only hold the bed or stand

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Just

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Can't walk

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why didn't you say it earlier

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hard to understand

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You see

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Smart

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm not a man

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm not a man

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's not right

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Then

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
cheap

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
B Robert

185
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Can do it

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
really

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
hot

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How goes

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So hot

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The dried meat on the top

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This slowly

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,520
to find the entrance of Lingxi Pavilion.

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,640
This is hard to find in the whole of Yuchong.

196
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,240
How did you get it?

197
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,240
What's going on?

198
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,000
I got the news from the Flower Moon Night.

199
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
So I went to the Mammoth Forest

200
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
and found this.

201
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,880
I mean your hand.

202
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,840
The locals found it and I got hurt.

203
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,320
Look, it's almost healed.

204
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,960
The news that the Empress Dowager has no child yet

205
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,560
is that Sun Liao is unwell.

206
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
It's said that you haven't been able to sleep for three days.

207
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,240
Maybe she's got a bad stomach.

208
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,080
A few days ago, Sun Liao was in a good mood.

209
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,480
The local people said that Princess Tian Ji admired her

210
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,080
and wanted to choose her as the Princess Consort.

211
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,560
She was in the street for a few days.

212
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,680
It's inevitable that she's not in good health.

213
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,200
Tian Ji admired her?

214
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,120
She believed such a lie?

215
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,080
She's so stupid.

216
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
She thought that Tian Ji was still that little girl

217
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,680
who could be fooled by you?

218
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,360
Do you think Sun Liao is not a good person

219
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,600
and is as stupid as Sun Liao?

220
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,360
You can't tell that Sun Liao went to the Shouhua's palace

221
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,040
to look for her.

222
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,960
I just believe that

223
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,560
even if Sun Liao was fooled by the Princess's scheme,

224
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,480
she still did her best to fulfill the order of the Prince.

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,440
She didn't interfere easily.

226
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,120
But I didn't expect that she's so impetuous.

227
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,880
Yan Xiao.

228
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,480
Do you know what your shortcomings are?

229
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
I'm not talented.

230
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,600
Please give me some advice.

231
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,640
Others are just a black heart

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,040
who is not loyal to morality.

233
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,400
But you are the opposite.

234
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,240
You seem to be not good at all

235
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,520
just to get the throne.

236
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,600
Yan Xiao.

237
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,360
You want too much.

238
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
I'm not a bad person.

239
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,640
I lost my conscience

240
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,440
to exchange it for the bargaining chip.

241
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,600
If you can't do it,

242
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,880
it's useless to me.

243
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,440
I'll have to let Count Ji

244
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,760
accompany me with these flowers and plants.

245
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,560
It's the fourth day.

246
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Count Ji.

247
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,360
Are you okay?

248
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,480
The Demon Water will cut off the most painful memory in your heart

249
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,400
and force you to enter the Star Demon.

250
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,000
You must stick to your heart and never move.

251
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,880
If the God's Will is taken by the Star Demon,

252
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,840
you will lose yourself completely

253
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,240
and be poisoned by the Demon Beast.

254
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,360
What if when you die,

255
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,080
the world expert

256
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,880
갔 Ihnen

257
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:23,380
and now I was just about to

258
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,520
even be a Black Heart?

259
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,680
My heart was like that.

260
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,880
Can you see it?

261
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,080
You used to be

262
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,520
a good kid in the tower of death?

263
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,160
Spill the kernel

264
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,800
and crush the pissed out important points in

265
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, have some drinks.

266
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,400
Anytime.

267
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,200
I am good with drinks.

268
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,200
Don't quantities.

269
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,600
As you wish.

270
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,000
Don't be afraid.

271
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,160
I think that

272
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,960
you are the same as my son.

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,360
He was ten years old

274
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,160
and ran away from home

275
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,560
He was beaten to death.

276
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Your hand

277
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,080
looks a bit like him.

278
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,080
When he was dead,

279
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,040
he had a bun in his hand.

280
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,960
His hand

281
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,920
had been trampled on,

282
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,360
so badly that

283
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,800
I could no longer stand up,

284
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,880
holding onto him.

285
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,840
I've tried my best

286
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,240
to even split open thesur Witch.

287
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,040
This is how he looked like

288
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,640
in his colors.

289
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,960
I can't even touch my mother's face.

290
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,560
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,760
My hands are too dirty.

292
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,800
You must be hungry.

293
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,880
Eat some.

294
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,360
It's okay.

295
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,600
Don't worry.

296
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Is it good?

297
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,240
Eat slowly.

298
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,800
I'm sorry.

299
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,400
Can you leave me a handprint?

300
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,320
I want to keep a memory.

301
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,960
If you don't want to,

302
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
forget it.

303
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,680
Wait.

304
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,280
Don't wipe it.

305
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,960
What will you do after wiping it?

306
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,080
Thank you.

307
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,800
Thank you.

308
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,880
I've made up the handprint for everyone.

309
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,160
Only your handprint is so dirty.

310
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,760
How dare you hit me?

311
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,720
You're so stubborn.

312
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,080
Look at it yourself.

313
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,000
How dare you leave a handprint?

314
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,200
You're too arrogant.

315
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,120
I'll kill you today.

316
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,920
Mu Ke.

317
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,240
Er Yang.

318
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,560
The people who train medicine

319
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,960
never come back alive.

320
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
I can't watch you die.

321
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,280
I can only find you a scapegoat.

322
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,920
If you offend Jing,

323
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,440
the one who is chosen to be a doctor

324
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,440
must be him.

325
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,520
Lord Houchao.

326
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,560
Where are the people I asked for?

327
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,080
Here.

328
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,000
Here.

329
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,800
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,240
I'm sorry, kid.

331
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,160
You're not my son anymore.

332
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,520
Don't believe anyone else anymore.

333
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,400
Qi P진.

334
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,040
Change a side?

335
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,800
Choose a side.

336
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,240
What does he mean by that?

337
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
Jose partes irgendwo�igoo.

338
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,000
You know I neverSO much a Нique.

339
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,200
And whereas you know money,

340
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,880
I know the pride.

341
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,960
I know the pride.

342
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,440
I've already abandoned you!

343
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Ji Bo Zi!

344
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
I told you to be lazy!

345
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,800
I told you to be lazy!

346
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
You're really lazy!

347
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,800
What's wrong?

348
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,200
Hurry up!

349
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,160
Hurry!

350
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,600
This is the last step.

351
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,760
You're all lazy!

352
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,480
Hurry!

353
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Catch him!

354
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Don't let him escape!

355
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Don't run!

356
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Don't let him escape!

357
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Catch him!

358
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Hurry up!

359
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Don't run!

360
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
He's escaped!

361
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Run!

362
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Run!

363
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
Why aren't you running?

364
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Little rabbit!

365
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
I'll kill you today!

366
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Slow down!

367
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Slow down!

368
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Hurry!

369
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
This is how to 210 sure is!

370
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
This is how to 210 sure is!

371
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:16,280
Dashing distance between a

372
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
That's it!

373
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
See?

374
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,280
This is the way to survive in this world.

375
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,280
Only revenge, only stepping on them,

376
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,280
can you not be bullied by anyone.

377
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,280
We have the most powerful power in this world.

378
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,280
With us, you can do anything.

379
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,280
Ji Bozai, let's be one with us.

380
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,280
We can give you everything you want.

381
00:22:52,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Let's achieve the goal of the six realms together.

382
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Little niece, you're finally here.

383
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,280
These days, Ji Bozai has never been willing to show himself.

384
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Everyone in Shouhua's rebel group is eager to see him.

385
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,280
I was thinking that you're just a little fairy sitting here.

386
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,280
I've really made it too hard for you.

387
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Now, I've come to ask for an order.

388
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,280
I've helped you take down the burden of Shouhua's rebel group.

389
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
You can rest assured to be a free princess.

390
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Isn't that better?

391
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Read it out. Let everyone hear it.

392
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
The divine order.

393
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Shouhua's rebel group is respected.

394
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
It's not right to say that...

395
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
You've been sleeping for days.

396
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Han Fengjun can get the order to take down my status.

397
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
You really make me feel honored.

398
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,280
I should go to the palace to see you.

399
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,280
To confirm.

400
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Little niece, you know that.

401
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,280
You're not well. You can't...

402
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Han Fengjun is here for the palace affairs.

403
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Why do you keep calling me your niece?

404
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Are you trying to mix the palace affairs with private affairs?

405
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,280
You keep emphasizing that I'm just a child.

406
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
So that everyone in Shouhua's rebel group

407
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,280
will not trust me.

408
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Han Fengjun said that

409
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,280
you're sick and sleeping again.

410
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
But you can see him.

411
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Why don't you let Han Fengjun

412
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,280
take me to see you?

413
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Let's wait here in Ziwei Hall.

414
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,280
When you wake up, we'll decide.

415
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
What do you think?

416
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
You're smart.

417
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
If your position in Shouhua's rebel group

418
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
can be as good as that,

419
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
you won't be able to control Ji Bozai.

420
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
He'll do whatever he wants.

421
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Shouhua's rebel group will be restless.

422
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Do you think you're doing a good job?

423
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,280
If I can invite Ji Bozai,

424
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Han Fengjun will think

425
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,280
I can take the position of Shouhua's rebel group.

426
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Of course.

427
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
Who said I can't invite him?

428
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
I didn't expect that

429
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Qi Bai is so devoted to me.

430
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Princess Tianqi, this is your fault.

431
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
If you had told me earlier,

432
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I would have come earlier.

433
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,280
I just stayed at home for a few days.

434
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Qi Bai misses me so much.

435
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Princess,

436
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
it takes seven days to train the demon source.

437
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,280
But Ji Bozai will do his best.

438
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Five days to complete.

439
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,280
I won't give Mu Qi Bai

440
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
any chance to take Shouhua's rebel group.

441
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Okay, okay.

442
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
Okay, okay.

443
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
With my cultivation,

444
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
it won't take long

445
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
to train all the demons and beasts.

446
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
You still want to stop me?

447
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
You're not worried?

448
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
With you here,

449
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
I won't worry.

450
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Let's go.

451
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
In the past five days,

452
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,280
my husband has been in seclusion

453
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
to practice cultivation.

454
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
As we all know,

455
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
cultivation is a struggle on the battlefield.

456
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
It's hard to go further

457
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
if you want to go further.

458
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
In the six realms,

459
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,280
there are no ones who can break through the barrier.

460
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Immortal Ji has been working hard.

461
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
It's hard to break through the barrier.

462
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
You can only break through it with one step.

463
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,280
We respect you so much.

464
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Yes, we do.

465
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
You're so good.

466
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Immortal Ji is always cautious.

467
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
He didn't make any progress before.

468
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
He told me to keep it a secret.

469
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Now he's in seclusion for five days.

470
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
He made a breakthrough.

471
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
He came to Shouhua's palace right away

472
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
to accept the new gift.

473
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
So today,

474
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,280
I'll ask Immortal Ji to take the throne.

475
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
You can ask him.

476
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
He won't hide it.

477
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Congratulations, Immortal Ji.

478
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Congratulations.

479
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Congratulations.

480
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
Go and ask him.

481
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Go and ask him.

482
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
Go and ask him.

483
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
Go and ask him.

484
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
Go and ask him.

485
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Go and ask him.

486
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Go and ask him.

487
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Immortal Ji, look at me.

488
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Immortal Ji, I haven't been able to do it for days.

489
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Help me look at it.

490
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
There's mine.

491
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
I don't know when I can get to the next level.

492
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
I haven't seen it either.

493
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Go and ask him.

494
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Go and ask him.

495
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Go and ask him.

496
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
What should we do?

497
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Go and ask him.

498
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
Go and ask him.

499
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Everybody, move aside.

500
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
Go and ask him.

501
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Go and ask him.

502
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Go and ask him.

503
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Go and ask him.

504
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Go and ask him.

505
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
Although I have some respect for you,

506
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,280
I'm still reluctant to change the waistband in advance.

507
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Don't worry.

508
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
You won't die.

509
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
I see.

510
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Help me to help Tian Ji.

511
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Brother Ji,

512
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
we finally get you back.

513
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
You must take us with you more in the future.

514
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Oh, Brother Ji,

515
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I have a good baby here.

516
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
I hope I can give you a good life

517
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
and give you some good luck.

518
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Yin-Yao Ji Li.

519
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
Yin-Yao Ji Li.

520
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
I'm going to ask for help.

521
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Do you know that a few days ago,

522
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
there were monsters in Ji Xing Yuan?

523
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Ji Bocai

524
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,280
is really that kind of person.

525
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
You're right.

526
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
You're right.

527
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
You're right.

528
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
You're right.

529
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
You're right.

530
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
You're right.

531
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
You're right.

532
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
You're right.

533
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
You're right.

534
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
You're right.

535
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
You're right.

536
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
Your Highness.

537
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
This is...

538
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Yin-Yao Ji Li.

539
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
This is too sensitive.

540
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
You must keep it well.

541
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Find a chance

542
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
to let Ji Bocai open it.

543
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
After that,

544
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
we will know

545
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
whether it is a blessing

546
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
for Tian Ji

547
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
or a blessing

548
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
or a misfortune.

549
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
Qi Bocai.

550
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
There's a demon!

551
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Why isn't it opening?

552
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Where is it?

553
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
It's like this.

554
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
What should we do?

555
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Move aside.

556
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Move aside.

557
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Qi Bocai.

558
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
Your Highness, don't worry.

559
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
I've put the demon aura

560
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,280
into Yin-Yao Ji Li.

561
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
Even if Ji Bocai

562
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
can train it in advance,

563
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
it's still not stable.

564
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
With the demon aura,

565
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
we can get the demon source out.

566
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
With the power of the demon aura,

567
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
we can get the demon source out.

568
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280
Is Ji Bocai

569
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
trying to change the demon beast?

570
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
Demon?

571
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
It's obvious that

572
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
the demon beast killed someone

573
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
in the Sacred Star Palace.

574
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
It's the demon aura.

575
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
How could it be fake?

576
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
I thought you would be safe.

577
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
I didn't expect

578
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,280
you were really related to the demon beast.

579
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Ji Bocai, you...

580
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
Don't come over.

581
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Where is it?

582
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Where is it?

583
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Tian Ji,

584
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
we've all been fooled by Ji Bocai.

585
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
He's been changing the demon beast.

586
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
This must be true.

587
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
What is it?

588
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
It's the Sword of the Seven Seas.

589
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
It's him.

590
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
He's really changing the demon beast.

591
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
He's changing the demon beast.

592
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
Idiot!

593
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
If Ji Bocai changes the demon beast,

594
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
there are many ways to avoid you.

595
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Why bother coming to Shouhua Pavilion today?

596
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
But the demon aura just now means...

597
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
It means someone is trying to frame Ji Bocai.

598
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
This...

599
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Frame him?

600
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:35,280
minute

601
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Mingyi, calm down.

602
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
Now that you're doing your best

603
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
to go to the Spiritual Heart Well,

604
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
you'll know

605
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
Long ago what is in the place of the Spirit Eye.

606
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Ji Bocai is so strong in the spiritual power.

607
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
He will be okay.

608
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Mingyi.

609
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,920
I can't believe I can get in.

610
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,520
Is he dying?

611
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,160
Qi Huo Zai.

612
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:08,840
Qi Huo Zai.

613
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,360
Be careful.

614
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,880
Wu Xiu.

615
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,080
You're also affected by the Yin-Demon Pavilion.

616
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,600
Qi Huo.

617
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,520
Don't you recognize us?

618
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,640
Calm down.

619
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,920
Jiu Long Ge.

620
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,520
I'm here.

621
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,360
I'm here.

622
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,160
I'm here.

623
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,920
I'm here.

624
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,640
I'm here.

625
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,360
I'm here.

626
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,080
I'm here.

627
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,840
I'm here.

628
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,600
I'm here.

629
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,400
I'm here.

630
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,400
Long... Long Ge.

631
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,600
Qi Huo Zai.

632
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,640
Qi Huo Zai.

633
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,000
Qi Huo Zai.

634
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,360
The Yin-Demon Pavilion is causing

635
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,520
a lot of damage to your body.

636
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,640
You must dig it out.

637
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,680
Otherwise, the magic of the flower and demon will be ruined.

638
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Your body can't use the spirit vein.

639
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,280
Er Qi.

640
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,400
Help me.

641
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,280
Together.

642
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,240
Hurry up.

643
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,840
Oh no.

644
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,080
When Ji Bo Zai was planted with the Yin-Demon Pavilion,

645
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,880
he didn't shoot the arrow.

646
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,600
This thing is too deep.

647
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,000
If we dig it out,

648
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,440
even if Ji Bo Zai doesn't die,

649
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,400
he will be skinned.

650
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,920
Ji Bo Zai really practiced the spirit vein of the body.

651
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,720
He hid the Yellow-Lighting Dream in here.

652
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,560
This should be the entrance.

653
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,920
But if the spirit vein

654
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,640
is not the person,

655
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,120
only the one who has the same spiritual sense with him can enter.

656
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,760
So Ming Yu married him

657
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,040
to get the heart

658
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,720
for the Yellow-Lighting Dream.

659
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,880
That's great.

660
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,360
Sister doesn't really like him.

661
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,800
Anyway,

662
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,240
I will do my best to help sister achieve her goal.

663
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,960
There is nothing else to do.

664
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,560
Ji Bo Zai.

665
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,980
Uncle Ji

666
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,740
Uncle Ji

667
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,140
Uncle Ji

668
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,220
Uncle Ji, where are you going

669
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,980
He wants to go to Dragon Pond

670
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,380
Good for no good

671
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,660
The demon is stable now.

672
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,500
I'll go to Buxiu.

673
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,300
Take care of him.

674
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,180
Your Majesty,

675
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,580
all the guards have been gathered.

676
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,260
We can go to the Wu Gui Sea to get them.

677
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,980
The dragon!

678
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,420
That silver dragon

679
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,140
is the beast of Ji Bozai.

680
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,980
Do you want to stall Ji Bozai?

681
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,500
You're so arrogant.

682
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,860
Soldiers,

683
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,540
in order to stop us from

684
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,540
killing the demon beast,

685
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,540
Ji Bozai has driven the beast away.

686
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,980
The guard of the Starland is here.

687
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,380
Kill him for me.

688
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,980
Lian Xuan.

689
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,820
Master is in danger.

690
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,620
Present ourmaster.

691
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,740
Here.

692
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,060
So many people.

693
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,940
Do 끝났

694
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,080
the power

695
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,860
of the Abbe,

696
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:22,600
that was

697
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,280
Not even the camp ghost can get close to him.

698
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Sister, let me help you.

699
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Jinxiu!

700
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Sister.

701
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Shh.

702
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Sister, you've used up too much energy.

703
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
Let me take you to the hospital.

704
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
I'm fine.

705
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
I'll take you to the hospital.

706
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
I'll take you to the hospital.

707
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Han Feng Jun accused Ji Xian Jun of changing his monster.

708
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
You don't want to be against him.

709
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
You have to help me.

710
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Sister is protecting Ji Bo.

711
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Isn't it just believing that he didn't change his monster?

712
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
You believe him.

713
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
I believe him.

714
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Because I know that sister

715
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,600
will never be someone who is dependent on the power of the monster.

716
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
If someone makes a mistake,

717
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,600
sister will definitely not be able to tolerate him.

718
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Sister, you believe me.

719
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Let me take you to the hospital.

720
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Thank you.

721
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
I'm really fine.

722
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
I'll go see how Ji Xian Jun is.

723
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Be careful.

724
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
I'm fine.

725
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
I'm fine.

726
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm fine.

727
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
I'm fine.

728
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
I'm fine.

729
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm fine.

730
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
I'm fine.

731
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
I'm fine.

732
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
I'm fine.

733
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
I'm fine.

734
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
I'm fine.

735
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
I'm fine.

736
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,600
I'm fine.

737
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm fine.

738
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I'm fine.

739
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
I'm fine.

740
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
I'm fine.

741
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
I'm fine.

742
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
I'm fine.

743
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I'm fine.

744
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
I'm fine.

745
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
I'm fine.

746
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
I'm fine.

747
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
I'm fine.

748
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
I'm fine.

749
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I'm fine.

750
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
I'm fine.

751
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
I'm fine.

752
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
I'm fine.

753
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
I'm fine.

754
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
I'm fine.

755
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
I'm fine.

756
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
I'm fine.

757
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
I'm fine.

758
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
