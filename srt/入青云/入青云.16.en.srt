00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 15

2
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,600
You don't have to waste your energy for me.

3
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,120
It's not worth it.

4
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,840
I used Ruoshan.

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,040
I used her

6
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,880
to vent my hatred.

7
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,240
Then I just thought about how to get rid of her.

8
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,520
I thought

9
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,680
as long as I sent her away,

10
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,520
I would be a man of my word.

11
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,280
I didn't care about her death.

12
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,960
No.

13
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
It's not like that.

14
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,280
Uncle Xi.

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
Mu Qi Bai.

16
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
The people who used her to raise the Demon King

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
are all my friends.

18
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,360
They were all caught by me

19
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,160
and sent to the court.

20
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,280
Many of them are old, weak, and rich.

21
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,440
Even...

22
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,440
Even those who are younger than me

23
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,600
have no chance.

24
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,040
They are all innocent.

25
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,480
Many of them

26
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,600
were caught by mein old master.

27
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,440
And then

28
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:53,080
I properly became aJewn Wu Lai Juice DO

29
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,560
I...

30
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,960
If I didn't overtirk her,

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
whether they and Ruo Shui

32
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,680
could survive.

33
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,320
But...

34
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,840
But...

35
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,040
But they are all dead.

36
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,560
I got them into trouble.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,080
It's not your fault.

38
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,640
Yes.

39
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,120
You can't blame them

40
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
for their death.

41
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,640
It's not your fault.

42
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,560
I found the dream.

43
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,480
But I can't get it

44
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,840
after it's in the blood.

45
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Blood?

46
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,440
Then only it can end.

47
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,520
It seems that Uncle Ji is still

48
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,840
prepared for you.

49
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,040
Then we...

50
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,040
Mingyi, why are you crying?

51
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,200
Erqi,

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
I thought

53
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
when I found

54
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,760
the trace of the dream,

55
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,280
I should be happy.

56
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,000
I should forget

57
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,680
that he was here.

58
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,600
But actually...

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,040
That's all.

60
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
Erqi,

61
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,680
there's the most important thing.

62
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,200
We have to eliminate the demon lord

63
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,280
and deal with Mu Qi, right?

64
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,840
What about you?

65
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,920
We can steal the dream

66
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,720
and get rid of your poison.

67
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,080
Then we can survive, right?

68
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
Erqi,

69
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,040
if it's you,

70
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,280
a living bad guy

71
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
and a dead good guy,

72
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,320
which one would you choose?

73
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,040
Mingyi,

74
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,800
I always want you to be

75
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,000
a good guy who never dies.

76
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,880
What do you mean by that?

77
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,440
You're not a good guy.

78
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Even your teeth are lost.

79
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,200
You can't even eat fish.

80
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,040
I'll ask if you'd choose it.

81
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,520
Just think it over.

82
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,800
You have to promise me this?

83
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:19,800
the

84
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
You lost control of Chen Yuan.

85
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
This is only temporary.

86
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Chen Yuan is seemingly sealed by the Si Pan Tang.

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
But no one knows that the Shiling tree is in conjunction with Chen Yuan.

88
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I haven't been out of the house for several days.

89
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I haven't had a monster.

90
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,700
So don't worry.

91
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,240
In ten days,

92
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,080
we'll be legacy.

93
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,880
Han Feng Jun,

94
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,840
you made a mistake.

95
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,080
You should be more worried about something not us.

96
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,720
If it's not Chen Yuan and the Fuhua tonics,

97
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,480
you have no chance.

98
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,920
I was too careless.

99
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
But all this

100
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,280
is because of An三.

101
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,600
You had said

102
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I came here this time

103
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
for the sake of Count Ji.

104
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Is the dream of Huang Liang

105
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
really in his hands?

106
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Count Ji

107
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
has plotted against my two men.

108
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
All of this

109
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
is to avenge Bo Yulan.

110
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
His relationship with the Doctor

111
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
must be very important.

112
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
You didn't answer my question directly.

113
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
It seems that you really don't know

114
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
where Huang Liang's dream is.

115
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I really suspect that

116
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,600
you also want to protect Count Ji

117
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
and let him one day

118
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
take over the Qingyun Conference

119
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
and become the No. 1 in the six realms.

120
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Let your Ji Xingyuan

121
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
completely get rid of the bamboo forest.

122
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I have no second thoughts about the bamboo forest.

123
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Even if you have, it's useless.

124
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Who is the winner of the Qingyun Conference?

125
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
I can't turn it over.

126
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Does Count Ji know

127
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
the existence of the Beast Army?

128
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I haven't found out yet.

129
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
This place is so bad.

130
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Even the boat can't move.

131
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Young Master.

132
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I still have to trouble Han Feng

133
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
to add his own strength.

134
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Yes.

135
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
In less than ten days,

136
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
the Beast Army will be completed.

137
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
We don't have much time left.

138
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Everyone thinks that

149
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
the city of Chenyuan that the Hall of Judicial Review is in charge of

150
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
is the most vicious place to commit the crime.

151
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
But the poisonous gas here is full.

152
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
No one is involved.

153
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I have thought about using this place to make medicine.

154
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
But Yin Medicine only made Li Hentian.

155
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
He opened the trap to Chenyuan

156
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
through the command letter.

157
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
He turned Chenyuan

158
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
into his own medicine.

159
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
The gas around here

160
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
is not only suitable for making medicine,

161
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
but also for the survival of the beast.

162
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
That's why Mu Ji Bai

163
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
chose to bring back the beast in the town.

164
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
He was afraid that you innocent people

165
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
would arrest him and make him do things.

166
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Their punishment

167
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
has never changed.

168
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
They caught the orphaned widow

169
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
and the old man to the prison.

170
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
They died.

171
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
No one was willing to help them.

172
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
That's why they were always in the place of the people like me.

173
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
The people who died without asking for money.

174
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Because for them,

175
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
people like us

176
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
are the most useful.

177
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Yin Medicine, you said that

178
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
if you want to completely eliminate

179
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
the demon king who hasn't been trained yet,

180
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
you can make yourself a place of medicine

181
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
and collect the demon source of the demon king

182
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
to train the flowers.

183
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Tell me.

184
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
How should this medicine

185
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
be used?

186
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
To do this,

187
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
you need a powerful magic power

188
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
to make the medicine.

189
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Leave this to me.

190
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
The late emperor is the fighter of the Heart-gathering Abyss.

191
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
There can't be any mistakes.

192
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I've promised the late emperor

193
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
that I'd like to be the flower of medicine.

194
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
You've said that

195
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
only those with strong magic power

196
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
can succeed.

197
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I...

198
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
I've seen you practice magic.

199
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Your spiritual power is limited.

200
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Even if you have a spiritual vein,

201
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
you can't succeed.

202
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
That's why

203
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I should be the flower of medicine

204
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
to keep the strongest power among us.

205
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
As long as you can make it,

206
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I'll be able to make it.

207
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
I'll be able to make it.

208
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,400
I'm the most powerful

209
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
in the palace.

210
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
As long as the late emperor is alive,

211
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Mu Ji Bai will definitely make some moves.

212
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
If you also get hurt,

213
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
how can we deal with

214
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
those behind him and him?

215
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm just a flower of medicine,

216
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
so how can I be hurt?

217
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
But you...

218
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
It's settled.

219
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
To be a flower of medicine,

220
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
there are three steps

221
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
that are more dangerous

222
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
in the future.

223
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,880
to form a unit.

224
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,920
The second step

225
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,920
is to suck the monster into the unit.

226
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,200
Then it will form a demon source in the body.

227
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,360
The third step

228
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,040
is to form an enemy

229
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,400
and live with the demon source.

230
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
It will be a lotus.

231
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,080
This is the first step.

232
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,040
The Immortal will use all his power

233
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
and his body will be weak.

234
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,840
Remember not to let him die.

235
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,520
Why does Count Ji really want to be the Flower Demon?

236
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,360
Is he not happy with it

237
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
or is he reluctant to let it go?

238
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,080
He is now in the Lingxi Jing

239
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,040
and is practicing in seclusion.

240
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,280
But he is not responsible for me.

241
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,360
He said

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,280
he was not happy with it

243
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,360
and he was more reluctant

244
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
to let it go.

245
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,840
He thinks that it is not important for me now.

246
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,080
He has to pass the first step first.

247
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,760
This medicine

248
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,320
can help him heal his wounds.

249
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,120
I have to make some more tonics

250
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,080
to help him maintain his strength.

251
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,280
Let's do these first.

252
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Si Pan, it's so late.

253
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,880
Why don't you go back and rest?

254
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,160
The other brothers have already left.

255
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,400
You go back first.

256
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,840
I'll leave after I finish this book.

257
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,680
Yes.

258
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,320
Yes.

259
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,760
Long time no see,

260
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,960
my dear brother.

261
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,100
Hello?

262
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,040
You have been

263
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,320
wearing neither the Hawaiian nor the Cold-blooded Ghost-ushing watery nailed hair.

264
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,080
Youlaugh at me

265
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,640
due to Festering Time

266
00:16:47,680 --> 00:17:05,980
In addition, you still take over your political status

267
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,580
I can't be the Seven Marquis in this life.

268
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,620
Since I'm here,

269
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,940
you can stop looking for his dream.

270
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,620
Brother,

271
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,540
I haven't changed at all.

272
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,540
I just want to be like the weaker one.

273
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,700
Yeah.

274
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,700
You're the weaker one.

275
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,900
You haven't changed at all.

276
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,220
Don't run away for long.

277
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,900
I'll shoot anyway.

278
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,780
However, you didn't save Liang Xi,

279
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,780
Fang Bi as well.

280
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,200
You said you would save him.

281
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,080
And often,�� how many time you never change.

282
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
I will never be humiliated like this again.

283
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,280
Fu Yan, I already said it.

284
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,320
I don't want the dream anymore.

285
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,280
Your Majesty,

286
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,680
can you think more for yourself?

287
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
Is love that important?

288
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,040
What you want,

289
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,240
what you still hate,

290
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,440
your own life,

291
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,680
do you want to give up for a woman?

292
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,680
I don't want to be humiliated like this anymore.

293
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
I don't want to be humiliated like this anymore.

294
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
I don't want to be humiliated like this anymore.

295
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,880
I've been watching Mu Qi Bai for so long for Your Majesty.

296
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,680
I finally have a new progress.

297
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,280
Do you really want to give up the dream to a woman?

298
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,480
What progress?

299
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,880
Do you have news about the dream?

300
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,280
Mu Qi Bai and the others searched the whole Wu Gui Sea.

301
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,680
They didn't find the dream.

302
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,080
I don't know if they found the dream.

303
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
I guessed that

304
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,080
maybe it was Ji Bo Zai

305
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,280
who could change into a real Ling Xi Jin.

306
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Only he could enter it himself

307
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,680
and hide the dream in the well.

308
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,080
Ling Xi Jin?

309
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,280
Your Majesty wants to use the dream to save Ming Yi's life.

310
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,480
The traces of the dream have been exposed in the Sacred Capital.

311
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,880
If there is no spiritual vein,

312
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,080
will they let you live well?

313
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Your Majesty, what have you always wanted to do?

314
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,080
I don't want to see you like this, doing this for others.

315
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,480
But...

316
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
the dream is only one part.

317
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,880
I just don't have a spiritual vein.

318
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,480
Ming Yi doesn't have the antidote.

319
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,080
He will die.

320
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,080
Then...

321
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,680
what if you think it's for me?

322
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,280
It's really hard to catch you.

323
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,080
I heard that the more dangerous the fox is, the more dazzling its fur is.

324
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,080
To make you into a fox, you need to be nervous.

325
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
I'll give you a thought.

326
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,480
Then let's play a game.

327
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Playing with you

328
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,480
can even put me in danger.

329
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
I can't wait to be happy.

330
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,280
Your thick eyes

331
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,480
always remind me of someone who is very naughty.

332
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Brother!

333
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,480
Your whip isn't working.

334
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,480
It's been healed in less than three days.

335
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
You're lucky.

336
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,080
You're a useless person without a spiritual vein.

337
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,280
You can handle it.

338
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,480
You've been fighting for years.

339
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,080
Despite not having a spiritual vein, you've gotten better.

340
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,480
Isn't that great?

341
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
You're hurt?

342
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
Then why aren't you afraid?

343
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
What firepower is so right?

344
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
If you're here to pity me,

345
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
then don't cry.

346
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,480
Wait until one day,

347
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,480
I can change all of this,

348
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
when I can celebrate victory,

349
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
then you can cry.

350
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
But...

351
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
You want to say,

352
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
but I'm weak now, right?

353
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
I know this.

354
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
My ability is far from enough.

355
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
But once,

356
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
someone told me,

357
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
as long as I dare to laugh,

358
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
there's nothing that can restrict me.

359
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Actually, it's all the same.

360
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Just think about it.

361
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Live on.

362
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
One day,

363
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
there's nothing that can restrict us.

364
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Even if you're a little fox.

365
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm not afraid of you.

366
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
I'm not afraid of you.

367
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm not afraid of you.

368
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
His Majesty values honor.

369
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
But in my heart,

370
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
His Majesty's life is more important than anything.

371
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
I was willing to do anything

372
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
that His Majesty asked me to do.

373
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,480
But this time,

374
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
it's the first time

375
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
I hope you can succeed.

376
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
Your Majesty, do you know?

377
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
I didn't have

378
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
any precious memories.

379
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I was just a fox

380
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
that could live for a day.

381
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
But until that day,

382
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
I had someone I wanted to cherish.

383
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
I had important memories.

384
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480
For you,

385
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
I knew that the longevity was meaningful.

386
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
Can you understand me?

387
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Sorry, I...

388
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
If His Majesty insists on doing this,

389
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
at least hide your whereabouts.

390
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Don't let them find out.

391
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
I'll also find a way

392
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
to determine if Ji Bo

393
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
really practiced

394
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
the spiritual attack of the body.

395
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
I'll go.

396
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I'll go.

397
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
I'll go.

398
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Let's not disturb him

399
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
for a while.

400
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
You want to see me?

401
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Nothing special.

402
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
I just thought that

403
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
you just made up the unit.

404
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
It must be a little bit empty.

405
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
So I made a bowl of medicine.

406
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
But I thought,

407
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
maybe not.

408
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Isn't the late emperor...

409
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
No.

410
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,480
Can I really

411
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
get your kindness?

412
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Didn't the late emperor

413
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
say that

414
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
he won't eat anything outside?

415
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
You're still talking about this?

416
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,480
If it were someone else,

417
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
he would suspect that

418
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
the late emperor was going to poison him.

419
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
But he was soft-hearted

420
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
and changed his mind.

421
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Now,

422
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
it's just a theory.

423
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
It's just a lie.

424
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Then you'd better not drink it.

425
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
It's time to start the second step.

426
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
We need to send the magic array

427
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
to send the unit to the bottom of the abyss

428
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
and completely empty the spirit of the demon beast.

429
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
But this step

430
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
will expose the smell of the lost tree.

431
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,480
Please send the unit back

432
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
as soon as possible.

433
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Otherwise, you'll be in a loss.

434
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
I've made a mistake

435
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
by not having a body.

436
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Yin Haoran is right.

437
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
The Demon Beast of Wanqian.

438
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
The wind.

439
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Please.

440
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Your Majesty, please take a look.

441
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
In three days,

442
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
the Demon Beast will be able to recover.

443
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
By then,

444
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,480
the number of demons and power

445
00:28:47,480 --> 00:29:00,480
are sufficient to eliminate

446
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,480
the demon beast that the fairy of the spirit of the spirit of a hundred years ago.

447
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,800
Why is there poison around?

448
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,680
I think aナ Swordsman

449
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,840
just stashed all the st fugs

450
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,800
seems to be acting up

451
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,320
How did he get here?

452
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,080
funk

453
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,800
yun

454
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
I've been完全及

455
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:33,760
Why is the Tips-Bones

456
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,760
and found through dumb means

457
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,240
Honey soon kicked Mr. 맞

458
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,540
Ji Bo-Zai

459
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,440
Yeah

460
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,900
Ji Bo-Zai

461
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,200
It must be him

462
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,280
sentences mate

463
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,260
нем padre

464
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
I don't know if the Jibozi has learned the secret technique of the Flower Demon Tree.

465
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Otherwise, I will definitely go back to the place.

466
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Jiang Xijue.

467
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
I really can't have any hope of this place.

468
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,600
The mountain is full of evil water, and the waste is everywhere.

469
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Jue Di, San Chi, find out the Jibozi for me.

470
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
If you want to be with me,

471
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
then I will tell you.

472
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Princess, take a break for a while.

473
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,600
The respected one in Shouhua's palace cannot be a beggar.

474
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I must keep every detail of the Qingyun Conference in mind.

475
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
The princess really has grown up.

476
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,240
I'm afraid.

477
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,080
Without Fuze,

478
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,680
Ji Xingyuan would have been more helpless than before.

479
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,240
Xiuyun,

480
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,600
I'm always afraid.

481
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,800
Do you think the heart-wrenching flowers

482
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,760
will wither again?

483
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,520
Don't worry, Your Highness.

484
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,480
Lord Yanxian's method is useful.

485
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,000
He's still doing well

486
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,840
even without Fuze

487
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,560
for so many years.

488
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,520
Everyone,

489
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,520
we've been training day and night.

490
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,600
But as the most important war veteran,

491
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,600
Count Ji has never appeared for days

492
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,160
and made the whole Shouhua rebel against us.

493
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,640
What else do we practice?

494
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
What do we fight for?

495
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,160
That's right.

496
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,880
Why?

497
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,120
The Qingyun Conference is a team battle.

498
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,040
The leaders we need

499
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,800
can lead the overall situation.

500
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,960
But now,

501
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,320
people like Count Ji

502
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,480
are promoted to war veterans

503
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,720
and are rewarded with treasures.

504
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,520
What else do we care?

505
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,320
We should stop training.

506
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,560
Sun Liao is right.

507
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,920
If Count Ji doesn't show up,

508
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,280
he's not qualified to be a war veteran.

509
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,080
That's right.

510
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,800
If he doesn't show up,

511
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,000
we don't need to train anymore.

512
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,480
That's right.

513
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,120
What should we train?

514
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
Don't say that.

515
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,480
Your Highness,

516
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,320
Sun Liao is making trouble in the Shouhua rebel.

517
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,640
Who said we don't need to train

518
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,480
without Ji Xianjun?

519
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,000
Ji Xianjun is a war veteran.

520
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,280
But he's not the only one in the Shouhua rebel.

521
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,120
He's the only one who can win.

522
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,360
If he doesn't show up,

523
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,560
we'll lose the Qingyun Conference.

524
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,760
Ji Xingyuan

525
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,280
won't be the real war veteran.

526
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,760
Who said

527
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,600
we're right?

528
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,640
Who said we're right?

529
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,520
I can't stand it anymore.

530
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,080
I think

531
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,760
Lord Sun Liao is right.

532
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,080
Sitter seems to think

533
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:24,240
that

534
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,880
even chances like this

535
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,800
can't be an easy pie to lose.

536
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,360
to seek the shortcut to the lower realm.

537
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,640
So,

538
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,560
that's what Count Ji has been thinking.

539
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,360
No wonder

540
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,680
I can't figure it out.

541
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,480
Why doesn't Count Ji

542
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,160
come to train?

543
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,120
I'm inspired by

544
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,680
what Lord Sun Liao said.

545
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,640
Such a person

546
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,160
doesn't deserve to be

547
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,600
a master in Shouhua Fatty Palace.

548
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,120
Yes.

549
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
That's right.

550
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,800
No.

551
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,640
Why don't we

552
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
change our class today?

553
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,000
Change?

554
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,760
Who?

555
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,960
The class is so important.

556
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,560
We should choose a good person.

557
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,240
Yes.

558
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,200
I think

559
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,600
Lord Sun Liao is a good choice.

560
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,360
Princess,

561
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,880
are you kidding me?

562
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,880
As a person

563
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
of Shouhua Fatty Palace,

564
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,120
I won't joke around.

565
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,240
Lord Sun Liao

566
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,240
attended the Qingyun Conference.

567
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,720
From his experience,

568
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,040
he's far better than other fighters.

569
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,800
Besides,

570
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,160
whether he chooses from fighters

571
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,360
or from Shouhua Fatty Palace's training,

572
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,920
Lord Sun Liao is active

573
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,160
and has a good attitude.

574
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,400
I'll order him

575
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,800
to dismiss Count Ji

576
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,800
and take the throne.

577
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,960
Disseminate him?

578
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,240
That's right.

579
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,840
That's right.

580
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,440
He won't leave us.

581
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,040
Disseminate him?

582
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,560
Disseminate Lord Sun Liao

583
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,360
and make him a soldier of Shouhua Fatty Palace.

584
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,360
Really?

585
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,400
Okay.

586
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,920
I support Lord Sun Liao.

587
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,160
I support Lord Sun Liao too.

588
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,520
I...

589
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,720
Lord Sun Liao?

590
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,640
That's right.

591
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,760
Is he okay?

592
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,360
What's going on?

593
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,040
I don't think it's reliable.

594
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,840
Thank you, Princess.

595
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,080
Thank you.

596
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,120
I was blind in the past.

597
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,680
I only saw Count Ji.

598
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,200
Now,

599
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,360
Lord Sun Liao

600
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,600
is more powerful

601
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,960
and more like a warrior than Count Ji.

602
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,560
Although Count Ji is not good,

603
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
he's still a good fighter.

604
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,520
We only

605
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,880
gave him a good fight.

606
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,840
That's right.

607
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,840
That's right.

608
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,640
Lord Sun Liao

609
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,240
must train everyone well.

610
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,160
If he does well,

611
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,960
I'll tell my father.

612
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,320
Yes,

613
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,120
Princess.

614
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,120
I've made you a soldier.

615
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,360
You still call me Princess.

616
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,720
Shouldn't you call me Sun Zhe?

617
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
Why did Tian Ji

618
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,160
have to make such a mess?

619
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,680
No.

620
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,160
This is exactly the best thing he did.

621
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,160
It's also the easiest way.

622
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,920
Okay.

623
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,800
Zhe.

624
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,720
Sun Liao is so arrogant.

625
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,320
We have to catch him.

626
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,560
Tian Ji is so tolerant.

627
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,280
He's so shameless.

628
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,720
Is it important to be shameless?

629
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,040
As long as you can achieve your goal.

630
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,840
Pretending to be a man

631
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,440
and pretending to be a woman.

632
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,360
That's all.

633
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,520
I'm not a man.

634
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,520
I'm a woman.

635
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Pretending, lying,

636
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,360
and saying nothing.

637
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,680
Instead of trying to protect Ji Bo,

638
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,920
why don't you kill Sun Liao

639
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,400
and make him a new target?

640
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,840
Han Feng,

641
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,280
what brought you here?

642
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,880
What's wrong with this tree?

643
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,760
It was fine before.

644
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,200
It's an unexpected mishap.

645
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,000
It's been deformed overnight

646
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,160
if you didn't pay attention.

647
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,800
Han Feng, you've been taking care of it.

648
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,920
I was careless.

649
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,560
Han Feng, don't be unhappy.

650
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,920
Han Feng,

651
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,160
I can bring you some best wine.

652
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
I'll bring it to you.

653
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,400
It has the unique

654
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,240
Zhaocui Flower Road.

655
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,920
So it tastes different.

656
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,960
The unique?

657
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,960
Yes.

658
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,320
We have the six realms.

659
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,920
The flowers look like weeds.

660
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
But every full moon,

661
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,560
the most famous flower road in the world can be collected.

662
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,040
I can't expect anything from this place.

663
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,600
The mountain is so deep.

664
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,160
It's so useless.

665
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:36,300
This is our

666
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,880
In those years,

667
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,720
our relationship with Shu Zhi

668
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,320
was very close.

669
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,160
Tian Ji is very sweet.

670
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,360
She wouldn't throw away

671
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
a box of candies.

672
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,360
She didn't want to let the God know.

673
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,680
So she asked my uncle

674
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,680
to keep it for her.

675
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,360
Because Tian Ji

676
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,960
treats Lord Han Feng as a support?

677
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,280
So,

678
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
seeing her working with Ji Bo,

679
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,040
I feel relieved.

680
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,080
No.

681
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,800
It's just her words.

682
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,000
She just thinks that

683
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,360
Ji Bo is very arrogant

684
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,240
when he's fighting.

685
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,960
Tian Ji won't

686
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,400
treat Ji Bo like that.

687
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,920
She doesn't like him.

688
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,560
So this makes me feel better.

689
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,880
Where is the girl

690
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,160
who treated uncle as a support

691
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,040
now?

692
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,400
What will she do in the future?

693
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,080
I can definitely protect Tian Ji.

694
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,960
I won't let her get hurt.

695
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,240
I don't have that confidence.

696
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,160
Why don't you have confidence?

697
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,400
Ji Bo.

698
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,880
Who knows

699
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,960
Ji Bo's past in the whole Ji Xing Garden?

700
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,480
He's a drunkard.

701
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,640
How can he have a spiritual vein?

702
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,160
This alone

703
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,920
is already disturbing.

704
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,200
Not to mention

705
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,040
since he defeated Yao Guangshan

706
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,320
and stopped Qingyun,

707
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,360
Ji Xing Garden has been moving.

708
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,760
Really?

709
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,440
Do you know that

710
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,360
Ji Xing Garden was attacked by a monster not long ago?

711
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
I thought someone was trying to

712
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,320
make things worse.

713
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,800
I'm investigating the truth.

714
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,760
So can you

715
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,400
clear all the danger

716
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,160
for me and Tian Ji?

717
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,880
Vote for me instead!

718
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,320
It's my soul that is weak.

719
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,320
It's enough to lie to myself once.

720
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:27,320
Even if I've never been true to myself.

721
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:35,320
From the starry sky to your heart, how long will it take?

722
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:42,320
And all the tenderness you gave me is the poison of love.

723
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:49,320
I'll drink up all my pain, only to exchange for your freedom.

724
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,320
Once I have love, I'm willing to let go.

725
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,320
At the back of the abyss, I struggle for a long time.

726
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,320
I want to ask the sky.

727
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,320
But this armor is always for you.

728
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,320
So what if I break it?

729
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,320
Fate is never wrong.

730
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,320
The sun will eventually fall.

731
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:24,320
I'll fight against all the absurdity.

732
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,320
I'll be right there.

733
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:34,320
Once I have love, I'll easilyaringly let go.

734
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:43,320
From the starry sky to your heart, how long will it take?

735
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:50,320
And all the tenderness you gave me is the poison of love.

736
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,680
Once love has, it's better to let go
