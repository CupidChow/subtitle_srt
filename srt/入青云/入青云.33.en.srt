It really is him.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,690
Why is he with Ming Yi and Ji Bozai?

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,980
Where did they go?

Yeah.

I don't need your pity!

I never thought that after a lifetime of being jealous of you,

Isn't that Ming Xian's companion beast?

37
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,690
- Yes. - Yes.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,940
I,

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,730
Ming Xin, Lord Chengyun of Yaoguang Mountain

40
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,380
and Ming Xian's younger brother,

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,570
can testify before you all.

42
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,820
This woman

43
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,820
is none other than Ming Xian of Yaoguang Mountain, the one who caused

44
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,130
your seven consecutive defeats!

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,980
What?

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,730
What? How could she be Ming Xian?

47
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,260
Impossible!

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,660
She's clearly a fairy!

49
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,540
Nonsense!

50
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,260
- Exactly. - Yes.

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,780
How can he say such nonsense with a straight face?

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,610
I don't believe him.

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,010
For the past 21 years,

54
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,290
she had used the Veil of Illusion to disguise herself

55
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,340
as a male immortal,

56
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,890
taking the title of Crown Prince for herself.

57
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,730
The artifact in her hand, the Embers,

58
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,940
was forged by Ming Xian

59
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,170
and answers only to her.

60
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,890
She also wears the spiritpact bell of Ming Xian's companion beast,

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,820
the White Cat.

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,820
Is Fairy Ming Yi really Ming Xian?

63
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:37,980
No,

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,450
it's impossible.

65
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,380
She's a fairy. How could she be Ming Xian?

66
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,690
But even Ming Xian's own brother identifies her.

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,940
And the companion beast

68
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,450
we just saw was indeed Ming Xian's cat.

69
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,410
It can't be faked.

70
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,380
Ming Xian, do you dare deny it?

71
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,450
Your identity will be exposed sooner or later.

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,890
I don't believe

73
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,410
that after all this,

74
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,130
the Six Realms will still have a place for you.

The Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain

76
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,540
should have been me.

77
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,610
It should have

78
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,930
been me.

79
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,580
Could what he said be true?

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,730
Is it true?

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,980
It sounds true to me.

Step back!

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,810
Calm down, everyone!

89
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,580
Back up!

90
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,020
Do not come closer!

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,980
Stop!

92
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,340
Calm down!

93
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,100
Step back!

94
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,810
Stay calm! Step back!

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,410
Get out!

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,290
Back up!

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,020
Calm down, everyone!

98
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,410
Get out of Shouhua Academy!

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,730
- Get out! - Get out!

100
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,700
Ming Yi is one of us here in Shouhua Academy.

101
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,580
You cannot drive her out just because you want to!

102
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,540
Ming Yi?

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,850
She's Ming Xian of Yaoguang Mountain!

104
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,050
- Right! - Right!

105
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,930
Everyone, please calm down.

106
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,980
Yes, she is Ming Xian,

107
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,140
but she's saved Jixing Abyss from disaster more than once.

108
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,100
Have you all forgotten that?

109
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,340
And every artifact

110
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,140
used in this Qingyun Tournament

111
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,220
was forged by her.

112
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,410
She has stood with us through every trial.

113
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,900
Why are you defending her?

114
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,340
Why shouldn't I?

115
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,100
When the netherbeast army struck,

116
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,810
it was Master Ming Yi

117
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,220
who protected the lives of Jixing Abyss!

118
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,980
She was once the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

119
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,660
If you let her stay in Shouhua Academy,

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,340
aren't you afraid she'll collude with the enemy

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,490
and bring ruin upon Jixing Abyss?

122
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,290
That's nonsense! She would never do that!

123
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,780
Enough talk!

124
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,780
Let's rush in

125
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,900
and drive that traitor out of Jixing Abyss!

126
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,340
Drive her out of Jixing Abyss!

127
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,950
Calm down!

128
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,780
Get lost!

129
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,050
Master.

130
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,780
Calm down!

131
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,700
Stop it!

132
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,900
I am Ming Xian.

133

If anyone has grievances,

134
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,140
come at me.

135
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,290
Ming Xian, you traitor!

136
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,540
Get out of Jixing Abyss!

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,100
Get out of Shouhua Academy!

138
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,170
- Get out! - Get out of Jixing Abyss!

139
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,730
- Get lost! - Get lost!

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,700
Your Majesty, the news has already spread across all Six Realms.

141
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,850
Fairy Ming Yi

142
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,780
is none other than Ming Xian, the one who caused Jixing Abyss

143
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,290
seven years of defeat and the loss of the Blessed Rain.

144
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,370
Has Your Majesty been blinded by her deceit

145
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,610
to have allowed her to join Shouhua Academy?

146
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,170
Your Majesty, please seize that traitor Ming Xian at once!

147
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,100
Yaoguang Mountain once hailed that wretch as their Warrior God.

148
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,290
She built her own glory

149
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,290
on the blood and tears Jixing Abyss offered

150
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,780
to Yaoguang Mountain.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,660
And now, she's even infiltrated our realm.

152
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,250
She must have ulterior motives!

153
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,410
- Yes, Your Majesty. - That's right, Your Majesty.

154
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,810
Your Majesty, we must not let her go unpunished!

155
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,050
Nor should we allow her to remain in Shouhua Academy!

156
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,140
We can't let her stay in Shouhua Academy!

157
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,810
- Your Majesty, you owe us an answer! - You owe us an answer!

158
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,700
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

159
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,410
She must not be forgiven!

160
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,850
- Stop hesitating, Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,610
- Your Majesty, make your decision now! - Your Majesty!

162
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,980
Give us justice!

163
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,900
I am indeed Ming Xian,

164
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,410
and it's true that I caused Jixing Abyss

165
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,580
to lose for seven years.

166
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,850
But back then, I belonged to Yaoguang Mountain.

167
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,340
There was nothing wrong

168
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,540
with fighting for them.

169
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,930
Still,

170
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,580
the hardships Jixing Abyss faces today

171
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,900
are partly my doing,

172
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,700
and I cannot just stand by.

173
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,050
So now,

174
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,930
I wish to join

175
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,730
the warrior ranks of Shouhua Academy to fight

176
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,100
for the Blessed Rain that should rightfully be shared with you.

177
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,610
Who would believe you?

178
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,410
What right do you have to be in Jixing Abyss?

179
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,810
Ming Xian would fight for Jixing Abyss?

180
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,900
You traitor, you lying wretch!

181
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,850
No one will believe you!

182
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,540
You made us lose seven years in a row,

183
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,810
and you dare to give this speech here?

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,780
Get out of Jixing Abyss!

185
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,610
- Get out of Jixing Abyss! - Get out of Jixing Abyss!

186
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,290
- Get out of Jixing Abyss! - Get out of Jixing Abyss!

187
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,730
Everyone,

188
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,930
I know you won't believe me

189
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,170
no matter what I say.

190
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,250
But there's one thing you know as well as I do:

191
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,410
right now, in Jixing Abyss,

192
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,980
no one else can rival the warriors of Yaoguang Mountain.

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,780
Only I can.

194
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,370
Without me,

195
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,250
you will lose again, just as you did in those seven years.

196
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,100
With me,

197
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,490
you might still have a chance.

198
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,930
If I truly mean to fight for Jixing Abyss,

199
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,850
then you'll have a chance to win,

200
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,420
and it will be your only chance to win.

201
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,460
So today,

202
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,460
I set up this arena.

203
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,700
If anyone can defeat me,

204
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,940
I will never again ask to join Shouhua Academy.

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,420
You have so many powerful artifacts.

206
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,300
How could we possibly beat you?

207
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,010
- Exactly! - Exactly!

208
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,060
Right.

209
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,460
- It's impossible! - Right!

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,060
I won't use any artifacts.

211
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,060
Everyone,

212
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,130
you've all seen what Ming Xian can do.

213
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,130
She's just trying to humiliate us.

214
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,610
That's right. She's trying to humiliate us.

215
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,420
This is unfair!

216
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,250
Then I'll even fight without using my hands.

217
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,960
What is she trying to do?

218
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,820
What now? Even so,

219
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,820
no one dares to fight Master Ming Yi?

220
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,610
Then what are you all complaining about?

221
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,730
You clearly need her,

222
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,010
yet you still refuse to trust her.

223
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,180
I'll give it a try.

224
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,730
I'll fight too!

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,180
Master, you are unbeatable!

226
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,420
Anyone else? Come at me together.

227
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,650
How could we ever win?

228
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,580
There's no way we can win.

229
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,300
Exactly.

230
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,130
We all know how strong you are,

231
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,370
but you fought for Yaoguang Mountain for so many years.

232
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,300
How can we trust you to fight for us now?

233
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,180
- Exactly. - Exactly.

234
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,770
I will vouch for her.

235
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,770
- Greetings, Your Majesty. - Greetings, Your Majesty.

236
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,010
I will stake everything I have on this.

237
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,340
Ming Yi will win back the Blessed Rain for Jixing Abyss.

238
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,300
But...

239
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,530
If she ever betrays us,

240
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,770
then it means I've made the wrong decision.

241
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,980
I will have her executed at once

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,650
and then abdicate the throne.

243
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,060
What?

244
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,530
You are just worried

245
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,370
that I might collude with Yaoguang Mountain.

246
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,700
So I will tell you the whole truth today.

247
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,980
Though I was once Ming Xian,

248
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,700
my real father isn't the Emperor of Yaoguang.

249
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,370
Nor is my birth mother the Empress of Yaoguang.

250
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,220
My real mother was a descendant of the Bo clan of Jixing Abyss.

251
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,060
So how am I not qualified
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

252
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,130
to fight for Jixing Abyss?

253
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,340
Give me this one chance,

254
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,820
and I will protect Jixing Abyss

255
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,610
so it will never again be oppressed.

256
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,340
Now we can trust her.

257
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,770
Jixing Abyss!

258
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,580
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

259
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,460
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

260
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,460
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

261
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,940
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

262
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,180
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

263
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,460
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

264
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,770
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

265
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,650
Get out.

266
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,300
Your Lordship, you must have heard by now.

267
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,180
Ming Yi has renounced the Ming Xian identity

268
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,770
and formally joined

269
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,890
Jixing Abyss's Shouhua Academy.

270
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,180
Give her up, Your Lordship!

271
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,940
She will be an enemy of Zhushui Spiritual State.

272
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,980
She already knows your true identity.

273
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,850
And she knows of all the innocent lives

274
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,980
you have taken.

275
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,980
You and she

276
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,650
can never be together!

277
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,980
Chao Yuan, forget her.

278
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,220
Forget her,

279
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,730
and you will be the one

280
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,460
most likely to rule Zhushui Spiritual State.

281
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,850
If you insist on choosing her,

282
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,730
you will lower yourself forever,

283
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,530
beneath even the dirt.

284
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,180
Back then in Jixing Abyss,

285
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,340
you killed

286
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,130
your own brothers for her.

287
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,730
Now you use living beings as sacrifices to train

288
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,250
in the art of illusory assassination.

289
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,850
How much blood is on your hands?

290
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,610
Can it ever be washed clean?

291
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,220
She never loved you.

292
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,180
Now that she knows what you are truly like,

293
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,100
she could never...

294
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,850
Shut up!

295
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,100
I won't!

296
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,580
At first, you hesitated to kill.

297
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,530
But now,

298
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,820
even when they tremble in fear,

299
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,650
kneel before you, and beg for mercy,

300
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,180
even when they die with their eyes wide open,

301
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,610
you don't even flinch.

302
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,060
This is who you truly are!

303
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,850
Shut up!

304
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,580
Fuyue, shut up.

305
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,580
Shut up!

306
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,940
I won't shut up!

307
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,650
Only I know this side of you.

308
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,610
Only I grew up suffering by your side.

309
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,010
When you had no spiritual veins and were bullied,

310
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,300
I was the one who endured it with you.

311
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,820
So why do you choose Ming Yi?

312
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,980
Because you are not her!

313
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,420
Leave.

314
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,420
Soon, I will have my own spiritual veins,

315
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,940
and I will no longer need you.

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,620
Fuyue,

338
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,420
you once took me to your Illusory Realm.

339
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,980
Your most precious memory

340
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,770
was the day I saved you from Chao Yu.

341
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,460
But mine was the day Ming Yi saved me.

342
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,900
♪Let the memories be buried...♪

343
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,460
I will never be able to move on.

344
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,050
But Fuyue,

345
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,940
you still have a chance

346
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,050
to live for yourself.

347
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,810
My training has no set routine.

348
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,090
If any of you can land even half a move on me,

349
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,700
that will be enough.

350
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,860
Here in Yaoguang Mountain,

351
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,570
we have never relied on artifacts in battle.

352
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,940
As an Honorary Warrior,

353
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,330
shouldn't you lead by example?

354
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,050
We used none before

355
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,220
and still won.

356
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,860
Exactly.

357
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,900
Why do you have to use artifacts?

358
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,290
Yeah, we've never used any.

359
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,380
Exactly. Why do you use them?

360
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,940
That kind of thinking is far too narrow.

361
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,290
I'll show you the truth through action.

362
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,570
If you can't overcome an artifact with your spiritual power,

363
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,810
how will you defeat your opponents

364
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,770
in the Qingyun Tournament?

365
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,700
Ji Bozai,

366
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,460
you're doing this just to humiliate us.

367
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,380
The former Honorary Warrior never trained us like this.

368
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,770
Which Honorary Warrior

369
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,570
are you referring to?

370
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,730
Don't tell me you mean Ming Xin.

371
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,220
He couldn't even train himself properly.

372
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,900
How could he ever train you?

373
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,620
Why pretend not to know, Immortal Ji?

374
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,460
The one who trained us before

375
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,700
was that wretched Ming Xian.

376
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,900
When Ming Xian brought you seven years of victory,

377
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,050
you hailed her as the Warrior God.

378
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,180
Then, after a single defeat,

379
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,180
you turned to support Ming Xin instead,

380
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,420
not even sparing her a word in defense.

381
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,380
And now, when you speak of her,

382
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,730
you even sound full of contempt.

383
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,570
How laughable.

384
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,460
What,

385
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,010
are you standing up for her now?

386
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,980
I bet he's doing this because they were once married,

387
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,570
and he came here today just to lecture us.

388
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,810
Did Ming Xian truly train you?

389
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,180
How could you all be so narrow-minded?

390
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,660
You...!

391
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,090
I took Ming Xian's place

392
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,490
to lead you in the Qingyun Tournament.

393
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,770
Everything I've said and done today

394
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,810
is as the Honorary Warrior.

395
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,010
But you?

396
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,290
Think about what you just said.

397
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,730
Do you still remember you are warriors?

398
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,570
Our time is running short.

399
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,730
If you want to be worthy

400
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,290
of the armor you wear,

401
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,620
stop behaving like that.

402
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,770
In this Qingyun Tournament,

403
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,660
whether you win

404
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,010
with spiritual power or artifacts,

405
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,660
a victory is a victory.

406
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,620
What you should do now

407
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,010
is focus on getting stronger

408
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,730
for Yaoguang Mountain.

409
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,770
You and Immortal Zheng Tiao are about to get married.

410
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,810
Why are you still staying in Jixing Abyss?

411
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,980
I get to make battle attire

412
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,330
for Shouhua Academy's warriors here.

413
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,420
I know what matters more,

414
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,700
and so does Zheng Tiao.

415
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,900
He won't stand in my way.

416
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,940
Besides,

417
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,860
if we saw each other every day, I might get tired of him.

418
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,530
It seems Zheng Tiao and you

419
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,180
are quite the match.

420
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,770
Our wedding is set for next month.

421
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,050
But Zheng Tiao

422
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,860
[To the Empress of Jixing Abyss]
is a warrior from another realm.

423
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,570
Your Majesty, could you...?

424
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,490
All right.

425
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,860
A union between realms is a joyous event.

426
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,770
I will issue a pass for Immortal Zheng Tiao.

427
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,660
Thank you, Your Majesty!

428
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,940
Looks like I'd better prepare more spirit stones

429
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,900
as your wedding gift.

430
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,770
Ming Yi,

431
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,530
actually, I've invited someone else too.

432
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,730
The bride and groom have arrived!

433
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,570
- Here they come! - Here they come!

434
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,460
She's so beautiful.

435
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,380
First, petals for an everlasting bond!

436
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,900
Second, petals for love in full bloom!

437
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,530
Third, petals for peace through all seasons!

438
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,050
Fourth, petals for reunion beneath the full moon!

439
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,290
Fifth, petals for joy and children to bless your home!

440
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,420
- Yes! - Yes!

441
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,180
Now, the three bows.

442
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,220
First,

443
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,050
bow to heaven and earth for witnessing your blessed union.

444
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,180
Bow!

445
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,900
Second,

446
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,090
bow to your families for lasting harmony and generations of joy.

447
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,570
Bow!

448
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,290
- Wonderful! - Wonderful!

449
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,290
Bow!

450
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,770
- Yes! - Yes!

451
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,940
Third,

452
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,220
bow to each other, united in heart and soul.

453
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,570
- Wonderful! - Wonderful!

454
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,380
How lovely!

455
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,980
Beautiful!

456
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,900
Lovely!

457
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,180
The ceremony is complete!

458
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,700
Zhang Tai,

459
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,250
marrying you

460
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,530
is the best thing that's ever happened to me.

461
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,530
From now on, we can watch the stars together every night.

462
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,090
So sweet!

463
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,290
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

464
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,220
What a perfect match!

465
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,250
Step aside.

466
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,220
By His Majesty's order,

467
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,700
before the Diwu tree's core is fully refined,

468
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,980
Your Highness cannot leave the realm.

469
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,290
Tell Father I hurt you.

470
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,290
That way, Father will not blame you

471
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,090
for letting me escape.

472
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,420
You truly disappoint me!

473
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,810
Father.

474
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,180
Only now do I learn

475
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,140
of your relationship with Ming Xian

476
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,290
and your dealings with Ming Xin.

477
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,090
There are plenty of things you still don't know.

478
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,140
Such insolence!

479
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,250
Are you really going to kill me, Father?

480
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,380
If you do,

481
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,010
I cannot say what will happen

482
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,250
to the Diwu tree's core.

483
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,810
You lowborn brat.

484
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,940
You even dare to threaten me now?

485
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,530
Lowborn brat?

486
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,570
I carry your blood, Father.

487
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,730
I've learned everything

488
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,810
from you, the father

489
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,010
I deeply admire.

490
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,860
If you stay here today, I will let this slide.

491
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,330
But if you defy my order and dare to leave the realm,

492
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,250
this spell, though not deadly,

493
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,090
will make you suffer as if thousands of ants were gnawing at your heart.

494
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,460
The Diwu tree's core may be your bargaining chip,

495
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,660
but I have my own ways to make you behave!

496
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,940
Think carefully

497
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,570
about what you should do.

498
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,810
Congratulations, Fairy Zhang Tai.

499
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,570
Isn't that Immortal Ji's companion beast?

500
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,530
Why is he here?

501
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,250
Isn't that Immortal Ji's companion beast?

502
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,140
What is he doing here?

503
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,380
Why is he here?

504
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,140
Yeah.

505
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,660
Why is he here?

506
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,570
My lord sends this gift

507
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,940
to congratulate you on your wedding.

508
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,290
Why didn't your lord come in person?

509
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,180
He has already severed ties with the past.

510
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,090
Still, on hearing that an old friend is marrying,

511
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,570
he asked me to deliver this gift on his behalf.

512
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,050
Please accept it.

513
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,010
Thank you.

514
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,250
He's leaving already?

515
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,980
I once overheard them talking

516
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,330
about something inside the Zhuojin Tower,

517
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,860
something called the Sky-Swallowing Array.

518
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,250
Buxiu,

519
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,770
do you still remember

520
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,050
the portrait that burned that day?

521
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,700
A hundred years ago,

522
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,140
the Emperor of Zhushui laid the Sky-Swallowing Array

523
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,460
inside the Zhuojin Tower.

524
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,460
He planned to seize the moment

525
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,420
when the Nine Heavens opened during the Qingyun Tournament

526
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,010
and use the array

527
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,420
to absorb the Blessed Rain and the primordial spirits of all beings,

528
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,050
claiming dominion over the Six Realms.

529
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,250
The one who activates the array

530
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,810
must possess unique spiritual veins

531
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,900
infused with both the Heavenly Grief and the Golden Millet Dream.

532
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,900
Thus, the Bo clan swore never to let the two medicines appear again.

533
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,700
Yet now, to save my disciple, Ji Bozai,

534
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,180
I have to refine the Golden Millet Dream once more.

535
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,900
I hereby record the method to undo the Sky-Swallowing Array:

536
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,420
Only one who has reached the Transcendent Stage

537
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,330
may destroy the array by sacrificing themselves

538
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,090
at the instant it is activated,

539
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,220
thereby averting catastrophe.

540
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,660
Your Lordship...

541
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,860
Buxiu, there's nothing to be sad about.

542
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,530
In all the Six Realms,

543
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,220
only I can do this.

544
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,460
Besides,

545
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,810
I don't have much time left anyway.

546
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,810
That's a good deal, isn't it?

547
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,770
It's just a pity

548
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,900
that what I promised her...

549
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,570
Today is a fine day.

550
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,700
You came.

551
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,900
Since you're here,

552
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,730
why didn't you go offer your congratulations?

553
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,180
Are you afraid to see me?

554
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,770
Maybe.

555
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,530
Are you afraid

556
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,900
that seeing me would bring back painful memories

557
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,980
that cling like a wound to the bone?

558
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,660
Ming Yi.

559
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,460
I'll go inside now.

560
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,570
I won't disturb your peace.

561
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,460

As long as it keeps raining,

576
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,090
there are no titles,

577
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,860
no realms,

578

and no Qingyun Tournament.

The rain has stopped.

00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,980
If only

590
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,300
there were a spell in this world

591
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,610
that could make the rain last forever.

592
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,010
Ji Bozai,

593
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,170
take care.

594
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,690
Immortal Ji, please wait.

595
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,980
Fairy Zhang Tai heard you came

596
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,380
and asked me to deliver a gift in return.

597
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,650
That's not necessary.

598
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,210
She said it was something Fairy Ming Yi wanted you to have.

599
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,860
Incredible, Lord Ji!

600
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,650
Since this pouch can hold everything,

601
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,260
let's call it the Qiankun Pouch.

602
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:36,860
Come back.

603
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,690
Why am I here?

604
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,650
Your Lordship!

605
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,780
Your Lordship.

606
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,420
Buxiu.

607
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,340
Your Lordship.

608
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,900
I have already channeled my spiritual power into the Sky-Swallowing Array.

609
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,940
My primordial spirit is now linked to it.

610
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,010
Extract it now.

611
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,260
If Zhushui Spiritual State activates the array,

612
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,210
remember to use my primordial spirit

613
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,210
to seal it at once.

614
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,050
No...

615
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,210
Stop hesitating.

616
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,050
We're out of time.

617
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,740
It's not over yet.

618
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,570
Why must I take your primordial spirit now?

619
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,090
If I don't make it to the finals,

620
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,010
remember what I've told you.

621
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,460
And do not tell Ming Yi.

622
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,420
You... How dare you?

623
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,690
Your Lordship,

624
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,420
I will never break our spiritpact.

625
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,460
This is the first time I've disobeyed you.

626
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,690
Asking me to extract your primordial spirit

627
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,300
is like asking me to kill you with my own hands.

628
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,260
I can't do it.

629
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,340
Even if it costs me my life, I can't!

630
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,530
Buxiu...

631
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,340
We don't have to give up now.

632
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,340
I will find a way to save you.

633
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,940
Wait for me.

634
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,820
Buxiu!

635
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,130
Your lord has treated mine heartlessly!

636
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,690
Step aside!

637
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,610
What are you doing here?

638
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,690
Buxiu!

639
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,940
- What's wrong? - Tell me...

640
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,820
- What's wrong, Buxiu? - why you're here first!

641
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,090
Why are you on your knees?

642
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,260
Fairy Ming Yi, I beg you, please save my lord!

643
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,570
What happened to Ji Bozai?

644
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,050
The Heavenly Grief in him has flared up again.

645
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,650
I know you can save him.

646
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,420
Please, Fairy Ming Yi, go to Yaoguang Mountain and save him!

647
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,780
Please!

648
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,610
Step aside!

649
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,010
I don't wish to fight you.

650
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,820
Ming Yi, I already let you go,

651
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,090
and yet you dare to return?

652
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,940
Please, Your Majesty, take me to see Ji Bozai.

653
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,170
My son has nothing

654
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,860
to do with you anymore.

655
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,130
With all these people here, this isn't the place to talk.

656
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,340
Please, Your Majesty, head to the Chamber of Ease with me.
