1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or the heat that will last only in the wind and clouds

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are a warm place that is as warm as the stars

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My memories have been fighting for you since then

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't forget your eyes

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can't escape from this love

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can't forget your eyes

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My sister is usually very secretive

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The one who proposed to me is about to break the door

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But I'm too picky as a brother

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I always feel that unless the first general of the six realms

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No one else is worthy

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A few days ago, Han Feng Jun mentioned the same place

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Want me to use my body to help you raise the monster

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Today, do you want to use your sister as a bargaining chip?

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
General, you can refuse

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Just take it as if I haven't mentioned it today

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ok

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Good

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If what you really want to exchange is your freedom of the heart

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then why are you marrying her? You should let her go

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You trapped her in your Dengxian Cave

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is your so-called freedom

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No, it's not like that

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's you, it's you

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why do you doubt my love?

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you stupid?

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Somers Vor mucho

are too EU.

40
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760
What do you want to do?

41
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,180
Kill her?

42
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:29,360
I have dropped the

43
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,000
No.

44
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,720
What's wrong?

45
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
Are you really

46
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,760
serious about Ji Bo?

47
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,440
You didn't sacrifice him.

48
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,320
Where did you get the love?

49
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm wrong.

50
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm wrong.

51
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,720
If he could die for you,

52
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,320
he must be very happy.

53
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,400
Uncle.

54
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,240
You're wrong.

55
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,040
I'll live with Ji Bo.

56
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,000
Why didn't he kill you?

57
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
Why didn't he kill you?

58
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,080
Why?

59
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,080
Why?

60
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,680
Ji Bo.

61
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,240
Why?

62
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,000
Come back.

63
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,640
Come back.

64
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Get out.

65
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,000
Ji Bo.

66
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,440
How are you doing?

67
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,920
Everyone directions!

68
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,060
Talking to you

69
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,820
Still have to ask

70
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,000
If you want to tell me

71
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,680
If you ask it

72
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,440
I...

73
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,160
I can scold you,

74
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,240
but do you want to live?

75
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,800
When Mu Xin Lou died,

76
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,960
you took every fairy

77
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,720
who looked like him

78
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
and turned into a puppet

79
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,680
to control the New Six Realms.

80
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,240
You're so mean!

81
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,880
It seems that you don't want to save him.

82
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,240
Zhang Tai.

83
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,800
Mingyi.

84
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,280
Xu Ming.

85
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,240
You just came back to me.

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,040
I feel that there is a seal in your memory.

87
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,640
Maybe Xin Liu's death

88
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,200
has another meaning.

89
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,360
What did you say?

90
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Have you ever thought

91
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,200
that the memory about Xin Liu

92
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,160
may have been opened by someone?

93
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,240
Xu Ming.

94
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,040
Think about it carefully.

95
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,120
The Immortal Lantern Cave is in the valley.

96
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,080
It's not sunny.

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,840
Why is the Immortal Lantern Cave in your memory

98
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
always sunny?

99
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,320
And

100
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,560
no matter in the Losheng Forest

101
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,600
or in the Immortal Lantern Cave,

102
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,200
there are people

103
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,840
carved with the name Zheng.

104
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,480
Do you really not know

105
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,520
what it represents?

106
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,840
Or are you running away on purpose?

107
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Why

108
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
Xin Liu doesn't want to stay here?

109
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,760
Where is my real memory?

110
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,680
Why can't I see it?

111
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,680
The seal in your memory

112
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
needs external force to open.

113
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,400
How about we make a deal?

114
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
I'll help you remove the seal.

115
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
You can return Zhang Tai to freedom.

116
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,120
Why should I believe you?

117
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,920
Don't you want to know the truth?

118
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,400
Amitabha!

119
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,040
Amitabha!

120
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,800
I will give

121
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,480
every chair unpleasant things.

122
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,920
Rubbish!

123
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,640
is all right

124
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,640
You have been in nhilin luosheng lightly train

125
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Yes, Elder.

126
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:07,680
libertine

127
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Xin Liu

128
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,660
I want you to tell me

129
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,580
I said,

130
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,780
whether you're sincere or not,

131
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
you're the only one

132
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,660
in my heart.

133
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,900
Tell me

134
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,700
your feelings.

135
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,220
Tell me now.

136
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,660
Ah.

137
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,580
Who was it?

138
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,220
North!

139
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,680
Why don't you tell me?

140
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
Are you sick?

141
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,860
X fortunate to have Rui.

142
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,380
He will take care of him.

143
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,100
Yourzzle!

144
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,940
I'm sorry.

145
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,580
General, you came back early and came back late.

146
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Your whereabouts are secret.

147
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,500
There's blood on your clothes.

148
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,620
General, what are you doing?

149
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,500
Xinling.

150
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,380
Han Fengjun is our marriage.

151
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,820
I'll raise the monster beast for him.

152
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,540
When the monster beast is born,

153
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,420
he'll be the master of the entire Ji Xingyuan.

154
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,740
So the wound on you

155
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,180
was caused by the monster beast, right?

156
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,100
For you, I'm willing to do anything.

157
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,260
If you're found out, you'll run away first.

158
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,940
After I've hidden my eyes,

159
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,700
I'll run out and meet you.

160
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,980
Why do you do this?

161
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,900
It's not only tied me up,

162
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,860
but also yourself.

163
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,060
Don't think about leaving me.

164
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,580
Xinling.

165
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,700
No matter how sincere you are,

166
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,660
you're the only one in my heart.

167
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,940
Uncle.

168
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,380
P beginning to long to be tainted so much

169
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,220
you will fail to begin to consider

170
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,120
the Iraqi people

171
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,700
General

172
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,700
I found a prescription in the Jade Star Palace

173
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,740
to help you regain your health

174
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,860
I heard that the Tongxin Formation can heal the power of the beast.

175
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Your magic skills are quite severe.

176
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,860
My spiritual power is so low that I can't train the Tongxin Formation at all.

177
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,860
Why don't you help me to get rid of the hard feelings

178
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,860
and find another great immortal to train the Formation?

179
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,860
I don't want to.

180
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,860
I don't want to.

181
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,860
I don't want to.

182
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,860
I don't want to hurt the immortal to train the Formation.

183
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,860
Even if there is no Tongxin Formation,

184
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,860
I can still find a way to suppress the beast beast.

185
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,860
Don't think about it.

186
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
No matter what,

187
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,860
I will never let you go.

188
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,860
I will never let you go.

189
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
What happened to your hand?

190
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,860
It's just a psychological pain.

191
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,860
I hurt myself.

192
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,860
You cut your blood into a medicine for me?

193
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
All the medical晚宴,

194
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,860
with a hundred 120 receive one 양 Bran.

195
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
I...

196
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
ical...

197
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
amplitude.

198
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,860
Even the most powerful польз investigated as Dr.ern was attacked.

199
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
I'm sorry.

200
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,060
General.

201
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,260
Don't worry.

202
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,860
I can hold on.

203
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,860
General,

204
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,660
take this medicine.

205
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
I'll take it.

206
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,260
The beast's counterattack

207
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,460
requires enough powerful spiritual power

208
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,660
to resist.

209
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,460
The medicine I fed you just now

210
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,860
will only make your body

211
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,060
more weak.

212
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,060
Why?

213
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,060
Why can't the beast kill you?

214
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,460
Why?

215
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
You know it.

216
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,060
You always know it.

217
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,260
Xun Ming,

218
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
I hate you.

219
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,060
I really hate you.

220
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,260
I hate you.

221
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,660
I hate you.

222
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,460
Why do you have to marry me?

223
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,060
Why?

224
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,460
Why do you want to lock me up here?

225
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,460
Why?

226
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,060
It's just a life.

227
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
I'll give you

228
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,460
all the medicine.

229
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
No!

230
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Xie Liu!

231
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,660
Xie Liu!

232
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,860
So, in my life,

233
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,060
I'll never be free.

234
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,060
I'll never be free.

235
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,460
Xun Ming,

236
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
it's all true.

237
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,260
You think those beautiful memories

238
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,460
are all your dreams

239
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,460
made up by your obsession.

240
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,460
Do you really love him?

241
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,660
You only love yourself.

242
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,660
Enough.

243
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,260
Put away your performance.

244
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,660
Stop pretending.

245
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,860
It's time to fulfill your promise.

246
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,060
Give Zhang Tai freedom.

247
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,060
You don't know

248
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
that

249
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,660
foxes are the most cunning

250
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,060
and the least trusted.

251
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,460
You want to save him.

252
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,460
Dream on!

253
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Bo at his waist.

254
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
Mu Qi Bai has changed your memory.

255
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,060
You're willing to use it to keep the Beast?

256
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
You think you can stop Mu Qi Bai?

257
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,060
Even if you can stop Mu Qi Bai,

258
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,060
you can't stop the person behind him.

259
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,060
What do you mean?

260
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
Why do you ask?

261
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,060
Today,

262
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,060
you and I,

263
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
will end up here.

264
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,060
He wants to destroy the illusion

265
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
and trap us here.

266
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,060
Let's go.

267
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Chang Tai's primordial spirit

268
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
is still in Xu Min's hands.

269
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
I...

270
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
I can't let go of your good friend.

271
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
You should die with him.

272
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,060
I...

273
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
I...

274
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
I can't let go of your good friend.

275
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
You should die with him.

276
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Ming Yi!

277
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Ming Yi!

278
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,060
The door is about to close.

279
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
We can't all sleep here.

280
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,060
Let's go!

281
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
This is bad.

282
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,060
This is bad.

283
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
This is bad.

284
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
The passage is about to disappear.

285
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
Hurry up!

286
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
Let's go!

287
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,060
Die here with me!

288
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,060
Qin Huo Zi!

289
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
The wall is blocking the way.

290
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,060
How ridiculous!

291
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
Who is ridiculous?

292
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
I don't know.

293
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,060
The evil spirit is gone.

294
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,060
All the evil spirits are back to their original state.

295
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,060
I...

296
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Zhao Nan.

297
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Ming Yi!

298
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Ming Yi!

299
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
Ming Yi!

300
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Ming Yi!

301
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,060
Ming Yi!

302
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,060
Ming Yi!

303
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,060
Li Heng Hua.

304
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
You've been hit by Li Heng Tian.

305
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,060
I can't let him know my identity.

306
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
He'll never know.

307
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,060
I'm sorry.

308
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,060
I'm sorry.

309
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
I'm sorry.

310
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,060
I'm sorry.

311
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
I'm sorry.

312
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,060
I'm sorry.

313
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,060
I'm sorry.

314
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
I'm sorry.

315
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,060
I'm sorry.

316
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,060
I'm sorry.

317
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,780
Right, right.

318
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,060
onto your knees.

319
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,020
You were forced out of your true self by Ji Bozai

320
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,380
and you used me to get out.

321
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,820
He is not as disgusting as you, a liar.

322
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,540
It seems that you remembered it.

323
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,100
Xun Ming,

324
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,340
I saw that you were incompetent

325
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,380
and couldn't accept the truth of your death.

326
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,900
That's why I helped you with a hand of kindness

327
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,060
and hid your true memory.

328
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,180
Why didn't you thank me

329
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,940
and fight against me?

330
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,340
Did you forget

331
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,300
that you were just a piece of shabby pieces

332
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,420
in front of the power of the beast?

333
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,340
The world has been broken.

334
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,860
Now you are just a strong enemy.

335
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,740
You are no longer of any use to me.

336
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,060
You think you can escape

337
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,860
the deserved punishment just because you killed me?

338
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,500
Even if I die,

339
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,700
you shouldn't live to see the end.

340
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,860
Work det counter attack?

341
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,460
Ever since the day we stopped spread the demon beast,

342
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,740
and I am willing to forever believe in it!

343
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,860
Your Highness, what you did

344
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,900
was not good enough for the clan to taint my glory.

345
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,340
Why did you

346
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:47,860
just expect to break into my house and sweep him?

347
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,340
Then you can't just do whatever you want.

348
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,660
If we want to let her die,

349
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,060
we will never have

350
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,660
I should be the one to correct the road.

351
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,540
Your Highness,

352
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,620
what's our next plan?

353
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,420
First, the order,

354
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,940
then the name.

355
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,340
If you avenge Bo Yulan,

356
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,820
I'll be the next one.

357
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,180
Now that you can fight for the Star-Castle.

358
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,340
We can't do anything to him.

359
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,500
To destroy him,

360
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,180
we must destroy his identity as a fighter first.

361
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,100
If I use this to Filan,

362
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,220
this protect the general and worst enemy of the joined Visit Tribes.

363
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,300
Like Bo Yunci.

364
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,900
As contract conditions,

365
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,820
I must come forward on this matter.

366
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,220
Let's meet at the Moon Qiuarlong Annals.

367
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,380
Alright, we'll talk later.

368
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:14,580
Bye.

369
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,820
exchange

370
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,620
I made the medicine for you.

371
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,100
How did we get out?

372
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,940
Thanks to your sudden help.

373
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,780
We got out after a long time.

374
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,020
The general of the Jixing Court

375
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,780
died at our wedding banquet.

376
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,380
The people of the Rebellion Hall should have come to ask.

377
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,420
Yes.

378
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
Thanks to you,

379
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,380
Mrs. Zhang was saved.

380
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,380
After she fully recovered,

381
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,660
she followed the Lord of Situ to the Rebellion Hall

382
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,020
to control the people

383
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,100
and harass the immortals and the primordial spirits

384
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,180
all over the place.

385
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,740
Later, Lord Han Feng arrived.

386
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,420
He said that the people were guilty of self-sacrifice in front of him.

387
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,460
The Rebellion Hall

388
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,220
was deprived of the identity of the general of the people.

389
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,860
It was completely occupied.

390
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,580
I finally died in the hands of Mu Qi Bai.

391
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,220
You already knew

392
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,660
who I was avenging.

393
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,300
Right?

394
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,860
Yes.

395
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,700
You asked Ruo Shui

396
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,740
to show your birth father's passport in public.

397
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,220
You didn't plan to hide yourself until the end.

398
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,260
I've been with you for so long.

399
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,300
I'm not stupid.

400
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,220
According to the current situation,

401
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,260
I'm afraid Mu Qi Bai already knew

402
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,300
that you wanted to judge those who harmed the Immortal Bo.

403
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,540
I'm not from the Rebellion Hall.

404
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,860
How can I judge?

405
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,620
You could have killed them all.

406
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,180
But you put so much effort

407
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,620
to search those iron evidences

408
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,500
and make them a crime.

409
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,700
Don't you think

410
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,580
they don't deserve to die in vain?

411
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,420
So you reminded Zhang Tai

412
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,380
how to control the Rebellion Hall

413
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,500
and kill them when they arrive at the Rebellion Hall.

414
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,180
Yes.

415
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,100
They harmed the innocent.

416
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,220
They took away the Immortal Bo

417
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,580
and suffered a lot.

418
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,460
They should be punished.

419
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,940
They are the real criminals.

420
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,660
Well,

421
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,820
when the illusion collapsed,

422
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,380
you could have let me go.

423
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,500
Why did you come back to save me?

424
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,220
Who knows?

425
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,660
Why are you laughing?

426
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,740
Do I need a reason to save you?

427
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,500
I'm a good man.

428
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
You know that.

429
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,140
I even want to return the fan

430
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,980
to Ming Xian.

431
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,220
He is my enemy.

432
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,020
When you fought with Ming Xian,

433
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,620
you were against Princess Tian Ji.

434
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
You had to fight.

435
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,740
According to your words,

436
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,140
you were a good man.

437
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,740
But you didn't want to fight

438
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,620
and let me poison Ming Xian.

439
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,260
That's what you think of me.

440
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,020
Why should I poison him?

441
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,980
If I want to win,

442
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,860
I just have to win him.

443
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,660
If I lose,

444
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,780
he won't have any choice.

445
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,820
I see.

446
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,620
Try heartily so he'll know

447
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,060
you are a good man.

448
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:22,740
What-

449
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,420
Protect Lord Ling from the murder of Man Man.

450
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,220
You should understand that

451
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,220
we were done riding the horse.

452
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,740
It's not a rival.

453
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,060
It's a villain.

454
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,460
It's a confidant.

455
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,100
You don't believe anyone, do you?

456
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,340
You won't believe anything

457
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,860
that is kept by outsiders in the mortal world.

458
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,900
Now that someone is willing to believe you,

459
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,620
I wonder if you can trust us more.

460
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,340
Η those wide dozen future matches

461
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,540
have to be broken by you.

462
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,760
I trust you.

463
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,840
Do you hurry up,

464
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,520
Lady Chai Chia is already asleep.

465
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,680
Someone is here.

466
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,560
Will res nowadays

467
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,280
call Imi Lim一起

468
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,520
find Ye Tan Wu Bri Hai to go with him?

469
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,360
He's just beingzen.

470
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,320
How does he mess around

471
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,880
which板

472
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,880
You are leaving Hua Yueye for so long.

473
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Have you forgotten how to act?

474
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
You...

475
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
guessed it?

476
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,880
What did I guess?

477
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,880
I guessed that you are not a philanderer.

478
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880
Or...

479
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
You are not...

480
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Mingyi.

481
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
Come.

482
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,880
I have to make the person who came see it more clearly.

483
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
You...

484
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
You are fooling me.

485
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880
You have a long eye.

486
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
How can you act?

487
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
You really are a philanderer.

488
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
I...

489
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
I...

490
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
I...

491
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
I...

492
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
I...

493
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
I...

494
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
I...

495
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
I...

496
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
I...

497
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
I...

498
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
I...

499
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
I...

500
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,880
I...

501
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
I...

502
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
I...

503
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
I...

504
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
You are really a philanderer.

505
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
You are responsible for being a philanderer.

506
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Where is there anyone?

507
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
You didn't leave.

508
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
There is no one at all.

509
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Who said there is no one?

510
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Didn't you act very well?

511
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Continue.

512
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,880
When you first brought me back to the Wu Gui Sea,

513
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
you were just trying to fool me like this, right?

514
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
The first night.

515
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
The fire on the first night.

516
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,880
It was also you who could have been the one to take it, right?

517
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Also, if the next morning,

518
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
I don't refuse you,

519
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
then...

520
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Yes.

521
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
At that time, I was thinking,

522
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,880
I could just make up something,

523
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,880
too much makeup,

524
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
too bad taste,

525
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
or say,

526
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
the smell is too fragrant.

527
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Mingyi,

528
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
if I say,

529
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
I treat you...

530
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
I treat you...

531
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
I treat you...

532
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
I treat you...

533
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
I treat you...

534
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
I treat you...

535
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,880
I treat you...

536
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
I treat you...

537
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,880
I treat you...

538
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,880
I treat you...

539
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,880
I treat you...

540
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880
I treat you...

541
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,880
I treat you...

542
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,880
I treat you...

543
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
I treat you...

544
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
I treat you...

545
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
I treat you...

546
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
I treat you...

547
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,880
I treat you...

548
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
I treat you...

549
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
I treat you...

550
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
I treat you...

551
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,880
I treat you...

552
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
I treat you...

553
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
I treat you...

554
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
I treat you...

555
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
I treat you...

556
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
I treat you...

557
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
I treat you...

558
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880
I treat you...

559
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,880
I treat you...

560
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,880
I treat you...

561
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,880
I treat you...

562
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
I treat you...

563
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
I treat you...

564
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
I treat you...

565
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
I treat you...

566
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
I treat you...

567
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
I treat you...

568
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
I treat you...

569
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,880
I treat you...

570
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880

573
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
I treat you...

574
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
I treat you...

575
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
I treat you...

576
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
I treat you...

577
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
I treat you...

578
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
I treat you...

579
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,880
I treat you...

580
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
I treat you...

581
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
I treat you...

582
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,880
I treat you...

583
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
I treat you...

584
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
I treat you...

585
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
I treat you...

586
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,880
I treat you...

587
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,880
I treat you...

588
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,880
Behind the abyss, struggling for a long time

589
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
I want to ask the sky

590
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,880
But this life is always for you

591
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,880
So what if I'm broken?

592
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
Fate has never been wrong

593
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,880
The sun will eventually fall

594
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,880
I fight against all the absurdity

595
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,880
How long will it take from the starry sky to your heart?

596
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,880
And all the tenderness you gave me is the poison of love

597
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,880
I drink my pain down

598
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,880
To exchange for your freedom

599
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,880
Once love has, it's better to let go

600
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
I drink my pain down

601
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,880
To exchange for your freedom

602
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Once love has, it's better to let go
