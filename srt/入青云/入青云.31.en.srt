1
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,160
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
<i>LOVE IN THE CLOUDS</i>

2
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,360
What about that child?

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,640
You mean

4
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,240
my child?

5
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,440
He is dead.

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,080
Back then, I ordered Bo Yulan
to take him somewhere safe

7
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,280
and protect him well.

8
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,400
But who could have known?

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,240
He died

10
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,400
on the way.

11
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,600
Retribution.

12
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,080
Retribution.

13
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,280
All of it is retribution.

14
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,840
He died?

15
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,680
That is the whole truth.

16
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,520
I have told you everything
you wanted to know.

17
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,760
You are not the real Ming Xian.
You are not my child.

18
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,520
The strict training, the harshness,

19
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,920
and the obsession with victory and defeat

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,960
were all because

21
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,960
you were merely
a tool to secure my position.

22
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,760
From the very beginning, I never once
saw you as my own child,

23
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,800
so I will not leave with you.

24
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,600
Go.

25
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,440
The fact that you are still alive now

26
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,880
means you have found a way
to suppress the Heavenly Grief.

27
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,440
Find a place and live in peace.

28
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Ming Xin will soon be
officially named Crown Prince.

29
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,160
Everything is set in stone.

30
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,720
To me

31
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,520
and to Yaoguang Mountain,

32
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,800
you are no longer of use.

33
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,680
Mother…

34
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,320
Someone's coming.

35
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
Master She has gone to hold them off.

36
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,000
We must leave at once.

37
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,160
Let's go.

38
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,360
Ming Xian?

39
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
Ming Xian!

40
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,120
Let's go.

41
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,560
- Find the intruders in Yaoguang Palace!
- There's an ambush.

42
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,240
They've taken Xin!

43
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,280
Don't let them leave
Yaoguang Palace alive!

44
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,320
It's Madam Meng.

45
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,000
Could we please leave now?

46
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,120
You little rascal!
How many times have I told you

47
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,600
not to go back on impulse?

48
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Why can't you ever listen?

49
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,560
No matter what happens, you just shake
that useless Messenger Bell!

50
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,560
Do you know how busy I am?

51
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,480
I've been running back
and forth because of you!

52
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
- Master She.
- What now?

53
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,640
I'm scolding my disciple.
Why are you stopping me?

54
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,640
Let go. If you don't, I'll hit you too!

55
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,560
What are you doing?

56
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,120
Looking all pitiful won't stop me
from punishing you.

57
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,040
I…

58
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,120
Oh my, I stewed a hen for you,
and now it's almost burned!

59
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,520
I know everything now.

60
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,480
Stop running, Old Man She.

61
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,760
Whenever you sneaked me scallion pancakes,

62
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Mother would punish me.

63
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,920
I thought she only
feared I'd grow spoiled.

64
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,040
But now I know she was afraid

65
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,080
that if I got too close to you, I'd see

66
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
that the way you treated me

67
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,560
was how real parents
would treat their child.

68
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,960
You…

69
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,600
you're my real…

70
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,400
my… my real…

71
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,040
Come.

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,080
I'll take you somewhere.

73
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,159
The Bo clan's ancestral home?
Zhangwei Mountain?

74
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,159
Isn't it said that only
descendants of the Bo clan can enter?

75
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,280
I built this place.

76
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
Master,

77
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,480
you… you built an exact replica of
the Bo clan's ancestral home?

78
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,200
I couldn't enter the real one,

79
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,720
so this was the only way

80
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,040
I could have
a residence that belonged to her.

81
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,960
Here,

82
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,280
I can preserve

83
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,240
the most precious
memories of your mother and me.

84
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,120
Come on.

85
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,800
Here, my child.

86
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,760
Years ago, your mother Bo Yucen

87
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,720
and her sister Bo Yulan

88
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,840
escaped from Zhangwei Mountain.

89
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,480
By chance, I saved them.

90
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,560
Then your mother and I grew close,

91
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,360
and in time,

92
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,440
we had you.

93
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,080
But misfortune struck.
The Empress discovered our relationship.

94
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,120
For a warrior to consort with a fairy
from another realm was a grave offense.

95
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,840
I was thrown into prison.

96
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,840
By the time I was released,

97
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,720
it'd become far too
late to change anything.

98
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,440
You

99
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,520
had been recognized by
the Emperor as his eldest son,

100
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,840
and there was no turning back.

101
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,280
I could only promise the Empress

102
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,600
that I would never
to reveal the truth to you

103
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,120
in exchange for
a chance to stay by your side.

104
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,120
So,

105
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,160
I trained tirelessly,

106
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,200
rising from an ordinary warrior

107
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,160
to the Venerable of the warrior ranks,

108
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,240
and eventually, your master.

109
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,960
I remember

110
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,960
◘you once said you knew
nothing of forging artifacts.

111
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
And since Yaoguang Mountain
despised such craft,

112
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
there was no skilled
Forger who could teach me.

113
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,360
But I loved forging.

114
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,200
So you studied it on your own,

115
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,440
just so I could learn more.

116
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,760
You gave me all the best things.

117
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,840
How could I not have known…?

118
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,600
Father.

119
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,040
Daughter.

120
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,000
My daughter.

121
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,400
Father.

122
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,120
Yucen, did you hear that?

123
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,360
This is our daughter.

124
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,920
Daughter.

125
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,920
My daughter!

126
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,120
Do you know

127
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,200
what I've been through all these years?

128
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,000
Do you have any idea?

129
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,240
Old Man She, this is the first time
I've seen you cry like this.

130
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,240
Don't cry, Father.

131
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,440
This is so embarrassing.
I must not cry. It's too embarrassing.

132
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,320
A father shouldn't cry like this.

133
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,400
It's not embarrassing.

134
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I feel like I forgot something important.

135
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Right.

136
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,360
You wrote in your message

137
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,840
that Ming Xin had been colluding
with Zhushui Spiritual State.

138
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,760
Is that true?

139
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,120
I sensed the spiritual power

140
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,120
of Zhushui Spiritual State
within his spiritual veins.

141
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,440
He also admitted it himself

142
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,400
that the Emperor of
Zhushui told him about my identity.

143
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,640
Then… isn't this bad?

144
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,240
If the Emperor of
Zhushui knows who you are,

145
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,600
he will surely take action.

146
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,120
And there's something even worse.

147
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,560
Ming Xin and the Emperor
of Zhushui are working together.

148
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,360
If Ming Xin truly becomes Crown Prince,

149
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,640
Yaoguang Mountain will be doomed.

150
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,000
And two days from now,

151
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,600
Father will hold
Ming Xin's investiture ceremony.

152
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
Yes, he has fallen into our hands,

153
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,400
but I am not Ming Xian.

154
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,080
Even if we bring him down,

155
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,400
what will become of Yaoguang Mountain?

156
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,120
The Emperor of Zhushui
had Mu Qibai raise netherbeasts

157
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,760
and has already gained immense power.

158
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,560
Why is he still going
to such lengths to make

159
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,440
the Heavenly Grief and
the Golden Millet Dream?

160
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,000
What else do you know?

161
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,800
I've told you everything I know!

162
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,880
Ji Bozai, you animal!

163
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,760
Is the Soul-seizing Technique
the only thing you can use?

164
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,840
Not necessarily.

165
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,160
There are plenty more
ways to make you suffer.

166
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,640
I came from the Sunken Abyss.

167
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,320
That place has no
shortage of torture methods.

168
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,480
The most unique one

169
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,360
is burning someone with Phantom Fire.

170
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,400
Your skin will be peeled away bit by bit,

171
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,680
rotting and scabbing

172
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,880
over and over again,

173
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,480
until a scar
that can never heal is formed.

174
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,640
Here it is.

175
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,240
Want to try it?

176
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,680
No…

177
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll talk!

178
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
I think they have another plan anyway.

179
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,480
The Heavenly Grief
and the Golden Millet Dream

180
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,520
aren't just
for winning the Qingyun Tournament.

181
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,960
Right,

182
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,640
I once overheard them talking

183
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,520
about something inside the Zhuojin Tower,

184
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,320
something called
the Sky-Swallowing Array, I think.

185
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,960
That's all I know.

186
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,440
Would they really share their secrets
with an outsider like me?

187
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,880
You should've said that sooner.

188
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,560
Come to think of it,

189
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,960
since I am not the real Ming Xian,

190
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,240
I have no ties
to Yaoguang Mountain anymore,

191
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,120
which means

192
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,120
its future has nothing to do with me now.

193
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,040
None of this concerns me now.

194
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,359
If even the Warrior Goddess
who brought it seven consecutive victories

195
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,480
has no say in its future,

196
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,839
then who has?

197
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,359
Ming Yi and Ming Xian.

198
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,960
Those are just names.

199
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,920
You grew up as Ming Xian, didn't you?

200
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
True, you are not the Empress's son,

201
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,480
but wasn't it you who fought

202
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,319
for Yaoguang Mountain
and protected its people?

203
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
You wish to fight for
peace among the Six Realms

204
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,240
and make the Qingyun Tournament
fair again.

205
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,360
Are you going to give up
just because you're not Ming Xian?

206
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
Whether you are a foolish girl

207
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,160
or a reckless boy,

208
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,800
a wise fairy or a stubborn fool,

209
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,000
what difference does it make?

210
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,080
As long as you can face heaven
and earth with no shame in your heart,

211
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,440
you are who you are.

212
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,040
Ming Yi.

213
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
Remember this:

214
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,680
you are my disciple,

215
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,400
the best child
your mother and I could've hoped for,

216
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,400
and someone with an unyielding spirit.

217
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Do you understand?

218
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,240
I took the portrait of Fairy Bo
and visited the places she had once been.

219
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,440
To my surprise, someone
at the border of Yaoguang recognized her.

220
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
They said that when Fairy Bo was alive,

221
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,000
she often came there to gather herbs

222
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,280
and would ask about a child
with a mark between his brows.

223
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,840
So,

224
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,520
when Master saved
me from the Sunken Abyss,

225
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,280
it wasn't by chance.

226
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,440
Perhaps Fairy Bo always knew

227
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,080
who you truly were.

228
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,600
Then maybe

229
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,440
when Master said she owed me,

230
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,480
it wasn't just because
she kept secrets from me,

231
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,200
but also because…

232
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,760
After Fairy Bo gave me the recipe,

233
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,480
I begged her to meet with you.

234
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
But she said she owed you,

235
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,320
and that she'd hidden
the truth right before your eyes,

236
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,080
somewhere within your reach.

237
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,600
But the truth was unbearable.

238
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,080
She feared that once you learned it,

239
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,080
you would lose faith
in people and in the world.

240
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,160
Somewhere within my reach?

241
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,000
Father, did you say

242
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,520
this place held the most precious memories
of you and Mother?

243
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,120
The portraits left
behind by the Bo clan after death

244
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,040
carry the memories of their owners.

245
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,800
The memories of how your mother and I met

246
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,280
are within this painting.

247
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,080
Master said the truth

248
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,360
was somewhere within my reach.

249
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,120
If not for you,

250
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,320
the Empress would never
have plotted to take my sister's child.

251
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,000
Father, do you know

252
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,440
if the child Fairy Bo Yulan sent away,

253
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,160
the Empress's own son,

254
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,920
really died?

255
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,680
When Yulan returned,
she told the Empress herself

256
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,240
that the child did
not survive the journey.

257
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,240
I escorted the young
prince away as ordered,

258
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,520
but he was too frail.

259
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,320
He died

260
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,640
on the way.

261
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
I failed in my duty.

262
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,400
Punish me as you will.

263
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,960
Retribution.

264
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,200
It is retribution indeed.

265
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,760
Retribution!

266
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,800
<i>But Mother and I</i>

267
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,320
were her last
remaining family in the world.

268
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,760
Mother died giving birth,

269
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,280
and the Empress took me in as her own.

270
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Did she really accept that task willingly,

271
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,240
without a single word of complaint?

272
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,960
The Empress used you as leverage.
She had no choice but to obey.

273
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,240
After learning the child had died,

274
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,560
the Empress once searched for
a child with a mark between the brows,

275
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,880
but she found none
that bore her son's presence.

276
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,880
You once said you had
a mark on your forehead.

277
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
I think

278
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,440
my mother planted it there
when I was still an infant.

279
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,760
It holds some vague memories of her.

280
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,760
I can't see her face clearly,

281
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,080
but she told me

282
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,920
this mark

283
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,480
was formed from her blood and mine.

284
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,960
I, too, once suspected

285
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,440
that Yulan might have killed that child.

286
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,920
The Empress had her doubts as well.

287
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,920
But

288
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,600
since you were the Empress's only hope,

289
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,440
they each had something to lose

290
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,320
and could no longer
turn against each other.

291
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,800
What is that mark between the brows?

292
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,240
The Empress wished to reunite
with her own son one day,

293
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,160
so she left
a Tracing Mark between his brows.

294
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,640
Then could Fairy Bo

295
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,160
have temporarily sealed that mark,

296
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,520
causing the Empress to
believe her child had died?

297
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,040
With the Bo clan's arts,

298
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,320
it could be done for a short while.

299
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,520
Your Lordship, you are actually
the son of the Empress of Yaoguang.

300
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,240
Fairy Bo risked her life to save you,

301
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
yet it was she herself
who abandoned you back then,

302
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,320
leaving you to grow up in the Sunken Abyss

303
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,160
as a prisoner.

304
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,880
Yesterday, my husband went
to the Sunken Abyss to deliver food.

305
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,000
He said he saw a poor child down there.

306
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,800
He looked barely ten years old.

307
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,000
Right.

308
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,760
I heard he'd been
there since he was little.

309
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
He must've been taken there.

310
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,160
When they beat him,

311
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,520
didn't a mark appear on his forehead?

312
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,320
Yes.

313
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,960
But it didn't seem
like the overseers left it there.

314
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,400
Maybe his family did.

315
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,280
That makes sense.

316
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,680
- Come on, let's gather herbs over there.
- All right.

317
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,760
<i>I must find him and atone for my sin.</i>

318
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,880
The portrait caught fire on its own.

319
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,240
Your Lordship.

320
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,640
Your Lordship, your heart
imprint resonated with Ming Yi's.

321
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,400
You're doing this
so she wouldn't see this, right?

322
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,280
Your Lordship.

323
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,280
There have been signs
that the Heavenly Grief in you

324
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,720
might stir again.

325
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,480
You must take care of yourself.

326
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm fine.

327
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,840
Wait!

328
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,080
You came after all.

329
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,880
I never thought

330
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,160
I would see you again.

331
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,000
Why are you turning away?

332
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,520
What I came to confirm

333
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,800
has already been confirmed.

334
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,800
It was my fault.

335
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,560
I truly believed

336
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,640
that you were gone.

337
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,040
I heard

338
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,280
you had fallen into the Sunken Abyss.

339
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,760
Do you not want to see me

340
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,200
because you still resent me?

341
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,600
I hold no resentment.

342
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,600
I lived 20 years
without my parents around.

343
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,520
Meeting you today

344
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,760
was unexpected for me as well.

345
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,040
But right now, you are just

346
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,560
a stranger in my eyes.

347
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,640
I know

348
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,360
I have failed as a mother.

349
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,360
But tell me, is there
anything I can still do for you?

350
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,960
Ming…

351
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,880
My child…

352
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,680
Your Lordship,

353
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,760
as you instructed,

354
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,080
I turned a blind eye

355
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,720
and let Madam Meng rescue Ming Xin.

356
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,000
The investiture ceremony is approaching.

357
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,280
Letting him escape

358
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,400
is necessary for my next move.

359
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,760
Your Lordship already has a plan in mind.
It is not my place to say more.

360
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,160
But please remember this:

361
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,880
no matter what happens,

362
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,160
you must not open the Spirit Well

363
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,120
until your spiritual
power is fully restored.

364
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,240
Otherwise,

365
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,280
you might really suffer a relapse.

366
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,000
Everyone,

367
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,320
today is the Sunlight Festival.

368
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,760
We give thanks to the gods for blessing
Yaoguang Mountain with the gift of light.

369
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,000
Today also marks
the investiture ceremony of Ming Xin.

370
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,560
From this day forth,

371
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,640
Lord Chengyun will be formally
named Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain

372
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,640
and assume the post of
Honorary Warrior of the warrior ranks.

373
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,800
This decision is final.

374
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,320
Wait!

375
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,040
- Who is that?
- No idea.

376
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,640
What's going on?

377
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,800
- That mask…
- That's Ming Xian's mask.

378
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,800
- That's strange.
- But this is a fairy.

379
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,360
Right. Is she…?

380
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,320
Why is she wearing Ming Xian's mask?

381
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,360
Is she Ming Xian?

382
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,760
- I don't know.
- Ming Xian?

383
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,400
- Who is she really?
- Is she Ming Xian?

384
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,679
- I don't think so.
- She… She…

385
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,120
- Isn't that a fairy?
- Yeah.

386
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,040
That's a fairy.

387
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,760
- But why is she wearing Ming Xian's mask?
- Ming Xian?

388
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,920
- She really is Ming Xian!
- She's Ming Xian?

389
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

390
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,120
- How can Ming Xian be female?
- Exactly.

391
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,679
Sinner Ming Xian!

392
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,560
You defected from Yaoguang Mountain,

393
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,080
and yet you still have
the audacity to interrupt my investiture?

394
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,840
Very well.

395
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,760
Today, before everyone,

396
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,400
I will expose your true identity!

397
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,920
Father,

398
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,239
the evidence is undeniable.

399
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,080
Even if the Empress refuses to admit it,

400
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,360
the truth is already before us.

401
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,080
Back then, the Empress, Jing Shu,

402
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,800
used an infant girl to
impersonate the Crown Prince!

403
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,520
- What?
- She did?

404
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,920
How dare she?

405
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,840
Is this true?

406
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,200
- Unbelievable!
- How could that be?

407
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,920
Lord Chengyun is right.

408
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,360
I am indeed a fairy.

409
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,600
Years ago, the Empress defied
the laws and practiced immortal arts,

410
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,560
disguising me as a male immortal to take
the real Crown Prince's place.

411
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,560
- She actually did that?
- How could this happen?

412
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,920
You deceived His Majesty. What audacity.

413
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,040
Your Majesty,

414
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,480
if it became known
that this jinx impersonated

415
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,240
the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain

416
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,520
and fought in the Qingyun Tournament

417
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,680
for eight consecutive
years, wouldn't it make

418
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,360
Yaoguang Mountain a laughingstock?

419
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,520
Naming Ming Xin Crown Prince today will be

420
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,960
what truly makes
Yaoguang Mountain a laughingstock.

421
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,240
In my hand is the Recording Mirror.

422
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,440
It holds proof of
Ming Xin's collusion with other realms.

423
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,360
He took the Heavenly Grief from Mu Qibai

424
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,880
and poisoned me
before the Qingyun Tournament,

425
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,320
causing Yaoguang Mountain's defeat.

426
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,720
Here's the Heavenly Grief you need.

427
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,200
Thank you, Lord Hanfeng.

428
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,200
With this Heavenly Grief,

429
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,840
Ming Xian

430
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,640
will no longer be
the Warrior God of Yaoguang Mountain.

431
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,440
Now, he has become
a pawn of Zhushui Spiritual State

432
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,560
and even schemes to have
the Emperor of Zhushui help him

433
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,360
secure the Crown Prince's seat.

434
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,880
If we allow Ming Xin to
show a wolf into the house,

435
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,960
who is to say
the Emperor of Zhushui will not divide

436
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,560
and devour
Yaoguang Mountain piece by piece?

437
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,960
Your Majesty,

438
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,960
Ming Xin did everything for you
and for Yaoguang Mountain.

439
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,080
Please don't be swayed
by the one-sided words of this jinx

440
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,000
and leave Yaoguang Mountain
without a Crown Prince.

441
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,160
Besides,

442
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,080
whose blood runs in this fairy's veins

443
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,720
remains to be verified, doesn't it?

444
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,880
Who I am no longer matters.

445
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,080
I came here today

446
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,320
to help Yaoguang Mountain

447
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,840
welcome back its true Crown Prince.

448
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,800
What do you mean?

449
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,560
Lord Chengyun,

450
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,000
what you said earlier was only half true.

451
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,280
Back then, after
the Empress gave birth to her son,

452
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,280
she discovered
that he had no spiritual veins.

453
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,720
So she found another child

454
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,320
born on the same day
within the Yaoguang Palace

455
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,080
and secretly switched them.

456
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,960
The real Crown Prince

457
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,240
was kidnapped by
bandits on his way to the border

458
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,040
of Yaoguang Mountain

459
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,360
and ended up in
the Sunken Abyss of Jixing.

460
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,840
There, he suffered endless torment

461
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,440
and was afflicted with the Heavenly Grief,

462
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,920
which later awakened
spiritual veins within him.

463
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,200
His spiritual veins
were formed after birth?

464
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,120
Then that man is the real Crown Prince!

465
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,520
Right!

466
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,480
Then who is that child?

467
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Ji Bozai?

468
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,240
Yes. What is he doing here?

469
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,560
- Ji Bozai?
- He's here too?

470
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,360
Why is he here?

471
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,560
What is his relation to Ming Xian?

472
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,760
Your Majesty.

473
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,880
Your Majesty!

474
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
Are you truly…?

475
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,440
Before sending the child away,

476
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,160
the Empress left a mark

477
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,240
between his brows with her own blood.

478
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,440
- How can that be proven?
- Yes.

479
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,480
Is it really him?

480
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,680
- Is he really…?
- It really is him!

481
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,120
It's him!

482
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,040
Nonsense!

483
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,560
You two conspired to deceive His Majesty

484
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,480
just to stop me

485
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,480
from becoming
Yaoguang Mountain's Crown Prince!

486
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,520
- Xin…
- On the basis of a single mark,

487
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,080
you claim Ji Bozai is
the true Crown Prince?

488
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,320
How utterly ridiculous!

489
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,360
If my father, She Tianlin, testifies,

490
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,360
might that prove it?

491
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,680
Before Your Majesty, I would not dare lie.

492
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,560
Ji Bozai is indeed the Empress's son,

493
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,960
while Ming Xian is
the child of me and a physician.

494
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,840
All right.

495
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,240
Everything is clear now.

496
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,480
Yaoguang Mountain has at
last seen its true Crown Prince.

497
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,240
Shall we proceed with
the investiture ceremony?

498
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,160
Ming Xian!

499
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,040
Xin!

500
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,160
Xin.

501
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,240
Your Majesty.

502
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
Your Majesty,

503
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,680
for the sake of
the years you've shared with Xin,

504
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,880
please spare him this once.

505
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,120
Ming Xin and his mother
colluded with Zhushui Spiritual State.

506
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,880
The evidence is conclusive.
They shall face the Ultimate Punishment!

507
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,600
Your Majesty,
this has nothing to do with Xin.

508
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,640
It was all my fault.

509
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,840
He knew nothing.

510
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,440
Let me take the punishment instead.

511
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,040
He is your flesh and blood.

512
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,680
I beg you, spare him this once.

513
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,520
As his mother,

514
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,840
were you truly
unaware of your son's deeds?

515
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,200
How dare you plead for him before me?

516
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,520
That Recording Mirror

517
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,680
holds solid evidence
of Ming Xin's involvement.

518
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,080
Wretch!

519
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,000
- Seize them both!
- Yes!

520
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,760
As for the Empress of Yaoguang,

521
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,280
strip her of rank at once.

522
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,520
Since she is
the Crown Prince's birth mother,

523
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,800
she shall not be executed.

524
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,480
Confine her to the palace for now.

525
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,040
I will decide her fate later.

526
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,520
As for She Tianlin and Ming Yi,

527
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,560
they deceived all of Yaoguang Mountain.

528
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,320
Their crimes are unforgivable.

529
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,520
She Tianlin shall face
the Thunder Punishment,

530
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,480
and Ming Yi shall be
stripped of her spiritual veins

531
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,920
and banished from the realm.

532
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,800
- Guards!
- Yes!

533
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,320
Seize them!

534
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,200
Wait.

535
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,080
Why not let the two of them go?

536
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,680
Now that I have returned,
punishing them seems pointless.

537
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,160
No.

538
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,760
If we let them go,
how can we command respect?

539
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,280
We cannot show mercy just because she once

540
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,760
stood as Crown Prince.

541
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,320
Besides, Ming Yi has
immense spiritual power.

542
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,200
We cannot risk her fleeing to the enemy.

543
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,720
For the welfare of
Yaoguang Mountain and its people,

544
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,440
I have no choice but
