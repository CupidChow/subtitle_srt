Your Lordship,

this scroll that Ming Yi gave you

272
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,770
was indeed altered by a Yaoguang spell,

273

but I don't have the skill

the entire Upper Third Realm was part of that.

At the end of the day, she's on their side.

282

283
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,250
never to let

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,700

285

286
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,330
how far human greed would go

for the medicine.

288

Be it Mu Qibai

290
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,140
or those from Yaoguang Mountain who took part,

291
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,660
none of them was the true culprit.

292
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,730
The Emperor of Zhushui

293
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,490
was the first to strike at the Bo clan,

294
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,660
and he's been secretly controlling Mu Qibai ever since.

295

happen again.

Your Lordship, if you intend to go after the Emperor of Zhushui,

299
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,490
I'll be right by your side.

300
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,530

304

Silly child,

308
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,530
how could you use your spiritual veins like that?

309
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,620
Master She, I heard you once fought as a warrior

310
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,010
and later became a physician.

311
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,700
You must understand Ming Yi's condition better than anyone.

312
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,940
Ming Yi once suspected

313
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,250
that Zhushui Spiritual State's Soul-seizing Technique

314
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,940
might suppress the Heavenly Grief.

315
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,530
I searched the old texts and found

316
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,530
that it wasn't the technique alone that restrained the aftereffects.

317
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,490
When those of Zhushui Spiritual State

318
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,770
used the technique,

319
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,010
they channeled their spiritual power directly into her spiritual veins.

320
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,620
That was what suppressed Heavenly Grief's aftereffects.

321
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,860
But only

322
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,010
people from Zhushui Spiritual State know this method.

323
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,460
Very well.

324
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,810
I'll storm the Zhushui Palace,

325
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,290
catch a few men there,

326
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,660
and force them to cast the spell to save her.

327
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,940
So all it takes is to inject spiritual power

328
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,770
into her spiritual veins using Zhushui's secret art?

329
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,700
Yes.

he is from Zhushui Spiritual State?

00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,530
No.

344
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,460
But if you'd cared about me a little more,

345
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,250
you would've remembered

346
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,900
which realm's robe I wore

347
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,730
the day we first met.

348
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,330
You never asked me,

349
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,420
so I supposed

350
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,140
my background

351
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,730
didn't matter to you.

352
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,010
Ming Yi,

353
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,780
you really don't remember.

354
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,170
Otherwise, you would've known

355
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,420
that I wore a robe

356
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,010
common across the Six Realms that day.

357
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,420
I guessed right.

358
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,460
Why did you

359
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,530
come to Jixing Abyss?

360
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,300
The Golden Millet Dream.

361
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,980
The Golden Millet Dream?

362
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,940
In Zhushui Spiritual State, might makes right.

363
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,380
Without spiritual veins,

364
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,650
I could only

365
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,490
live like a servant there.

366
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,300
So I escaped to seek the Golden Millet Dream.

367
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,940
That is all.

368
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,780
But Ming Yi,

369
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,380
after we met again,

370
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,780
I gave up any thought

371
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,380
of taking the Golden Millet Dream for myself.

372
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,170
I'll go to Ji Bozai now

373
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,690
and bring the Golden Millet Dream to you.

374
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,940
Don't go!

375
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,300
You must not go.

376
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,460
Don't go.

377
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,260
- Ming Yi. - Ming Yi.

378
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,170
Ming Yi.

379
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,460
Don't go to him.

380
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,420
Even now, you're still

381
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,380
acting in his interest?

382
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,780
The Golden Millet Dream is the only cure for you.

383
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,940
If he refuses to give it,

384
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,310
I will kill him and take it!

385
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,820
Ji Bozai doesn't have the Golden Millet Dream.

386
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,090
He spread false news

387
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,210
to lure

388
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,570
those who covet it.

389
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,490
He never had the antidote.

390
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,260
He doesn't have it?

391
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,210
Then what should we do?

392
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,980
What else can I do?

393
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,610
How can I save you?

394
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,170
Your Highness.

395
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,340
Why are you here?

396
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,650
I came to report on the recovery

397
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,260
of those injured in the battle with the netherbeasts.

398
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,210
Everyone within the Jixing Palace has recovered.

399
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,610
The prescriptions

400
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,530
sent to Huansha Market for the common folk have also taken effect.

401
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,010
The warriors at Shouhua Academy

402
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,130
are nearly all healed

403
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,340
and can resume training tomorrow.

404
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,260
Is there anything else?

405
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,980
No, Your Highness.

406
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,610
I'll take my leave.

407
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,210
Yan Xiao.

408
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,420
You're always like this.

409
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,900
You feared my father would be in danger,

410
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,490
so you chose to lie to me.

411
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,740
You feared my uncle would harm me,

412
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,490
so you allied with Ji Bozai while keeping me in the dark.

413
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,940
You always do what you think is best for me,

414
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,010
but you've never once asked me

415
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,260
if that's what I truly want.

416
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,130
I just...

417
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,690
I just wanted to protect you.

418
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,090
Protect me?

419
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,300
Your Highness.

420
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,860
Your Highness, why are you crying?

421
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,090
Did someone hurt you?

422
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,980
Tell me.

423
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,010
I'll go teach them a lesson.

424
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,210
Jixing Abyss lost at the Qingyun Tournament again.

425
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,900
Once again, we get no Blessed Rain.

426
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,530
Look,

427
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,860
my Blessing Flowers are withering.

428
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,490
Back when the Empress was alive,

429
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,860
she planted these with the Emperor.

430
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,690
I promise I'll heal them for you.

431
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,650
Xiao!

432
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,260
The Blessing Flowers have bloomed!

433
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,610
How did you do it?

434
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,570
Without the Blessed Rain's nourishment,

435
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,260
how could they bloom?

436
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,940
The ways of healing are universal.

437
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,940
Curing plants isn't much different from curing people.

438
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,460
But

439
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,090
isn't it difficult

440
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,210
to make them bloom without the Blessed Rain?

441
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,090
No,

442
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,980
not at all.

443
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,650
This isn't protection.

444
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,530
It's just you doing what you think is right.

445
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,090
Just like this.

446
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,900
Blessing Flowers wither

447
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,940
after the Prayer Night

448
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,650
and bloom again the following year.

449
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,980
But this pot, the one my mother left me,

450
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,460
has bloomed all year round.

451
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,380
I once thought

452
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,940
you'd found some special herb or artifact to sustain it.

453
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,740
Only today did I find out

454
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,610
you'd been feeding it with your own blood.

455
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,260
Your Highness, you're back.

456
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,380
It's the only thing the Empress left you.

457
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,530
I didn't want you to feel sad watching the flowers wither.

458
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,530
But if this is the price,

459
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,260
do you really think I'd still want that?
