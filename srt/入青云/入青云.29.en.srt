Congratulations on soon obtaining the Golden Millet Dream

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,900
and ruling the Six Realms, Your Majesty.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,850
Save the flattery.

26
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,490
I called you here because I have

27
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,850
an important task for you.

28
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,660
You have been

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,740
obsessively searching

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,900
for your missing brother, Ming Xian.

31
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,460
Do you know where he is now?

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,930
Does Your Majesty know where he is?

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,380
It's no wonder you couldn't find him.

34
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,460
Who would have imagined

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,500
that Ming Xian, Yaoguang Mountain's Warrior God, the winner seven years running,

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,730
would actually be a fairy?

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,380
She fled into enemy territory, Jixing Abyss,

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,570
and even degraded herself

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,500
by marrying Ji Bozai.

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,170
Ming Xian

41
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,450
is the little fairy beside Ji Bozai?

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,940
Ming Xian went to Zhangwei Mountain,

43
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,290
broke through the Zhulong Barrier,

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,410
and took "Bo's Medical Classics."

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,980
So, the blood flowing through her

46
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,820
must be from the Bo clan.

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,540
How can that be?

48
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,060
I didn't summon you here

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,220
to have you foolishly ask how that is possible.

50
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,260
I have managed to manipulate the outcome of the drawing

51
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,850
so that the tea gathering will be held at Yaoguang Mountain.

52
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,170
That is your territory. You know what to do.

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,380
Ming Xian will attend the tea gathering

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,850
together with Ji Bozai.

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,690
You will investigate her background,

56
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,220
capture her alive,

57
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,890
and bring her to me.

58

Understood.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,890
You know how to use the Soul-seizing Technique, right?

60
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,450
I will not fail you, Your Majesty.

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,500
So Father has suspected Ming Xian's background all along.

Then grow stronger.

64

Make yourself the only one by Ming Yi's side.

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,050
That way, you can protect her,

66
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,100
possess her,

67
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,850

72

Lord Chengyun,

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,050
you were the one who forcefully broke the array at Jixing Abyss

77
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,220
and tried to enter my Judgment Hall,

78

weren't you?

79
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,660

what is it you really want from me?

83
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,340
You were present when my father and I

84
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,660
spoke that day.

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,100
You must have heard everything.

86

Now, in all Six Realms,

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,490
I am the only one who knows the recipe for the Golden Millet Dream.

89
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,140
I first

90
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,490
need more vagrants.

91

If you can lend me a hand in this,

92
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,100
then once I've refined the Golden Millet Dream,

93
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,700
I could consider sharing more of both the Golden Millet Dream

94
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,900

95
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,780

100

want the throne of Zhushui.

102

When the time comes,

103
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,900
we can form an alliance

104
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,100
and get

105
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,900
all Six Realms under our control.

106
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,060

in an old ruler nearing his end

116
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,130
or choose to side with someone who promises you a future?

117

Since you're offering the Golden Millet Dream,

and figure out her true identity,

122

I'd like you to bring her to me first.

and a Yaoguang Mountain warrior says,

147

You didn't show up for the meal,

just to avoid paying the bill?"

What a brilliant, sarcastic remark.

154
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,500
Was I being sarcastic?

155
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,780
I didn't mean to.

but leaves you out.

What do you do?

160
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,850
Tianji would never do that.

161

The Emperor of Zhushui sees you

at the tea gathering and says,

165
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,330
"The youth are impressive.

166
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,850
Looks like I'm really getting old."

167

How do you respond?

168
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,780
The Emperor of Zhushui is over 100 years old.

169

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,660
Can you two

172
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,610
stop laughing now?

173
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,780
Even your poses are the same.

174
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,450
I didn't want to keep bothering you,

175
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,180
so I asked someone else to help me practice discernment.

176
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,380
Is that really so funny?

177
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,300
Yes, it is.

178
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,900
All right, come on, sit down.

179
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,180
Sit down.

180
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,540
Listen to me.

181
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,690
If you keep practicing,

182
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,570
you'll definitely

183
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,090
improve over time.

184
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,140
I believe in you.

185
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,020
But I'm so worried.

186
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,660
I caused so much trouble for Ji Bozai last time.

187
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,420
At the tea gathering,

188
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,610
if someone from Yaoguang Mountain

189
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,970
asks you to pass something to Ji Bozai like last time,

190
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,060
will you still do it without hesitation?

191
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,260
Of course not.

192
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,090
I'll check it at least eight or ten times first.

193
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,970
That's the spirit!

194
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,210
See? You've made great progress.

195
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,420
Right.

196
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,090
It seems my recent efforts have paid off.

197
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,180
I'll go find Chen Xi to help me practice more.

198
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,090
See you.

199
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,690
By the way, this is for you.

200
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,180
It's just a habit of mine. I wanted to make you happy.

201
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,380
Of course I'm happy.

202
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,430
Silly.

203
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,570
Thanks.

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,060
We three will always be the best of friends,

205
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,700
right?

206
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,580
Of course.

207
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,180
Of course.

208
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,100
Here.

On the way,

212
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,580
quiz me some more.

213
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,580
No problem.

214
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,610
Can the boat carriage carry all this stuff?

215
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,580
No matter how much, it'll fit.

216
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,820
Be careful, Chen Xi.

217
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,890
I've read about so many places

218
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,650
in Yaoguang Mountain

219
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,100
to eat good food and have fun.

220
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,580
There's even a market

221
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,370
that only opens around the Sunlight Festival at Yaoguang Mountain.

222
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,530
It's said to be a must-visit spot for the immortal couples there.

223
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,730
Let's share a boat carriage together,

224
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,060
and I'll tell you all about it.

225
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,420
Are you sure I need you to tell me about it?

226
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,060
Right, I forgot you were from Yaoguang Mountain.

227
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,460
She's taking my boat carriage.

228
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,490
Immortal Ji, I know

229
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,530
you don't want to be apart from her for a single moment,

230
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,420
but you should still ask her what she wants.

231
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,100
Of course.

232
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,130
But Fairy Zhang Tai,

233
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,180
I want to ask Ming Yi about...

234
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,490
some matters regarding artifacts.

235
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,770
That's right.

236
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,250
I've always been very interested in artifacts.

237
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,010
And since, to the outside world,

238
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,250
she's still my wife,

239
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,850
traveling with me

240
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,010
will prevent anyone from suspecting her identity,

241
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,850
right?

242
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,060
That's hard to refute.

243
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,820
But I've seen through you.

244
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,300
I still want to share a boat carriage with you.

- We'll get there in no time. - Master,

The first event of the tea gathering

256
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,650
is tomorrow's spiritual power test.

257
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,580
The spiritual power stone will assess

258
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,890
each warrior's spiritual power level

259
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,490
so the others can adjust their strategies accordingly.

260
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,580
I heard the test would be followed by a travelers' competition.

Warriors can't participate.

go to the warriors' base

272

and report the list of warriors for the test.

No tasks for you for now. Get some rest.

Your Lordship, aren't you worried you'll end up with nothing?

not for anything else.

282
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,010
Hesitation suggests fear.

283
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,250
What I want

284
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,490
is for her to choose me

285
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,890

286
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,100
But what if she doesn't dare?

287
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,820
She is Ming Xian.

288
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,370
What is there to fear?

289
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,580
She just needs time to understand.

290
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,670
Then...

291
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,300
Enough. The competition begins tomorrow.

He made a mistake at the Qingyun Two-Realm Tournament.

The Emperor of Zhushui

298

sentenced him to be bitten by a fish monster in the stomach

299
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,010
and stripped him of his warrior status.

300
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,330
After that, he went completely mad.

301

A hundred and thirty-two.

That's still not enough to make me more powerful.

Of course I came.

I wrote you so many letters,

with phrases like "got it" or "I see."

Really.

333
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,220
I'm just not good with words,

334
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,980
so I've been focusing on training,

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,380
You like me!

341
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,330
Of course.

342
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,900
Preparing for the test

343
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,220
won't take too much time.

344
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,220
We rarely get a chance to leave Jixing Abyss.

345
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,140
We should take this opportunity to look around.

346
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,290
Come take a look, young immortal.

347
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,810
These artifacts are finely crafted.

348
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,250
Pick one you like.

349
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,980
I'll buy it for you.

350
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,330
No merit, no reward.

351
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,530
Just choose one.

352
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,900
You helped Yangqiu practice discernment earlier,

353
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,490
so you're half his master.

354
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,570
Think of this as his tuition fee.

355
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,250
What do you say?

356
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,140
But...

357
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,580
No buts.

358
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,980
Pick whichever you like.

359
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,260
All right, then I'll pick one.

360
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,950
Go ahead.

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,980
The night market at Yaoguang Mountain is always bustling.

362
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,090
I remember there was a scallion pancake stall there.

363
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,660
I used to go every day.

364
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,140
Even the owner

365
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,090
remembered how I liked my pancake.

366
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,900
It's all thanks to your seven consecutive victories

367
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,620
that Yaoguang Mountain is so prosperous.

368
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,700
I didn't realize until I came to Jixing Abyss

369
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,660
that when some are laughing,

370
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,290
others are crying.

371
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,010
This one's really easy to keep alive.

372
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,620
Sir, we'll leave these here.

373
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,490
Yaoguang Mountain truly is wonderful.

374
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,530
When will Mangfu Swamp and Cangwu Hill

375
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,460
ever be this prosperous?

376
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,770
Even the artifacts at the market are top-notch.

377
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,570
Yeah.

378
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,770
Once we finish our work

379
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,620
and get paid,

380
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,380
we can buy new artifacts.

381
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,810
Let's take a look there.

382
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,810
Are you the younger brother of Immortal Xu Yun from Jixing Abyss,

383
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,860
Chen Xi?

384
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,700
Chen Xi?

385
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,900
Wow,

386
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,860
you've grown so much in just two years!

387
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,530
Exactly!

388
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,660
Uncle Xiao, Uncle Tai!

389
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,410
You came to the tea gathering this year too?

390
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,210
- Yes. - Yes.

391
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,970
If you like this dagger,

392
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,490
I'll give it to you.

393
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,930
To be honest, we...

394
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,970
we can't afford it.

395
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,900
Our realms keep losing at the Qingyun Tournament,

396
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,100
and we've been living in hardship.

397
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,650
If your brother hadn't gifted us artifacts two years ago,

398
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,690
we probably wouldn't have even qualified for the warrior selection.

399
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,970
That's true.

400
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,300
Since you're Chen Xi's friends,

401
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,380
you're my friends too.

402
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,730
I'll buy this dagger for you.

403
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,450
Thank you for your kindness,

404
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,450
but that won't be necessary.

405
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,650
Once we finish our work and get paid,

406
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,250
we'll buy one ourselves.

407
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,690
Then let me help you.

408
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,650
- No... - No need.

409
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,580
That won't do.

410
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,780
You'll dirty your clothes.

411
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,900
Don't worry about that.

412
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,340
With the Blessed Rain unevenly distributed,

413
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,820
it's hard for the Lower Realms to rise up.

414
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,380
The Six Realms should help each other out.

415
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,010
We'll get the work done in no time.

416
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,620
Once we're done, food's on me.

417
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,490
Still thinking

418
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,380
about the warriors from Mangfu Swamp and Cangwu Hill?

419
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:47,900
Yes.

420
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,450
When I was at Yaoguang Mountain,

421
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,340
I had no idea

422
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,140
that in the Lower Realms,

423
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,690
even the warriors struggled so much.

424
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,820
How hard life must be for ordinary people.

425
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,900
Where there are victors, there must also be losers.

426
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,100
The Qingyun Tournament may seem fair,

427
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,490
but in reality, it creates a vicious cycle.

428
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,210
The Lower Three Realms lack Blessed Rain

429
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,140
and suffer from a loss of talent.

430
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,780
As time goes on,

431
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,690
the gap just keeps growing wider,

432
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,780
and the beings in those realms

433
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,250
sink deeper into hardship.

434
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,300
The strong keep getting stronger.

435
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,340
Whether Jixing Abyss or Yaoguang Mountain

436
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,210
takes first place,

437
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,100
it won't change the situation.

438
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,410
If only the rules of the Qingyun Tournament

439
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,900
could be changed someday,

440
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,690
and the Blessed Rain could be shared equally

441
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,860
among all Six Realms.

442
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,930
Why are you smiling?

443
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,650
I know, human nature is fickle.

444
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,580
Maybe I'll change my mind one day.

445
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,900
I'm being too idealistic.

446
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,780
I'm smiling because we,

447
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,100
who once fought against each other at the Qingyun Tournament,

448
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,780
are now having this conversation.

449
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,860
But you're right.

450
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,060
If we don't dream,

451
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,620
that day will never come.

452
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,010
In truth, the beings of the Lower Three Realms

453
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,900
don't care who wins first place at all.

454
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,930
All they want is the Blessed Rain,

455
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,820
enough to eat, and clothes

456
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,450
to keep warm.

457
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,410
When I was in the Sunken Abyss,

458
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,450
I saw countless people who wanted to live

459
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,730
but had to twist their own will to survive.

460
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,250
It wasn't their fault.

461
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,250
They just wanted

462
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,540
to live too badly.

463
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,820
You've gone through so much in the past.

464
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,860
Thank you

465
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,010
for holding on and surviving,

466
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,780
or I wouldn't have met you now.

467
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,490
You once said you had a mark on your forehead.

468
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,210
I think

469
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,250
my mother planted it there

470
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,690
when I was still an infant.

471
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,170
It holds some vague memories of her.

472
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,490
I can't see her face clearly,

473
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,650
but she told me

474
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,580
this mark

475
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,450
was formed from her blood and mine.

476
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,900
Haven't you ever thought about looking for her?

477
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,900
Of course I have.

478
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,340
When I was in the Sunken Abyss,

479
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,860
I imagined countless times

480
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,690
that they'd come looking for me.

481
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,860
But perhaps

482
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,490
they are no longer alive.

483
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,490
It doesn't matter anymore.

484
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,570
What matters is

485
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,980
that I had my master

486
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,250
who saved me and guided me.

487
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,700
I have Buxiu who respects me

488
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,140
and Granny Xun who cares for me.

489
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,730
And then there is you.

490
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,380
What about me?

491
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,730
You lied to me.

492
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,250
Ji Bozai, I...

493
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,180
I'll give you one more chance to say it.

494
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,810
You love me.

[Tea gathering of Qingyun Tournament]

501
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,860
- Yes. - Right.

502
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,090
Rest assured.

503
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,810
All right.

Do you have faith in yourself?

505
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,730
The first event of the tea gathering

506
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,420
is tomorrow's spiritual power test.

507
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,530
The spiritual power stone will assess

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,420
so the others can adjust their strategies accordingly.

510
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,770
But doesn't that mean exposing one's own strength?

511
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,090
Yes,

512
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,380
and no.

513
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,420
First up,

514
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,050
a warrior from Flowing Wave Gorge.

515
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,530
The Qingyun Tournament is fought in teams.

516
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,900
Within each team, there are naturally warriors of varying strength.

517
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,050
Those with greater power can choose to conceal it

518
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,770
and act

519
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,330
as hidden trump cards during the actual match.

520
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,530
What if

521
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,250
everyone hides their strength?

522
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,280
Those who do are usually evenly matched and rely on surprise tactics

523
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,250
to win.

524
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,900
But like Yaoguang Mountain in the past, Zhushui Spiritual State

525
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,050
doesn't bother with that.

526
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,490
They send out their strongest warriors

527
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,460
to display their power

528
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,620
and crush the opponents' will before the fight even begins.

529
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,220
Next, a fighter from Zhushui Spiritual State.

530
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,380
[Chao Yan, Fourth Prince of Zhushui]

531
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,010
Impressive.

532
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,860
Indeed.

533
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,980
When Jixing Abyss was still one of the Lower Realms,

534
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,900
our warriors, after seeing the strength of Yaoguang Mountain's warriors

535
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,980
at the tea gathering, would expect defeat

536
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,220
before the fight even began.

537
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,530
Now, a warrior from Jixing Abyss.

538
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,620
He looks like a fool,

539
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,940
but his spiritual power is surprisingly strong.

540
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,460
- Exactly. - Right.

541
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,980
That's the warrior without spiritual veins, right?

542
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,620
What's so special about him...

543
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,860
- No idea. - That he gets to join the Qingyun Tournament?

544
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,620
I wonder.

545
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,380
I heard he had exceptional healing skills.

546
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,620
The Empress of Jixing really does have an eye for talent.

547
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,420
True,

548
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,050
or she never would've discovered Ji Bozai.

549
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,940
That kid's impressive.

550
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,900
Yes.

551
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,810
He's got real potential.

552
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,050
He reminds me of Ming Xian back in the day.

553
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,490
Indeed.

554
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,090
I'm confident.

555
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,700
We've got Immortal Ji

556
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,330
and Master Ming Yi, who can forge all kinds of artifacts.

557
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,900
Even so, don't get cocky.

558
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,940
Overconfidence leads to defeat.

559
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,900
Remember that.

560
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,420
Oh my.

561
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,330
He's incredible.

562
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,140
- Remarkable indeed. - Impressive!

563
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,730
- Amazing! - Wonderful!

564
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,770
- Excellent! - Impressive!

565
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,530
So impressive.

566
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,900
As expected of Immortal Ji!

567
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,810
Impressive!

568
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,330
Indeed.

569
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,330
Whoever faces him is doomed.

570
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,530
The Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain is here!

571
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,980
Greetings, Your Highness.

572
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,620
Now that Ming Xin is the Crown Prince,

573
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,530
he sure makes quite an entrance.

574
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,730
Yeah, no kidding.

575
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,050
What's he showing off for?

576
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,250
He lost miserably last year.

577
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,530
He's been competing for years,

578
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,860
but his strength is just average.

579
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:15,940
Exactly.

580
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,980
Amazing, Your Highness!

581
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,660
Truly incredible.

582
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,660
- That was impressive. - Yes.

583
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,490
Such power!

584
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,330
What kind of elixir did he take to get that strong?

585
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,730
- Right. - Oh my.

586
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,050
Unbelievable!

587
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,220
Ming Xin is about to reach the Transcendent Stage?

588
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,620
How is that possible?

589
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,180
Even his mother, Lady Meng, once said

590
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,490
he didn't have the talent

591
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,770
to reach such a level.

592
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,770
Perhaps

593
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,460
someone's helping him.

594
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,900
Ming Xin acted strangely at the tea gathering.

595
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,570
It seems he has already realized who you are.

596
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,690
From the way he looked at me, I think he has.

597
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,860
But right now, what matters most

598
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,420
is the travelers' competition tonight.

599
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,170
I must win the black lingzhi mushroom

600
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,380
to bring Twenty-Seven back.

601
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,570
Due to the rules,

602
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,490
as a warrior, I can't compete,

603
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,010
and you shouldn't show yourself either,

604
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,980
or Ming Xin might get suspicious.

605
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,570
So,

606
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,740
I want to ask Buxiu to help.

607
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,900
So the great Warrior Goddess already has a plan?

608
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,690
In that case,

609
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,010
let's restore our heart imprints first.

610
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,820
If Ming Xin makes a move

611
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,860
and you're in danger,

612
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,130
I'll be able to reach you in time.

613
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,780
You drive a hard bargain, don't you?

614
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,570
Ming Yi,

615
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,980
what happened to your hand?

616
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,820
Nothing.

617
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,610
Either way, we should restore our heart imprints.

618
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,100
You're just taking advantage of the fact that our names are still

619
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,050
on the Marriage Stone.

620
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,940
Did I agree to do this?

621
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,610
So what if you didn't?

622
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,460
I got what I wanted.

623
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,610
Smarty-pants.

624
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,210
- Incredible! - How many has he beaten now?

625
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,570
This immortal has already defeated

626
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,740
725 opponents

627
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,490
without a single loss.

628
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,260
That many?

629
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,780
Does anyone else want to challenge him?

630
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,380
Anyone?

631
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,380
If no one can defeat him,

632
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,800
the prize will go to this immortal.

633
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,260
I'll be taking it, then.

634
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,160
Please.

635
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,340
Where did they go?

636
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,170
They vanished!

637
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,570
The black lingzhi mushroom is gone too!

638
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,980
It's really gone!

639
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,940
The black lingzhi mushroom is gone too!

640
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,490
Yeah, what happened?

641
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,820
Just as Your Lordship and Fairy Ming Yi predicted,

642
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,820
the lingzhi mushroom disappeared.

643
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,740
Someone attacked, and Ming Yi was taken.

644
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,980
It must have been Ming Xin.

645
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,610
Your Lordship, aren't you going to do anything?

646
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,380
She can handle it.

647
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,090
I have faith in her.

648
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,130
Ming Xian.

649
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,300
For your cat to come back to life,

650
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,340
you'll need a black lingzhi mushroom.

651
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,210
I knew you'd bite the hook

652
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,340
with this as the bait.

653
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,940
Let's see

654
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,530
if you have what it takes to snatch it from me.

655
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,380
Back then, you were obsessed with forbidden arts

656
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,980
and drew countless designs for magical artifacts.

657
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,010
When the Empress found out, she confiscated them.

658
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,650
Now that I've gone through them,

659
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,780
I must say, they're quite useful.

660
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,900
Perfect

661
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,460
for dealing with you,

662
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,090
Ming Xian.

663
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,650
What's that supposed to mean?

664
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,570
Trying to make me think

665
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,820
my mother is behind all this?

666
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,010
You think such cheap tricks

667
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,010
would work on me?

668
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,490
Of course the Empress wouldn't harm you.

669
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,420
You're her most useful pawn.

670
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,340
What dark spell did she use back then

671
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,860
to turn you into a man?

672
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,610
Even your face

673
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,050
looked completely different.

674
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,570
The Crown Prince of Yaoguang, whom I hated for so many years,

675
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,340
turns out to be a woman.

676
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,340
How revolting.

677
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,460
It's a pity you don't know

678
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,860
how I gave you the Heavenly Grief.

679
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:31,740
I slipped it into the scallion pancake

680
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,340
the Empress herself made for you before the Qingyun Tournament.

681
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,530
You're insane!

682
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,090
How dare you show up at the tea gathering

683
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,690
with people from Jixing Abyss, our enemy?

684
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,780
Once I bring you to that person...

685
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,090
Spiritual power from Zhushui Spiritual State?

686
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,090
Did the Emperor of Zhushui give it to you?

687
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,090
No wonder your power surged at the tea gathering.

688
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,010
Who are you taking me to?

689
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,530
The Emperor of Zhushui?

690
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,570
So you were faking it all along!
