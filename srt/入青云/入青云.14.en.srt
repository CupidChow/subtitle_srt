1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Your light is controlling me

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's me

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's me

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Or the heat that will last only in the wind and clouds

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You are the warmth engraved in my heart

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I will always be with you from now on

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't forget your eyes

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't escape from your love

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't forget your eyes

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Qi Mu Ze

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The holy food

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You are so good at playing the role of a demon

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What can you do?

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You will get hurt if you go on like this

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can't leave you alone

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You have an affair

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What else did you hide from me?

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Say

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who are you?

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I am from Yaokong Mountain

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's related to the star

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am Ming Xian's fiancee

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Sorry, it's not the time to tell you now

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The wife who was close to my brother

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is Ming Xian's fiancee

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
At this point

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you think I will believe you?

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Give me back Er Shiqi first

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I will prove it to you

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He was seriously injured at the tomb

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If he is not treated in time, he will die

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I beg you

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Er Xi

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Er Xi

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's okay

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's okay

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The reason why Ming Xian was born

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Was because Ming Xian and I

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Were together since childhood

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Like a child and a twin

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The same life and the same death

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So I believe that I can use it for me

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Connect with me

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Er Xi

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You approached me from the beginning

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What's your purpose?

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Qingyun Daihui province

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Ming Xian lost to you

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because he was cheated by others

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So he lost

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Inside Yaokong Mountain

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The brothers are close to each other

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Ming Xian has a brother named Ming Xin

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He slandered Ming Xian

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Then Ming Xian didn't know what to do

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I suspect that someone

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is colluding with Ming Xian inside Yaokong Mountain

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And killed Ming Xian

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Now it seems that he is

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Mu Qi Bai

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
In order to survive

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And revenge

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I can only hide my connections

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And leave Yaokong Mountain

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then I went to the night of the full moon

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
To approach you

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I admit that my mind is not simple

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But I can't help you

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I have the same position as you

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I suspect that Mu Qi Bai is suspicious

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I want to start from him

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
To find out who

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Killed Ming Xian in Yaokong Mountain

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I haven't hurt you since then

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want to deal with Mu Qi Bai just like you

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I understand

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You want to stay in the Wu Gui Sea

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
To deal with Mu Qi Bai

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let me guess what you want to say

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you want to say

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mu Qi Bai has nothing to do with Yaokong Mountain

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If I leave you to be my helper

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Maybe I can find Mu Qi Bai as soon as possible

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Or do you want to say

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In other people's eyes

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We are one body and one mind

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If I kill you

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You will be suspected

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If you disappear suddenly

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And you will be trapped in my hands and feet

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So I'd rather you stay

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And be my cover

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I can continue to investigate the monster

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Right?

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It seems that the Lord of the Deity knows

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a good choice to leave me

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Lian Yi

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Compared with killing Mu Qi Bai

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I want to kill you now

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Lord of the Deity

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sorry I lied to you

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But the biggest problem now is the monster army and Mu Qi Bai

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Lord of the Deity

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You...

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you want to continue?

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I just

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
My spirit is not hidden in the spirit cube

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I used other means

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So my body is over-saturated

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why do you pretend to be so weak?

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Even if you are dead, it has nothing to do with me.

122
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,000
Erqian.

123
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
Mingyi, are you okay?

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,800
Mingyi.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Mingyi.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Erqian.

127
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
We are brothers.

128
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
I just healed your wound.

129
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
You just got better.

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,600
You have to run away from me.

131
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,600
I thought we were in a serious situation.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,200
I was too stupid to show them.

133
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,000
What if I killed you?

135
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
Don't say that.

136
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm still here.

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,200
Look.

138
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,600
I'm fine.

139
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
You are fine, too.

140
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
We are all here.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
That's the best.

142
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,200
And how can I blame you?

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I can only blame the enemy for being too cunning.

144
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,600
On the other hand.

145
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
When Wu Zhiqi was trying to convince jewelry driver

146
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
to join hands with us,

147
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
he was seriously injured

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,560
and broke up with you

149
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,600
only because of you.

150
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,600
Now,

151
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,600
you are a storm for him.

152
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
But she still can't help but kill you.

153
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,440
Mingyi.

154
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,560
Our plan has been successful.

155
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,240
She really likes you.

156
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,600
Yes.

157
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,400
So I really don't have any intention.

158
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,520
What can you do?

159
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,760
Qin'ai can't save your life.

160
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,520
I haven't let you be my хочу-kind love blue.

161
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,680
It's just like you.

162
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,840
Why...

163
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,360
Why is guy robbing?

164
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,820
Now you offer up your

165
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
hope andmalevolence.

166
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,320
We got the Wild Blood Mirror

167
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
and sisters, right?

168
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,040
How can we leave here?

169
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,840
Mingyi and His Majesty have taken the star seal.

170
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,960
If he knows where the dream is,

171
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,240
he can enter the Lingxi Jing

172
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,880
at any time with the star seal.

173
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,360
We have to kill him.

174
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,480
I have a way to make him take the dream.

175
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,520
You're really the master.

176
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,000
We have to deal with him.

177
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,120
He has useful values.

178
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,520
I'll kill the cat first.

179
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,400
It's useless to kill the cat.

180
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,160
It has no heart.

181
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,400
We have to kill it first.

182
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
Buxiu, you can't deal with problems only by killing.

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,760
Cheng Ran,

184
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,840
killing it can solve some problems.

185
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,280
I understand.

186
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,080
Come back.

187
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,160
I really understand.

188
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,840
You really don't understand.

189
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,040
Go to Yaoguang Mountain

190
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,840
and find out the obvious details.

191
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,640
Yes.

192
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,040
I use Within 분인ivo 신부

193
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
to describe Ji Bozai

194
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,040
that I love her

195
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
and also that she likes you.

196
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

197
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,760
I deserve his respect.

198
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,200
He is a bastard.

199
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,440
Your Majesty.

200
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,480
Your Majesty.

201
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,720
Let's talk about it.

202
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,120
Let's talk about it.

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Mu Xi is holding the Beast Lord in his hand.

204
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,200
Do you know how to deal with them?

205
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,920
I have an idea.

206
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,320
I'm willing to set up the Beast Lord's gate

207
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,680
to show our sincerity.

208
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,000
Sincerity?

209
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
How can I use

210
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,000
someone who doesn't know the bottom line?

211
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,440
When you're willing to tell me the truth,

212
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,240
come to talk to me about cooperation.

213
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,480
But what I can't

214
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,400
is just how much I love my father?

215
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,840
Right,

216
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
I think

217
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,440
I'm gonna lose all the doctors

218
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,400
and doctors' lives?

219
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,360
Mr. Bai.

220
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,200
sonra-sora.

221
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I...

222
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,440
This is so good.

223
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,840
This is not what people wear.

224
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,320
Lord Jinxian.

225
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,160
This... This prison is cold.

226
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,760
Mingyi, last night...

227
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,120
She... She consumed too much.

228
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,280
She must be sick.

229
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
Let us out.

230
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,080
Lord Jinxian.

231
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,160
This prison is so cold.

232
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,720
Why don't you come in and have a look?

233
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,360
Mind your words.

234
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,560
Lord Jinxian.

235
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,800
What I said is true.

236
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,400
Mingxian is my fiance.

237
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,160
I...

238
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,040
Lord Jinxian.

239
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,160
Lord Jinxian.

240
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,400
My life.

241
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Lord Jinxian.

242
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,520
Lord Jinxian.

243
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,120
Mingyi fainted.

244
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,960
Mingyi fainted.

245
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,640
Mingyi fainted.

246
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,400
Stop acting. She's far away.

247
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,480
Why is she so blind?

248
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,160
She...

249
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,840
She's...

250
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,520
She's kind.

251
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,000
Lord.

252
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,840
After the meeting,

253
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,200
Mingxian disappeared from Yaoguang Mountain.

254
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,000
No one knows where she is.

255
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,200
No one knows

256
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
if she has a fiancee.

257
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,000
But there are many rumors

258
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,000
about her in Yaoguang Mountain.

259
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,080
It's not surprising that she hid one.

260
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,680
Mingyi appeared at the Flower Moon Night

261
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,600
after the Qingyun Conference.

262
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,280
Mingxian must have something to do with her.

263
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,880
Mingyi is useful to us now.

264
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,040
It's complicated.

265
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,040
We can only keep her.

266
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
Lord,

267
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,720
you care about her and Mingxian's relationship?

268
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
What does it have to do with me?

269
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,280
No matter what relationship Mingyi has with her,

270
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
in this situation,

271
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,400
Mingxian can't appear in a short time.

272
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,480
I thought Mingxian

273
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,560
was a straightforward person.

274
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,240
But now she's hiding in the west.

275
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,840
There must be something wrong.

276
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,840
Xiaoyun, let's go.

277
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,480
Princess.

278
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,080
Are you going to the Wu Gui Sea?

279
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,640
Xiaoyun, wait for me outside.

280
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,360
Lord Yan, you should worry about yourself.

281
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,120
You've messed up

282
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,200
the things I've done recently.

283
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,200
You're a dog.

284
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,440
Do you still trust your master?

285
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,080
You're not like Lord Ji.

286
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,680
A capable person

287
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,120
will only be dissatisfied

288
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,000
if you want to control him.

289
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,040
The skills of thousands of people

290
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,000
are not as good as the capacity of a person.

291
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,360
Is it a person or a person?

292
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,320
Princess, why don't you just tell Lord Ji to come in?

293
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,560
It sounds more like it.

294
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,480
You're here to say this?

295
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,400
You can leave now.

296
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,320
Princess, you can use Ji Bozai

297
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,320
but don't help him.

298
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,000
Don't go against Lord Han Feng

299
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,840
for his sake.

300
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,280
Thank you for your reminder, Lord Yan.

301
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,280
Actually, I should have told you

302
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,320
some things earlier.

303
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,640
I made a mistake that day.

304
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,640
I shouldn't have done that.

305
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,600
I shouldn't have done that.

306
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,480
I shouldn't have done that.

307
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,080
I made the decision

308
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,160
to put you on the list of the best fighters.

309
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,720
I thought

310
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,480
I could turn you down one day.

311
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,360
After all, you're trusted by my uncle.

312
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,920
He put you by my father's side

313
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,240
to take care of his health.

314
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,920
If you're willing to help me,

315
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
you can save my father's life.

316
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,600
But now it seems that I was wrong.

317
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,120
Lord Yan followed my uncle

318
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,280
and wanted to have a good future.

319
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,480
He has no regrets.

320
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,920
I shouldn't have expected anything from you.

321
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,200
I won't do that again.

322
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,360
By the way,

323
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,520
if you don't want to take part in the fight,

324
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,280
you can quit at any time.

325
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Tian Ji, I...

326
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,800
Whengg Craft fight

327
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,920
is about to start.

328
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,000
You are sick.

329
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,760
Don't talk to us.

330
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,920
Tea is prepared.

331
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I don't know,

332
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,960
but after that,

333
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,600
I know it will show you the power.

334
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
I know.

336
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,720
I'm stupid to expect anything from you.

337
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I shouldn't have it.

338
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,560
But I'm facing you.

339
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,640
You don't know that

340
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,560
I've been treating you since childhood.

341
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,880
Xiao Xiao is crazy among the others.

342
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,600
We're 55 years apart.

343
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
I'll never let go.

344
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,760
If you don't supply me with time,

345
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,160
and you don't pay me back,

346
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,240
I won't even let go of your hand.

347
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,200
I thought you really wouldn't come.

348
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,840
Ji Bucai, Ji Bucai.

349
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,560
Stop it.

350
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,440
Ji Bucai, Ji Bucai.

351
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,080
Ji Bucai, Ji Bucai.

352
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,720
Ai darker

353
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,840
My traveled

354
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,560
Your honor

355
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,000
I've thought about it

356
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,140
Me

357
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,440
iOS Princess call

358
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,640
You go with me

359
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,560
Ok. Ok.

360
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,680
I hope it will help

361
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,360
Say one more word

362
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,680
You can go back

363
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,040
I

364
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,360
She's gone?

365
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Where's the cat?

366
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,840
Go away!

367
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,200
Princess, you summoned us.

368
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,320
What's the matter?

369
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,840
Such a big thing happened before.

370
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,000
I have to ask you.

371
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
What else do you want to know?

372
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,000
Mu Qi Bai's name is in the book.

373
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,240
My wife

374
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,960
tried to take away my identity as a fighter.

375
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,280
Isn't it already on the cover?

376
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,760
What's there to question?

377
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,640
Of course.

378
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,640
For example,

379
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,920
when did you raise Ming Xian?

380
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,400
Ji Bo Zi,

381
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,560
we're in the same boat.

382
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,600
But you've been hiding too much from me.

383
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,440
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,080
You're worried about me?

385
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,520
Lord Han Feng

386
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,840
has been trying to hurt my husband.

387
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,960
He has arranged a lot of spies in the Wu Gui Sea.

388
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,320
He found out

389
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,080
that my husband took Ming Xian's life

390
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,360
and used it to slander us.

391
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,400
Fortunately, you made up your mind.

392
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,320
Or else, you wouldn't be able to wash the dirty water.

393
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,240
Really?

394
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,960
I've been regretting it these days.

395
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,240
I should have

396
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,240
asked Lord Han Feng to take you away

397
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,680
and solve the problem.

398
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,200
You should know that

399
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,400
Lord Han Feng used me to cause trouble

400
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,040
because he thought I was a weakness of Ji Xian.

401
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,640
But don't worry, Your Highness.

402
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,280
Look, it's such a big thing.

403
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,840
It can be done properly.

404
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,800
I don't think anyone will dare to use this matter

405
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,240
to make a fuss in the future.

406
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,320
So my existence is not a trouble.

407
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,280
If you keep me,

408
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,600
you can make Lord Ji

409
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,560
to be a lucky man in the future.

410
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,720
You don't look so stupid.

411
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,320
Your Highness, you can be the one who is respected by the Shouhua Pan Palace.

412
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,240
I don't think it's entirely like what others say.

413
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,040
What others say?

414
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,440
What?

415
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,880
Kind and naive.

416
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,440
A fierce man.

417
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
How dare you!

418
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,440
It's good that others say that.

419
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,240
In fact, Ming Yi and Ming Xian

420
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,600
are really absurd.

421
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,600
Uncle also doesn't believe it.

422
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,560
He just came here for a reason.

423
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,040
But this matter is so big.

424
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
The whole Shouhua Pan Palace is watching.

425
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,040
Ming Xian can't keep it.

426
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,760
Keep it.

427
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,480
I'll keep it.

428
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,320
I'm thinking if Ming Xian comes back one day,

429
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,680
I can use it to pray for him.

430
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,400
I wonder if Your Highness can comfort

431
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
the whole Shouhua Pan Palace with this.

432
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:28,480
The wholeelectric power 어요

433
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,960
Along with these pulled persimmons,

434
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,000
With me.

435
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,400
What are you two doing?

436
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,760
I will go see Heradder.

437
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,960
What is your most important job?

438
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,160
Thank you, Lord Immortal.

439
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,680
Thank you for saving my daughter.

440
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,440
You asked Princess Tian Ji to summon us.

441
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,280
Princess wanted to see you.

442
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,880
So I let you out.

443
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,200
You wanted to remind me through her.

444
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,800
Now we're still on the same boat.

445
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,920
I thought

446
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,680
she would want to see you sooner or later.

447
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,920
But I didn't ask her to do that.

448
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,400
It's not necessary.

449
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,840
I sent you back to the Flower Moon Night before.

450
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,200
You went to the Flower Moon Night

451
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,160
to see me.

452
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,000
I didn't ask you to do that.

453
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,440
You sent me back to the Flower Moon Night.

454
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,960
You just left.

455
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,760
You came here at the last minute.

456
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,240
It was an accident.

457
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm sorry.

458
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,040
I was wrong to you in the past.

459
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,040
Please forgive me.

460
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,480
I'm useful to you.

461
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,480
Please help me.

462
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,220
Liang Duan,

463
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,800
please help me.

464
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,720
Who?

465
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,280
Who?

466
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,600
What's wrong?

467
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,160
Aren't you sick of being covered with wounds?

468
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,560
I will have you checked on.

469
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,480
Exactly.

470
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,600
I'll go out.

471
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,360
OK.

472
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
you need to make the flower and demon's base

473
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and put the demon's source into it

474
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,280
and collect it with your body

475
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,480
before you practice.

476
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,520
But this skill

477
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
can also hurt your soul.

478
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,840
If you are willing to join hands with me,

479
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,680
I'll make the flower and demon's base

480
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,200
and do everything for you.

481
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,160
Get up.

482
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,440
We have three rules.

483
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,200
One,

484
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,120
during the turtle's sea,

485
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,560
you can't contact...

486
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,760
You can't contact anyone outside.

487
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,440
Two,

488
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,120
no matter what,

489
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,120
as long as I summon you,

490
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
you must appear.

491
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,840
Three,

492
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,160
you just need to tell me

493
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,160
how to make the flower and demon's base.

494
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,440
The rest

495
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,360
is not your business.

496
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,960
Okay.

497
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,320
I was against Mu Qi Bai

498
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,600
in the previous game.

499
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,960
If he fails this time,

500
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,640
he will be in the dark again.

501
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,800
It's not easy to find the evidence

502
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,840
to find him.

503
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,040
But

504
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,600
that cat went to Longlitan.

505
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,000
I know.

506
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,600
He always wanted to

507
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,800
get in our turtle's sea.

508
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
We have to check his Longlitan.

509
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,560
It depends on your performance.

510
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,480
I'll think about it.

511
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,440
I'm satisfied.

512
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,880
After the recent selection test,

513
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,200
Jiang Ji Bo Zai,

514
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,480
Chen Xi,

515
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,240
Meng Yang Qiu,

516
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,760
Sun Liao,

517
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,760
Yan Xiao

518
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,040
are confirmed to be the official competitors

519
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,840
of the Summer Green Cloud Conference.

520
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,360
Good.

521
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,680
Zoom in quickly.

522
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,760
Your racing teams are being ready,

523
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,680
I'll confirm that,

524
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,560
do you personally want

525
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,760
to join the Shou Hua treason?]

526
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,760
Is there anyone

527
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,400
who wants to quit?

528
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,760
That's very good.

529
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,600
Starting from now,

530
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,840
please be pretty

531
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,600
and attend the Summer Green Cloud Conference.

532
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,360
result that Lord wrench also

533
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,560
just let me Nearchy

534
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,600
In this situation

535
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,800
the two of us need to share

536
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,900
the same things

537
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,600
to make a play

538
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,960
beat Qing Yun

539
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,000
That's a great friend

540
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,100
I really should

541
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,560
give this one a good fight

542
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,840
According to what i could choose

543
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,780
I should let you

544
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,720
go to the G — Voorheijou

545
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,200
I'll eat and live with you

546
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
and train with you.

547
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,280
Why haven't you given up

548
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,840
the turtle sea that you set up?

549
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,960
Cai Meng.

550
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,880
You can't succeed in one thing, but you can succeed in another.

551
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,760
Brother.

552
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,800
If you still care about this,

553
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,840
can I apologize to you?

554
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,040
I made this proposal

555
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,920
just for the princess.

556
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,280
Don't you want the team to

557
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,360
work together as soon as possible

558
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,560
and cultivate a tacit understanding?

559
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,400
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,400
Thank you for your concern.

561
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,680
But

562
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,360
it's not appropriate

563
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,560
for so many people to live in the turtle sea

564
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,760
even if they are prepared to fight.

565
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,800
Why don't

566
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
all five fighters

567
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,960
help me to defend the palace?

568
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,280
In this way,

569
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,000
it's convenient for everyone to practice

570
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,920
and I can inspect it every day.

571
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,080
Do you think

572
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,680
it's good?

573
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Please research the passage and rails to help you.

574
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,360
This is the position...

575
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,960
Isn't it?

576
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,000
If it weren't委 dormant...

577
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,160
What a fine man should sleep on one bed.

578
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
That's disgusting.

579
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,480
It's comfortable here.

580
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,680
Mingyi, be careful of her shoulder.

581
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,960
My lord,

582
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,880
the princess asked you to live with other fighters.

583
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,400
Why did you bring me here?

584
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,680
Because I can't leave you at any moment.

585
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,280
Will the princess be angry if she knows it?

586
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,480
My silly girl.

587
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,440
What are you worrying about?

588
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,160
As long as my Mingyi is happy,

589
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,720
I don't care about others.

590
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,280
Here.

591
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,000
Wait.

592
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,920
How can the boy sleep in a single room?

593
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,240
Because he's married.

594
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,840
So am I.

595
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,480
You?

596
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,720
You're a bad guy.

597
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,200
Chen Xi.

598
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,480
You won't snore when you sleep at night, right?

599
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,160
I won't.

600
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,480
How dare you hit me?

601
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,680
Come here.

602
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,400
My little niece is really a good girl.

603
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,280
She made you and Meng Yangqiu into a fighter.

604
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,120
What?

605
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,800
You don't care about others,

606
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,040
but you want to kill them?

607
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,840
Do you think everyone can be like you

608
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,760
and fight for the title of the best fighter?

609
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,400
You're thinking too much.

610
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,960
I'm not that capable.

611
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,160
I think so, too.

612
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,880
Yan Xiao.

613
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,840
You betrayed Tian Ji.

614
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,640
Do you think he'll accept you

615
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,200
if you change your mind?

616
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,560
You'd better do your duty well.

617
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,160
After the task is done,

618
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,520
I'll erase Tian Ji's memory

619
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,120
and give her to you without any harm.

620
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,000
We opponent you out of weakness

621
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,120
and do not Suwu.

622
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,200
I'm a genius.

623
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,360
Angel ET.

624
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,680
No mercy.

625
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,360
If we could bring them back,

626
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,780
it would outta

627
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,360
Ba reward of over 60,000.

628
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,280
What's going on between us?

629
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,360
Are you trying to hide from me?

630
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
You...

631
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
My Lord,

632
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,960
you said you wanted to investigate the dragon-dome.

633
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
I asked the 27th Bureau to investigate it.

634
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,960
As expected, the dragon-dome is sealed.

635
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
If you want to enter,

636
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
you can only use the fox fan.

637
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,960
Now we are all trapped.

638
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Shouhua's treason, this bird dragon-dome,

639
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
how can it be transferred to Lishan?

640
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
My Lord, I have a plan.

641
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
My Lord,

642
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
you can't go to Lishan.

643
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
You can't go to Lishan.

644
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
You can't go to Lishan.

645
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
You can't go to Lishan.

646
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
You can't go to Lishan.

647
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
You can't go to Lishan.

648
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
You can't go to Lishan.

649
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
You can't go to Lishan.

650
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
You can't go to Lishan.

651
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
You can't go to Lishan.

652
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
You can't go to Lishan.

653
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
You can't go to Lishan.

654
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
You can't go to Lishan.

655
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
You can't go to Lishan.

656
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
You can't go to Lishan.

657
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
You can't go to Lishan.

658
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
You can't go to Lishan.

659
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
You can't go to Lishan.

660
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Uncle Ji,

661
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
we are already married.

662
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Can you believe me more?

663
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
I have a second heart for you.

664
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
You are too...

665
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
You are too much.

666
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Why can't I suspect you?

667
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
You can't be repaired.

668
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
We are like this teacup.

669
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
It's broken.

670
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
It can't be repaired.

671
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Uncle Ji,

672
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
why do you say that?

673
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
There must be someone else.

674
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
What about you?

675
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
You are innocent.

676
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
I want to be the strongest fighter

677
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
in the world.

678
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Why don't you ask me?

679
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,960
You tell me.

680
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Xiao Chen Xi, you...

681
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
This...

682
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
You are really doing this for me?

683
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Yes.

684
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Why do you...

685
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Why do you want to be the strongest fighter in the world?

686
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
I didn't give you a chance to be the strongest fighter.

687
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
You are doubting me.

688
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
I didn't ask you about you.

689
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Give it back to me.

690
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
You...

691
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
You did it.

692
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
I did it.

693
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Why do you say that?

694
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
You say it.

695
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
You are like this when you just got married.

696
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,960
You are a man.

697
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Yin Xiang,

698
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
what is that?

699
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
If you don't explain it to me today,

700
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
I will...

701
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,960
You think the girls are good?

702
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Get out.

703
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
You go to find the girls.

704
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
You will be back in 28 weeks.

705
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Okay, I will find them.

706
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
It's so scary.

707
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,960
It's better not to get married.

708
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
I want to be the strongest fighter in the world.

709
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,760
This direction,

710
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,760
MXJ right away.

711
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Go right.

712
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
It sounds nice.

713
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
We haven't seen he look like this before.

714
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Yes, he is drunk.

715
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Did he have a quarrel?

716
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,160
I think it was.

717
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,680
Master is here.

718
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,840
Lord Ji,

719
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,720
how about I send a letter to Mingyi

720
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,160
and ask her to pick you up?

721
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,760
That's a good idea.

722
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,760
I didn't bring my wine.

723
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,760
Master,

724
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,400
Mingyi just sent a letter.

725
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,440
Now you think of me?

726
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,360
Girls,

727
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,440
leave her alone.

728
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,720
Let her die outside.

729
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,160
Don't come back.

730
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,160
Let her die.

731
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,040
Die.

732
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,960
Die.

733
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,760
Die.

734
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,760
Die.

735
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,840
Die.

736
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,240
Die.

737
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,760
What's going on?

738
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,600
Lord Ji,

739
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,440
although you brought the wine,

740
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,080
the fruit and pastries

741
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,120
are scattered.

742
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,200
You know the rules of the night.

743
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,200
Cover,

744
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,120
cover,

745
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,040
cover,

746
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:55,880
cover,

747
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,800
cover,

748
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,400
and send a letter to my best brother.

749
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,480
Let him come here.

750
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,040
Your best brother?

751
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,680
Who is he?

752
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,960
Your Highness,

753
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,720
the owner of the night is here.

754
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,960
Lord Ji wants to see you.

755
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,200
What is he up to?

756
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,720
Did he receive the seal

757
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,320
and set up the king of the Sky Tower

758
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,640
and wait for Lord Han Feng to come?

759
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
He wants to invite me to his palace.

760
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,320
It's dangerous.

761
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,040
We can't be careless.

762
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,800
Then let's go as he wishes.

763
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,640
Then let's go as he wishes.

764
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,440
Bring everyone here.

765
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,880
Yes.

766
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,760
Move aside.

767
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,640
Move aside.

768
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,040
Move aside.

769
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,320
I'm a loser.

770
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,760
Your Highness, you're finally here.

771
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,280
Lord Ji must want me to come to you

772
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,240
and say that Lord Han Feng is his best brother.

773
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,880
It's really rare.

774
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Bye-bye.

775
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,360
Stop calling me.

776
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,960
Bye-bye.

777
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,120
I'm here.

778
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,720
Brother Qi Bai,

779
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,120
you made me wait so long.

780
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,560
Brother Qi Bai,

781
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,080
Brother Qi Bai,

782
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,080
I'm telling you,

783
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,880
you can't get married as a man.

784
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,960
Get married?

785
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,880
I'll take you to heaven first

786
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,560
and then take you to the ground.

787
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,840
Brother Qi Bai,

788
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
you don't even give me a penny

789
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
and you kicked me out of the house.

790
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,000
I...

791
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,080
I'd rather be a sinner

792
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,960
than a sinner in love.

793
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,200
Brother Qi Bai,

794
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,920
let go of me.

795
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,800
You're a cheater.

796
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,880
This place is not your tomb.

797
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,400
What should I do?

798
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
What should I do?

799
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
What should I do?

800
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
What should I do?

801
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,120
Little kid,

802
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,120
do you know what a real tomb is?

803
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,520
It's a marriage.

804
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,880
Brother Qi Bai.

805
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,560
Brother Qi Bai.

806
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,640
You've been wronged, Brother Qi Bai.
