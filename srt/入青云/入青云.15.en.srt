1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's me

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or the heat that only exists in the wind and clouds

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are a warm and heart-wrenching moment

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will fight for you from now on

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The hero that I can't forget

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The love that I can't escape from

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I love you like the cloud and the night

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The Love by Hypnotic

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Episode 14

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Si Tu Ling released you from the prison

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Han Feng Jun ordered me to catch you one by one

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You've been raising them for so long, and you've spent so much blessings

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just to make you more fat

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How can I let you go?

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Now that the strong enemy is still around, and we can't stop Ji Bo Zai

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We have to hurry up and give you to the beast

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So that they can leave as soon as possible

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Sir, let us go

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let us go

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let us go

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let us go

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let us go

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let us go

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let us go

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let us go

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let us go

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Aren't you afraid?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Afraid of you?

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Afraid of you?

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Can you play this play?

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The more you don't play according to the routine, the more you can disturb others' mood

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You mean to say that

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Ji Bo Zai suddenly found Mu Qi Bai

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mu Qi Bai must be like a big enemy

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
To keep him safe, he will kill himself

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
At least most of the people sent to the Flower Moon Night

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How much advantage is still unknown

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But at least it can be done

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
As long as they are well-prepared

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There is a chance to find the door that Xing Liu said to keep the beast

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's right

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I will go

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I will definitely save his old fox tail

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
By the way

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The name list of the deal that Mu Qi Bai has written

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's very likely to be in Long Li Terrace

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I will find it secretly

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Be sure to be safe this time

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't worry

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I will go

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Where did Mu Qi Bai hide the thing?

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why is this room so hot?

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why is this room so hot?

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why is this room so hot?

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why is this room so hot?

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I met the little cat again

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't worry

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This time I don't have to play any tricks to let you go

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Just kill you

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You really are a dog

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Little cat

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The claws are really sharp

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Just cut

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's really fun to play with you

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,500
you even bring with you a hand где

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,920
Her apple!

72
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
I'll step on it.

73
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,480
Why should I step on it?

74
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Mr. zoning out.

75
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,600
Here.

76
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,840
Y 그렇게做掉!

77
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,980
It's nothing, just a

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,240
Send it over there.

79
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,920
Xiao Mai, send it over there.

80
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,960
You see I can draw, but you're not surprised.

81
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,080
It seems that you and your master know a lot.

82
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,080
Although Ji Bozai hasn't reached the truth,

83
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
he has already reached the painting scene.

84
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,800
So he has a beast that can draw.

85
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,880
It's not hard to guess.

86
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,720
Not to mention that Ji Bozai

87
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,040
is not really relieved about me and Mingyi.

88
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,320
So I guessed it early on.

89
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,200
He will send you to watch the fire.

90
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,480
Come on, scallion oil cake with small fish.

91
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,560
It's the first time to do this.

92
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,760
I don't know how it tastes.

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
Enjoy your meal.

94
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,680
Thank you.

95
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,160
Your dragon

96
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,840
appears in the market in broad daylight.

97
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,880
Is it really okay?

98
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,200
Your Majesty, now...

99
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,840
Enjoy your meal.

100
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,880
Thank you.

101
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,600
Your Majesty, now and over there

102
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,840
are also open opponents.

103
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,160
No need to hide from me.

104
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,760
You're right.

105
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,360
Do you want to eat fish?

106
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,160
You dragons should all eat fish.

107
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
I have a name.

108
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,640
Go back after eating.

109
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
You didn't tell me your name.

110
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,440
Enjoy your meal.

111
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,640
Thank you.

112
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,040
Bu Xiu.

113
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,120
My name is 27.

114
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,360
Bu Xiu.

115
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Good name.

116
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,960
To be honest,

117
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I envy you dragons.

118
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,400
You're big and mighty.

119
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,280
Your figure is so strong.

120
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,720
แล ah

121
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
You might leave now.

122
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,200
Wait for me.

123
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,280
Brother.

124
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,120
How fun it is.

125
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,120
That idiot Ji

126
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,040
tells me to make peace.

127
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,360
He plays down on me

128
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,920
and makes fun of me all night.

129
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,440
His actions

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,780
because his passion for the mountains

131
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,680
He met evil men

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,200
in Longlitai

133
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,040
Han Feng

134
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,840
He

135
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,520
Get away

136
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,120
Yes

137
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,300
you are asleep

138
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,440
I don't know what happened outside.

139
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I originally liked the ability of Ji Bozai.

140
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,440
I wanted to lure him to work for Ji Xingyuan.

141
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Who knew that he only wanted to fight against me.

142
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Brother, he doesn't understand anything.

143
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Winning a Qingyun Conference for Ji Xingyuan is nothing.

144
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Only people like me can change the beast into a group.

145
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Having the power of the beast,

146
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Ji Xingyuan will not be afraid of anyone.

147
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Brother,

148
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Ji Xingyuan needs to be really strong.

149
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,440
There are some sacrifices that cannot be avoided.

150
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
I was reckless.

151
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,440
I let the people in the bed run away.

152
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,440
What did you say just now?

153
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
I... I am incompetent.

154
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I let the people in the bed...

155
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Ji Bozai is too cunning.

156
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
He still has a backer.

157
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
He arranged someone to take over.

158
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
The person who took over is the same blood as his.

159
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,440
I guess that is his successor.

160
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,440
I'm afraid... I'm afraid Ji Bozai has been hiding his cultivation.

161
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
His successor...

162
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,440
His successor can already be turned into a human form.

163
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,440
They didn't find anything else, right?

164
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
No.

165
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Han Fengjun, don't worry.

166
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I definitely didn't reveal the existence of the Shiling Tree.

167
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
It was me who lost my temper.

168
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
That Ji Bozai and Mingyi had a quarrel and were kicked out of the room.

169
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
They were sent to the Flower Moon Night.

170
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,440
We were ordered to monitor the Shouhua Pan Palace and watch Mingyi for a night.

171
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,440
I just didn't expect that Ji Bozai could let Mingxian, that white cat, listen to him.

172
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
He even joined hands with his own successor...

173
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Yan Xiu!

174
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
In the past few days in the Shouhua Pan Palace,

175
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,440
you have been so loyal to this medical career.

176
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,440
I have been watching every day the harmony between you and Ji Bozai.

177
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
You don't need to worry.

178
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
If it wasn't for you...

179
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,440
I just don't want to get too close to Ji Bozai.

180
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Otherwise, it would be even worse.

181
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
I have no objection.

182
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Please give me your opinion.

183
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Give me your opinion!

184
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
I have spent so much effort to cultivate it.

185
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,440
But I think it's useless.

186
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Forget it.

187
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,440
I know of a way to help this Han Qingzhu.

188
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
You know how to treat it?

189
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
I will go and get it right away.

190
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Get it?

191
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
If I remember correctly,

192
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
the way you said it should be using your teeth.

193
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Yes.

194
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
The wings...

195
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
are turned upside down.

196
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,440
I didn't say I should use my own teeth.

197
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
I will do it myself.

198
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
You are really a skilled doctor.

199
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,440
You even cured the problem of Sun Liao's mouth rotting.

200
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Then, taking care of my brother

201
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
won't be a problem, right?

202
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
I will do my best.

203
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
That tree is definitely a problem.

204
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Mu Qi Bai likes flowers and trees.

205
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
But in his yard,

206
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
only that one tree has a growth.

207
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
It's like sucking up other trees

208
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
and feeding it to himself.

209
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,400
I think the tree I saw in my back

210
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
is that tree.

211
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
I think it's from the yard

212
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
to the underground chamber.

213
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Its root looks more like a demon.

214
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
If it can suck up other trees,

215
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
maybe

216
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
it can suck up the spirit of life.

217
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,400
I saw a ancient secret tree from the forest.

218
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,400
It can take the spirit from the human body to the wood

219
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
and turn it into the Shiling Tree.

220
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
There are blood vessels around the tree.

221
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,400
The Shiling Tree can keep the spirit alive.

222
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
But someone used them.

223
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Is this the special door

224
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
that Xin Liu mentioned to change the monster?

225
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
The best way to raise a monster

226
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
is to use the spirit of life.

227
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
The monster was in chaos a hundred years ago.

228
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
People tried to kill it.

229
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Even the fairy who raised it

230
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
was swallowed by them.

231
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
If Mu Qi Bai

232
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
gathers these monsters

233
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
and turns them into a king,

234
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
the consequences will be unimaginable.

235
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
It's such a big deal.

236
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Let's report to the God of the Star.

237
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
The God of the Star has been controlled by Mu Qi Bai.

238
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
He can't sleep all year round.

239
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
He has no intention to be with the puppet.

240
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Then,

241
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
tell me the other five secrets.

242
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
The secret of the five realms.

243
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
These emperors

244
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
are just seeking for peace.

245
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
If they know

246
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
the existence of the Demon Beast Army,

247
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
I'm afraid they only want to be the key.

248
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Use this power to dominate the six realms.

249
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Not all emperors

250
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
are enslaved by power.

251
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Everyone will consider

252
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
other lives for the six realms.

253
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,400
We should try to unite everyone.

254
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Unite?

255
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
How is that possible?

256
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
But our power is too weak.

257
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
The Demon Beast Army is too powerful.

258
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
If we can't stop Mu Qi Bai

259
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
with our power,

260
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
what will happen to the six realms?

261
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
You said that the lower realms have been shared for seven years.

262
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
They will grow up in a place like the Yao Gong Gong.

263
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
They will believe that there is justice

264
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
in the six realms.

265
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,400
If you live in the abyss for a day,

266
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
you will understand

267
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,400
what is the greed and evil thought of humanity.

268
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
If the Demon Beast Army is open,

269
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
it's not Mu Qi Bai's turn to be a troublemaker.

270
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
The six realms will be in chaos

271
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
for this power.

272
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
You are no exception.

273
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
You...

274
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
You didn't die because of your birth.

275
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I'm too precious.

277
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
You were born in the upper realms.

278
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
That's why you are too precious.

279
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Tian Ji has written the handbook.

280
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
The training will end from today.

281
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
You don't need to work in the calligraphy department.

282
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Go.

283
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Don't let this beast

284
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
have any problems with me.

285
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Greetings, Father.

286
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Chao Yu,

287
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,400
you did a good job

288
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
in curing the chaos of Cang Wu Qiu.

289
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Do you have any rewards?

290
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
I have my duties.

291
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
I don't dare to take any credit.

292
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
You have done a good job in curing the chaos.

293
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I will call you

294
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Lord Jing Xi.

295
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Your rewards are all from Heaven.

296
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
It's just that

297
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
I only hope to be able to help you.

298
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Father,

299
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
a few days ago,

300
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:59,980
the

301
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,980
I want to be crowned.

302
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,980
I don't know if you've heard of this before.

303
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,980
Let me show you something.

304
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
The tongue of the dead is in there.

305
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
That's because they saved the dead.

306
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I will ask you again.

307
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
You have done a good job in curing the chaos.

308
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Now you are crowned

309
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Lord Jing Xi.

310
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
What do you think?

311
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Father, you are wise.

312
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
I only want to help you

313
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
with my whole heart.

314
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
I have no intention of being a burden.

315
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Father, you are wise.

316
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Congratulations, Your Highness.

317
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
You have won the title of Lord Jing Xi.

318
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Get lost!

319
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

320
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
I thought you would be the Crown Prince this time.

321
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
But I heard that

322
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Father has granted you the title of Lord Jing Xi.

323
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
You are still the Crown Prince.

324
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I have been thinking about it.

325
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
I have been thinking about it.

326
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I have been thinking about it.

327
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
I have been thinking about it.

328
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
You are the title of Lord Jing Xi.

329
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
And you killed some of your men.

330
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
You are here to laugh at me.

331
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
How dare I?

332
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Father has been disemboweled from the position of Crown Prince

333
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
because his sons are many.

334
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
He is waiting to see our performance.

335
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
But I really hope

336
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
that you can be the Crown Prince.

337
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
What do you want to say?

338
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Do you know

339
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
where Chaoyuan

340
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
has been these months?

341
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
He is a useless man.

342
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Where can he go?

343
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
He?

344
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
I heard that the Heart-wrenching Courtyard is practicing medicine in the Chanyuan.

345
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
He went there to find the dream of the Yellow-Curved Dream.

346
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
What?

347
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Chaoyuan has been

348
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
loved by his brother since he was a child.

349
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
If he finds the dream of the Yellow-Curved Dream first

350
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
and gives it to Father,

351
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
do you think Father will allow him

352
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
to cultivate his spiritual pulse?

353
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
This is a great achievement.

354
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
If he is the Crown Prince,

355
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
will Chaoyuan

356
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
also have a position?

357
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
What?

358
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
That man wants to come to the Heart-wrenching Courtyard in person?

359
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Yes.

360
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
The single person's identity is restricted.

361
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
He wants to be introduced by His Highness himself.

362
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
He wants to be escorted.

363
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Your Majesty.

364
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
After a few days,

365
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Mu Qi Bai finally left Longlitai.

366
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Yes.

367
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
He carried a boat and was looking at Chaoyuan.

368
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
I put the stone print of Ming Yi

369
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
on his boat.

370
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Within six hours,

371
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I can see his location.

372
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
All the little things he made

373
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
are useful to my brother.

374
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Indeed.

375
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
I asked His Majesty to observe

376
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
the 27th movement near Longlitai.

377
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
He did carefully observe it.

378
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
He didn't find any other problems.

379
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
He listened to Ming Yi so much.

380
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
It seems that he and Ming Xian

381
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
have a deep relationship.

382
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:27,880
So Ming Xian's

383
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Qi Xian Jun.

384
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
You and Ji Bo Zai have successfully

385
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
received the letter.

386
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Send him out.

387
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
We can go to the Lingxi Pavilion.

388
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
What?

389
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
You're worried that I'll go alone

390
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
to find the Beast Lord?

391
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Then you can come with me.

392
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I believe that Ji Xian Jun is like me.

393
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
He won't be tempted by

394
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
this dangerous battle.

395
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
It's cold at night.

396
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Ji Xian Jun is in danger.

397
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
You should be careful.

398
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,000
Ji Yuan

399
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Are you going to let him

400
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
go alone to find the Beast Lord?

401
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I mean,

402
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
the power of the Beast Lord

403
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
is all about being a group of nobles.

404
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,000
I only trust you.

405
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:56,740
Add the

406
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,320
I'll sit here.

407
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,240
I won't go anywhere.

408
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,960
Just watch me.

409
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,520
Just have a try.

410
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,520
Don't be afraid.

411
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,240
What's your relationship with Ming Xian?

412
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,640
If His Majesty can let you go,

413
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,080
it's not a big deal.

414
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,640
But I want to ask you...

415
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,000
I have a marriage contract with Ming Xian.

416
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,240
Marriage contract?

417
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,280
You and Ming Xian?

418
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,160
You're the spy of Yaoguang Mountain?

419
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,840
No, no.

420
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,240
His Majesty won't let you go.

421
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,240
If he can let you go,

422
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
it means you won't harm him.

423
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,120
Why are you in the auspicious night?

424
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,080
You're still in the night of the full moon.

425
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,360
I...

426
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,200
Did Ming Xian...

427
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,680
and I...

428
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,400
get so angry every day...

429
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,320
that we're like old men?

430
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,800
He made you go to the night of the full moon...

431
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,640
to make up for your loss.

432
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,560
It's true that he did harm.

433
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
You're a war god.

434
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,520
How can you be so mean?

435
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,800
Listen to me.

436
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,360
His Majesty won't mind it.

437
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,000
He saved me back then.

438
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,120
Now he's willing to save you.

439
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,560
But you shouldn't have kept it from him.

440
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
You've gone too far.

441
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,240
Listen to me.

442
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,160
Work, work!

443
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,880
Too busy?

444
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,920
Amazing!

445
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,560
Yes, if you're so lazy,

446
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,720
I'll have to pay for it myself.

447
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
rico...

448
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,040
Right, IOB.

449
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,400
Right.

450
00:28:50,400 --> 00:29:08,200
He is a

451
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:19,880
I have

452
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,800
It's being trapped here?

453
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,760
That's the Labyrinth喧嘩 place,

454
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,600
and you can find him.

455
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:49,840
She claims that the

456
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,000
Nonέ gifted meodzi

457
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,480
blood print

458
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Doctor Jimo was into me

459
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,400
this is the seal she changed to prevent me from returning sixth sense

460
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,960
She's dead.

461
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,960
Go.

462
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,320
Those are the dead spirits that Chen Yuan کیd,

463
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,760
the lick from Qu Katherine,

464
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,320
because she tester will release her.

465
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,960
Don't die.

466
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,280
Don't die.

467
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,280
They haven't left

468
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,720
capital safely.

469
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,760
My mother

470
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,800
caught them back.

471
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,800
You're thorough!

472
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:46,800
Now

473
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,640
I'm not going to go on an expedition!

474
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,560
Pan Min!

475
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,560
If cupping can cure me...

476
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,720
I'm definitely living on!

477
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,780
I'll live the rest of my life!

478
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,960
Dear Turkish boy!

479
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,600
No way.

480
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,440
Why is Fairy Ruoshui here?

481
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,080
Didn't we already...

482
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,600
Listen.

483
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,200
Originally,

484
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,840
you only needed to do some hard work in the Abyss of God.

485
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,920
It was all done by Count Ji.

486
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,320
Now that the Abyss of God is sealed,

487
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,920
the Rebellion Hall has been released.

488
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,160
Even if you don't know much,

489
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,760
you might have accidentally leaked some secrets.

490
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,120
So you

491
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,880
can only do some thinking.

492
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,280
Han Feng.

493
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,080
Don't blame me.

494
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,680
If you want to blame someone,

495
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,640
blame Count Ji.

496
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,520
So weak.

497
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,360
You're too weak.

498
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,280
You broke it so easily.

499
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,280
How can you do this?

500
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,520
How can you save your own life?

501
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,960
I'm not weak at all.

502
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,360
I... I even got a kidney disease.

503
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,360
I'm very tough.

504
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,680
I must survive.

505
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,720
Changcheng.

506
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,360
Heaven.

507
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,760
Uncle.

508
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,360
As expected.

509
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,160
You want to be strong, too, right?

510
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,880
I...

511
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,680
I finally...

512
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,160
I finally got saved.

513
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,680
I can't let my mother down.

514
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,840
I can't let the people who saved me

515
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,760
to be wasted.

516
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,000
I must

517
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,000
live well.

518
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,160
Okay.

519
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,280
Let me help you.

520
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,280
You're so weak.

521
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,240
You can't be a strong man by yourself.

522
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,320
You'd better quit and seek a second chance.

523
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,200
Be a part of the strong.

524
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Maybe

525
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,000
a lucky aqua Ge Ge commandant will help?

526
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,240
It's a good luck.

527
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,280
What are you doing?

528
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,400
I ate the koi grass.

529
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,640
I'm feeling better now.

530
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,800
So I want to give this to Ji Xuan Jun

531
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,760
as a gift.

532
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
My life was given by my mother.

533
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I must live well.

534
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
Thank you, Ji Xuan Jun.

535
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,320
My Lord.

536
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,200
The person who disappears from my life

537
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,920
is no more.

538
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,880
But whoever was with me

539
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:56,160
would disappear from my life.

540
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,620
I see that

541
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,520
you try hard

542
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,880
I owe you what I feel and what I see.

543
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,520
I owe you what I feel and what I see.

544
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,520
I wish I could live my life as a firefly

545
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,520
and love could pass by again.

546
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,320
Look at the fireflies under the clouds.

547
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,720
They are covered with the night sky.

548
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:34,120
Do you remember me?

549
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,120
I'm your dark night.

550
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,120
The coldness is not warm.

551
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:48,120
Burn my love and put it in your chest.

552
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Even in this vast world,

553
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,120
there is only my light

554
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,120
that shines brightly for you.

555
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:08,120
If your world was once a boundless desert,

556
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:15,120
I'd like to tear it apart and fill it with your wounds.

557
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,120
Even if this life is like a shooting star,

558
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:26,120
I'd like to be with you forever.

559
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:35,120
I'd like to be your light.

560
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:06,120
The Long Ballad

561
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:13,120
The Long Ballad

562
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,120

The Long Ballad

564
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:39,120
When the clouds in the sky are left behind me,

565
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:46,120
I'll use my soul to admire their weakness.

566
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:52,520
It's enough to lie to myself once.

567
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Even if I've never made any promises,

568
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,520
it'll take me forever to get your heart.

569
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:13,520
Your kindness is all because of love.

570
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:20,520
I'll drink up my pain to free you.

571
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:27,520
I'd rather give up my love than give up my life.

572
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,520
I'd like to ask the sky for help

573
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,520
when I'm struggling behind the abyss.

574
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,520
I'd like to be your armor for life.

575
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,520
So what if I'm broken?

576
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Fate has never been wrong.

577
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,520
The sun will eventually fall.

578
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:55,520
I'll fight against all the absurdity.

579
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:06,520
How long will it take for tears to fall from the sky to your heart?

580
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:13,520
Your kindness is all because of love.

581
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:20,520
I'll drink up my pain to free you.

582
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:27,520
I'd rather give up my love than give up my life.
