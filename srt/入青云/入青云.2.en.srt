1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you didn't have to go to the Flower Moon Night,

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
how could I have been able to catch you?

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're a scoundrel!

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The day before yesterday, I gave Lord He a bottle of wine.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He didn't wake up for three days.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yesterday, I gave Lord Zhang a massage.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yesterday, I gave him a fracture.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Today, I let you praise Lord Li.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You said that his head is the biggest and most powerful of the six realms.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think you're the one who made my head big.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Say it. Can you do it well?

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I... I...

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you can't do it well, then get lost!

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Lord, he's not in the room.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wait for me here.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're back, Lord. Are you hungry?

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The scallion oil cake I made is very delicious.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The owner of the Flower Moon Night, Fu Yue, told me that

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if you want to keep a man's heart,

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you have to be diligent and virtuous.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So I thought I'd go to the man's kitchen

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and make you breakfast.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Scallion oil cake?

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You were making this before?

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Scallion oil cake is my favorite food in this world.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't know if you like it or not.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm not sure if you like it.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Do you like it?

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then why don't you come to me?

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Lord, he has my safety.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He doesn't want me to go out.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Then I have to think about what to do for you.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Lord,

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
could it be...

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that you miss me?

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course I miss you.

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Lord, what are you doing?

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is just the piano.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Perfect.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm playing the drum.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm playing the piano.

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm playing the drum.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm playing the piano.

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm playing the piano.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Lord,

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
do you want to be here?

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is not appropriate.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You seem...

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You bit me?

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This...

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is not a good day.

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You are going to affect your spiritual cultivation.

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You have a bad habit. You have to take care of yourself.

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You are so sincere to me.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But you are so careless.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If that's the case,

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you can go back.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I won't leave you here.

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are so annoying.

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Madam.

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Lord.

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Lord.

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Send her back to the night.

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Lord, I know I was wrong.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Please don't send me back to the night.

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If I go back, the housekeeper will think I'm useless.

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
She will torture me to death.

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
My lord.

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My lord.

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
My lord.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I have been poor since I was a child.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
My parents died.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I spent days and nights in the garden.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I only ask you to give me a place to stay.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I beg you.

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Finished?

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The story is so ordinary.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's more boring.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
My lord.

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
My lord.

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You can leave me here.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I will do whatever you want.

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Please believe me.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
My lord.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I will do whatever you want.

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Please leave me here.

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Lord.

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's not fair.

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
My lord.

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He really misunderstood what happened.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I...

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I didn't mean it.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I just...

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
My lord, I will send you back to the night.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Can he think so highly of me?

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
My lord, send me back to the night.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm so useless.

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Please don't make a big deal out of it.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Could you be quiet?

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:15,400
Even if noise,

103
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,360
All this time?

104
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,560
songs

105
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,140
Come on, drink

106
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,740
Here, drink

107
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,620
Here, drink

108
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,020
.

109
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,360
You don't know, right?

110
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,320
Last night,

111
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,400
the little fairy who was brought back from the Flower Moon Night

112
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,320
by the Count Ji and the Immortal Ji,

113
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,240
do you remember?

114
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Yes, I remember.

115
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,760
Tell me.

116
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,280
He didn't know what to do

117
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,040
and offended our new star?

118
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,800
He was thrown back this morning.

119
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,880
He was thrown back?

120
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
Or the Immortal Ji

121
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
is so fresh

122
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
that he couldn't even stay up all night.

123
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
He was taken home for a day

124
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,040
and sent back.

125
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,440
It's too limited.

126
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,560
Is it true?

127
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,680
The Count Ji was sent back?

128
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Yes.

129
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,040
The housekeeper of Fuyue

130
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,680
is still being swept away by the enemy.

131
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,160
Poor thing.

132
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
He was swept from the south to the north,

133
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
from the east to the west,

134
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
from the back to the back,

135
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
but he didn't stop.

136
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,960
Why is the housekeeper of Fuyue

137
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,680
so cruel?

138
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,400
There's such a thing?

139
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Yes.

140
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,160
Since the fairy has been sent back from the Flower Moon Night,

141
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,280
this is a good chance

142
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
for us to send someone back.

143
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,680
After the Qingyun Conference,

144
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,080
I've been telling Count Ji many times

145
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,680
that he hasn't got a reply.

146
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,080
I'd like to see

147
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,080
why he refused me this time.

148
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,480
As long as I can send someone back to the Wu Gui Sea,

149
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
then in the eyes of outsiders,

150
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,280
the alliance between the Count Ji and my niece

151
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,080
is not too stable.

152
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,080
I understand.

153
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
Your Majesty,

154
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
the shadow has been sent back to the Flower Moon Night.

155
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,280
Now he's being punished by the housekeeper of Fuyue.

156
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,480
What about the barrier of magic being broken?

157
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,880
As long as he's back.

158
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
There are salt fairy everywhere in the Wu Gui Sea.

159
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,880
He's not the only one who's suspicious.

160
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,080
We can find a reason to send him away.

161
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,680
The most important thing now

162
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,080
is to get the Night Grass.

163
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
The Qingyun Conference was won by Zhu Shui and Ling Zhou.

164
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,680
The blind talisman is about to be lost.

165
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
I'll find it and take it.

166
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
I'll remember it in the tribute.

167
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,880
You can go there tomorrow.

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,680
Yes.

169
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,880
Bu Xiu,

170
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,280
Zhu Shui and Ling Zhou are evil.

171
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,080
You must protect yourself.

172
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,880
Wu Ai,

173
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,880
I'll kill one of them.

174
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,280
I'll kill one of them.

175
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,080
Your Majesty,

176
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,480
a woman has come.

177
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,080
It's from Lord Yan Xiao.

178
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,080
I'll do it.

179
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Don't kill him yet.

180
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,280
You can transfer the favour on Jiang Essentially in your next life

181
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,680
to Lady Xiao encont.

182
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,380
Lord Ye next.

183
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,380
that fairy has been sent back to the Flower Moon Night by Lord Ji.

184
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,780
Since the fairy served you badly last night,

185
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,380
it's also right for you to go back.

186
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,180
But these two fairies

187
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,380
were specially chosen by Lord Han Feng for you.

188
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,380
You are the chief warrior.

189
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:51,980
You should...

190
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,380
I really heard that

191
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,180
you went back to the Flower Moon Night.

192
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,180
Yes.

193
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,580
I'll be honest with you.

194
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,980
You left home with me this morning.

195
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,580
I was going to pretend to be fine,

196
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,380
but I was so confused

197
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,580
that I was like a little kid.

198
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,580
I didn't expect that I would make such a misunderstanding.

199
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,180
It's really funny.

200
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
But in the end,

201
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,180
I was really anxious

202
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,380
to make a mess.

203
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,580
Excuse me.

204
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,380
Xin Er.

205
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,580
This is the chestnut cake

206
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,380
that I made for you.

207
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,780
Try it.

208
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,980
Is it good?

209
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,380
It's good.

210
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
Since Ming Xian lost the competition

211
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,180
and escaped from Yaoguang Mountain,

212
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,180
His Majesty won't give His Majesty

213
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,380
any more affection.

214
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,780
Xin Er.

215
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,980
As a mother,

216
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,580
I finally have a chance to help you.

217
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,580
I've sent someone to get the hunting mirror

218
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,980
and searched the six realms.

219
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,980
Once Ming Xian's trace is found,

220
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,980
I'll take it down.

221
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,580
As long as I can get Ming Xian to die outside,

222
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,780
and the dragon is not in my hand,

223
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,980
before the next Qingyun Conference,

224
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,380
I will definitely

225
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,580
find a new Crown Prince.

226
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,780
You're acting.

227
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,380
Hurry up.

228
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,780
Your spirit energy is so weak.

229
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,780
You've been doing this for a long time

230
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,380
after someone else's ice.

231
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,980
How dare you offend the late Emperor Ji?

232
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,180
My sign of the Flower Moon Night

233
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,580
is almost ruined by you.

234
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,780
I really don't know

235
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,580
how I was soft-hearted

236
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
and brought you in.

237
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,580
I...

238
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,980
Because you're soft-hearted.

239
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,380
You're the best.

240
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,180
Mr. He,

241
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Mr. He,

242
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,780
are you leaving?

243
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,780
He said

244
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,780
he'd stop wiping the floor.

245
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,580
He's a tall and a short person.

246
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,180
He's been skating several times today.

247
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,380
He's very unhappy.

248
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,180
I've put on several more pairs of shoes for him.

249
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,780
Why don't you care about me at all?

250
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,180
Why don't I care about you?

251
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,380
Then why do you let him wipe the floor here?

252
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,580
Enough.

253
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,780
Stop wiping.

254
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,980
That's it.

255
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,180
Erqi,

256
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
did you

257
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,980
fall into the trap?

258
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
Listen,

259
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
Mingxian

260
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,180
was defeated by Ji Xingyuan just now.

261
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,180
He can't come here.

262
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,980
I think Lord Chengxun

263
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
is very confused

264
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,180
and sent you and me

265
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,180
to find him here.

266
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,580
No matter if we can find him or not,

267
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
we must come here

268
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,580
because the late Emperor is so lucky.

269
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,580
But

270
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,780
we still have to

271
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,380
find a way to deal with him.

272
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,180
Ji Xingyuan's night

273
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,380
is indeed a good one.

274
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,380
Come on.

275
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,580
Let's have a drink here.

276
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,180
The one who's chasing Ji Jing

277
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,380
is the one who's with him.

278
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,380
If Mingxian shows up nearby,

279
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,980
he'll definitely warn us.

280
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,580
After the door is opened,

281
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,380
there will only be a compass in the mirror.

282
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
Why isn't there any reaction?

283
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Is Mingxian really hiding here?

284
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,180
Chase him.

285
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,780
Don't run.

286
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,380
Stop.

287
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,180
Stop.

288
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,980
Move.

289
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,980
Move.

290
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,780
Move.

291
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,780
The compass is spinning.

292
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,180
Why can't we see him?

293
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,180
This...

295
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,580
Let me pass.

296
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,780
Let me pass.

297
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Where is he?

298
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,380
He's here.

299
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,180
It's him.

300
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,980
Don't run.

301
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,380
He found me again.

302
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Still trying to run?

303
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,780
Turn around.

304
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,180
Why isn't Chief Qi here yet?

305
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,380
If we can't do anything,

306
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,780
we can only do it ourselves.

307
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
This...

308
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,580
He's my man.

309
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,980
Why are you chasing him?

310
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,380
The Ji County Army has taken a move.

311
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,580
Why are you interfering?

312
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,980
The Fairy is suspicious.

313
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,780
She's trying to get the mirror.

314
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180
Move.

315
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,180
Yao Guangshan.

316
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,380
You lost the Qingyun Conference.

317
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,580
Now you're the next.

318
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,380
Now you're trying to get the compass.

319
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,980
You're trying to get the mirror

320
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
and get me on the ground.

321
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
Get lost.

322
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,980
Chief Qi.

323
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,380
We're following orders.

324
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,980
The Fairy is suspicious.

325
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,180
She ran away when she saw us.

326
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,580
We...

327
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,780
Can't you understand me?

328
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,380
I said,

329
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,180
get lost.

330
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,180
She's a fairy from the Garden.

331
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,380
She can't be a fairy.

332
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,180
It must be the magic of Lord Chengyun.

333
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,580
Let's go.

334
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,780
Don't make a fuss.

335
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,780
Okay.

336
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,980
They left.

337
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
Yes.

338
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,580
Why are you running around?

339
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,580
Hurry.

340
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,780
Change your clothes.

341
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,380
Come back to Wugui Sea with me.

342
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
Yes.

343
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,380
Yes.

344
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,980
You're not affectionate.

345
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,780
You keep recommending Lord Han Feng.

346
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
But if you really offend Lord Han Feng,

347
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,180
what's the point?

348
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,580
I'll do it.

349
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,980
Hello.

350
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,580
You're the MTall burned monster,

351
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,980
transfer girl and h plugging the set.

352
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,980
Let's play a match to decide a winner at the truth.

353
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,780
If sheNow

354
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,380
he won't do anything.

355
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Go.

356
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,020
Your Majesty.

357
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,940
Your Majesty.

358
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,020
It's been so long.

359
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,620
You want to replace me so soon?

360
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,820
Don't be angry.

361
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,620
Brother Yan.

362
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,180
Explain it to me.

363
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,820
I'm sorry.

364
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,380
Miss Ming Yi.

365
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,820
These two immortals

366
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,740
were carefully selected by Lord Han Feng.

367
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,820
They will never compete with you.

368
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,940
My Lord.

369
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,380
When you brought me back from the Flower Moon Night,

370
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,340
did you promise me

371
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,620
to treat each other sincerely

372
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,580
and let me stay in the Wu Gui Sea

373
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,100
peacefully?

374
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,020
Kind of.

375
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,660
Since it's like this,

376
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,820
why am I not

377
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,220
the female master of the Wu Gui Sea?

378
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,540
I think so.

379
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,580
I think so?

380
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,420
Yes.

381
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,660
Okay.

382
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,940
You said it.

383
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,460
If you two

384
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,900
insist on staying in the Wu Gui Sea,

385
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,060
I'd rather ruin myself.

386
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,260
Never.

387
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,860
Then let them go.

388
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,700
By the way, tell everyone

389
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,900
that I'm the female master of the Wu Gui Sea.

390
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,620
Let them die.

391
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,500
Don't let anyone in.

392
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,540
Or I'll die for you.

393
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,740
Brother Yan.

394
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,500
Look.

395
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,660
What should I do?

396
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,980
My family has become

397
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,420
restless because of your kindness.

398
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,260
You can't just

399
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,780
see me as a official, right?

400
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,700
Right?

401
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,940
What a good official.

402
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,100
Since Brother Ji has said so,

403
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,940
what else can I do?

404
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,100
Please, Your Majesty.

405
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,380
You two continue.

406
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,500
I'll go.

407
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,100
What are you looking at me for?

408
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,220
I didn't take it back.

409
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,660
I'm the female master of the Wu Gui Sea.

410
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,620
You're welcome.

411
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,620
I'll go.

412
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,060
Sir.

413
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,940
Who are you?

414
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,540
You've been back to Huayue for only

415
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,740
half an hour.

416
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,620
So Yan Xiao brought people here.

417
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,380
It has nothing to do with me.

418
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,740
Sir, do you suspect

419
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,380
that I spread the news?

420
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,300
Yao Guang Mountain's broken mirror

421
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,620
has reacted to you.

422
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,620
Who are you?

423
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,060
Sir, let go of me.

424
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,020
It hurts.

425
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,700
Sir, you're just testing me.

426
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,020
Let's see if I used the transformation skill.

427
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,780
Who?

428
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,860
You.

429
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,460
You're determined to wrong me, right?

430
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,820
How do I know

431
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,060
what the broken mirror has to do with me?

432
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,940
The tribute from Yao Guang Mountain

433
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,620
is all yours.

434
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,540
Maybe the tracking agent

435
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,900
has been affected.

436
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,540
What a coincidence.

437
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,500
Then you tested me.

438
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,180
Did you find anything?

439
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,820
No.

440
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,220
I searched for the body and asked for the question.

441
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,540
I spent a lot of money.

442
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,460
But I got nothing.

443
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,540
I feel sorry for you.

444
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,780
I don't think so.

445
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,700
When I asked you the question,

446
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,740
you were in a mess.

447
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,820
You're the one who's in a mess.

448
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,300
If you don't believe me,

449
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,060
I'll leave.

450
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,460
Let's see where these things come from.

451
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Please spare my life, sir.

452
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,580
Why did you come to the Wu Gui Sea?

453
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,260
I'm afraid I can't find the body.

454
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,340
I'm afraid I can't find the body.

455
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,740
I'm afraid I can't find the body.

456
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,980
I'm afraid I can't find the body.

457
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,540
I'm afraid I can't find the body.

458
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,180
I'm afraid I can't find the body.

459
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,060
I'm afraid I can't find the body.

460
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,100
Because I'm too poor.

461
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,700
My family has been in the water of drought for generations.

462
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,540
I can only use herbs to survive.

463
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,300
The only friends I know

464
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,900
are all in trouble.

465
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,460
So I...

466
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,500
You shouldn't do that.

467
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,540
You can't do that.

468
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,540
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,180
I've paid for the house of Xu Kuofu.

470
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,100
If you need anything, I'll...

471
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,700
Just say it.

472
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,980
I told Yan Xiao

473
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,780
that you're the owner of the Wu Gui Sea.

474
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,380
If you need anything,

475
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,820
just tell me.

476
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,140
And

477
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,380
this room will be yours from now on.

478
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,220
This room...

479
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,740
This...

480
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,420
Thank you, sir.

481
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,380
Thank you, sir.

482
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,180
Thank you, sir.

483
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,380
Thank you, sir.

484
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,860
I...

485
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,260
Ji Bu is very suspicious.

486
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,860
We must be prepared.

487
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,300
What else do you need?

488
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,300
Hmm.

489
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:10,940
Hmm.

490
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,060
If I pretend to be greedy,

491
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,820
I can solve his doubts.

492
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,900
As long as I can solve it,

493
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,500
I can make you look good.

494
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,620
Master.

495
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,620
How many times have I told you?

496
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,900
I don't need your luggage.

497
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,100
Yes.

498
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,060
Go to the bamboo water bell tower

499
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,900
and go to the water of the cold rat first.

500
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,620
Why?

501
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,700
Ming Yi was born in the water of the cold rat.

502
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,940
You check his background carefully.

503
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,420
Master, you want to keep him?

504
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,580
I want to keep him temporarily.

505
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,180
He took my identity

506
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,340
in front of Yan Xiao.

507
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,820
It's not good to send him away again.

508
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,260
People outside

509
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,380
are also trying to

510
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,740
put their own people in.

511
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,580
If he really has no problem,

512
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,260
he can stay and be a pretext.

513
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,020
It's good to block those people.

514
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,460
Master is too cautious outside.

515
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,740
In fact,

516
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,900
it's easier to kill him.

517
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,620
If he really is a child

518
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,860
who wants the fairy's child in the water of the cold rat,

519
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,420
then his plan for me

520
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,300
will be useful.

521
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,700
Han Feng Jun is looking for you.

522
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,740
No.

523
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,020
I'm just here to play.

524
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,940
Please.

525
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:49,980
Thanks.

526
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,220
It's delicious.

527
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,620
I'm incompetent.

528
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,900
That Ji Bo Zai

529
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,740
took back the fairy of the Flower Moon Night again

530
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,940
and used her as a shield

531
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,300
to block the enemy.

532
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,940
Since you don't eat soft food,

533
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,460
then eat hard food.

534
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,700
It's not hard enough.

535
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,140
It's too hard.

536
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,220
Han Feng Jun means

537
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,500
he's trying to frame us.

538
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,420
But there's no evidence.

539
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,980
It's hard to get evidence.

540
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,820
Let me

541
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,180
feel it myself.

542
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,140
What is

543
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,740
the Wugui Sea like?

544
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,020
Han Feng Jun is right.

545
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,780
I can't see it outside now.

546
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,980
You can't hear us.

547
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,660
You're really good.

548
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,260
You managed to

549
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,340
calm Ji Bo Zai down

550
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,100
and let him keep you.

551
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,980
The current situation of Ji Xing Yuan

552
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,020
is that the God Lord is sick and fallen.

553
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,260
He usually falls asleep.

554
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,180
There's only one side of him.

555
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,180
He can't inherit the military position.

556
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,780
His brother Han Feng Jun is innocent.

557
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,740
He's likely to be the God Lord in the future.

558
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,380
But no one expected

559
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,220
that Princess Tian Ji

560
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,940
had found Ji Bo Zai who was in the dark.

561
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
He made Ji Xing Yuan who was constantly falling

562
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,460
to the top.

563
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,380
I was right.

564
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,660
After the Qiyun Conference,

565
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,180
Princess Tian Ji

566
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,500
also wanted to marry Ji Bo Zai.

567
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,860
Han Feng Jun

568
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,780
won't be happy.

569
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,780
So,

570
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,980
he's trying to frame Ji Bo Zai.

571
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,780
He's actually

572
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,220
trying to form an alliance with Princess Tian Ji.

573
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,020
So, Ji Bo Zai needs to block the arrows.

574
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,340
Just like I need to catch the target.

575
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,780
So, it's hard for Ji Bo Zai

576
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,940
to hide the dream of the emperor

577
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,700
in the turtle sea.

578
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,740
Have you checked his body?

579
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,860
Me?

580
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,700
What?

581
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,580
Think about it.

582
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,300
Maybe he has the most precious thing

583
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,380
with him.

584
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,060
How could it be so obvious?

585
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,500
The Lord is

586
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,900
in a mess.

587
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,580
The Lord is in a mess.

588
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,460
Could it be

589
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,140
he's really in a mess?

590
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,540
But can you search his body?

591
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,700
Searching his body might not work.

592
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,260
But

593
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,300
it can help us find his body.

594
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:50,800
Zai'er.

595
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,660
Where are you?

596
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,100
Do you want to die?

597
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,660
Masters won't kill me.

598
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,780
Hands up!

599
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,300
Hand up!

600
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,340
Who's your master?

601
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,700
Don't you know I'm still a kid?

602
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,540
Date him.

603
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,460
You'll be sure to get a certificate.

604
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,620
It's still here?

605
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:41,140
I've

606
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,500
some things

607
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
we have to go to bed on

608
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:46,900
Guards

609
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,260
later

610
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,020
It sounds

611
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,300
I had to find it.

612
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,860
Your master and I

613
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,060
learn things too fast.

614
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,540
This thing...

615
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,260
This...

616
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,900
What is this?

617
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,500
My eyes!

618
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,540
My eyes!

619
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,300
My eyes.

620
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,020
My eyes!

621
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
The Flower Moon Night

622
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,420
is almost half of my life.

623
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,540
This place...

624
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,140
I made many promises.

625
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,700
I also left many memories.

626
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,740
Thanks to your kindness,

627
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,380
I can forget about the past.

628
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,780
I'm very happy.

629
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,740
To give you a gift,

630
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,420
I hope you can

631
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,780
have a good life.

632
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,780
The thing I promised you

633
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,860
will be yours soon.

634
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,180
You won't regret

635
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,780
what you said before, right?

636
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,060
Don't worry, Xing.

637
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,420
You saved my life.

638
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,220
I will repay you.

639
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,540
I won't regret it.

640
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,380
I can't talk about kindness.

641
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,260
I will kill

642
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,020
anyone who doesn't have you.

643
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,740
He is my father,

644
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,740
but he treated my mother

645
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,060
so harshly.

646
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,100
I will never let him down.

647
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,780
I will do as you planned.

648
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,900
I will also

649
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,700
make him pay for it.

650
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,820
Darling.

651
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:59,740
Why should

652
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,900
you feel bad

653
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,140
about the person who's guilty?

654
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,380
For the piace,

655
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,860
I'm humans now.

656
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,420
I won't be like yesterday.

657
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,620
Tonight, again,

658
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,620
I'll get back

659
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,580
the Antrag network

660
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,580
Help me get a dress.

661
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
What dress?

662
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,580
You're so dirty!

663
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,980
Hurry up!

664
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,580
Hurry up!

665
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,380
You're using my weakness to deal with me?

666
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,780
Don't you think you're going too far?

667
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
I'm not going too far.

668
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,580
Which cat is the most obedient?

669
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
I'm the most obedient.

670
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
I'm the most obedient.

671
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
I'm the most obedient.

672
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I'm the most obedient.

673
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
I'm the most obedient.

674
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,580
This room is so airy.

675
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,580
It's so cold.

676
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,580
I can't even stand the cold.

677
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,180
You little brat.

678
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,580
You're trying to make me suffer?

679
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,580
This is too ordinary.

680
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,580
It's ordinary.

681
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
Okay.

682
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,580
You're back.

683
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,580
Is this really possible?

684
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,580
Okay.

685
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,580
Your Majesty.

686
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,580
Lord Han Feng is waiting for you inside.

687
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
Yu Jin.

688
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,580
Yu...

689
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,580
Yu Jin.

690
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,580
If it weren't for you,

691
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,580
I would have died in Ji Bo's hands.

692
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
It was that time,

693
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
I fell into his spiritual energy.

694
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
He's just treating Yu Jin

695
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,580
as a battle gift.

696
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,580
He keeps burning it here every day.

697
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,580
My brother.

698
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,580
There are very few outsiders in this Wu Gui Sea.

699
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,580
Did I offend you by coming here today?

700
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,580
No.

701
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
You're the one who brought me here.

702
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,580
I'm here to save you.

703
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,580
I'm here to save you.

704
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,580
I'm here to save you.

705
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,580
I'm here to save you.

706
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,580
I'm here to save you.

707
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
I'm here to save you.

708
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,580
It's nothing.

709
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,580
I'm just a visitor.

710
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,580
I'm sorry to have offended you.

711
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,580
This is where you live.

712
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,580
Okay.

713
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,580
Lord Han Feng, please come in.

714
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Brother.

715
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,580
You really live in a very good place.

716
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,580
Yes.

717
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
The past Chen Yuan

718
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,580
is full of dark and dark.

719
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,580
There are many places

720
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
that are too remote.

721
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,580
Right now,

722
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,580
I just like this cold and empty place.

723
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,580
You really are different from the rest.

724
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,580
But,

725
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,580
you only have that old house in Wu Gui Sea.

726
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
It's still very quiet.

727
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Why don't I arrange two people for you

728
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
so that you can have more fun here?

729
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,580
Lord Han Feng, you must not.

730
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
I'm afraid that the little fairy

731
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
will be confused again.

732
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,580
How can you find such a vulgar jar?

733
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
Mrs. Xun, bring me the wine.

734
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,580
This wine

735
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,580
was made by Meng Yang Qiu.

736
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
It's from the Jiuxian family.

737
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
Try it.

738
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,580
It's good wine.

739
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,580
To be honest,

740
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,580
I don't know

741
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,580
what it tastes like.

742
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,580
But,

743
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,580
to be honest,

744
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,580
I've always wanted to be friends with you.

745
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,580
My little niece, Tian Ji,

746
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
knew you first.

747
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,580
She was so good at acting

748
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
that she made you a fight.

749
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,580
You've made such a great contribution

750
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,580
to Ji Xing Yuan.

751
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,580
Although I'm a descendant,

752
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,580
I admire your respect and respect for me.

753
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,580
You're really overbearing.

754
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
It's my honor

755
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
to have your love.

756
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
Since you're willing

757
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,580
to be my friend,

758
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,580
I'm curious

759
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,580
if I can help you.

760
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,580
I'll do my best.

761
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Ji Xing Palace has been saying

762
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,580
that your spirit energy

763
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
is derived from Li Hen Tian.

764
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
You can survive

765
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,580
with Li Hen Tian.

766
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,580
Could it be

767
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
that you have the dream of the emperor?

768
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,580
It's enough to lie to myself

769
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,580
even if I've never been true to myself.

770
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,580
From the stars to the stars,

771
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,580
how long will it take for me to be with you?

772
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,580
Your tenderness to me

773
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,580
is all because of the love.

774
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,580
I'll drink up my pain

775
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,580
and give you freedom.

776
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Once I have the love,

777
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,580
I'll be willing to give up.

778
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,580
Behind the abyss,

779
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,580
I struggle for a long time.

780
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,580
I want to ask the sky

781
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,580
what's wrong with me

782
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,580
being a puppet for you?

783
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,580
Fate has never been wrong.

784
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,580
The sun will eventually fall.

785
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
I'll try my best

786
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,580
to avoid all the absurdity.

787
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,580
From the stars to the stars,

788
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,580
how long will it take for me to be with you?

789
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,580
Your tenderness to me

790
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:54,580
is all because of the love.

791
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,580
I'll drink up my pain

792
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,580
and give you freedom.

793
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,580
Once I have the love,

794
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:07,580
I'll be willing to give up.

795
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
The End
