00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,410
Can you hold out?

176
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,900
I'll beg His Majesty.

177
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,970
He can't keep you locked like this.

178
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,300
You have no spiritual veins.

179
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,900
You can't withstand this prison.

180
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,900
Keep this up and you'll die!

181
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,730
He locked me here.

182
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,340
I can't do anything.

183
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,300
But you can still move.

184
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,170
That's why I sent you to scout.

185
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,650
How is Ming Yi?

186
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,650
Answer me!

187
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,580
She's dead!

188
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,140
She didn't find the Golden Millet Dream.

189
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,010
Heavenly Grief flared.

190
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,450
She's already gone.

191
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,730
No.

192
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,780
Your Lordship.

193
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,340
- I'm getting out. - Your Lordship.

194
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,540
Your Lordship!

195
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,820
Are you mad?

196
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,620
His Majesty is only disciplining you.

197
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,100
If you break out yourself,

198
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,100
do you know the consequences?

199
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,580
Let go of me!

200
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,200
Your Lordship.

201
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,930
- Your Lordship! - I'm going to save Ming Yi!

202
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,010
Your Lordship.

203
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,410
I'm going to save Ming Yi.

204
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,580
She isn't dead!

205
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,900
I lied to you. She's still alive.

206
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,970
Your Lordship.

207
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,690
Is that true?

208
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,860
Yes.

209
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,780
She Tianlin already gave her the Medical Classics.

210
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,490
Really?

211
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,930
Yes.

212
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,970
I confirmed it myself.

213
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,860
Whatever you assigned me,

214
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,380
I'll see it done.

215
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,340
Your Lordship.

216
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,250
Think about yourself for once.

217
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,410
Don't worry about me.

218
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,650
Father has already lost three sons.

219
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,250
He won't let me die.

220
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,580
Survival of the fittest.

221
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,730
He'll choose me.

222
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,490
He has no choice but me.

223
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,340
Compared to other bow artifacts,

224
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,780
this one aims with higher precision,

225
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,860
hits harder and pierces deeper.

226
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,820
It can store spiritual power for the user.

227
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,140
And its arrows can shift forms

228
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,900
to fit different situations.

229
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,860
This is a warrior's weapon.

230
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,100
I may dislike artifacts,

231
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,060
but I'm not clueless.

232
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,060
They carry the forger's mind and intent.

233
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,930
When Ming Yi fought the netherbeast army,

234
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,930
her forging approach

235
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,060
matched this one exactly.

236
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,170
Clearly this is her handiwork.

237
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,900
She has spiritual veins,

238
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,900
but she isn't a warrior.

239
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,900
Did Ming Xian teach her?

240
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,340
Such forging skill takes

241
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,340
talent, combat, experience, and training,

242
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,820
all essential.

243
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,820
Only a battle-tested warrior

244
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,690
can master it.

245
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,950
[Demon-repelling parasol blueprint]

246
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,620
Ming Xian's iron-fan artifact is called Embers.

247
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,450
Too bad I already destroyed it.

248
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,650
It is my...

249
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,900
It's Ming Xian's most important artifact!

250
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,250
Do you know how many netherbeasts it can handle

251
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,210
at a crisis?

252
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,210
How did we get out?

253
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,210
Thanks to you blasting the exit.

254
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,300
It took everything we had.

255
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,170
Ji Bozai!

256
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,900
You actually have spiritual veins!

257
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,100
Tell me, who are you really?

258
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,450
If I have that name list,

259
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,970
I'll have proof

260
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,970
to drag out the villain

261
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,690
who used Heavenly Grief to poison Ming Xian.

262
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,820
Instead of waiting here.

263
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,900
Ming Xian

264
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,380
was hit by Heavenly Grief?

265
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,060
No wonder...

266
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,860
At the Qingyun Tournament,

267
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,620
his power clearly faded.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

268
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,450
I'm fine.

269
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,250
Ming Yi's reacting...

270
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,690
Even with backlash from the Graft Spell,

271
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,690
your body shouldn't be this weak.

272
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,650
So cold.

273
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,620
She's just like me

274
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,380
back when I was struck by Heavenly Grief.

275
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,060
She was the one poisoned.

276
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,170
I am Ming Xian...

277
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,060
Ming Xian's fiancée.

278
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,930
Where was Ming Xian?

279
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,930
Did one Heavenly Grief strike

280
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,340
and the severing of spiritual veins already ruin him?

281
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,140
He couldn't care less about you!

282
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,210
Is he even a man?

283
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,490
He isn't. Happy now?

284
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:28,930
Could it be...

285
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,010
Stop, Fuyue.

286
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,250
Stop!

287
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,930
Fuyue.

288
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,010
Why?

289
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,650
Why burn your cultivation to save me?

290
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,930
Don't worry.

291
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,410
I won't die.

292
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,620
Yousu Fox Tribe can hide their inner cores

293
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,620
in illusions.

294
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,490
Even if cultivation drains,

295
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,300
they won't die like the Immortals.

296
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,780
But once it's gone,

297
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,140
you'll revert to your true form.

298
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,450
If that day really comes,

299
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,210
if I become

300
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,340
just another wild fox among thousands,

301
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,690
no different from the rest,

302
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,490
will you still know me?

303
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,620
Like you always know Ming Yi?

304
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,820
Your Highness, His Majesty calls.

305
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,490
You've been practicing the Thousand Insect Spell!

306
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,490
So you could kill your two brothers.

307
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,300
How dare you covet the Bo's Medical Classics

308
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,650
and work right under my nose?

309
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,730
You hid in Jixing Abyss for so long.

310
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,010
You still didn't find the Golden Millet Dream?

311
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,170
I've verified the rumor is false.

312
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,450
Ji Bozai never had the Golden Millet Dream.

313
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,900
What use is that?

314
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,380
You stole the Bo's Medical Classics

315
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,210
to brew the Golden Millet Dream yourself?

316
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,010
If I say

317
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,860
I've learned in Jixing Abyss

318
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,690
how to breach the Zhulong Barrier,

319
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,820
what will you think of that?

320
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,970
Go on.

321
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,170
I know.

322
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,340
You've long sought the Bo clan's ancestral home

323
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,300
to take what you missed back then,

324
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,730
Part 2 of the Bo's Medical Classics.

325
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,650
But Zhulong revived

326
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,820
and cast a barrier.

327
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,930
No outsider can find the Bo clan's ancestral home.

328
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,650
But do not worry.

329
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,820
I can do this for you.

330
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,380
So you'd rather keep from me

331
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,650
how to break the Zhulong Barrier.

332
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,900
I want to be strong.

333
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,210
I won't live under another's heel.

334
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,490
Across the Six Realms,

335
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,340
you alone stand supreme.

336
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,140
Serving you

337
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,820
and aligning with you

338
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,340
keeps me from being carved up.

339
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,900
If you get what you want

340
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,010
and grant me trust and backing,

341
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,930
I'll be a power of Zhushui Spiritual State.

342
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,970
A few days apart,

343
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,780
I hardly recognize you.

344
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,930
Chao Yuan,

345
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,930
you are bold.

346
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,690
Father,

347
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,140
I seek the Golden Millet Dream

348
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,450
to awaken spiritual veins

349
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,170
and vie at the Qingyun Tournament.

350
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,170
But it's only to help you

351
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,860
to defend Zhushui's honor.

352
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,100
I dare not covet more.

353
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,900
This is my intent.

354
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,780
And it will not change.

355
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,930
Go for it, my son.

356
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,140
Bring that Bo's Medical Classics

357
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,730
back to me.

358
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,780
This Medical Classics is sealed.

359
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,450
It's a Bo clan's secret art.

360
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,820
Seems we must find Part 2 of the Medical Classics

361
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,780
and join the two

362
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,650
before we can read it through.

363
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,580
I came with two matters.

364
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,410
First is about Situ Ling.

365
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,210
His identity is suspect.

366
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,860
It is in doubt.

367
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,650
But I owe him.

368
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,490
Some things I can't tell you.

369
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,690
By the way,

370
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,100
I've found Part 1 of the Medical Classics.

371
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,010
Across the Six Realms,

372
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,170
many eyes are on it.

373
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,250
But I promise

374
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,300
I won't leak a word.

375
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,650
And that is my second matter.

376
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,860
Why are you fixed on the Bo's Medical Classics?

377
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,650
Of course for Ming Xian.

378
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,170
Why stop me from checking your spiritual veins?

379
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,900
What are you hiding?

380
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,170
What do you want to check?

381
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,970
We're no longer involved.

382
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,340
I decide whether we are.

383
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,010
That day in Sunken Abyss,

384
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,450
your crossbow was built for offense not defense.

385
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,170
And it could pre-store spiritual power.

386
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,820
Only a battle-hardened warrior

387
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,380
could make that.

388
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,780
Has he sensed something?

389
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,490
What are you suspecting me of now?

390
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,860
You still care about me?

391
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,140
Ji Bozai,

392
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,170
you played the rake for so long.

393
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,730
Now you can't let go of a woman who fooled you.

394
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,490
I've been lying to you.

395
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,100
I meant to steal your master's Golden Millet Dream!

396
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,450
Ming Xian's busted fan is with me.

397
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,970
Don't you want it back?

398
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,970
If you do,

399
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,970
trade me something.

400
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,380
What do you want?

401
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,490
An artifact.

402
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,970
Forge one that's one of a kind,

403
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,780
one only you can make.

404
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,580
Fine, I'll give you the artifact.

405
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,860
But besides returning me Embers,

406
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,730
you'll erase our names on the Marriage Stone

407
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,780
and we're square after that.

408
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,140
You don't get to decide now.

409
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,180
Buxiu,

410
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,130
Situ Ling showed up in Sunken Abyss.

411
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,300
Something's off.

412
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,410
Either the Situ clan ties to the Emperor of Zhushui,

413
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,130
or his identity hides more.

414
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,970
Find a chance to ask around.

415
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,970
Yes, I'll see to it.

416
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,300
But about Ming Yi,

417
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,050
what's your plan?

418
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,490
She lies by habit.

419
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,300
Getting the truth won't be easy.

420
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,900
If she really is the one

421
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,450
in your heart,

422
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,570
she'll side with Yaoguang Mountain

423
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,180
and be your destined foe.

424
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,300
What do we do then?

425
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,340
Most things come as dilemmas.

426
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,090
But

427
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,340
I will find a way through.

428
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,050
Thanks to you for infusing it with spiritual power.

429
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,970
Look, how's the sword?

430
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,820
What's that face?

431
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,260
What do you think?

432
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,490
I know.

433
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,130
This sword was reborn from Embers.

434
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,410
But I remade it as a longsword.

435
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,860
No one else will notice.

436
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,450
The Embers artifact's my finest artifact, after all.

437
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,900
It senses danger in time

438
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,130
and shields its master by instinct.

439
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,530
I can't understand.

440
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,860
What spell did that guy put on you?

441
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,180
He's hurt you this badly.

442
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,930
He ruined the Golden Millet Dream.

443
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,260
He killed your only hope to live!

444
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,860
From where he stood,

445
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,090
he wasn't wrong.

446
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,090
And I'm heading to Zhangwei Mountain.

447
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,260
It's deadly there.

448
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,530
I mean,

449
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,900
if something really happens,

450
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,090
or we still can't make the Golden Millet Dream,

451
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,130
Ji Bozai still has to face

452
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,260
that Zhushui lot.

453
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,050
I just want this sword

454
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,610
to be there when it counts

455
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,340
to save his life,

456
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,220
like Embers once shielded me.

457
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,010
Try it.

458
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,220
It's razor sharp!

459
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,300
Don't mess around.

460
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,860
A shame for our sect...

461
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,130
Hear that sound!

462
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,970
Your Lordship.

463
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,970
I'll take my leave.

464
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,380
This is the artifact I promised.

465
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,410
It's named Nirvana.

466
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,220
In exchange,

467
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,090
please return Embers to me.

468
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,130
And erase our names on the Marriage Stone.

469
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,570
Take this artifact

470
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,860
and we're square.

471
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,130
Please return Embers soon.

472
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,610
This artifact you made...

473
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,610
I'm not satisfied.

474
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,220
It doesn't count.

475
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,050
You're playing me?

476
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,740
A sword's cry should be dragon song.

477
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,050
Your Nirvana doesn't qualify.

478
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,050
That still isn't dragon song?

479
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,820
It isn't.

480
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,180
Because I decide.

481
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,410
So it doesn't count.

482
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,570
Look closely.

483
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,820
This artifact crowns the Six Realms.

484
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,050
It's my proudest work!

485
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,380
So cut the nonsense.

486
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,090
Liar.

487
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,820
Ji Bozai!

488
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,300
Have you no shame?

489
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,130
Ming Yi.

490
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,340
Between us,

491
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,050
is Ming Xian still in the way?

492
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,410
Even without him,

493
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,380
there's too much mess between us.

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,780
on Mu Qibai's name list,

505
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,780
there's finally progress.

506
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,490
I traced

507
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,300
the fairy whom Sun Liao once loved.

508
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,220
From her I learned

509
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,900
Mu Qibai's name list

510
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,180
is not a jade slip.

511
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,570
It's inside a Recording Mirror.

512
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,300
A Recording Mirror?

513
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,490
So those shards under the Soul-Consuming Tree

514
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,130
are from the Recording Mirror?

515
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,660
We need a way to read it.

516
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,780
Earlier I probed the Situ clan.

517
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,490
They always aligned with Mu Qibai.

518
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,220
After he died,

519
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,410
they petitioned to cut ties.

520
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,410
But in the end,

521
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,610
they're tangled with Zhushui Spiritual State.

522
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,300
Situ Ling is said

523
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,970
to be a bastard sent away,

524
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,010
later taken back and acknowledged.

525
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,900
Yet the registry never notes

526
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,860
who his birth parents are.

527
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,570
Maybe

528
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,300
his identity is just a shell.

529
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,300
Master, any progress?

530
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,130
I still can't break the seal on it.

531
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,340
We'll have to wait for Part 2 of the Medical Classics.

532
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,610
How's your health?

533
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,450
Can you hold on?

534
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,090
Let's leave for Zhangwei Mountain tomorrow.

535
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,570
Your Lordship.

536
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,740
You're awake.

537
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,260
Here.

538
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,620
Feeling better?

539
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,530
Your Lordship,

540
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,850
we finally made it back to Jixing Abyss.

541
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,740
What's our move?

542
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,410
Father told me to find the Bo clan's ancestral home

543
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,220
and fetch Part 2 of the Medical Classics.

544
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,740
Ming Yi sets out for Zhangwei Mountain at dawn.

545
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,410
The Zhulong Barrier admits Bo clan's blood only.

546
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,370
I'll lead Ji Bozai there

547
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,050
to help her enter the Bo clan's ancestral home.

548
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,930
If she gets the recipe,

549
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,850
brews Golden Millet Dream and lives,

550
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,620
she won't hand you the recipe.

551
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,660
How will you answer then?

552
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,100
What will His Majesty do?

553
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,410
Kill or cut me, I'm not afraid.

554
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,660
As long as Ming Yi is safe,

555
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,050
nothing else matters.

556
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,970
Tomorrow send Ji Bozai a flying letter.
