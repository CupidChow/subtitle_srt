1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's you

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's you

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it the heat that will last only in the wind and rain?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You are the warmth engraved in my heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Memories have been struggling with you

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The unforgettable ten years of love

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The unbreakable ten thousand love letters

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I love you so much that I can't forget you

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The order of the gods and the gods

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The leader's order to keep the seven-leaf clover

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Tell me why my descendants will be cured of the disease of crying

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All the descendants of the descendants are descendants

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Should I just cut off the bloodline?

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I beg the tree to tell me how to die of the disease

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Help my descendants live a long life

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I, Hao Zhao, will exchange everything in this life

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will be able to fulfill your wishes

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But you have to do one thing first

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can fulfill your wish

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But you have to do one thing first

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ming Yi

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ming Yi

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ming Yi

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Your Highness, they are all dead

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What the hell is going on?

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Ming Yi

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What happened?

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sir

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Your Highness

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Someone was killed by a monster

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That one, that one, they're all dead

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Monster

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Monster

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Suddenly, a black cloud came to us

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How is that possible?

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The blood monster has been a problem since the fairies of the Qinglin Sect were born

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's already been eliminated

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Besides, if there really is a monster

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How can you still be alive?

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You must have seen it wrong

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I clearly saw it, how could it be wrong?

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a monster

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If it's not

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If it's not

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If it's not the late Lord Situ

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I would have died

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Han Feng Jun

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
From this point of view

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There is someone behind the back

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It must be this person

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He wants to wipe out Ming Yi and Ruo Shui

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,960
Since the

57
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Let's talk about it

58
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,960
You really saved them just now

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You really saw the monster

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry, Lord Situ

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can only let you sleep for a while

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
After I sent the back-up and left

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I returned

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I ran into one, two, three, four

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Anyway, there are many monsters

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Not yet

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm still attacking the two fairies

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I can't just sit around

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Defeating the monster

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is still the usual

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're still the same

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm still the same

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm still the same

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm still the same

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm still the same

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm still the same

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is still the usual

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,520
A public service is a burden to the private

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I did have some slack in the past

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But actually

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm considering it as a private

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What should be done

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What shouldn't be done

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Saving people from danger

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's also the responsibility of the private

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Han Feng Jun must have some misunderstanding about me

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Then you talk about it

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You have no spiritual connections

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How did you kill the monster

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Just because I have no spiritual connections since childhood

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I learned some skills

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Protect yourself

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I think

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Just for today

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Can bet on life

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Protect the two fairies

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's also because those monsters

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Haven't finished the training

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can only force one

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Since there are private statements

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know Han Feng Jun

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What are your doubts

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is strange

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What are you worried about

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The monster is in the world

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's not good to be in danger

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'd rather believe it than not believe it

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You can't believe it, you can't believe it

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Han Feng Jun

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This matter must be investigated

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ji Xian Jun has a point

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This matter must be investigated

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why is it a long time ago

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Just care about idle things

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now your physical therapy is not enough

119
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
ako

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Lin Cute captured first tem время

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How do you feel now

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Gentle Italian reverse

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm okay now

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Qiu Ruoshui's life

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
But what happened today

126
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
is too complicated.

127
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,600
First, the backer used Chen Yuan to make medicine.

128
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
Then, the monster beast appeared.

129
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,880
Fortunately, it's a big deal.

130
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,400
The Four Pan Sect will investigate Chen Yuan.

131
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,840
Then the blood-pattern flower deal

132
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,240
will stop here.

133
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,800
The people who know the water of Han Shu

134
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,840
finally don't have to

135
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,520
suffer because of the blood-pattern flower.

136
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,440
I asked you to send those gold and silver jewels.

137
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,600
You sent them all, right?

138
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,680
I didn't send the blood-pattern flower

139
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,640
to investigate them.

140
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,320
I did it for my own purpose.

141
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,160
I gave them the blood-pattern flower

142
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,000
as a reward.

143
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,840
It's a good thing, right?

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,880
He indeed needs money.

145
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,880
But you're so considerate

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
to yourself.

147
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,440
My Lord.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
I didn't hurt you, right?

149
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,440
My Lord, I'm fine.

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,880
You don't have to worry about me.

151
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,120
How is the Water Immortal?

152
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
He's fine.

153
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,760
Let me see your wound.

154
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,200
My Lord, I said I'm fine.

155
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,840
It means I'm really fine.

156
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,640
What?

157
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,160
You feel sorry for me?

158
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
You also got scared.

159
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,080
Rest early.

160
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
Where are you going today?

161
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,160
I'll leave after you fall asleep.

162
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,960
My Lord,

163
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
it's almost time to wake up.

164
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,520
Let's go.

165
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,400
Kylin is going directly to Lord of The fiber- frequencies

166
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,720
and hidden groups

167
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
to test and South wind.

168
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
If you decide now

169
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,960
I'll tell our South wind

170
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,400
to contact Qixiayuan

171
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,780
to take the Steps of 재도

172
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,360
to the external J speaks.

173
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,000
Because perhap

174
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,760
the inner ES is not ruined,

175
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,080
this time there's no distinction

176
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,080
What are you doing!

177
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,320
Go!

178
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,480
You keep putting them into the soup!

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,840
Go, go

180
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,880
Go, go

181
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,440
Except for you

182
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Let's go.

183
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
Ji Bozai.

184
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,880
Ji Bozai.

185
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,760
I promised you

186
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,320
to use my own life

187
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,320
to keep my daughter safe.

188
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,520
Now, I confess my sins.

189
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,000
When Lord Hanfeng promoted me,

190
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,240
it was about your crime.

191
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,960
You promised me.

192
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,600
You promised me

193
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,440
you wouldn't go back on your word.

194
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:42,560
You must give the

195
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,880
What are you laughing at?

196
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
What are you laughing at?

197
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,280
Do you think

198
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,520
I will be friends with my enemy?

199
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,560
Ji Bozai.

200
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,840
Have you destroyed the sword grass?

201
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,800
Where is Ruoshui?

202
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,520
Is she still alive?

203
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,000
Who will be killed by this devil?

204
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,380
We kids end up

205
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,440
turning into monsters.

206
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Ji Bozai!

207
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
Huo Zhao.

208
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,320
Did you

209
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,400
нов that you действ lihgd

210
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,800
too much

211
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,440
that you could pretend that

212
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,440
you present that to your boss?

213
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,920
is indeed the last child

214
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,240
of your Houshi.

215
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,680
Only this sentence

216
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,840
is true, right?

217
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,560
You...

218
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,320
What do you know?

219
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,640
Houshao,

220
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,000
how could you not know?

221
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,360
I took away all your memories.

222
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,760
Of course, it includes this part.

223
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,520
Houshao,

224
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,720
I can fulfill your wish.

225
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,520
But you have to do one thing first.

226
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,720
You need to give me

227
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,600
a healthy bloodline.

228
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,440
But...

229
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,520
But all my children

230
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,600
died of the disease of the Houshi.

231
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,800
I...

232
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,280
Where can I find

233
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,160
a healthy bloodline?

234
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,840
Houshao,

235
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,640
Houshao,

236
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,920
don't you still have a daughter?

237
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,360
If you cry, you will be cured.

238
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,280
You can take the sword leaf grass.

239
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,720
You planted the alchemy of the Houshi.

240
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,280
When it takes the sword leaf grass,

241
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,040
it will lose its mind

242
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,880
and will die.

243
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,320
Give me a healthy body

244
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
to give up the power of your family

245
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,560
so that your family can continue to prosper.

246
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,080
Did you hypnotize yourself?

247
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,280
Did you forget that you just

248
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,360
treated Ruoshui as your sacrifice?

249
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,760
What?

250
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,640
Do you really think you are a good father?

251
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,040
No.

252
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,520
No.

253
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,240
It's not him.

254
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,840
It's not him.

255
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,320
Houshao,

256
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
I want you to see it with your own eyes.

257
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,120
You are the last of the Houshi.

258
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,400
Your reign of Houshi

259
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,240
will be lock up for the time of your convenience.

260
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,760
I'm here and waiting for your arrival.

261
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,880
Are you well?

262
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,160
I'm good.

263
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,240
Just diewards!

264
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,960
You,

265
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
how dare you!

266
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,720
How dare I?

267
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,400
My master Guo Yunlan

268
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,960
how did you kill on him?

269
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
I know you are going up the mountain to protectLi Tianyin,

270
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,440
and help her,

271
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,560
Xiecional dripping with blood.

272
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,920
I trust you.

273
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,080
Thank you.

274
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,720
I won't forget my promise.

275
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,640
Never want to million vise versa.

276
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,760
Miss Leng,

277
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,440
remember this reading̲

278
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,800
Write about...

279
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,680
How Si Hu failed.

280
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,680
They are the real criminals.

281
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,920
I want them to die in sin.

282
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,640
Let's go back. Don't let them find out.

283
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,560
ous fer

284
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:28,180
That should be the

285
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,280
is Bo Yulan's disciple.

286
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,080
Bo Yulan was killed by the second edict.

287
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,760
But it sounds like he's not the only murderer.

288
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,600
If that's the case,

289
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,680
Han Feng Jun is not that simple.

290
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,880
What Count Ji did in the Heart-wrenching Courtyard

291
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,800
was just a cover-up.

292
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,960
His real purpose

293
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,480
was to avenge his master.

294
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,000
You think

295
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,760
if the second edict can make Li Hentian,

296
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,600
the medicine would have been spread all over the world.

297
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,760
Then wouldn't there be

298
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,600
many people guarding Li Hentian in the six realms?

299
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,200
Then would it be possible that

300
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
the person who poisoned me was someone else?

301
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,240
You...

302
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,600
Don't you think he's loyal to you?

303
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,160
You think he's used his own strength

304
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,400
to break the whole circle?

305
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,160
You think he's avenging his master?

306
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,400
You're just making a fuss.

307
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,200
Yes.

308
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,760
Li Hentian may have been spread to more people.

309
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,440
But

310
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,640
according to the situation at that time,

311
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,320
the most suspicious person was still Count Ji.

312
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,560
He took Yu Jing to the right place

313
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,960
and said that he would return to his master

314
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,920
after Ming Xian came back.

315
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,880
And in the second edict,

316
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,080
all he did was justifying his actions.

317
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
I admit that I did make some rumors.

318
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,160
I think he may not have poisoned me.

319
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,400
But you're right.

320
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,320
He's suspicious.

321
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,920
And I need to be in the dream.

322
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,200
Then I'm destined to be his enemy.

323
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,840
His knife

324
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
still has to be aimed at those people.

325
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,800
And I still have to use my value for him.

326
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
But between us,

327
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,680
it depends on who is more cruel.

328
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,280
Who can live to the end?

329
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,280
Wu Xiu.

330
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
The matter of Lu Shui leaving

331
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,440
is settled.

332
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Your Majesty,

333
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
tomorrow afternoon,

334
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,440
I'll escort Fairy Ruo Shui

335
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,520
out of Ji Xing Garden.

336
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,240
I'll come with you then.

337
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,440
This time,

338
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,480
a monster-like entity appeared.

339
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,320
It must be Mu Xibai.

340
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,920
I thought

341
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,520
he was just a master of Ji Xing Garden.

342
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,080
But I didn't expect

343
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,600
that he would be the master of Ji Xing Garden.

344
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,000
But I didn't expect

345
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,040
he would be so sick

346
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,080
and be a monster-like entity.

347
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,600
He's in danger.

348
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,920
If he can't kill Ruo Shui,

349
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,560
there must be other tricks.

350
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,360
We need to take a step forward

351
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,600
to find out the truth.

352
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,000
What else did you find

353
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,040
in the back of the edict?

354
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
In the back of the edict,

355
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
the other person who killed my master...

356
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,760
I'll burn him.

357
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,880
Where are you going to kill him?

358
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,760
Come back.

359
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,720
Sit down.

360
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,480
Sit down?

361
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,240
Well,

362
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,280
I can send the folk doctor away.

363
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,200
She...

364
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,240
She cares about us.

365
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,840
Well,

366
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,560
Fu Xiu,

367
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
I have a friend.

368
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,360
My Lord.

369
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,920
I can't hear you clearly.

370
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,360
Here's the thing.

371
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,920
I have a friend.

372
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,080
To achieve his goal,

373
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,760
he used an immortal

374
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,480
to harm him.

375
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,480
If he wants to make up for it,

376
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,280
he can't do it.

377
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,560
What would you do in that case?

378
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,560
garlic

379
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,000
A friend?

380
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,840
Have所以p a friend?

381
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,760
Who?

382
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,640
Why don't I know?

383
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,640
You're wanting a new boyfriend?

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,040
When can we have a new investigate?

385
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
I must ask you.

386
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,600
I'm back.

387
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,560
Your Majesty is back.

388
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,920
Granny Xun,

389
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,240
His Majesty said he has a friend

390
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,880
who did it for his own benefit.

391
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,440
No.

392
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,760
Your Majesty,

393
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,000
can't we talk about this?

394
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,600
Sure.

395
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,960
His Majesty said he has a friend

396
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
who did it for his own benefit

397
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,920
and hurt an immortal.

398
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,640
He wanted to make up for it, but he couldn't.

399
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,360
Granny, do you know

400
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,320
who his friend is?

401
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,680
When did he make a new friend?

402
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,000
What kind of person

403
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,880
is his friend's immortal friend?

404
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,720
Him?

405
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,960
He...

406
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,840
He is a person

407
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,520
who is usually heartless

408
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,520
and likes to play the little smart.

409
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,520
In fact,

410
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,120
he is a person who knows how to find his way

411
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,440
and is very affectionate.

412
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,960
He is a person

413
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,360
who is strong.

414
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,320
What if this friend

415
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,960
directly apologizes to this immortal friend?

416
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,360
He didn't open his mouth.

417
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,280
It's a waste of time.

418
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,640
It's better to give him more blessings.

419
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,720
Indeed.

420
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,160
I'll tell him to give me this friend.

421
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,920
Your Majesty,

422
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,520
you haven't told me who your new friend is.

423
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,440
Let's go.

424
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,160
When the case of Chenyuan came to light,

425
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,200
it was done by one person.

426
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,000
The person who confessed the crime

427
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,200
was killed by the spirit.

428
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,800
The person who committed the crime

429
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,480
is sentenced to six years in prison.

430
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
What a good story.

431
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,800
The first

432
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,120
was that he used Chenyuan to make medicine

433
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,520
because of his selfish desires.

434
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,240
But because the doctor was missing,

435
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
he only made the poison that had been lost for a hundred years,

436
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,880
Li Hentian,

437
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,160
but didn't make the antidote, Huangliang Meng,

438
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,240
and now he used the medical law to destroy the spirit of the second edict

439
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,400
and destroy all Li Hentian

440
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,920
to clear Chenyuan.

441
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,640
Well said.

442
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,120
Don't talk nonsense.

443
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,360
What a bad thing.

444
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,480
How can he leave such a bad thing?

445
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,520
Yesterday in the hall,

446
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,880
the second edict was supposed to be given to the person behind it.

447
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,520
It was said that he confessed the crime and was sentenced to six years in prison.

448
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,720
It was said that he was the only one who did it.

449
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's so unfair.

450
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,440
But he's dead anyway.

451
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,280
It's better to end it with a dead person.

452
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,240
Lord Ji,

453
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,000
don't you believe this result?

454
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,160
I do.

455
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,600
Lord Han Feng believes it.

456
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,800
I believe it.

457
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,720
I believe it.

458
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,960
The case of Span

459
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
will be fair.

460
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,720
Lord Ji is so interested in the truth

461
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,320
that he can investigate it himself.

462
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,800
I dare not.

463
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,320
I don't know how to investigate.

464
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,000
I can investigate where there are beautiful little fairies.

465
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,040
If it weren't for my family's reputation,

466
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,000
I wouldn't be interested in asking.

467
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,600
The Wu Bu tea and Chenyuan tea

468
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,040
have searched 326 palaces of Li Hentian.

469
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
There are also blood, pearls, flowers and other poisons below.

470
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,400
They have all been destroyed.

471
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,080
How about those innocent people

472
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,160
who were arrested and sentenced to sentence?

473
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,160
Lord Han Feng,

474
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,760
they are all released safely.

475
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,680
Thanks to Lord Ji this time.

476
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,240
It's my fault.

477
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,560
Lord Ji,

478
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,680
why don't you come with me?

479
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,360
My boat is very comfortable.

480
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,240
We can sit and chat.

481
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,640
Really, listen to me.

482
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,680
Lord Ji,

483
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,040
come on my boat.

484
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,400
I'll send you back.

485
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,200
I just wanted to visit the Wu Gui Sea.

486
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,880
Sun Liao,

487
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,560
who doesn't know that you talk about your Lord Ji behind your back every day?

488
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,760
He can sit on your boat.

489
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,520
Lord Ji will definitely sit on my boat.

490
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,800
My sky skill is so good.

491
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,480
The boat I made must be comfortable.

492
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,840
Your sky skill is not as good as mine.

493
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,640
Lord Ji, come with me.

494
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,880
We can talk.

495
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
We can talk about

496
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,560
what happened to you in Chenyuan.

497
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,640
You are so noisy.

498
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,120
Do you want to have a fight with me?

499
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,040
Or do you want to know

500
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
if I have a spiritual vein because of the dream?

501
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,480
Or

502
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,040
you are curious if I have a dream

503
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
because of the dream.

504
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,320
Lord Ji,

505
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,240
if you don't make it clear,

506
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,760
people will always be curious about it.

507
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
The back edict says he didn't have a dream.

508
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,240
Why don't you give it to him?

509
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,320
Then people will not choose the spiritual vein.

510
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,880
Do you have a dream?

511
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Yes.

512
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Yes, we do.

513
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
To be honest,

514
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,000
actually, I have...

515
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,000
Someone sechsed me.

516
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,360
Whose tbsp is it?

517
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,440
Does it belong to such rich family?

518
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,200
Yes.

519
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,160
Do you have a phod from me?

520
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,400
I haven't got it.

521
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,440
Li Zicheng,

522
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,400
stop this!

523
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,360
What happened?

524
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,520
I'm losing my mind.

525
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,600
Put it aside.

526
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Why are you here?

527
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,160
I had a lot of dreamy dreams.

528
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Have a taste and let me know.

529
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,840
This is made with honey.

530
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,440
It smells like a dream.

531
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,920
It's the best way to call it a dream.

532
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,880
So this is the dream you mentioned?

533
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,760
What else?

534
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,280
What do you think it is?

535
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,480
You want to steal the dream from me?

536
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,680
Fairy of the Sun Liao,

537
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,920
you always talk about my master

538
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,760
as a drunkard.

539
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,960
You're the most controversial person.

540
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,760
I didn't expect you to be the most popular person.

541
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Fairy of Tai,

542
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,600
your Heavenly Arts is really good.

543
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,600
It's better to say it in a different way.

544
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,920
Lun...

545
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,600
Lun'an.

546
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,880
Lun'an,

547
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,080
your boat is really good.

548
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,160
But you used to say my master

549
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,200
is not good enough to be a boat.

550
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,280
He's only good for walking.

551
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,120
But he's changed today.

552
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,480
I've said everything.

553
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,160
But he didn't leave.

554
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,880
He's just a shy person.

555
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,680
You...

556
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,200
You...

557
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,040
You're right.

558
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,840
What's wrong?

559
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,760
Come on.

560
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,280
Let's go.

561
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,200
Let's go.

562
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,800
Let's go.

563
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,400
Let's go.

564
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,080
Let's go.

565
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,480
Come on.

566
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,040
What's wrong?

567
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,520
Come on.

568
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Let's go.

569
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,160
Come on.

570
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,800
Let's go.

571
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,480
Let's go.

572
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,240
Let's go.

573
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,960
Let's go.

574
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,720
Come on.

575
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,760
No wonder you asked Fairy Mingyi to stay by your side.

576
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,560
She's quite smart.

577
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,480
She knows how to help you.

578
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Help me?

579
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,800
Is there anyone who wants to make it difficult for me?

580
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,120
You, Brother An.

581
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
What do you think?

582
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,400
Don't pull me.

583
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,600
I want to taste it.

584
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,760
You're so stubborn.

585
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,400
Why are you pulling me?

586
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,800
Hold your dream.

587
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Who is that?

588
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
I can't recognize it.

589
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,520
So,

590
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,040
I can know who it is.

591
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,080
Who is it?

592
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,800
It's...

593
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,600
It's...

594
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
I can know who it is now.

595
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,280
My Lord,

596
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,600
you left last night after I fell asleep?

597
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Will you sleep with me in the future?

598
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,520
Why is this wine called Huangliu Mang?

599
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,720
Are you curious

600
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
if I have that thing?

601
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,480
My Lord, are you stupid?

602
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,920
Who cares about that crap?

603
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,760
I heard them from afar

604
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
bothering you

605
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,000
and trying to flirt with you.

606
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,400
They said you have Huangliu Mang,

607
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,000
so they were licked.

608
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,280
I called this wine Huangliu Mang.

609
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,760
Otherwise, who would want to call it

610
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Huiqi?

611
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,640
What is the name of this wine?

612
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,520
It's called

613
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Junxi of the Moon.

614
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,920
I want to give it to you.

615
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,200
Thank you.

616
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I only drink the wineink I made.

617
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,880
Thank you for your kind offer.

618
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,820
I was first to let her go.

619
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,800
I'll come to with it.

620
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,260
Thank you.

621
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,760
Your Highness,

622
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,640
uh...

623
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,580
Isn't he Flora of A output?

624
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,320
Don't be so sure.

625
00:34:46,920 --> 00:35:04,920
I'll have to

626
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,640
een about that?

627
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,820
Unaut晓

628
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
I'll start it later.

629
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,040
My Lord, is this for me?

630
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
I'm afraid that you won so much

631
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
in the Qingyun and Liangjing meeting.

632
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
That's all.

633
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Don't mind that.

634
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Just take it.

635
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
Why?

636
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
You suffered from the black magic yesterday.

637
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
It's on you.

638
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
It seems that

639
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,040
you still have me in your heart.

640
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
You're really guilty.

641
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
If it weren't for you,

642
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
I would have been in deep trouble.

643
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Who are you?

644
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
What are you afraid of?

645
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Didn't you come to me?

646
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
You're late.

647
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
You don't recognize me?

648
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
That's enough.

649
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Zhao Qun,

650
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
you're not a man.

651
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
You're a man.

652
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
You're a man.

653
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
You're a man.

654
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
You're a man.

655
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I've never seen you like this.

656
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
You should spare his life.

657
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
General Xu Ming.

658
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
You can leave now.

659
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Yes.

660
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
You're still the same.

661
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
I'm not the same as before.

662
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
If it weren't for the emergency,

663
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
I wouldn't have called you back.

664
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Han Feng, you still

665
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
have Ji Bozai as your spy?

666
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
That day,

667
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
I forced Lord Shen to

668
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
take down the case of the back-up.

669
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
I didn't tell him who the person behind it was.

670
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
But I have endless regrets.

671
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
You're worried

672
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
that Lord Shen will suspect

673
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,040
that Chen Yuan's case is related to you?

674
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
The priority now

675
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
is to get rid of Ji Bozai first.

676
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
He must be the one behind it.

677
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
Maybe he's trying to

678
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
avenge Boyu Lan.

679
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Don't forget.

680
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
You're also involved in this.

681
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
Ji Bozai never responded.

682
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
Does he have a dream?

683
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
If he doesn't,

684
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
it means he's sure.

685
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
If Ji Bozai

686
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
was the one behind it,

687
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
he wouldn't have let the back-up

688
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
get rid of us.

689
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
He would have found a way to deal with us.

690
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
You must be careful.

691
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
I'm a member of the Fox Clan.

692
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Who can find my Cloud God

693
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
in the six realms?

694
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
It depends on

695
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
whether he's capable

696
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
or not.

697
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
I'll wait for him

698
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
to kill me.

699
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
You made Ji Bozai drink,

700
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,040
but he didn't drink.

701
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
You helped him steal the painting.

702
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
He healed you.

703
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
He brought you a pancake.

704
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
I thought he was going to fall in love with you.

705
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,040
But he came up with

706
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
a big trick at the election.

707
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Do you think

708
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
it's useful?

709
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
It might be useful to others.

710
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
But to Ji Bozai,

711
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,040
he's too scheming.

712
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
I can't even tell.

713
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
But at least we know

714
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
he went to the Garden of the Moon

715
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
to hide the real purpose of the water.

716
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Then he might have

717
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
pretended to be a romantic man.

718
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
He's trying to

719
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
find the real murderer

720
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
who killed his master Bo Yulan

721
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,040
and avenge him.

722
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Men like him

723
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
need to be smart and considerate

724
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
and be a little bit muddled.

725
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
The most important thing is to understand him.

726
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
I've done all of that.

727
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
If you put it that way,

728
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
isn't Princess Tian Ji

729
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
more suitable for these conditions?

730
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
She's also good at

731
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
the hand-pulling and treason.

732
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Princess, it's not suitable.

733
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
The magic of the magic is complicated.

734
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Who knows how many secrets she's hiding?

735
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
That's right.

736
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
Now we're finally

737
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,040
one step closer to the dream of the Yellow River.

738
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Besides, it's not easy for us

739
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,040
to come all the way here.

740
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Master and Mother are waiting for us to go back.

741
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Especially that snake old man.

742
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,040
He must believe that I can go back.

743
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
We escaped from the Sunshine Mountain

744
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
and fell to the bottom of the valley.

745
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
Do you remember

746
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
when we just arrived in the Heart-pulling Abyss,

747
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
we couldn't even eat a bite.

748
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
We just picked up the wild fruits and fruits on the roadside.

749
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I didn't know that I was hungry.

750
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
After leaving the Water of the Cold Tree,

751
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
we tried our best to get close to the fruit of the Water of the Cold Tree.

752
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
We tried our best to get close to the fruit of the Water of the Cold Tree.

753
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
We found out that it always goes to the Garden.

754
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
So I sold myself to the Garden.

755
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
This way, I can get close to the Water of the Cold Tree

756
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
and help the life of the Water of the Cold Tree.

757
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
and help the life of the Water of the Cold Tree.

758
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
Why don't you tell me first

759
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
that you're going to stop me from doing this?

760
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
Who would have thought that the Master of the Abyss

761
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
is really not a good thing?

762
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
He hit me when I was not dancing well.

763
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
I was once a God of War.

764
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
How could I fall into this?

765
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,040
Okay, I'll tell you. I have something to do.

766
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
Help me investigate Xun Yumin.

767
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
The next person I'm going to deal with is probably him.

768
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
I have to help him.

769
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
I have to help him.

770
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
No, you haven't explained it to me yet.

771
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Are you really going to stop me?

772
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
