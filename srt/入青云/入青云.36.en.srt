I've finally found someone

51
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,010
who is truly willing to sacrifice for the Six Realms.

52
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,410
You are the Spiritual Veins Fairy

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,980
who caused the Netherbeast Calamity a hundred years ago.

54
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,810
Yes.

55
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,340
I used a spell to hide the last trace of my divine consciousness

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,930
inside this Sky-Swallowing Array.

57
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,490
I have long waited for someone from a later time to meet me here.

58
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,730
Fairy Lin,

59
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,610
what exactly happened back then?

60
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,170
The Netherbeast Calamity a century ago

61
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,580
was not my doing.

62
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,580
Let me tell you the truth.

63
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,050
A hundred years ago,

64
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,580
the Emperor of Zhushui bred netherbeasts

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,170
to rule over the Six Realms.

66
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,540
But he knew that refining them

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,140
would damage his primordial spirit.

68
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,250
Hence, he used love as bait

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,460
and tricked me into raising the netherbeasts

70
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,660
at Cangwu Hill.

71
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,140
When I discovered his plot to destroy the world,

72
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,780
I tried to stop him, and failed.

73
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,980
He ended up imprisoning me.

74
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,660
While I was imprisoned, the Emperor of Zhushui

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,020
released the netherbeasts to wreak havoc.

76
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,370
Countless lives across the Six Realms perished

77
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,980
and war spread once again.

78
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,900
To the outside world,

79
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,220
he pretended to have destroyed the netherbeasts

80
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,540
and acted like a savior.

81
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,020
To truly end the disaster,

82
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,290
I had to trick him

83
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,700
into performing the Heartbond Array with me

84
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,220
to subdue the netherbeasts.

85
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,140
But he had planned ahead.

86
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,900
He used me as a tribute

87
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,980
and forged the ancient forbidden spell,

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,220
the Sky-Swallowing Array.

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,610
He set the Sky-Swallowing Array

90
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,020
inside the Zhuojin Tower.

91
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,850
He planned to activate it during the Qingyun Tournament,

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,100
to seize the source of spiritual power from the Nine Heavens,

93
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,140
and consume all the Blessed Rain

94
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,140
so he could control the Six Realms.

95
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,700
The Sky-Swallowing Array must be cultivated for a century.

96
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,490
It required someone from the Bo clan

97
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,780
who possessed the special spiritual veins

98
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,170
born from Heavenly Grief and the Golden Millet Dream

99
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,700
to truly unlock it.

100
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,580
You had already passed away,

101
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,660
but with your spiritual power

102
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,730
you sealed the last of your divine consciousness

103
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,660
inside the Sky-Swallowing Array,

104
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,780
all to stop the Emperor of Zhushui.

105
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,370
Correct.

106
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,370
Only those who are willing to sacrifice themselves

107
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,050
and offer their lives as tribute

108
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,490
can see me.

109
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,050
Only then do we have a chance to save the Six Realms of Hexu.

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,250
Fairy Lin,

111
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,980
did you know the Emperor of Zhushui

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,100
blamed everything on you?

113
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,980
He claimed that you raised netherbeasts and brought chaos.

114
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,250
Every Spiritual Veins Fairy after you

115
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,580
was seen as a bad omen.

116
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,540
I never imagined

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,020
that I would become

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,850
the excuse to condemn the fairies of the future.

119
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,810
How ridiculous.

120
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,540
To seal the Sky-Swallowing Array,

121
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,370
someone at the Transcendent Stage

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,660
must die to destroy it.

123
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,980
You are both at the Transcendent Stage.

124
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,730
Luckily, you entered the array together.

125
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,580
Your divine consciousness is connected,

126
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,490
and, most importantly, your hearts are in sync.

127
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,730
You trust each other.

128
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,410
I have a plan.

129
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,050
With the last of my spiritual power,

130
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,140
I can merge your spiritual veins.

131
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,930
That will grant you the strength of the Perfected Stage.

132
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,810
You may escape safely and destroy

133
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,170
the Sky-Swallowing Array.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,810
You must protect the Six Realms

135
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,540
and change everything.

136
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,170
We will not fail you.

137
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,490
The Six Realms

138
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,540
will finally have the justice they deserve.

139
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,220
The peace of the Six Realms

140
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,530
will be in your hands now, younglings.

141
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,250
Ming Yi, you're alive!

142
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,700
What have you done?

143
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,580
Chao Yuan.

144
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,980
Everything the Zhushui Spiritual State has done

145
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,460
must come to an end today.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,130
Impossible.

147
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,980
None of you will ever defeat me.

148
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,370
No one in this world

149
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,980
will ever surpass me again!

150
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,890
My loyal soul shall live and die with you.

151
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,460
Bear witness! We guard the Primordial Realm.

152
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,460
What is happening?

153
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,580
No idea.

154
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,730
Wake up!

155
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,130
What's going on?

156
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,700
Ming Yi.

157
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,530
I remember now.

158
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,770
My life has never had any real worth.

159
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,770
But back then,

160
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,980
I met you.

161
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,300
Do you think I could ever be like you?

162
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,940
My whole life feels like a joke.

163
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,650
Ming Yi.

164
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,060
Do you still remember our promise?

165
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,890
Immortal Situ.

166
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,180
In the end, I was the one who owed you.

167
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,650
Ming Yi, promise me one thing.

168
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,460
I haven't decided yet.

169
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,130
But whatever it is I ask for,

170
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,370
you'll make it happen for me, won't you?

171
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,580
Right?

172
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,250
I've decided.

173
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,340
In the next life,

174
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,420
let's meet again and start over.

175
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,460
I hope that in your next life, you'll live for yourself.

176
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,100
The Emperor of Zhushui, Chao Heng, and Crown Prince Chao Yuan

177
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,060
attempted to control the Six Realms during the Qingyun Tournament

178
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,700
by manipulating the Sky-Swallowing Array.

179
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,010
Their crimes were unforgivable.

180
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,100
Both have met their end.

181
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,300
This announcement is made to Hexu to set the record straight.

182
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,980
[Chao Heng of Zhushui Spiritual State]

183
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,730
The Sunken Abyss is gone.

184
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,300
We stopped Zhushui Spiritual State's plot.

185
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,340
As for Chao Heng,

186
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,420
he was overthrown by the traitors.

187
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,060
In future Qingyun Tournaments,

188
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,530
the title of the top warrior of the Six Realms

189
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,730
will be decided with only fairness.

190
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,100
From now on, the Six Realms' Blessed Rain will be shared equally

191
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,130
between the Upper and Lower Realms.

192
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,730
Fairy Bo.

193
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,940
The truth is, the debt between us can never really be settled.

194
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,290
But I do know that

195
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,810
when you first came to find me,

196
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,770
you truly wanted to save me.

197
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,380
And I also know

198
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,860
that you taught me with everything you had.

199
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,050
You protected me with your own life,

200
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,420
so I could cure the poison,

201
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,810
and live safely until today,

202
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,730
and see for myself

203
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,380
what this world is really like.

204
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,180
So, you see,

205
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,090
I have no right to hate you.

206
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,050
Whether you did it to atone for your sins,

207
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,660
or out of kindness and loyalty,

208
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,250
either way,

209
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,860
I could never repay you.

210
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,620
From this moment on,

211
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,570
you may rest in peace.

212
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,770
Under the proposal of Empress Tianji of Jixing Abyss,

213
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,810
the rulers of all realms reached a joint decision.

214
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,620
From now on, the Qingyun Tournament

215
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,050
will have only one final round.

216
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,460
The tests of spiritual power will end once a clear result is shown.

217
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,050
No matter the outcome,

218
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,900
all Six Realms will share the Blessed Rain of the Nine Heavens.

219
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,140
- Great! - Wonderful!

220
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,460
That's wonderful.

221
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,660
Come on, tell us about Ming Yi and Ji Bozai.

222
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,250
Is he still a warrior of Jixing Abyss?

223
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,220
The final match was interrupted.

224
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,980
The rematch is next month.

225
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,860
Does that mean Ming Yi

226
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,420
will face Ji Bozai once more?

227
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,530
- Exactly. - That's right.

228
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,490
That Ji Bozai really is something.

229
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,010
He's carefree and reckless, as always.

230
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,700
When the Emperor of Yaoguang asked what his future plans were,

231
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,900
he said he only wanted

232
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,460
to remain a warrior in the warrior ranks.

233
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,620
The Emperor of Yaoguang was furious about it, of course.

234
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,490
But Ji Bozai told him,

235
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,090
"Your Majesty,

236
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,770
you're still in your prime.

237
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,900
You could always raise another crown prince."

238
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,980
That's exactly what Ji Bozai would say.

239
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,180
Only he could come up

240
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,380
with something like that.

241
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,730
You're telling me.

242
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,940
- Exactly. - Totally.

243
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,180
So, he is living on Yaoguang Mountain,

244
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,420
apart from Ming Yi

245
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,770
who is now at Jixing Abyss?

246
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,140
Ji Bozai still has the Spirit Well.

247
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,940
That's right.

248
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,180
He can bend space itself.

249
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,900
So meeting up isn't a problem at all.

250
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,900
Those two really are quite the pair.

251
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,900
They can fall in love one moment,

252
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,660
then fight side by side the next.

253
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,940
They manage to do both without missing a beat.

254
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,380
Exactly.

255
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,860
I really do wonder

256
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,420
which of the two of them

257
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,900
is the strongest in all Six Realms.

258
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,460
We'll find out next month.

259
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,530
I can't wait to see who will actually win.

260
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,770
Speaking of Ming Yi,

261
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,010
her spiritual veins are said to be the purest and strongest of all.

262
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,250
It's simply peerless.

263
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,770
Why did you catch so few fish?

264
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,940
Next time you go fishing, take me along.

265
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,050
By the way,

266
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,290
where did you catch them?

267
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,010
They taste amazing once they're dried.

268
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,770
You never stop eating or talking.

269
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,490
Shut it.

270
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,730
I was trapped inside that bell for so long,

271
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,900
I couldn't even eat a single dried fish.

272
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,530
Now I just want to make it up to myself, what's wrong with that?

273
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,570
I'll catch you a whole bucket tomorrow.

274
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,180
Are you coming with me?

275
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,380
Of course I am.

276
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,530
The dried fish I eat

277
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,810
has to be handpicked by me.

278
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,900
You'll just catch them for me.

279
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,700
So, who do you think will win?

280
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,050
Ji Bozai or Ming Yi?

281
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,940
That's obvious...

282
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,810
Of course it's Ming Yi, right?

283
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,460
I...

284
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,980
I told you so.

285
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,730
Think about it.

286
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,010
Ming Yi has defeated every opponent across the Six Realms.

287
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,570
If it weren't for the Heavenly Grief,

288
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,420
she would have won.

289
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,330
I wouldn't be so sure.

290
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,420
His Lordship's spiritual veins have recovered.

291
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,090
He also has the Spirit Well.

292
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,220
What about the Spirit Well?

293
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,290
Is it really that powerful?

294
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,290
Can it surpass Ming Yi's extraordinary veins?

295
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,730
Besides, she has that unbeatable companion beast, Twenty-Seven.

296
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,730
Then, stop eating your dried fish.

297
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,860
Fine, I won't.

298
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,530
Their strength is evenly matched, though.

299
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,010
Ming Yi will win for sure.

300
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,180
No, His Lordship will.

301
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,660
Ming Yi will win.

302
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,290
His Lordship will win.

303
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:23,900
Ming Yi will win.

304
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,620
His Lordship will win.

305
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,010
Ming Yi will win!

306
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,900
Ladies, if there's any jewelry you like, just tell me.

307
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,140
I'll knock a few spirit stones off the price today.

308
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,050
Come and have a look!

309
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,180
Oh my!

310
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,090
You're having twins!

311
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,570
Can you please be more careful?

312
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,490
It's fine.

313
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,660
You've gone from running a stall to owning a shop.

314
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,140
You're earning even more Blessed Rain now,

315
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,660
but that doesn't mean you should get too excited.

316
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,090
I'm not that fragile.

317
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,620
Empress Tianji has issued a decree.

318
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,940
Even non-warriors can enter the Outer Realm.

319
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,220
Ming Yi, Ji Bozai,

320
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,980
Zheng Tiao, and I,

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,330
can travel freely now.

322
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,770
Of course I'm happy about it.

323
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,940
My love.

324
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,620
I missed you.

325
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,810
I missed you too.

326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,940
I'll get back to work.

327
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,140
Take your time.

328
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,050
Ming Yi told me

329
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,770
to keep tomorrow free.

330
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,810
She probably has something planned.

331
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,980
I heard that

332
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,620
Immortal Ji proposed to Fairy Ming Yi several times,

333
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,460
but she turned him down.

334
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,980
So what?

335
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,660
Ming Yi doesn't have to say yes

336
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,730
just because he proposed.

337
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,700
If you ask me,

338
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,330
I wouldn't want to marry either.

339
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,730
Marriage only ties people down.

340
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,730
It makes them soft.

341
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,250
How can you focus on your career that way?

342
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,900
Your Majesty, don't worry.

343
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,860
I'll do everything I can to assist you.

344
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,220
I'll protect Jixing Abyss

345
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,770
and never let you waver even for a moment.

346
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,940
You're surprisingly understanding.

347
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,570
Well then…

348
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,050
Will you do so even without a name or a title?

349
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,980
I think

350
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,010
that's fine with me.

351
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,980
If that day truly comes,

352
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,730
when you become just one butterfly among millions,

353
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,050
no different from the rest,

354
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,810
I would still recognize you.

355
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,770
This wine of yours is quite good.

356
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,460
Fairy Ming Yi,

357
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,420
I brewed it for you with Blessing Flowers.

358
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,090
Really?

359
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,010
You dare to steal my food?

360
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,140
Why are you fighting with a child?

361
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,330
Why are you fighting your brother?

362
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,980
Don't you have your own?

363
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,220
So unfair.

364
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,050
How is that unfair?

365
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,330
Wine!

366
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,140
The cat can't drink that.

367
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,810
Ming Yi.

368
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,660
Zhang Tai!

369
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,860
No.

370
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,090
Careful, the baby.

371
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,700
I forgot.

372
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,380
It's fine.

373
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,050
Sorry.

374
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,980
Happy birthday.

375
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,460
You didn't have to bring a gift.

376
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,700
Zhang Tai chose it carefully.

377
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,530
Didn't you?

378
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,530
Come out quickly.

379
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,700
Stop troubling your mother.

380
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,490
Come play with your brother.

381
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,460
I see now.

382
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,090
So that's why you asked me to keep today free.

383
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,490
It's your birthday.

384
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,860
Empress.

385
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,730
You only prepared one gift?

386
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,860
I'm not the only one celebrating today.

387
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,010
Try it.

388
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,490
But don't eat too much.

389
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,860
I'll accept it on his behalf.

390
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,660
Other than Master Ming Yi,

391
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,090
who else has a birthday today?

392
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,180
Chen Xi.

393
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,530
You're not as quick-witted as I am now.

394
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,250
Where is he?

395
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,460
Of course he's...

396
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,180
Immortal Ji, happy birthday.

397
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,660
Don't move.

398
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,810
- Immortal Ji, Fairy Ming Yi. - Immortal Ji, Fairy Ming Yi.

399
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,770
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

400
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,900
Happy birthday.

401
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,250
Wishing you good health.

402
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,140
Wait.

403
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,620
What a lively crowd.

404
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,010
You lot of rascals,

405
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,940
you're all behaving outrageously.

406
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,140
How could you drink without inviting me?

407
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,490
Father.

408
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,140
My precious daughter,

409
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,330
happy birthday.

410
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,660
And happy birthday to you too.

411
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,140
Originally,

412
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,700
I had arranged with Emperor Cangwu

413
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,810
to go teach the children to cultivate their spiritual power at his place.

414
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,290
But when I received this invitation

415
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,460
saying it was your birthday banquet,

416
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,490
how could I miss it?

417
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,700
I changed my plans at once

418
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,730
and hurried here.

419
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,490
Next month,

420
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,290
you two will return to

421
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,570
the finals' arena.

422
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,050
You little devil, I'm telling you,

423
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,490
last year my daughter drew Heavenly Grief,

424
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,490
that doesn't count.

425
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,290
This year you must really compete properly.

426
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,220
I'll warn you first,

427
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,140
do not, because of personal feelings,

428
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,490
let him win.

429
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,860
Master She is right.

430
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,420
Don't go easy on me.

431
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,090
Father.

432
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,700
Men won't slow my sword-drawing speed.

433
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,730
That's my precious daughter.

434
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,180
She'll have you picking teeth off the ground.

435
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,090
Someone wants to be my son-in-law?

436
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,220
But it's not that easy.

437
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,940
You must pass my test.

438
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,010
Father,

439
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,620
don't organize it, nobody will drink.

440
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,940
Dare you?

441
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,570
If you dare, come with me.

442
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,250
Come on.

443
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,090
Don't.

444
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,380
This one was brewed by Meng Yangqiu.

445
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,090
Just humor him,

446
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,090
don't show off.

447
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,730
Try it.

448
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,380
It's delicious.

449
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,220
Twenty-Seven.

450
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,980
You've eaten so much and you still eat?

451
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,180
You've taken mine twice.

452
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,290
How did you get this drunk?

453
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,010
With my father's capacity for wine,

454
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,620
no one would've been able to crawl out.

455
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,810
This way.

456
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,530
So then,

457
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,980
he must've gone easy on you.

458
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,140
How much did you drink?

459
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,090
About two jars?

460
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,250
I drank...

461
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,570
How many was that?

462
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,050
Slow down.

463
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,010
No, don't lie here.

464
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,770
Just a few more steps.

465
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,570
Come on.

466
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,770
What do you mean?

467
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,250
A wall.

468
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,140
A whole wall of wine?

469
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,490
A wall of wine, you two…

470
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,570
My father-in-law said he wanted to test my character.

471
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,860
How could I possibly lose?

472
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,900
Of course I had to drink.

473
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,770
You could've shown a bit of weakness, it wouldn't kill you.

474
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,730
What is it?

475
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,940
This is outside, no, that's not good.

476
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,940
Scallion pancake.

477
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,290
This taste…

478
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,660
It was the Empress of Yaoguang who asked me to bring it to you.

479
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,860
She also wanted me to tell you,

480
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,980
happy birthday.

481
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,460
How is she?

482
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,220
She…

483
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,570
His Majesty has already...

484
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,860
already lifted her confinement.

485
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,250
But she still doesn't dare to see you.

486
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,980
In a few days,

487
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,140
I'll go see her.

488
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,490
I've never seen you like this before.

489
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,940
Could you be like this more often?

490
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,980
Like what?

491
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:05,220
Just show me this side of you sometimes.

492
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,490
A little.

493
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,250
That tickles.

494
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,250
Ming Yi.

495
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,700
Actually…

496
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,490
I…

497
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,380
I…

498
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,620
I still owe you an apology.

499
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,730
I said,

500
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,250
I still owe you an apology.

501
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,620
The Sky-Swallowing Array, right?

502
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,660
Indeed, you shouldn't have hidden it from me.

503
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,730
So what do we do?

504
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,700
But I lied to you before as well.

505
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,380
So I owe you an apology too.

506
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,940
That makes us even.

507
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,860
But we must promise never to deceive each other again.

508
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,700
Never to deceive each other.

You little brats, I'll deal with you later.

564
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,860
What exactly must we carve on the Marriage Stone

565
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,820
to make sure we aren't punished by the heavens?

566
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,860
Carve Ming Yi and Ming Xian?

567
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,010
That sounds too strange.

568
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,490
I don't want you changing your name back to Ming Xian.

Then we can't carve Ji Bozai and Ming Yi again, can we?

00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,740
Let me think.

572
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,780
Maybe this time it'll work without any trouble.

573
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,690
After all, the last time we came here,

574
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,210
we both held something back.

575
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,690
