You still haven't explained why you must see Ji Bozai.

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,660
How do I know you will not harm him?

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,020
I know that, because of my current identity,

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,900
it is hard for Your Majesty to trust me.

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,100
But if I wished to harm Ji Bozai,

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,620
I've had hundreds of chances to do it.

29

Your Majesty, please let Fairy Ming Yi in.

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,570
His Lordship's spiritual veins are shattered,

32

right now, I'm the only one who can save your Crown Prince.

You must let me see him.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,170
Ji Bozai promised me

38
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,340
that he had cut ties with his past.

Back then, because of the absence of the Diwu tree's core,

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,770
the Golden Millet Dream that my lord took was incomplete.

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,090
It could only suppress the poison temporarily,

But my lord refused to take it.

53
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,650
He used it as bait

54
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,050
to draw out his enemies.

55
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,090
He's suffering a relapse now

56
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,810

You never told me. I didn't know a thing.

that in this life,

101
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,410

Did you really think

121
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,730
I'd just sit by and watch you make the Golden Millet Dream?

122

125
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,770
You used a winged leech against Ji Bozai

But tell me, Chao Yuan,

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,140
why would someone as cautious as Ji Bozai

130
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,100
let you get close to him so easily?

131
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,900
Father,

132
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,290
everyone has a weakness.

133
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,450
And Ji Bozai's weakness

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,810
is love.

135
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,650

136
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,140
Who could he possibly love?

137

Don't tell me it's Ming Xian.

Ji Bozai's title and power,

142
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,620

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,650

00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,450
In your eyes,

146
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,930
all emotions must seem laughable.

compare to even a fraction of your insight or cultivation.

Now, hand over the Diwu tree at once.

156

Once I make the Golden Millet Dream,

157
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,170
you shall have your share,

158
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,770
and you will finally have what you've always wanted:

159
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,930
spiritual veins of your own.

160
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,810
Since I've accomplished

161
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,450
such a great task for you, Father,

162
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,140
could you reward me with the title of Crown Prince?

163
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,020
Insolent!

164
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,770
So you meant to bargain with me all along?

165
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,690
Hand over the Diwu tree now!

166
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,220
Unfortunately,

167
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,340
I've already planted it in my heart.

168
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,170
If you want it...

169
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,530
Father,

170
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,740
if you had hesitated for even a moment,

171
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,140
just one moment,

172
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,290
I would not have done this to you.

173
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,380
You... you are just like that woman.

174
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,140
You both betrayed me.

175
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,930
The Golden Millet Dream is already within me,

176
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,050
and Chao Yan is dead.

177
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,930
I am the only son you have left.

178
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,650
It is time

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,900
you told me how you really plan to seize control

180
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,340
of the Six Realms.

181
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,810
You wretch.

182
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,650
If you tell me everything, Father,

183
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,530
I will

184
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,170
spare your life.

185
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,290
Fine. I will tell you.

186
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,020
I once foolishly believed

187
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,740
that I could share my ambitions

188
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,980
[A hundred years ago]
with the one I loved,

189
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,530
and that we could rule the Six Realms together.

190
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,220
However...

191
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,100
Your Majesty, you promised me

192
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,860
that you would form the Heartbond Array with me.

193
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,770
What exactly is this Heartbond Array?

194
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,980
It can enhance the power of the netherbeasts, of course.

195
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,740
You know

196
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,170
I would never do anything that could harm you.

197
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,290
She... she lied to me.

198
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,930
The Heartbond Array sealed the netherbeasts.

199
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,340
I truly cared for her,

200
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,380
but she betrayed me

201
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,530
and ruined my grand plan.

202
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,410
You lied to me.

203
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,450
You and I should both go to hell together.

204
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,170
Lin Ziyao,

205
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,860
even without the netherbeast army,

206
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,860
I still have the Sky-Swallowing Array.

207
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,930
You have already reached the Perfected Stage.

208
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,340
By sacrificing you

209
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,930
and combining that with the Heavenly Grief and the Golden Millet Dream,

210
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,020
I will be able to activate the array,

211
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,530
seize all the Blessed Rain of the Six Realms,

212
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,650
and rule them all!

213
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,900
Now you see, Chao Yuan,

214
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,970
how foolish I once was.

215
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,930
To achieve true dominion,

216
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,660
one must cast aside all emotion.

217
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,990
Father, you can rest now.

218
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,920
I will not take your life.

219
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,300
I finally understand

220
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,100
[Divine Crimson Palace]
why you became who you are now.

221
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,070
But I am not like you.

222
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,580
Emotion does not make me weak.

223
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,440
It only makes me stronger.

224
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,640
In celebration of Prince Chao Yuan's appointment as Crown Prince,

225
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,890
Zhushui Spiritual State will exhibit

226
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,000
the long-lost treasure of the Six Realms, the Diwu tree, at the Zhushui Palace.

227
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,890
This announcement is to be shared across Hexu.

228
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,200
Ming Yi!

229
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,680
What are you doing here?

230
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,960
Buxiu and Twenty-Seven sent me a message.

231
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,640
They...

232
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,160
Wait, what's wrong? You look pale.

233
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,920
I'm fine.

234
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,090
I just got word

235
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,800
that the Diwu tree is in Chao Yuan's hands.

236
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,290
I'm going to Zhushui Spiritual State.

237
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,890
You mustn't go!

238
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,520
That boy is setting a trap for you.

239
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,560
That little brat.

240
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,280
Even back when he was Situ Ling,

241
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,280
he had already tricked me into revealing too much.

242
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,080
He knows

243
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,480
the final catalyst herb for the Golden Millet Dream is the Diwu tree.

244
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,720
But I am clearly his target.

245
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,930
Even if it's a trap, even if it's a deadly one,

246
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,850
I have to go.

247
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,480
As expected, it's fake.

248
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,650
Should I call you Situ Ling

249
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,320
or Chao Yuan?

250
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,760
You can call me whatever you like.

251
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,480
I don't think you ever wanted

252
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,760
to return to Zhushui Spiritual State as its prince.

253
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,480
What made you decide to become Chao Yuan again

254
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,890
and abandon your life as Situ Ling?

255
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,320
Ming Yi,

256
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,480
as soon as Ji Bozai's life was in danger,

257
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,720
I spread word across the Six Realms

258
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,130
that the Diwu tree was in my possession.

259
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,520
You're clever.

260
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,720
You must have realized

261
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,410
that his relapse was my doing,

262
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,560
and that the Diwu tree

263
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,690
was the bait I set for you.

264
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,040
You knew there would be a trap,

265
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,320
but you still came.

266
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,320
For him,

267
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,320
you would really risk everything,

268
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,280
even knowing you're walking straight into a trap, wouldn't you?

269
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,890
Chao Yuan,

270
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,130
why don't you just tell me

271
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,930
what I have to do to get the Diwu tree's core?

272
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,170
Don't you already know

273
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,280
what I want from you?

274
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,800
Ming Yi,

275
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,000
this is the wedding gown I prepared for you.

276
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,560
Chao Yuan,

277
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,320
you're a Crown Prince now.

278
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,930
You've captured me,

279
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,930
yet instead of eliminating a powerful rival for your father

280
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,970
before the Qingyun Tournament,

281
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,130
you're holding a ridiculous wedding?
(Watch on www.kisskh.at to support Admin)

282
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,130
Yes.

283
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,720
Compared to eliminating a rival

284
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,520
before the Qingyun Tournament,

285
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,370
I actually want this wedding more.

286
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,560
Even I don't know

287
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,210
how important

288
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,450
you've become to me.

289
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,080
You want the Diwu tree?

290
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,320
I can give it to you.

291
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,210
I can give you anything you want,

292
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,080
as long as you marry me.

293
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,280
Sure.

294
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,610
It's just marriage. Fine by me.

295
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,520
I see that you've formed spiritual veins.

296
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,890
You must have

297
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,280
used the Diwu tree's core to make the Golden Millet Dream.

298
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,410
Since the Diwu tree is no longer useful to you,

299
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,520
give it to me,

300
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,520
and I'll marry you.

301
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,850
I'll marry you once, twice, however many times you want.

302
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,170
How could you say that like it means nothing to you?

303
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,970
You were once the only reason I was alive.

304
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,080
Why do you have to hurt me like this?

305
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,800
Once?

306
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,480
What about now?

307
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,170
Are you living for yourself now?

308
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,760
As long as you're by my side,

309
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,210
nothing else matters.

310
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,080
Is that so?

311
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,610
Then let me be the Crown Prince of Zhushui Spiritual State.

312
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,040
It's true. I'm not the same as before.

313
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,170
But from now on, as long as you're with me,

314
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,610
you won't need

315
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,560
to fight for recognition like in Jixing Abyss,

316
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,520
or fear being abandoned

317
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,080
like in Yaoguang Mountain.

318
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,970
But that's not love.

319
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,210
If you love someone,

320
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,480
you won't dig a pit for her to fall into.

321
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,000
You won't trap her here.

322
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,320
And you won't hurt the people she cares about.

323
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,560
The people she cares about?

324
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,800
Ming Yi,

325
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,130
who do you care about most?

326
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,690
Is it Ji Bozai?

327
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,480
Why do you care about him?

328
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,690
Why can't you love me, even a little?

329
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,800
What does he have that I don't?

330
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,850
Why do you choose him and not me?

331
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:03,890
Ming Yi,

332
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,800
can't you try to love me, even just a little?

333
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,130
Just a little.

334
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,690
The Diwu tree is right here.

335
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,240
Shall we continue?

336
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,800
I don't mind.

337
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,610
Ji Bozai?

338
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,720
You tricked me.

339
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,650
But I am clearly Chao Yuan's target.

340
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,560
Even if it's a trap,

341
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,510
- even if it's a deadly one... - Wait.

342
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,240
I have to go.

343
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,930
Perfect timing.

344
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,970
Talk some sense into her.

345
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,850
You can't go alone.

346
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,930
- Don't try to dissuade me. - I mean,

347
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,080
I know I can't stop you.

348
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,000
I'll go with you.

349
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,610
Chao Yuan wants to lure you into a meeting,

350
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,930
and it's clear

351
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,170
he intends to claim you for himself.

352
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,130
So,

353
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,000
I'll disguise myself as you and meet him.

354
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,210
That way, we can buy some time.

355
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,690
Meanwhile, you and the others

356
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,170
can search Zhushui Palace for the Diwu tree.

357
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,850
A trap for a trap. You're welcome.

358
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,480
Your Heavenly Grief has flared up.

359
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,850
You're already at your limit.

360
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,650
Are you really going to fight me?

361
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,800
Are you all right?

362
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,480
Not dying yet.

363
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,240
Immortal Situ,

364
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,890
this may be the last time I call you that.

365
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,650
Now that I've been cured of the Heavenly Grief,

366
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,890
you're no match for me.

367
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,130
Give up.

368
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,370
I was wondering how

369
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,370
your spiritual veins recovered.

370
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,690
Ji Bozai doesn't have the Golden Millet Dream.

371
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,970
He spread false news

372
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,280
to lure

373
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,480
those who covet it.

374
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,370
He never had the antidote.

375
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,690
You lied to me.

376
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,930
Ji Bozai had the Golden Millet Dream all along.

377
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,970
He gave you the antidote.

378
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,280
How touching.

379
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,890
You're both willing to risk your lives to protect each other.

380
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,210
I suppose

381
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,930
you really are a perfect match.

382
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,240
This...

383
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,890
hurts more than being killed.

384
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,850
You planted the Diwu tree in your own heart?

385
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,450
What are you doing?

386
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,000
You...

387
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,690
You...

388
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,370
Isn't the Diwu tree so precious to you?

389
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,850
Then let me

390
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,890
destroy it

391
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,210
right before your eyes!

392
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,690
Chao Yuan.

393
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,560
Chao Yuan!

394
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,080
Let's go.

395
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,080
You're not going anywhere.

396
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,520
Ji Bozai!

397
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,210
Your Lordship,

398
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,080
we've taken down all the guards outside.

399
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,320
Let's wait for her outside.

400
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,130
Why save me?

401
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,520
Wouldn't it be better

402
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,850
to let me die?

403
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,320
Chao Yuan,

404
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,720
I once told you

405
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,970
that you might develop

406
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,080
spiritual veins of your own one day

407
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,210
or change the rule

408
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,450
that only those with spiritual veins

409
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,320
could become warriors,

410
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,000
and that one day, you'd become truly powerful.

411
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,170
Now, you've done it.

412
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,040
You've become Crown Prince of Zhushui Spiritual State

413
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,410
and developed spiritual veins.

414
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,480
You've achieved it all.

415
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,250
But are you still yourself?

416
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,000
Since you've chosen to be Chao Yuan,

417
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,730
our paths have diverged.

418
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,410
When we meet again, don't hold back.

419
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:31,120
♪Yet still looking back in the next life♪

420
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,280
♪I wish to borrow the moonlight's glow♪

421
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,060
♪To write a dream of fleeting life♪

422
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,890
♪Even if old dreams fade in flames, the wish remains unpaid♪

423
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,240
♪So I scattered the moonlight into dust♪

424
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,120
♪Let the memories gaze afar♪

425
00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:02,170
♪That is how I loved, with all my stubborn pride♪

426
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,160
It's done! I've made the Golden Millet Dream!

427
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,200
Really? Really!

428
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,600
Fairy Ming Yi,

429
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,680
please wait.

430
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,970
Before it's refined,

431
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,730
it can't be taken directly.

432
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,450
It must be planted in the body to take effect.

433
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,410
Let me do it.

434
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,410
Ji Bozai...

435
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,410
Ji Bozai!

436
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,120
Your Lordship.

437
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,120
What's happening?

438
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,680
His spiritual veins have recovered,

439
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,160
and the Heavenly Grief is gone.

440
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,520
Why is this happening?

441
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,770
The Golden Millet Dream can purge the poison,

442
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,810
but it's excruciating to have it planted in the body.

443
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,040
It feels as if one were being flayed alive.

444
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,080
But when he put the Golden Millet Dream into a scallion pancake

445
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,120
and tricked me into eating it,

446
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,730
I didn't...

447
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,810
Because His Lordship

448
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,480
took all the pain for you when refining the Golden Millet Dream.

449
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,080
Now that it has come to this,

450
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,970
there's something I must tell you on his behalf.

451
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,290
The truth is,

452
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,330
he never truly wanted to leave you.

453
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,450
He learned the secret

454
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,680
of the Sky-Swallowing Array.

455
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,930
When he said those things to you,

456
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,890
he was simply using the sharpest blade

457
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,770
to sever his bond with you.

458
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,410
Ming Yi...

459
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,850
Master She.

460
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,770
- Let's go prepare medicine for His Lordship. - All right.

461
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,890
Go ahead.

462
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,970
You know

463
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,890
Buxiu isn't exactly the sharpest.

464
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,370
- And he can never control the heat properly. - Right.

465
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,930
We can't do it without you.

466
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,370
Come on, Master She.

467
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,600
You two

468
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,680
really can't do anything without me, can you?

469
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,680
Yes, you're right.

470
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,330
I told you

471
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,890
to watch and learn

472
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,000
when I refined medicine, didn't I?

473
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,930
Yes, you did.

474
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,890
You should've paid attention.

475
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,850
But did you?

♪I'll still be your light♪

492
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,250
Why didn't you tell me?

493
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,480
Tell you what?

494
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,600
You refined the Golden Millet Dream

495
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,000
in your own way, didn't you?

496
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,970
That's why I didn't feel any pain when I took it.

497
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,250
It was nothing worth mentioning.

498
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,330
Buxiu really can't keep a secret.

499
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,680
Nothing worth mentioning?

500
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,560
Fine. Then here's another question.

501
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,330
Why did you decide on your own

502
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,770
to stop the Sky-Swallowing Array

503
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,850
by sacrificing yourself?

504
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,120
You forced open

505
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,120
your Spirit Well to save me,

506
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,810
and that caused the relapse of the Heavenly Grief.

507
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,930
You couldn't even handle the winged leech

508
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,120
that Situ Ling gave you.

509
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,370
If Buxiu hadn't told me all this,

510
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,560
were you planning to keep it from me

511
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,480
until the day you died?

512
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,330
I made that decision long ago.

513
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,080
There was no need to tell you.

514
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,850
Hold it steady, cat claws.

515
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,890
Don't spill it.

516
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,480
It took a lot of effort to brew.

517
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,410
Yes, Master She.

518
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,890
And mind you, the herbs are very expensive.

519
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,370
What's going on?

520
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,810
Did His Lordship wake up?

521
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,000
He did,

522
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,730
but he might not be coming out anytime soon.

523
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,200
That won't do!

524
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:41,900
Ming Yi!

525
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,770
- Ming Yi! - Master She, calm down.

526
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,640
Master She.

527
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,250
Ming Yi was the one who sealed us out.

528
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,410
Maybe we shouldn't interfere

529
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,640
in whatever they're doing.

530
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,520
We shouldn't interfere?

531
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,850
That's my daughter in there!

532
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,000
She can't be taken advantage of!

533
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,290
- Ming Yi! - Calm down...

534
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,640
Uh, the medicine's gone cold.

535
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,330
We should reheat it.

536
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,040
Just warm it up with your spiritual power.

537
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,970
No, Master She,

538
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,560
it'll mean more if you do it yourself.

539
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,450
You two, let go of me!

540
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,890
You ungrateful brats.

541
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,520
How dare you!

542
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,560
I raised you for nothing!

543
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,250
My Heavenly Grief is gone.

544
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,970
You think you can keep me here?

545
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,410
Do you enjoy clinging to me like this?

546
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:27,680
I do.

547
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,290
There's nothing I enjoy more.

548
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,330
I'm not arguing with you.

549
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,080
Have you ever thought about what my life would be like

550
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,200
if you went off to die alone?
