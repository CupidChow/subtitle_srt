1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm trapped

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's you

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's you

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your love is the color of the sky

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it the heat that will last only in the wind and rain?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You are the warmth engraved in my heart

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Memories have been struggling with you

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The unforgettable ten years of love

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The unbreakable ten thousand love letters

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hugging you, I'm hugging you

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I love you like the clouds in the sky

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why are you sitting here alone?

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I can't go in

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Didn't your parents buy you tickets?

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I came secretly

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My father

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He never took me to the ball

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
why

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Because I'm a loser

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The whole family only has me without a soul

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They all look down on me

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't say you're on the pitch of the ball

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't even deserve to go to the competition

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hey, kid, raise your head

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who said you're a loser?

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Isn't it?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Without a soul

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I will never have any relationship with the love conference

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But I really admire the famous God of War

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I know a lot of things about him

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But I haven't seen him in a game

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He was 13 years old and went to the game

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I haven't lost a game

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm 13 years old today

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I'm a loser

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't be sad

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let me take you in

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So because you don't have a soul

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Your brothers all bully you

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Your father only took them to the love conference

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I won't take you

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What kind of father and brother are these?

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Forget it

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I have a brother

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He's not a good thing

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're so good

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a pity that I don't have a soul

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I won't have a chance to be like you in my life

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Can I borrow this?

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes, you can

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But you have to take good care of it

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
OK

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Today the two-way meeting

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yao Guangshan versus Ji Xingyuan

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Ji Xingyuan

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Please enter the gold tower

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Wait, I will win this game for you

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Mingxia

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Brother is the God of War?

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The weapon can control Mingxia's armor

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Mingxia, don't lose

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Mingxia, my weapon can control your armor

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mingxia

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mingxia

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mingxia

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Mingxia

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mingxia

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sister is looking for me

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Sister

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That Liao Liao

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Of course

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I have been waiting for you

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Situ Xianjun

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I came today just to thank you

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Sister, I recognize you

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you remember this?

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't be nervous

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In this world

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You are the most important person to me

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So I will protect you

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will protect you

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will protect you

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can you lend me this?

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes, but you have to take good care of it

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So I recognized you that day

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Situ Xianjun, you are mistaken

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I am just an ordinary fairy in the garden

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I was afraid of the danger of the water fairy

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I was very confused

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So I don't know how I happened to save her

94
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I still have to thank Situ Xianjun

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
For helping me solve the problem that day

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sister, you don't recognize me?

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You really recognize the wrong person

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I know

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sister, don't worry

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I won't tell anyone

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I will tell anyone

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Sorry to bother you today

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I will leave now

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Luo Qing

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
What's wrong?

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Nothing

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I was about to have 의�ונה

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So I would like to tell you now

109
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,280
If it wasn't for you,

110
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,080
Father...

111
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,360
The back photo...

112
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,360
The back photo of the wedding dress.

113
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm afraid that I've become

114
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,720
a sacrifice.

115
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,760
Thank you, Ji Xianjun.

116
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,800
We're just exchanging interests.

117
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,320
You don't have to be so grateful to me.

118
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,680
You don't have to thank me.

119
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,760
You're always like this.

120
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,520
But I know that

121
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,520
you're a very, very good person.

122
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,920
You're still trying to get me out of here.

123
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,840
Aren't you?

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,320
This is what we agreed on.

125
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,080
We'll get you out of here.

126
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,880
Then our deal will be done.

127
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,080
What are you doing?

128
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,560
I ate the golden leaf grass.

129
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
I'm fine now.

130
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,520
So I want to give this to you

131
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,520
as a gift.

132
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,960
No need.

133
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,440
Your Majesty, this is rude.

134
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
In the Ma fünf Lovers' Palace,

135
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,200
draft is on display at the 50th Earth F doubtful Festival.

136
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,040
I'll write it as slap drawing for you on traditional nur conflicts

137
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,200
in the past 30 years.

138
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,480
What if he really uses me

139
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,240
as his benefactor?

140
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,680
All in all,

141
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,280
I just did it for the sake of his benefit.

142
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,120
Is this also very beneficial?

143
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,440
But Your Majesty,

144
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
Why don't you say that?

145
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,180
You're correct.

146
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
So that's what you called being useful.

147
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm here to visit you in person.

148
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I'm here to welcome you.

149
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,120
You know me?

150
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
Lord Han Feng mentioned that you would visit me.

151
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,480
I have something urgent to deal with.

152
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,840
Something urgent?

153
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,520
Lord Han Feng summoned me

154
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,880
to worry about the monster beast in Shouhua's rebel camp.

155
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
We need to investigate it.

156
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,480
We need to investigate it.

157
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
It takes time to investigate it.

158
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,240
I know that.

159
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,040
But Lord Han Feng's worry is that

160
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
the monster beast has been in the six realms for hundreds of years.

161
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,760
If it really appears again,

162
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
it will cause a lot of trouble

163
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
in the whole six realms.

164
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,800
So Lord Han Feng hopes to speed up the investigation.

165
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
It's best to investigate it one by one

166
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
to see if there is really a monster beast.

167
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,880
Ji Bozan must have the dream of the Yellow-Current.

168
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
Lord Han Feng has been in the dark

169
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,400
to investigate the Wu Gui Sea many times

170
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,440
but he hasn't got anything.

171
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,400
It's better to let the rebel camp

172
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
investigate it in a fair and just way.

173
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,520
This magic weapon

174
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,080
can accurately identify the position of the dream of the Yellow-Current.

175
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,920
Once it's found,

176
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
I'll get it back immediately.

177
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,280
Yes.

178
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,000
Is this a magic weapon?

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,240
Lord Han Feng asked me to make this weapon.

180
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
It can accurately identify the position of the monster beast.

181
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,960
Please use this weapon as soon as possible

182
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,880
to check if there is a sign of a monster beast

183
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,280
so that Lord Han Feng can rest assured.

184
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
I know.

185
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,680
If you cannot avoid it,

186
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:20,720
let me show you some

187
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,440
Just kidding.

188
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,320
It seems that the rumor about the familiar

189
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,160
is true.

190
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,840
For the sake of reputation,

191
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,800
you don't come to me anymore.

192
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,960
You only come once

193
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,160
and you even took me to kill Lezi.

194
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,560
Deity,

195
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,160
the person you just pinched hurts so much.

196
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
How can you treat him like this?

197
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,560
Deity,

198
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,480
what do you want to do?

199
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,360
Tell me.

200
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,960
How can I kill the Suhu Clan?

201
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,840
Deity,

202
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,800
you want me to

203
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,560
betray the secret of the Tong Clan.

204
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,960
You look down on me, don't you?

205
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,640
How can I look down on

206
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,720
the owner of the Flower Moon Leaf?

207
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,760
Now,

208
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,000
do you think I'm sincere?

209
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,600
Betraying the Tong Clan

210
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,280
is killing my conscience

211
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,560
and my character.

212
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,600
Even if you kill me,

213
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,960
I won't agree.

214
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,640
Unless I have to pay

215
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,000
three times the price here.

216
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,640
Deal.

217
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,440
No matter how powerful the Suhu Clan is,

218
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,840
the way to hide the primordial spirit

219
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,440
is simple and simple.

220
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
As long as you find the most real memory

221
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,440
of every fox,

222
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,240
you can find the real body

223
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,400
that it hides in the illusion

224
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,600
and kill it.

225
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,440
No wonder you're not afraid to tell me.

226
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,520
Even if I know how to deal with the Suhu Clan,

227
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,360
I can't deal with you.

228
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,000
That's not necessarily true.

229
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
How do you know

230
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
the most real memory of the Flower Moon Leaf

231
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,840
is not related to you?

232
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm afraid that Fang Zhou

233
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
deliberately revealed the news to me.

234
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
Why would he tell me

235
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,840
the secret of the Suhu Clan so easily?

236
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,960
Let's be honest

237
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,680
between Fu Yue and the late emperor.

238
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,920
The situation has changed.

239
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,080
It's not easy to do business.

240
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,520
There's a news that

241
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,480
the late emperor wants to marry Princess Tian Ji

242
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,880
and inherit the Star Abyss.

243
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
The Star Abyss?

244
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,040
Fu Yue

245
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,320
just wants to

246
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
protect the late emperor.

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,040
Why did the traitor

248
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,320
suddenly come to my Wu Gui Sea?

249
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,280
I made it very clear

250
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,880
that my master is not here.

251
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,240
No outsiders are allowed to enter.

252
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,240
No matter who came today,

253
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
I won't say that.

254
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,040
Then I can only

255
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,560
apologize to my mother-in-law.

256
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,400
Lord Han Feng has ordered

257
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,800
that the monster beast is out.

258
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,320
It's about the safety of the Star Abyss.

259
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,000
So every household has to search

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,400
for traces of the monster beast.

261
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,480
The Star Abyss,

262
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,560
no matter how big or small,

263
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,840
has been searched.

264
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,080
Only Wu Gui Sea is left.

265
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,160
We can't treat it in a special way.

266
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,720
We have to make up for it.

267
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,440
What are you doing?

268
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,320
Stop it.

269
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,200
Don't fight.

270
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,040
Get off.

271
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,440
Are you okay?

272
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,120
You two

273
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,280
are quite protective of my life.

274
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,360
Aunt Xun,

275
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,200
the Si Tu Lord also said

276
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
that the monster beast is out is a big deal.

277
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,040
Moreover, this is the order of Lord Han Feng.

278
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,520
The Star Abyss, I and the household

279
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,320
have to check it.

280
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,120
If we don't allow it,

281
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,720
we will drag the master to retreat.

282
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,840
No, my master is not here.

283
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,200
It should prove that the master is innocent.

284
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,280
The Si Tu Lord?

285
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,800
Si Tu Lord, please.

286
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,440
Si Tu Lord,

287
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,160
this inside's king's blessing is to kill the monster beast.

288
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,400
Who is his master?

289
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
Don't make me a icon.

290
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,320
Where do you live in Wu Gui Sea, Webb?

291
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,240
Yes

292
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,120
Where does Qi μου culpate about her?

293
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,880
Over there

294
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
Where does Miss Ji live?

295
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,440
Don't overthink it

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Where does Miss Ji live?

297
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,520
Why did you come here?

298
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,360
Just for a trap?

299
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,040
Even I thought he didn't match you.

300
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,560
You're right about that.

301
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm saying that I'm not that kind of person.

302
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,920
I mean you're right

303
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,640
when you said that.

304
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,040
Sister,

305
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,480
how have you been going until now?

306
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,960
Ci Pan Palace

307
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,680
baking shop

308
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,280
I'm not asking because of my identity.

309
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,000
There must be a lot of things happening to you

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,160
that you can't tell me.

311
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,600
I just want to know this.

312
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,280
Are you

313
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
doing well?

314
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,360
I'm not.

315
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,600
Han Feng Jun has given orders recently.

316
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,720
I have to come.

317
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Only in this way

318
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,240
can you get rid of the trouble.

319
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,400
What...

320
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,440
What is this?

321
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,800
Han Feng Jun's special weapon.

322
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,320
It's said to be able to accurately

323
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,880
detect the smell of the monster.

324
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,160
Behind that is the direction of Ling Xi Jing.

325
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,400
We can't let them find out.

326
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,480
Isn't that the warehouse of the Immortal Lord?

327
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,160
Over there!

328
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,240
How could there be a monster in the Wu Gui Sea?

329
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,480
Mu Qi Bai wanted to use the

330
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,600
fake to find Huang Liang Meng.

331
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,560
We have to find an excuse to drive them away.

332
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,080
What's in the warehouse

333
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,800
are all the most precious hairpins of the Immortal Lord.

334
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,680
They must be hidden from the fire and light.

335
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,080
If anything bad happens to them,

336
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,400
we'll all be dead.

337
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Immortal Lord Si Tu,

338
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,160
this won't do.

339
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,280
We can't see anything.

340
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,920
No!

341
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,600
I lost.

342
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,760
There can't be fire and light.

343
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,400
Sister,

344
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,320
how are you?

345
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,440
Ming Li, are you okay?

346
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
How are you?

347
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,240
I'm fine.

348
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,800
I'm fine.

349
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,200
But, Immortal Lord,

350
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,160
this won't do.

351
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,400
There's light.

352
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,160
Then we'll have to light it up.

353
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,440
Light it up!

354
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,280
No!

355
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,400
These hairpins are afraid that I can't light it up.

356
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,080
I'm begging you.

357
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,880
I can't let it go.

358
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,760
Immortal Lord Si Tu,

359
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
I'll light it up for you.

360
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Run!

361
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,360
Run!

362
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,120
My precious hairpin!

363
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,000
What do you mean?

364
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,600
I told you that our hairpins are afraid of fire.

365
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,640
But you still want to light it up.

366
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,800
Right?

367
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,960
Did you light it up?

368
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,920
Why are you so stubborn?

369
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,160
Did you do it on purpose?

370
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,560
Calm down.

371
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,080
Calm down.

372
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,880
No, Uncle Xu.

373
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
It's all gone.

374
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,520
What should I do?

375
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,120
How can I communicate with the Immortal Lord?

376
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm begging you!

377
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,480
Don't be mad.

378
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,800
What is this?

379
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,160
This is the only hairpin

380
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,000
that can search for the Beast Master.

381
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,520
It's all gone.

382
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,760
I'm still the only one

383
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,440
who can light the lotus lantern.

384
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,200
I'm the only one

385
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,960
who can light the stone statue of the Seven-Gong.

386
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm the only one

387
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,760
who can return the hairpin.

388
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,400
How can I compensate you?

389
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,920
How can I communicate with the Immortal Lord?

390
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,600
I'm all gone.

391
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,160
Immortal Ming Yu,

392
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,360
you're the only one

393
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,920
who can light the lantern.

394
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm the only one

395
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,080
who can light the lantern.

396
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,160
But you can't leave your wound alone.

397
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,000
How about this?

398
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,520
Let's find a clean place

399
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,040
to heal your wound.

400
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,800
Let me help you.

401
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,080
Let me help you.

402
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,120
This is the bamboo yard of my sister.

403
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,320
What's your plan, Immortal Si Tu?

404
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,400
I'm here today

405
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,200
to see how you're doing.

406
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm afraid that Lord Han Feng

407
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,760
has been using you.

408
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,840
If you really have any purpose,

409
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,480
you'd better let me do it

410
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,800
instead of letting others do it.

411
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,720
What do you mean?

412
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,160
You're right.

413
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,760
I was not made to go the same yore.

414
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,120
Lord,

415
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,080
you're finally back.

416
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,440
How dare they boycott the holy mountain!

417
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,560
I...

418
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,880
I need you to go buy the imperial medicine.

419
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,360
Later, I'll ask all sweethearts to check the place from the particles and weapons famous by this Saint Graph Telegram.

420
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,320
Xiao Wei!

421
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,140
Are you okay?

422
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,380
The Bow C teilweise lost control.

423
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,140
Check around for found anything?

424
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,780
Yes, Your Highness.

425
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,780
Thank you, Youraved Eana.

426
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,160
You sure are a master!

427
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,060
Yes.

428
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,060
A family.

429
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,360
This is the only lotus lamp in the world.

430
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,560
The only one in the world who can match the magic of the Golden Steel Stone.

431
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,560
And the only one in the world who can't match the single-flying watch.

432
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,760
Minister Si Guan.

433
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
How are you going to pay?

434
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Single-flying watch?

435
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,160
Not coming back?

436
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,560
My Lord.

437
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,160
My Lord.

438
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,760
Do you smell that I'm all smelly?

439
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
You're too careless.

440
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
What are you doing to my people?

441
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,160
How can he be your people?

442
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Did you buy him?

443
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,560
Let him go when the flame is ten times stronger.

444
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,160
You're dreaming.

445
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,160
Let go.

446
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,760
Let go.

447
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,960
Three.

448
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,160
Three.

449
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,160
Three.

450
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,160
Three.

451
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,160
Three.

452
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,160
Three.

453
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,160
Three.

454
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,160
Three.

455
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,760
My hand.

456
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,560
It hurts.

457
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,760
Sister.

458
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
Did I hurt you?

459
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,760
It's okay.

460
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Lord Ji, please wait for me.

461
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,360
I'm sorry for burning your house.

462
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,160
I'll compensate for all the losses.

463
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,560
No need.

464
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,960
I'm sorry.

465
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,760
I broke the warehouse.

466
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,560
Lord Ji is unhappy.

467
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,960
He should be angry at me.

468
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
It's okay, sister.

469
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
He looks unhappy.

470
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,760
Is it because I burned his warehouse?

471
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,960
Let's go.

472
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,960
Lord.

473
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,760
The thing is that

474
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,560
Lord Si Tu said that

475
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
the people of the Fumin family were going to search for the traces of the monster.

476
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,360
I think it has nothing to do with that monster.

477
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,360
And if I insist on stopping it,

478
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,960
others will misunderstand.

479
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,960
So I let Lord Si Tu check it.

480
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,360
Who knows that the magic weapon

481
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,960
will have a sense of protection in the warehouse?

482
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,160
I guess

483
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,960
this monster is just a lie.

484
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,360
In fact, this magic weapon is for something else.

485
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,360
Then...

486
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,560
Then I dare not ask Lord directly.

487
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,760
Lord.

488
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,160
We are on the same boat now.

489
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,560
If you are not at home,

490
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,160
I have to guard the turtle sea for you, right?

491
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,360
Why do you have to protect Si Tu Li?

492
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,360
What?

493
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,760
Are you and Si Tu Li very familiar?

494
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
You don't want to be rational, right?

495
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,760
Look at me.

496
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,560
Say something.

497
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,160
He is angry at this.

498
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,960
My relationship with the adults

499
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,560
is not ordinary.

500
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,560
Brother Zhi Yao must have

501
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,160
doubted me before.

502
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,960
Now it sounds like eating...

503
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,560
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,960
I'm sorry.

505
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,960
I'm sorry.

506
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,960
I'm sorry.

507
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,360
Lord, you care so much about other men.

508
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
How about this?

509
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,760
Lord.

510
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,560
If you marry me

511
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,960
and marry my brother,

512
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,960
other men will not come to me.

513
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,160
You are so rude.

514
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,160
Lord.

515
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,160
I'm serious.

516
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,160
I used to think

517
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,160
it would be nice to stay by your side.

518
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,560
I'm getting greedy.

519
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
I want to be your wife.

520
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,760
I want to be a wife

521
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,760
who is kind and loyal.

522
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,960
Is that okay?

523
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,160
It seems that

524
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
there is a chance.

525
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,160
Lord.

526
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,560
Fu Yue.

527
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,760
You have accepted a dancer

528
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
named Ming Yi.

529
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,360
Why didn't you tell me?

530
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,760
Lord asked me to come

531
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,160
just to ask this.

532
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,360
Every day on the night of the flower garden,

533
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,960
new dancers will come.

534
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Is there any special place

535
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,960
for Ming Yi?

536
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,960
He is the one I have been talking about.

537
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,360
I finally found him.

538
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,960
He...

539
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,560
Ming Xian?

540
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,960
How is that possible?

541
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Ming Xian is an immortal?

542
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,560
Lord.

543
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,160
Did you get it wrong?

544
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,960
No.

545
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
It's him.

546
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,760
I thought he was an immortal for many years.

547
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,160
Lord, you look happy.

548
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,360
Yes.

549
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,360
When you have news about him,

550
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,960
you must tell me immediately.

551
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,160
I see.

552
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,960
By the way,

553
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
I heard that

554
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
the Demon-Devouring Pillar

555
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,960
can detect the smell of demon-slaying.

556
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,360
But I think

557
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,560
it's not that simple.

558
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,560
The gourd has been destroyed.

559
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,360
No matter what the purpose of the wooden pavilion is,

560
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,360
it's already soaked in the soup.

561
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,960
It seems that it is very dangerous

562
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
to stay with Ji Bao.

563
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
I thought

564
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
the work of tearing the soup

565
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,760
was too difficult.

566
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,760
I regret to choose to come here.

567
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
I'm sorry.

568
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,360
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,760
I shouldn't have come here.

571
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,360
Now I think about it.

572
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,160
Fortunately, I'm a private judge.

573
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,760
I can help Ming Yi.

574
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Lord, don't you just want to

575
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,560
spend some time in the private judge's hall

576
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,560
and focus on finding Huang Liang Meng?

577
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
Lord.

578
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,760
Ming Yi is a member of Ji Bo.

579
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,160
Mu Qi Bai wants to deal with Ji Bo.

580
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,160
You want to help Ming Yi

581
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,960
by being against Mu Qi Bai.

582
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,760
What's the big deal?

583
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,360
He is the only light

584
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,360
in my whole miserable past.

585
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,160
As long as I can help him,

586
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,360
even if I have to fight against the six realms,

587
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,160
I have nothing to fear.

588
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,560
Lord asked me to come here

589
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,160
just to ask these?

590
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
I'm done.

591
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,760
I'll leave first.

592
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,160
Sucerous Bird

593
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,960
Nether World

594
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,480
The Super Stars

595
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,520
with your skill

596
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,120
The one who has the most experience will be the winner.

597
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,800
He has already taken a step forward and gone to the

598
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,600
Tuteng stage.

599
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,680
As long as you want,

600
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,120
there is nothing that can limit you.

601
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,880
Without the spirit vein,

602
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,280
maybe one day you can create the spirit vein.

603
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,680
Or change the rules that you have to

604
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,440
adopt the spirit vein to participate in the fight.

605
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,840
One day,

606
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,520
you will also become very strong.

607
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,600
Can I?

608
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,720
You were born

609
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
the way I want to be.

610
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,280
I want to find the Yellow-Crocoid Dream

611
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,040
and create the spirit vein.

612
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,480
In order to become as strong as you,

613
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,240
one day,

614
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,520
I can protect you.

615
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,520
You disappeared from Yaoguang Mountain.

616
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,280
I've been looking for you.

617
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,920
Now,

618
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,760
I can't find you.

619
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,960
I've been looking for you.

620
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,440
Now,

621
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,680
I finally found you.

622
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,200
According to the order of General Xun Min,

623
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,960
when we were searching for the turtle sea in Situ Ling,

624
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,880
we arranged for one of us to get into the machine.

625
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,120
We did see the warehouse of the magic weapon,

626
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:41,180
the

627
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,400
magical weapon.

628
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,640
It seems that the people of Count Ji are really cautious.

629
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,640
They actually came up with a plan

630
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,800
to disrupt our plan

631
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,960
and also burn the wheel.

632
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,360
Maybe

633
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,760
they knew each other long ago.

634
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,720
When they first met in the Flower Moon Night,

635
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,720
maybe it was just a play

636
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
that Count Ji played for us.

637
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,600
This woman must know something.

638
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,440
You go to the Flower Moon Night in person

639
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,040
and investigate this woman.

640
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,240
Be careful.

641
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
Is it your first time here?

642
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,760
You look familiar.

643
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,520
You're a new guest.

644
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,360
I'll give you a bottle of wine.

645
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,640
You smell good.

646
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,520
I've heard that you have a family of Sui.

647
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,960
I'm here today

648
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,440
to ask you something.

649
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,080
Immortal, may I ask

650
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
if I know anything about the Flower Moon Night?

651
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,000
I heard that there was a immortal called Ming Yi

652
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
who was later brought back by the Ji Immortal

653
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,840
who was betrayed by Shouhua.

654
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,000
I heard that he was a good teacher.

655
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,000
I heard that he was a good teacher.

656
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,400
So I brought the Ji Immortal who betrayed Shouhua back home.

657
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,480
I want to know

658
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,880
when this immortal Ming Yi

659
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,040
came to the Flower Moon Night.

660
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,760
He...

661
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,080
Ming Yi is...

662
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,360
Good.

663
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,720
Perfect.

664
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,360
That's really good.

665
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,560
Immortality,

666
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:03,740
this 아l remt

667
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,140
She is a precious girl.

668
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,940
She is from the Jingwei Clan.

669
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,940
She is the most beautiful girl in this house.

670
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,140
Playing the music is also a good choice.

671
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,740
Her name is

672
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,140
Zhangtai.

673
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,600
The

674
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,700
Come here.

675
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,660
You mean

676
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,340
you can do all this yourself.

677
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Give it me again.

678
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,100
No, no it's okay.

679
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,540
I don't have anything to eat.

680
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,340
As if I don't eat.

681
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,540
Give me again?

682
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,700
No, forget it.

683
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,780
Thank you, sir.

684
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,740
What's the habit of the wife?

685
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,500
You help her with her work, she'll get you money.

686
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,140
How much does she earn as a fighter?

687
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,860
I don't know.

688
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,820
No matter how much she earns,

689
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,220
what can be certain is

690
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,580
definitely spent on women.

691
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,340
When she pretended to be a woman,

692
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,420
she might have spent money on many women.

693
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,700
But now it's all in your hands.

694
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,580
What's the reason this time?

695
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,460
Thank you for helping her

696
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,420
clear up the trouble of Situ Lin.

697
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,100
This time, I guess it's a toy.

698
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,220
Because I told her

699
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,580
I want to be her wife.

700
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,500
But she can't marry me.

701
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,420
So she used these things to make me angry.

702
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,860
That's good.

703
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,740
At least she won't think

704
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,420
you have other purposes, right?

705
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,380
But we've done this.

706
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,660
She still refused.

707
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,340
What else can we do?

708
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,460
If you don't marry her, you can't go to Lingxi.

709
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,220
If you don't go to Lingxi,

710
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,380
when can you get

711
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,580
the dream to save your life?

712
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,140
If she wants to marry me,

713
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,420
it's useful enough.

714
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,980
We need to finish what's going on.

715
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,060
How's your investigation going?

716
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,140
Nothing useful.

717
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,820
But

718
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,420
I found a big news

719
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,260
that's shocking.

720
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,820
Your good sister, Zhangtai, is getting married.

721
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,940
Why are you laughing?

722
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,220
Erqi, I'm sorry.

723
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,020
I haven't taken good care of you these days.

724
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,940
Look at you.

725
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,220
Your hair is all messed up.

726
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,980
You didn't cut your claws.

727
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,020
You must have cut it yourself.

728
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,820
It's puffy.

729
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,620
Your ears must be all messed up.

730
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,660
Your hearing is damaged.

731
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,300
Let me show you.

732
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,780
Why are you kidding me?

733
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,100
Don't lie to me.

734
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,180
I love cleanliness.

735
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,940
Sometimes I take a shower three times a day.

736
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,660
No, I'm telling the truth.

737
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,380
Zhangtai is getting married.

738
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,700
If you don't believe me, you can ask in the garden.

739
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,740
No way.

740
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,580
Zhangtai is getting married.

741
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,620
How can he not tell me?

742
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,980
I'm his best...

743
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,820
Really?

744
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,980
Sir, I want to go out.

745
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,860
You're in such a hurry.

746
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,700
Where are you going?

747
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,860
I want to go back.

748
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,460
My good sister,

749
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,340
the one you met, Zhangtai,

750
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,540
suddenly wants to get married.

751
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,900
She didn't tell me.

752
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,780
I have to ask her clearly.

753
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,980
Who is she going to marry?

754
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,620
I heard that she's just like the owner of the mansion.

755
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,700
She's a bit vulgar.

756
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,780
I'll go with you.

757
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:39,820
Okay.

758
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,380
By the way,

759
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,460
since we're sisters,

760
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,500
do you have any gift?

761
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,540
Of course.

762
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,860
The jewelry that you gave me,

763
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,180
I'm going to give it to Zhangtai.

764
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,620
It seems to be a real friend.

765
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,220
Why does His Majesty go to the full moon night with Mingyi?

766
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,620
Zhangtai is going to marry a vulgar fox.

767
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,140
How many vulgar foxes can there be

768
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,540
in the whole Ji Xingxuan's capital?

769
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,500
Over a month ago that

770
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
her sister Muxibai

771
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,620
and Mingyi's father are from college,

772
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,620
Muxibai provided a tiny place to the tab.

773
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,980
I don't think that lies.

774
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,460
Xun Ming?

775
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,820
As for Muxibai and the others,

776
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:27,380
they fears that they will be exposed to the Chenyuan cases.

777
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,420
Mingyi's parents

778
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,980
died of theobra virus.

779
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,700
She also denied the injustice such a thing.

780
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,540
to find her.

781
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,540
It seems that I'm not smart enough.

782
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,540
These days,

783
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,540
His Majesty almost gave all the land of the Wu Gui Sea

784
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,540
to Ming Yi

785
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,540
to buy her.

786
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,540
His Majesty is so wise.

787
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,540
I'm sorry.

788
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,540
