00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,630
Sachets, pendants...

6
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,509
I'm gonna soak my feet.

7
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,110
Those architects

8
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,390
went to the house last night and took no action at all.

9
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,910
Could there be something wrong?

10
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,030
Very probably!

11
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,830
If there's really something wrong,

12
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,950
what are you gonna do?

13
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,230
I can only

14
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,790
demolish the house

15
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,390
and sell it as a piece of land.

16
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,630
Our inn-business isn't really working,

17
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,460
now you're even to sell that house at a low price?

18
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,070
Do you want me to live a hard life with you?

19
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,630
So what?

20
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,270
You can't stand it?

21
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,350
Of course!

22
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,670
You should have provided me with a good life.

23
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,230
All right, all right.

24
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,510
Ever since the incident of this house,

25
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,070
have I had any peaceful day?

26
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,710
Speaking of it,

27
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,950
it's all because of that bitch.

28
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,590
She wouldn't spare me even if she has died.

29
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,110
Oh, you don't say.

30
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,750
It was she herself that couldn't keep a man.

31
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:36,990
I think that

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,630
maybe I was blind,

33
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,390
or why would I marry such a jinx?

34
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,500
She gave birth to three babies but all of them died early.

35
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,750
Then she even blamed me for treating her badly.

36
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,020
It just serves her right!

37
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,470
Be careful!

38
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,550
Has Qinghe got up to cook?

39
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,310
I just knocked on her door.

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,550
I don't think she's awake yet.

41
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,390
This little girl has been a bit weird recently.

42
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,910
Do you think she knows something?

43
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,510
Impossible.

44
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,430
I've wiped it clean.

45
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,550
Even those officials have been deceived,

46
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,950
let alone her.

47
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,190
No, no, no.

48
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,830
Think about it.

49
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,670
Since Qinghe came here,

50
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,310
things of this house have begun to go not well, right?

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,270
Yeah, that's right.

52
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,630
At this time in usual,

53
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,630
she would have waken up to cook.

54
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,950
But today, she still hasn't got up yet.

55
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,660
Could it be...

56
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,510
Qinghe.

57
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,270
Qinghe. Open the door.

58
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,550
Qinghe.

59
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,670
It's really her.

60
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,390
Brother-in-law.

61
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,270
How is it?

62
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,270
I followed her to the inn,

63
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,550
watched her go in,

64
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,670
and made sure Innkeeper Liao didn't realize her before I left.

65
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,830
I found nothing unusual during this period.

66
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,550
I thought my Lady asked you to escort her back home.

67
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,750
Your lady meant to let me tail after her.

68
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,830
My Lady.

69
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,150
what is that for?

70
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,190
Now we only listen to

71
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,150
what Qinghe said.

72
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,630
But we can't believe it all.

73
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,550
That's true.

74
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,470
It's not that I don't want to believe Qinghe.

75
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,430
It's just that we now need to be more cautious.

76
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,230
What should we do next?

77
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,110
It's time to think about it.

78
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,550
The government has been tricked by Innkeeper Liao.

79
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,270
Then what should we do

80
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,310
to let Innkeeper Liao show his true colors?

81
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,070
To do the opposite.

82
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,350
Let them confess without being pressed.

83
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,590
Now Meng Yuanxu and Boss Luo

84
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,470
have gone to prepare for it.

85
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,310
Tonight,

86
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,340
let's wait to see it.

87
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,350
Innkeeper Liao,

88
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,590
are you there?

89
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,590
Innkeeper Liao,

90
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,270
Innkeeper Liao, are you there?

91
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,910
Put it down.

92
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,300
This belongs to women.

93
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,790
Innkeeper Liao.

94
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,710
Coming. Coming.

95
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,790
Innkeeper Liao.

96
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,390
Coming. Coming. Coming.

97
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,750
Next time, get your things situated!

98
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,190
Boss Luo!

99
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,070
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

100
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,909
I'm worried about you.

101
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,070
How was it last night?

102
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,980
Come on.

103
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,390
Come. Let's sit.

104
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,310
To be honest,

105
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,630
I almost lost my life.

106
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,750
So...

107
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,110
that ghost was wearing white clothes with her hair down.

108
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,750
She had no shadow under the moonlight,

109
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,190
and killed people invisibly in the wind.

110
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,590
So aggressive she was!

111
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,870
I'm afraid she had a huge grudge

112
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,390
and turned into a lonely ghost to kill those

113
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,470
who are brutal, cold-blooded

114
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,830
and go against conscience.

115
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,190
Is she really going to kill you?

116
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,510
Nonsense!

117
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,909
Hongdou and I...

118
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,430
We loved and respected each other for half of our lives.

119
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,750
How could she want to kill me?

120
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,110
Speaking of this,

121
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,150
I really miss Hongdou so much.

122
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,710
Unfortunately,

123
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:55,950
she scared herself to death.

124
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,270
It's so pathetic.

125
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,470
Boss Luo,

126
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,830
since things have come this far,

127
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,630
I just hope your team of craftsmen

128
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,310
to keep your promise.

129
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,070
After all, we had a deal before.

130
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,430
The happening of such a strange thing

131
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,430
has nothing to do with me.

132
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,950
You still have to finish the work.

133
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,750
Innkeeper Liao, I can take it as my being hapless.

134
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,030
But after finishing the task,

135
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,790
we have to stay in a temple

136
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,190
for a year or so

137
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,790
to get rid of the evilness.

138
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,350
Well... Boss Luo,

139
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,710
to be honest...

140
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,190
Please have some tea first.

141
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,590
Please.

142
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,700
Actually, I also hope

143
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,110
there can be no death in the house anymore.

144
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,510
Otherwise, even if the renovation is done,

145
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,070
I'm afraid no one will buy it.

146
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,230
I think at this point,

147
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,630
we are of the same mind.

148
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,630
Of course.

149
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,990
Innkeeper Liao,

150
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,430
I also want my workers to be safe.

151
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,670
Then

152
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,190
I actually have another idea.

153
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,950
I think you can stop your work.

154
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,230
Because I can demolish the house

155
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,630
and sell it as a piece of land.

156
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,110
Innkeeper Liao,

157
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,510
then it will make you a great loss.

158
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,830
But I have to do so.

159
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,350
Boss Luo, if you shall stop this work

160
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,310
for the safety of the workers,

161
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,630
then I'm afraid you need

162
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,660
to double my money back.

163
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,270
Then your workers won't have to risk their lives,

164
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,549
and I can be relieved by losing money.

165
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,549
It's perfect for both sides.

166
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,830
What do you think, Boss Luo?

167
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,510
-You... -Wait, it's not gonna work.

168
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,860
Innkeeper Liao.

169
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,910
The Wood Feather House

170
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,910
has always regarded employers

171
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,550
as intimate friends.

172
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,070
To make you lose money for it?

173
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,350
I can't let that happen.

174
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,350
If you don't agree,

175
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,350
how are you gonna handle the endless strange things?

176
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,870
Aren't you afraid that more people will die?

177
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,710
Of course I'm afraid.

178
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,220
But compared with this,

179
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,430
I care more about the money in Innkeeper Liao's pocket.

180
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,710
Bro,

181
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,350
does that mean you've had an idea?

182
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,220
Innkeeper Liao is truly a smart man.

183
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,150
Come on.

184
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,230
I'll introduce a master to you.

185
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,990
Master.

186
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,870
Look.

187
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,670
Master, please.

188
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,670
Master Deshan!

189
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,310
Please. Please.

190
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,630
You just came from the Tianshan Mountain in the Western Region

191
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,350
to Lin'an?

192
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,190
Everyone,

193
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,790
this is Master Deshan.

194
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,910
Master. Nice to meet you.

195
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,870
Why are you yelling?

196
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,150
You...

197
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,460
How can you talk to Master like that, Boss Luo?

198
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,270
That's right. Not polite at all.

199
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,870
Please forgive him, Master.

200
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,150
Innkeeper Liao.

201
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,190
You once asked me who my master was.

202
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,110
Here he is! I made great efforts to let him be my master.

203
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,190
I tried my best to invite him here

204
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,860
from the Western Region.

205
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,670
He can subdue ghosts tonight and return peace to you.

206
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,150
Boss Luo.

207
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,110
I didn't expect that so young a man like you

208
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,110
could have so great a master.

209
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,150
I admire you.

210
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,110
Tonight,

211
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,270
please be sure to observe on the scene.

212
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:22,990
Sure.

213
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,670
Innkeeper Liao, you should absolutely be there too.

214
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,470
Yeah, of course.

215
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,270
You should also go with me.

216
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,910
I won't go.

217
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,270
Go yourself.

218
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,030
Why do you take me with you?

219
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,510
What if

220
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,390
the ghost isn't subdued

221
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,270
but kills me instead?

222
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,790
I won't go.

223
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,590
Nonsense!

224
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,230
It's disrespectful to Master.

225
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,230
Besides,

226
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,150
will it be safe for you

227
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,390
to stay here alone?

228
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,350
I...

229
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,230
It doesn't matter.

230
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,270
If Mrs. Liao don't want to go,

231
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,390
I'll find someone to accompany her tonight

232
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,990
and protect her well.

233
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,230
What do you think?

234
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,150
No. Well...

235
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,910
Master,

236
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,110
Is this a proper arrangement?

237
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:13,910
I'm here.

238
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,700
What are you doing?

239
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,780
Wait a minute.

240
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,430
Here you go.

241
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,960
♫The wind stopped in the story of flowers♫

242
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,110
What are you doing?

243
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,110
To lace it up like this

244
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,150
so that it won't loosen easily.

245
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,500
♫Waiting for people to listen♫

246
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,710

♫The moon hidden in the boundless night sky♫

248
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,030
The way that you used to lace it up can get loosened easily

249
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,510
just as it did last night when I pulled it .

250

♫Looking for its dreamboat to find♫

251

Except you,

253
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,470
who would pull my belt?

♫I'm trapped in an endless universe♫

♫Like we have been in chemistry since we were born♫

263

264

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,390
But it can also show that

268
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,180
♫Write the most romantic poem of my life♫

269

Will it work?

284
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,110
I hope Innkeeper Liao will confess.

285
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,630
Here he is.

286
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,390
Boss Luo is not here?

287
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,110
Master asked him to take a look around.

288
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,310
And he will be back soon.

289
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,070
Master, is everything going well?

290
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,950
Just check whether it goes well or not.

291
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,990
I will return peace to your house.

292
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,750
That's great.

293
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,590
I'm really grateful.

294
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,790
Please.

295
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,780
Please step back.

296
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,670
This is the first time I've seen Master performing magic.

297
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,630
Me too.

298
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,470
I wonder whether Miss Han

299
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,350
has got ready for it.

300
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,870
Little babies are eating well.

301
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,190
That's great.

302
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,630
The more they eat, the louder they can cry.

303
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,350
Where did you get the master?

304
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,910
With gray hair,

305
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,070
he's really like a fairy.

306
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,030
Is he really Master Deshan?

307
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,670
Of course he's not.

308
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,710
That's my father.

309
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,750
Your father?

310
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,590
Why does he stop?

311
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:29,990
What happened?

312
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,190
Has your father forgot the movements and the spell?

313
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,310
No way.

314
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,340
I see.

315
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,070
He is testing my sincerity.

316
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,030
Master, thank you.

317
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,460
See? I'm experienced.

318
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,340
Try this.

319
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,990
This is sweet.

320
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,590
This smells so good.

321
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,940
Aren't you here to accompany me?

322
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,310
We asked you to taste it but you refused.

323
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,910
Then I’d better eat some.

324
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,430
Why is this neither fragrant nor sweet?

325
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,950
Ms. Jiang,

326
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,950
your heart isn't in it at all,

327
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,230
and thus everything tastes insipid.

328
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,110
It's all the damn ghost's fault.

329
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,310
Which one do you refer to?

330
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,710
Innkeeper Liao?

331
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,030
Or Miao Hongdu?

332
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,110
Don't say that.

333
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,470
When you mention her,

334
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,670
I feel like she can hear it.

335
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,190
By the way,

336
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,030
Where is Qinghe?

337
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,910
Qinghe said she wanted to see her sister for the last time,

338
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,230
so she followed Innkeeper Liao to the house.

339
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,670
Then I have no one to serve me a cup of hot tea now.

340
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,590
We need liquid courage now.

341
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,990
I also want to drink some.

342
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,390
Wait here. I shall go to get some liquor.

343
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,300
Where are you going?

344
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,869
Of course the Manxiang Restaurant next door.

345
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,270
The liquor in your inn may be good to outsiders,

346
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,190
but I'm not used to it.

347
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,869
No, you can't leave.

348
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,829
Luo, go buy it.

349
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,390
Me?

350
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,109
Luo is a girl.

351
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,990
It’s dangerous to let her go out.

352
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,349
You can't leave.

353
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,950
You're the only man here.

354
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,829
If you leave, there will be no Yang energy here.

355
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,310
No. You have to stay here.

356
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,990
You know a lot.

357
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,590
Ms. Jiang is right.

358
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,070
Mr. Meng, you can stay here with Ms. Jiang.

359
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,070
I'll go get some liquor.

360
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,390
Fine.

361
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,630
You must be careful.

362
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,670
I’d better sit next to you.

363
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,550
It's just the wind.

364
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,070
It must be the wind.

365
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,470
Show your power!

366
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,030
Heaven and earth.

367
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,790
Gods from all directions please show up.

368
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,590
Heaven and earth.

369
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,390
Show your power.

370
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,420
Oh my god!

371
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,150
This is your end, you damn ghost!

372
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,710
Mr. Li, this...

373
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,950
Can Master manage it?

374
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,710
Don't worry.

375
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,950
Don’t worry. Wang Sheng is here.

376
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,430
Hang in there., just for a while.

377
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,350
Let's go.

378
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,550
Don't come over!

379
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,790
Don't come over!

380
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,190
Don't come over, Hongdou!

381
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,780
Don't kill me!

382
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,110
It was you who killed me, and I'll make you pay with your life.

383
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,150
I didn't kill you on purpose.

384
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,060
That day, I...

385
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,950
It was by accident.

386
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,590
You're lying.

387
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,190
For the sake of

388
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,190
our once being as a couple,

389
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,350
please spare my life.

390
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:57,950
Or I can...

391
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,590
I can go to your grave every month,

392
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,790
and kowtow to you!

393
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,390
Okay?

394
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,390
I just want your life.

395
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,540
Don't come over!

396
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,070
You're not...

397
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,190
Qinghe?

398
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,590
I've eaten all of them.

399
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,390
No wonder I'm so full.

400
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,910
Why hasn’t Luo come back?

401
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,590
I shall go find her.

402
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,470
You can't leave.

403
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,950
If she won't come,

404
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,190
then it doesn't matter whether I leave or not.

405
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,190
If she comes,

406
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,470
even if I stay here,

407
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,950
I can do nothing but to die together with you.

408
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,550
What are you afraid of?

409
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,790
Besides, I get a feeling that

410
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,710
it should be peaceful now in the house.

411
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,830
Really?

412
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,270
You should never underestimate Master’s ability.

413
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,710
Really?

414
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,060
Don't worry.

415
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,910
I shall just check by the door. Don’t be afraid.

416
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,030
Come back soon.

417
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,630
Official?

418
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,790
Are you outside?

419
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,830
Official Meng?

420
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,710
Can you hear me?

421
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,590
Ghost!

422
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,950
Don't come over.

423
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,670
Don't come over.

424
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,350
What did you eat? So sweet.

425
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,350
I'll hit you! I'll hit you!

426
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,430
I'll hit you!

427
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,070
I'll hit you!

428
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,910
-Give me back my life. -It's none of my business.

429
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,430
-Give me back my life. -It's none of my business.

430
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,070
It's you.

431
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,260
-It's you. -Not me!

432
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,670
It wasn't me.

433
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,950
Liao Shisan killed you.

434
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,190
You should go for him.

435
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,910
Don't come to me. Don't come to me.

436
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,030
Okay. You said it.

437
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,470
The murderer is Liao Shisan, right?

438
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,270
You...

439
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,950
When did I mention it?

440
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,780
Do you know what crime it is to cover up a murderer?

441
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,470
How dare you deny it

442
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,150
after you've just let it slip?

443
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,310
The truth that Liao Shisan killed Miao Hongdou

444
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,710
has already been revealed.

445
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,950
Now it is the time to convict him.

446
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,190
If you confess now,

447
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,870
you still have a chance to make it easier on yourself.

448
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,470
Otherwise,

449
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,860
you can only wait to be exiled.

450
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,390
Wipe it. Wipe it.

451
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,190
What's going on?

452
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,950
We suspect Innkeeper Liao

453
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,420
is the murderer who killed Hongdou.

454
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,150
So we planned to expose him.

455
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,550
But unexpectedly,

456
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,430
he chose desperate fighting in the end,

457
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,870
killing Qinghe.

458
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,710
What? He ran away?

459
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,150
Damn Liao Shisan!

460
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,430
How could he leave me alone and ran away himself!

461
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,750
Since Wang Sheng is not here,

462
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,990
we couldn't manage him.

463
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,990
How can you let a murderer escape?

464
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,390
I shall take people to chase them now.

465
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,790
I'm afraid it's too late.

466
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,150
What should we do?

467
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,990
It seems that

468
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,470
we can only take Ms. Jiang

469
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,590
to the government office.

470
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,990
I didn't kill anyone.

471
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,350
But you are the wife of Innkeeper Liao.

472
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,270
You didn't report what you know.

473
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,710
If the situation is serious, you'll be sentenced to the same crime.

474
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,310
I'm not married.

475
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,990
I'm not his wife either.

476
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,990
I didn't hide anything.

477
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,870
Liao Shisan forced me.

478
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,230
I want to report him!

479
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,670
Luo.

480
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,030
Official Meng.

481
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,470
You have to testify for me.

482
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,750
I made it very clear that

483
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,630
Liao Shisan killed Miao Hongdou.

484
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,390
You must testify for me.

485
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,270
All right, don't worry.

486
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,030
Then about what you said in the inn,

487
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,990
please say it again.

488
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,750
We will help you.

489
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,950
to make it easier on you.

490
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,820
He killed Qinghe, and we saw it personally.

491
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,830
Then if he killed Miao Hongdou,

492
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,660
did you see it personally?

493
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,030
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

494
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,300
I was there.

495
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,750
I saw with my own eyes that

496
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,550
Liao Shisan strangled Miao Hongdou to death.

497
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,470
Later, Liao Shisan made it appear to be that

498
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,790
Miao Hongdou got overshocked and strangled herself to death.

499
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,630
He did all this.

500
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,310
It has nothing to do with me.

501
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,790
I can testify.

502
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,590
Good. Very good.

503
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,150
In this case,

504
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,350
what you two said can match.

505
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,270
You...

506
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,590
You...

507
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,900
You bitch!

508
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,390
-I'm going to kill you. I... -Don't move.

509
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,950
Liao Shisan, how can you be so cruel?

510
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,060
I didn't expect it.

511
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,030
I've been smart all my life,

512
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,510
but got destroyed by two bitches in the end.

513
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,030
It was you that destroyed yourself.

514
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,230
Qinghe, your sister's death has been avenged,

515
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,150
and the truth has been found.

516
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,270
Just leave the rest to the government office.

517
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,870
Let's go.

518
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,870
Miss, take care.

519
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,070
You did a good job today.

520
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,070
I really fell down.

521
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,590
Hey.

522
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,630
What's the relationship between you and Miss Han?

523
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,750
Why are you staring at me?

524
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,900
Don't forget that I'm your father.

525
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,790
Once you kick your ass,

526
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,830
I know what you're gonna do.

527
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,430
Don't talk nonsense. You...

528
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:47,710
Father.

529
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,070
Has he pleaded guilty?

530
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,950
There are so many witnesses. How dare he deny it?

531
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,710
How about the penalty?

532
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,510
Liao Shisan killed his wife, which is unforgivable.

533
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,310
He'll be beheaded in 15 days.

534
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,630
Jiang covered up the crime and deceived the government,

535
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,990
so she will be imprisoned for five years.

536
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,710
That's a wise decision, father.

537
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,910
What about the house and the inn?

538
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,110
Of course they will be given to Miao Qinghe.

539
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,380
Great. Then I can be relieved.

540
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,830
Father, so amazing you are.

541
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,590
Stop flattering me.

542
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,100
Let me ask you.

543
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,630
Are you really

544
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,630
working with a team of craftsmen now?

545
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,990
Yes, it's true.

546
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,140
Why?

547
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,070
At first, it might be out of curiosity and impulsion.

548
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,070
But till now,

549
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,510
after finishing three projects,

550
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,830
I find that

551
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,390
it really feels good

552
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,030
to help others.

553
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,150
Father,

554
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,630
I've grown up.

555
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,590
You brat.

556
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,270
You've really grown up.

557
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,790
You didn't do this for pursuing girls, did you?

558
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,150
What are you talking about?

559
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,580
Pursuing what girls?

560
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,390
Come on, don't pretend!

561
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,710
Don't think that I don't know.

562
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,590
A few days ago,

563
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,030
you took one girl

564
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,790
back to our mansion,

565
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,710
and made a great mess, didn't you?

566
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,630
How inappropriate!

567
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,190
Is that girl also from the team of craftsmen?

568
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,470
Father, it's a long story.

569
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,470
Take your time.

570
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,790
I’m free today.

571
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,150
Father, this story is very long.

572
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,630
I'll talk to you in detail later.

573
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,430
You're free today but I'm not.

574
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,150
I shall leave now.

575
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,630
See you!

576
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,990
You brat!

577
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,710
You can't escape it anyway!

578
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:41,660
Qingfeng!

579
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,310
Lord Meng has interrogated Liao Shisan.

580
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,670
Official Meng stayed there,

581
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,670
so I came back.

582
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,270
The evil has finally got punished.

583
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,780
It's really a pleasant thing.

584
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,150
You're repairing your wooden kite?

585
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,950
Yes.

586
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,270
Then do make good use of your limited time

587
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,430
studying it!

588
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,910
What do you mean?

589
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,550
After I came out from the government office today,

590
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,590
I heard lots of talking all the way

591
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,860
about Liao's Mansion.

592
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,470
Even the Wood Feather House has been mentioned repeatedly.

593
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,550
Then I dropped by

594
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,710
the recruitment market on the West Street.

595
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,910
But it surprised me that

596
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,350
I got surrounded by a crowd asking various questions.

597
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,940
And many bosses came to make friends with me.

598
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,350
The Wood Feather House

599
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,430
is now gaining prestige again.

600
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,630
I think in the future,

601
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,150
we will have lots of projects to do.

602
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,830
Good news.

603
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,910
After Qinghe's case is over,

604
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:34,910
we should make this project

605
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,710
be well completed.

606
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,630
Of course.

607
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,230
In the future, this house

608
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,990
should be named after its original master.

609
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,470
By the way,

610
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,990
have you checked Wang Sheng’s case?

611
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,310
Come, let me tell you.

612
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,990
I asked my friend to check it.

613
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,870
He used to be an Imperial Guard.

614
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,990
Imperial Guard?

615
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,430
We can only find out that he was fired.

616
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,750
But the specific reason is unknown.

617
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,350
Imperial Guard...

618
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,230
Then why does he come here to be a chief executive?

619
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,190
You mean

620
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,030
Langyue?

621
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,910
I also checked her identity.

622
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,310
The address she gave us is fake.

623
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,030
She probably doesn't want us to know

624
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,270
her real identity.

625
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,150
Think about it. Even an Imperial Guard

626
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,950
is obedient to her.

627
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,870
Then Wang Sheng was an Imperial Guard,

628
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,430
and he followed her here.

629
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,150
Didn't I tell you not to investigate her?

630
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,350
Aren't you curious

631
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,510
about her secret identity?

632
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,070
Everyone has secrets.

633
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,790
But since she came here,

634
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,670
she has never done any harm to us.

635
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,590
I can also see her devote all herself

636
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,230
to working.

637
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,710
Since she intended to hide it,

638
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,230
then it must be that she doesn't want us to know.

639
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,110
So it's not good for anyone if we keep investigating.

640
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,460
Right.

641
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,070
I don't care who she is.

642
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,430
Anyway, all I need to know is that

643
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,110
she is the deputy architect

644
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,830
of our Wood Feather House.

645
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,060
That's right.

646
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,140
Qingfeng,

647
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,550
I have to go home today.

648
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,550
Your father did a hard work last night.

649
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,500
Please say hello to your parents for me,

650
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,950
and tell them that I will visit him in two days.

651
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,220
Okay. I’m leaving!

652
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:23,790
Miss Han.

653
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,750
Boss Luo.

654
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,190
Are you tired? Do you want to rest?

655
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,150
It's okay.

656
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,830
How about you accompany me to meet another employer?

657
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,230
You have got a new project so soon!

658
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,550
It's not settled yet.

659
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,430
Anyway, I shall go to discuss about it first.

660
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:40,910
Besides,

661
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,310
the identity of this employer

662
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,270
is a little special.

663
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,670
How special?

664
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,230
You'll know when you get there.

665
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,060
You can go pack up first,

666
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,110
then let's go out.

667
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,510
Okay.

668
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,230
Boss Luo.

669
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,470
Miss Chen?

670
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,430
I was looking for you.

671
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,550
Miss Chen.

672
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,030
Miss Chen, you got something for me?

673
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,590
I want to go home.

674
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,470
So I came to ask for a leave.

675
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,190
Sure. You can take a break these days.

676
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,310
Let me see...

677
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,910
Just remember to tell Qingfeng about it.

678
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:04,990
Okay.

679
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,780
I'm here.

680
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,110
You're...

681
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,990
repairing it?

682
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,870
I shall get it dismantled and then study it.

683
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,550
You don't have to feel guilty.

684
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,470

856
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,390
Can't you just

857
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,510
spare my blushes?

858
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,590
What blushes?

859
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:49,950
You are no longer the wealthy man that you were before, are you?

860
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,670
Understood. Understood.

861
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,190
Come with me.

862
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:56,990
Well,

863
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,350
I shall get you a cup of tea.

864
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,470
Do you know how long you haven't been home?

865
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,990
When did you become so stubborn?

866
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,430
After my mother died.

867
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,710
Why do you mention your mother again?

868
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,950
Because I always remember

869
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,030
and I will never forget

870
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,300
why my mother died.

871
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,630
These words again.

872
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,950
I’ve explained it to you.

873
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,190
Describing your giving up your oath

874
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,420
as a helpless difficulty,

875
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,060
is this the so-called explanation?

876
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,470
I won't argue with you.

877
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,150
I’m here today for another thing.

878
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,990
That girl surnamed Chen...

879
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,190
What's wrong with her?

880
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,110
Although the Li family is not noble,

881
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,070
the girl you are to marry should at least match you.

882
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:05,350
As for that lady Chen, if you do like her,

883
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,550
then it's okay.

884
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,350
But we need to know about her family,

885
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,590
then I can find a matchmaker to get you two betrothed.

886
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,950
She and I have expressed our feelings for each other.

887
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,750
I don't care whether she matches me or not.

888
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,230
I like her, so the one I'm to marry must be her.

889
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,140
You...

890
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,750
So you still know you should come to see me.

891
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,310
I always miss you,

892
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,690
[Memorial to the throne]

893
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,430
so I came to greet you.

894
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,710
Really?

895
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,550
As a carpenter,

896
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,430
you still have time to think about me?

897
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,310
I know I was wrong.

898
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,790
If I really blame you,

899
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,830
I would have already caught you back.

900
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

901
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,510
But,

902
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,390
how did you know?

903
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,990
Come in.

904
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,510
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

905
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,670
Wang Sheng?

906
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,590
Except being the chief executive of Wood Feather House,

907
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,020
he is also

908
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,390
Commander in charge of the Palace Division.

909
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:21,900
I sent him

910
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,870
to protect you.

911
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,390
I see.

912
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:34,150
No wonder you were always staring at me.

913
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,870
And your dress-up...

914
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,950
You were the one following me on the street, right?

915
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,950
If I offended you,

916
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,190
please punish me, your Highness.

917
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,950
Don't be like this.

918
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,430
I'm not used to it.

919
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,220
Wang Sheng is young,

920
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,830
but he has the title of the Best fighter in the imperial court.

921
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,350
That I sent him to protect you

922
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,110
is indeed a waste of his talent.

923
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,910
But only if he's with you can I rest assured.

924
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,710
Thank you, your Majesty.

925
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,390
Thank you, Wang Sheng.

926
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,070
No.

927
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,390
Should I call you Commander?

928
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,390
You can call me whatever you want.

929
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,150
I’d better call you Wang Sheng. It's more natural.

930
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,310
We are partners in the Wood Feather House.

931
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,390
Then you don't have to be so cautious in front of me.

932
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,390
Don't tell his Majesty everything.

933
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,590
And in the future,

934
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,220
when we return to the Wood Feather House,

935
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,750
do treat me in a more normal way.

936
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,270
Don't take extra care of me.

937
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,710
Or Architect Li will suspect us.

938
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,990
What? You still will go back?

939
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,830
