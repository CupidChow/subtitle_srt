[Episode 6]

4
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,390
You can do whatever you want.

5
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,110
But don't you hurt the reputation of Wood Feather.

6
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,030
We can't afford the consequences.

7
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,430
Enough.

8
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,350
You're in charge here.

9
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,950
You have the right to fire Meng Yuanxu.

10
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,270
But look how domineering you are!

11
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,229
Is this the way you treat your colleague?

12
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:57,990
I'm domineering?

13
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,030
You don't think so?

14
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,340
Meng Yuanxu did make a mistake.

15
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,750
But he didn't do anything wrong

16
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,710
on the construction site.

17
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,110
The injured craftsman

18
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,670
wanted to make more money

19
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,270
by lying that he was a stonemason.

20
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,910
Did you know about this?

21
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,950
You are just a carpenter.

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,550
Why did you tell them you're a stonemason?

23
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,590
- Stop it. - Why?

24
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,350
Now look at you.

25
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,990
You're injured.

26
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,070
What do we do now?

27
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,590
Here's Dr. Xu.

28
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,430
He'll treat you,

29
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,390
and I'll pay everything.

30
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:31,870
And

31
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,579
these 100 taels

32
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,710
are a compensation for your injury.

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,270
This...

34
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,790
And

35
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,430
Meng Yuanxu and I are indeed friends.

36
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,150
But you immediately concluded that

37
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,990
he joined because of me.

38
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,110
Doesn't that show how domineering you are?

39
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,070
Stop it.

40
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,710
Director of carpenters.

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,710
Big deal.

42
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,710
Best luck, you guys!

43
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,710
- Sir!  - Meng Yuanxu!

44
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,070
Architect Li...

45
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,790
Stop.

46
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,270
I didn't do anything wrong.

47
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,670
Li Qingfeng.

48
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,190
I need to talk to you.

49
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,270
Let me ask you.

50
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,550
Do you really care about what Mr. Meng thinks?

51
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,790
What do you mean?

52
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,470
He's in love

53
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,390
with Miss Chen. So what?

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,190
I'm fine with that.

55
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,670
But it can't affect our quality of work.

56
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,390
But he already learned the lessons.

57
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,590
Is it because

58
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,630
you don't want to

59
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,190
see them together?

60
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,990
What does that have to do with me?

61
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,990
It has something to do with me.

62
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,829
He's in love with Miss Chen,

63
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,230
just as I'm in love with you.

64
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,070
Mistakes can be corrected,

65
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,110
but there's nothing wrong with love.

66
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,470
Li Qingfeng.

67
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,190
I always do as you say.

68
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,829
But when it comes to this matter,

69
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,750
you should think twice about it.

70
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,910
Besides, the construction schedule is tight.

71
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,230
That's why

72
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,100
you should ask Mr. Meng to come back

73
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,230
and finish the work first.

74
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,110
It's also an opportunity for him to make up for his mistake.

75
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,190
Right?

76
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,590
No matter what,

77
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,110
I will support your decision.

78
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,390
I’m off.

79
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,390
Luo, is it you?

80
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:38,590
It's me.

81
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,710
You said that

82
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,750
Meng Yuanxu didn't stay just because of you.

83
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,230
Is that true?

84
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,550
You won't believe what I say anyway.

85
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,350
Tell me.

86
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,590
I believe you.

87
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,230
If you really do, I don't need to explain at all.

88
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,100
Tell me, please.

89
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,790
Meng Yuanxu

90
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,470
grew up under his father's strict discipline.

91
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,030
But

92
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,270
no matter what he does,

93
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,710
his father never appreciates it.

94
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,710
His family seems to be his biggest advantage.

95
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,710
But it's actually his biggest burden.

96
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,830
As the only son in the family,

97
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,910
the only choice for him is to become an official.

98
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,350
But he doesn't like politics and the Imperial Exam.

99
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,710
That's why he was idling around

100
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,070
and was deemed as a rebellious playboy.

101
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,950
He just wants to show

102
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,070
to his father

103
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,670
that he's a useful man.

104
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,070
Do you know?

105
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,230
After we renovated Tongtong's house,

106
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,190
he told me that

107
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,070
it was the first time he was proud of himself

108
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,270
that he had

109
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,790
helped do something

110
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,790
that made a difference.

111
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,550
So you're saying

112
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,510
Meng Yuanxu

113
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,950
took the excuse of following you to Wood Feather

114
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,750
to give himself a chance to grow?

115
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,830
This is just my speculation.

116
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,470
I haven't asked him about it.

117
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,230
So

118
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,990
believe it or not.

119
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,270
And

120
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,790
I'm not putting in good words for him because I'm his master.

121
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,910
I just don't want you to misunderstand him.

122
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,150
But

123
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,590
why did he follow you here in the first place?

124
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,910
Do you know his father too?

125
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,350
He's the magistrate of Lin'an.

126
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,670
How could I know him?

127
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,910
Anyway, that's all I have to say.

128
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,990
It’s late now.

129
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,990
I'm going to sleep.

130
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,030
Wait.

131
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,230
It won't break.

132
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,990
There you go.

133
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,750
It really doesn't break.

134
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,390
So I was wrongly accusing him.

135
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,150
But as the son of the magistrate,

136
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,710
why is he so respectful to Miss Chen?

137
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,110
Why does Miss Chen

138
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,060
know him so well?

139
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,990
Who is she?

140
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,100
Does it really matter?

141
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,390
What's going on now?

142
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,380
The progress here...

143
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,990
Miss Chen.

144
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,910
Mr. Luo.

145
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,590
Where is Qingfeng?

146
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,070
Why do you ask me?

147
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,030
Right.

148
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,470
Why did I ask you about him?

149
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,150
Well, he told me this morning that he had work to attend to.

150
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,670
It's already noon and he hasn't come back yet.

151
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,790
I saw him go to your room last night.

152
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,740
You two...

153
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,790
We didn't do anything.

154
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,350
Miss Chen, don't get me wrong.

155
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,460
I was just asking.

156
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,510
Don't take it personally.

157
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,470
Mr. Meng!

158
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,110
Come on, let me drink with you.

159
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,470
Come on!

160
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,630
Let's drink with Mr. Meng.

161
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,190
Have a drink.

162
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,270
A toast to you.

163
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,030
Come on.

164
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,150
Have a drink.

165
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:07,790
Get lost!

166
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,990
Don't bother me!

167
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,270
Li Qingfeng, what are you doing here?

168
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,110
Leave me alone!

169
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,750
I'm here to apologize to you.

170
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,820
I had no idea that

171
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,870
the carpenter lied about being a stonemason.

172
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,230
Although you were the general director,

173
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,910
it's not all your fault.

174
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,230
Did I hear it wrong?

175
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,030
You're apologizing to me?

176
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,820
You didn't hear it wrong.

177
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,390
You'll still work as the general director of Wood Feather.

178
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,590
If you don't want to,

179
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,390
I'll take my leave now.

180
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,270
Li Qingfeng, what do you think I am?

181
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,220
Your servant?

182
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,830
So will you continue working for us or not?

183
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,190
Well.

184
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,990
Go to another room.

185
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,150
Who told you you could sit down?

186
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,390
If you want to swear me,

187
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,070
you can start now.

188
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,310
Swear you?

189
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,790
I want to beat you up!

190
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,070
No problem.

191
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,660
I'm not a reckless man.

192
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,910
I won't really beat you.

193
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,750
Let me ask you.

194
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,870
I want to stay in Wood Feather because of my master.

195
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,630
What's wrong with that?

196
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,430
Do you have a crush on my master?

197
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,830
Wood Feather is a professional architecture team.

198
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,430
If our work is held back because of your personal issues,

199
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,870
it's unacceptable.

200
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,910
Then why did you apologize to me?

201
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,150
I'm here to tell you that

202
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,550
you can stay

203
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,270
as long as you do your job in the future.

204
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,350
Mr. Meng.

205
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,670
I'm not gonna drink with you.

206
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,030
What are you smiling about?

207
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,070
The construction schedule is tight.

208
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,790
Are you going back with me now

209
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,830
or

210
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,670
do you need to sober up first?

211
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,030
What construction?

212
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,230
Did I tell you that I would go back with you?

213
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,230
Sorrows abound,

214
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,750
while good wine is limited.

215
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,750
Although there're more sorrows than wine,

216
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,430
drinking drives away the sorrows.

217
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,110
Drink this up

218
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,550
and come back with me.

219
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,990
We're here to drink.

220
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,550
Stop reciting poems.

221
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,110
I'll go back, but it's because I'm magnanimous.

222
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,670
I forgive you.

223
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,990
I'm back.

224
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,590
And there.

[Rose and Pine]

226
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,310
Great!

227
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,590
But you'll have to

228
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,670
make up for the lost time.

229
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,990
Don't worry. No problem.

230
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,110
I'll make it.

[Rose and Pine]

232
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,510
Guo,

233
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,870
how's it going?

234
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,750
I asked Mr. Luo.

235
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,390
The work will be delivered in 3 days without any delay.

236
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,550
3 days later...

237
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,190
Welcome, Mr. Zhao, Mr. Fan.

238
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,870
Please wait in the hall.

239
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,870
When it's time,

240
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,750
I'll take you to Huan Cai House.

241
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,550
Please.

242
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,630
[Waves Pavilion]

243
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,590
Good work.

244
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,870
Well done.

245
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,990
That's right.

246
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,220
Look at the fake mountains.

247
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,510
They are rolling and well-proportioned.

248
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,310
They look much better than before.

[Waves Pavilion]

250
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,070
Between the pond and the mountains,

251
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,630
there is a subtle sense of beauty.

252
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,590
Thanks to the drafting of our two architects.

253
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,310
It's so nice of you, Niaoniao.

254
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,750
By the way, Mr. Luo,

255
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,190
where is Architect Li?

256
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,790
You were not here just now.

257
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,790
He went to see Miss Liu.

258
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,390
It's been an hour.

259
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,100
He's still not back.

260
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,390
I think Li Qingfeng

261
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,350
must have taken the opportunity

262
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,190
to drink and talk to her.

263
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,310
Nonsense.

264
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,870
I'm so busy today.

265
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,310
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

266
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,230
My apologies.

267
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,470
No worries.

268
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,390
The renovation is completed as scheduled.

269
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,670
I’m here to invite Miss Liu to check it.

270
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,670
When you were working on it a few days ago,

271
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,590
I went to check it several times.

272
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,100
I saw the new garden

273
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,550
and liked it a lot.

274
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,620
There's a poem-writing competition in Lin'an today.

275
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,870
It's a big event.

276
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,990
Miss Liu has invited those talented poets to visit Huan Cai House.

277
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,710
That shows

278
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,750
your trust of Wood Feather.

279
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,910
You're welcome.

280
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,950
My father is an official in the Ministry of Rites

281
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,270
and in charge of the Imperial Exam.

282
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,190
The competition

283
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,020
is just his approach

284
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,830
of selecting talents.

285
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,070
I find it very boring.

286
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,030
But

287
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,990
it may be different tonight.

288
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,030
What's the difference?

289
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,430
Nothing.

290
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,230
Could it be that

291
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,110
people who come this year are different from before?

292
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,830
They're all playboys.

293
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,790
Nothing different.

294
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,860
When I was working in the garden the other day,

295
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,310
I thought of a classic story,

296
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,270
which reminded me of

297
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,030
your request for the innovation.

298
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,670
Miss Liu, you must know

299
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,470
which story I'm talking about.

300
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,190
You are well-read.

301
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,750
I'm impressed.

302
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,910
But I wanted to renovate this garden for some personal reasons.

303
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,910
I've never thought of any classic stories.

304
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,310
In that case,

305
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,510
I'd better take my leave now.

306
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,390
If there is any problem about the garden,

307
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,150
send someone for me at Wood Feather House.

308
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,310
We're on duty at any time.

309
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,550
Qingfeng.

310
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,470
You're back.

311
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,430
Where is Miss Liu?

312
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,070
Miss Liu said she trusted us.

313
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,030
So she wouldn't check the finished work.

314
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,630
It's done.

315
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,550
Thank you, everyone.

316
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,710
Great!

317
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,030
Cut the crap.

318
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,390
I've been working so hard these days.

319
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,790
Now I just want to have a party.

320
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,910
So

321
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,550
what do you say?

322
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,670
How about this?

323
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,750
You send the tools back to the house.

324
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,030
And I'm going to Drunk Immortal Restaurant

325
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,310
and order their best dishes for us.

326
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,110
What do you think?

327
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,990
Order some chicken for me.

328
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,790
Small. Small. Small.

329
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,910
We won!

330
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,140
That's right.

331
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,910
Drink it up.

332
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,350
Here.

333
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,830
We're home. We're home.

334
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,870
Lift your feet. Come on. Be careful.

335
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,430
Luo.

336
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,910
You're drunk. You can't drink.

337
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,030
I won the whole night.

338
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,910
- But why was I the one who's drinking?  - Slow down.

339
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,830
Shut up.

340
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,630
I'll teach you a lesson tomorrow morning.

341
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,630
You're drunk

342
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,220
and you made Luo drunk too.

343
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,390
He probably

344
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,190
didn’t expect Luo would get drunk with only one cup.

I would return from battlefield in triumph

You two are a perfect couple.

Why did you want to kill yourselves?

420
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,630
Yun and I have known each other since we were little.

421
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,030
We were childhood sweethearts.

422
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,670
However, my father is a civil official,

423
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,230
while Yun was born in a family of generals.

424
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,750
Civil officials and military officials have long been at odds with each other.

425
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,780
My father doesn't want us to be together

426
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,350
regardless of my plea.

427
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,670
Three years ago, Yun led the army to guard the border.

428
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,950
My father insisted we should break up because of the long-distance relationship.

429
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,790
Over the past three years,

430
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,500
I've been begging father every day.

431
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,510
I even thought about going to the border and stay with Yun there.

432
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,830
But father has told the city guards that

433
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,990
I'm not allowed to leave the city.

434
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,510
I left Liu Mansion and came to Huan Cai House

435
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,630
for some peace and quiet.

436
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,700

Yun returned at long last.

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,390
He had lost the battle

439
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,110
and was getting depressed.

440
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,820
But my love for him is even deeper than before.

441
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,110
Yun has reported to His Majesty that

442
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,070
conflicts rage between civil and military officials and the army is suffering a low morale.

443
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,510
If it goes on like this, the state will be on the decline.

444
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,940
But father is so obsessed with breaking us apart

445
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,510
that he pulled strings and ousted Yun.

446
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,830
Yun has been dedicated himself

447
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,150
to serve the state.

448
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,710
But now there's no way for him to fulfil his ambitions.

449
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,630
And two of us are forbidden to love each other.

450

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,230

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,060
how could you

460
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,590
have the heart to see your loved one die?

461
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,110
If you do,

462
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,910
how come you didn't even

463
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,980
have the courage to live on and make your dreams come true?

464

To die for love looks heroic,

465
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,950
but it's the most cowardly and convenient choice.

466

Right?

471

Miss,

472
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,030
when there's no way out,

473
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,740
how can we survive?

474
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,820
So there's only a way to die

475
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,190
instead of a way to live for you?

476
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,990
That's ridiculous.

477
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,590
Your devotion to the state is admirable.

478
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,670
And your love for him is touching.

479
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,830
I don't think there's no way out for you two.

480
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,220
That's right.

481
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,540
We are outsiders after all

482
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,510
and can't make decisions for you.

483
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,790
But I do think

484
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,630
you have a future together.

485
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,070
But you need to work very hard for it.

486
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,590
For example, you can leave Lin'an together.

487
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,910
You can go to the border and join the army again.

488
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,310
You can submit your proposals to the government along with other generals.

489
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,230
Only by surviving can there be hope.

490
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,030
As Miss Han said,

491
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,590
death is the worst decision you can make.

492
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,670
To find a way out for each other

493
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,950
is the right thing to do.

494

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,830
Miss Liu and I talked a lot.

517
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,510
I could tell what she was thinking.

518
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,310
Besides, her renovation plan

519
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,630
is very similar to an ancient tale.

520
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,900
That's why I concluded that she may kill herself.

521
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,830
Tale?

522
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,670
What tale?

523
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,470
The Peacock Flies Southeast.

524
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,070
Yes.

525
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,750
Pine tree, buttonwood,

526
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,030
and a pond with mandarin ducks.

527
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,910
These are all similar to the story.

528
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,950
So it's not hard to tell.

529
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,230
But what strikes me most is that

530
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,790
even when she was going to die for love,

531
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,670
she used the classic story to show her affection.

532
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,830
Now I can see why she's the most talented lady in Lin'an.

533
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,750
In my opinion,

534
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,110
she's also the craziest lady about love in Lin'an.

535
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,990
This is life, I guess.

536
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,550
I really feel sorry for them.

537
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,190
I wonder what they will do next.

538
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,390
In that case,

539
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,470
the only option they have

540
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,590
is to go to the border.

541
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,590
But he was already fired.

542
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,510
That may not work.

543
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,790
One is a veteran general,

544
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,270
and the other is a talented girl.

545
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,790
They're a perfect couple

546
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,860
and deserve each other.

547
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,670
But

548
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,630
the feud between civil and military officers

549
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,830
is so irreconcilable.

550
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,630
Fire is the test of gold.

551
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,510
Maybe true love must always go through ups and downs.

552
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,750
Niaoniao.

553
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,590
Thank you. You saved them tonight.

554
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,630
And what you said to Miss Liu

555
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,070
really touched me.

556
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,590
Although you have a gentle voice,

557
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,710
you speak powerfully.

558
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,590
I'm so flattered, Miss Chen.

559
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,510
I was just talking nonsense.

560
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,190
No, you had a good point.

561
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,590
I didn't know much

562
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,310
about relationships.

563
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,030
But tonight,

564
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,260
I think I've learned a lot.

565
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,910
What have you learned?

566
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,270
Love is a little bit scary

567
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,270
and a little bit touching as well.

568
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,870
Big news! Big news!

569
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,950
Liu Yiyun eloped with a guy!

570
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,380
[Construction according to conditions]

571
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,600
Really?

572
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,830
You don't look surprised at all?

573
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,990
Do you already know it?

574
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,670
Then do you know who the guy is?

575
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,790
I've no idea.

576
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,670
I only know that Lord Liu invited the Imperial Guards,

577
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,150
who are searching everywhere aroud the city.

578
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,710
He must be a playboy.

579
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,180
I just don't understand.

580
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,590
Since she was going to elope,

581
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,350
why did she ask us to renovate the garden in the first place?

582
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,990
You're wrong.

583
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,030
He's not a playboy,

584
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,590
but the chief of Imperial Guards.

585
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,670
That’s why the guards are all out now.

586
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,590
How do you know that?

587
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,670
It's a long story.

588
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,550
What are you doing early in the morning?

589
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,230
Niaoniao caught a cold last night.

590
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,590
I'll get some medicine for her.

591
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,470
Go make the medicine.

592
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,310
By the way,

593
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,430
where did Li Qingfeng go?

594
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,870
I didn't see him in the morning.

595
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,630
Qingfeng went to the lake with Miss Zhao.

596
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,110
The lake?

597
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,790
Miss Zhao came to see him in the morning.

598
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,990
Don't tell anyone I told you that.

599
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,030
They're out for fun, huh?

600
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,150
Pear juice! Pear juice!

601
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,150
You want it?

602
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,550
Yes.

603
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,340
Sir, pear juice for two.

604
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,950
OK. Just a second.

605
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,830
No sugar for me.

606
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:16,670
Got it.

607
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,550
You like sour food?

608
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,270
There you go. Enjoy.

609
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,670
Here.

610
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,740
Thanks.

611
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,710
You looked serious ever since you left Wood Feather House.

612
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,110
But now you're smiling because of the pear juice.

613
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,110
Is it that good?

614
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,510
It's sour.

615
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,950
I wonder

616
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,100
whether you can tell how sour I am.

617
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,030
You're sour, too?

618
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,950
What do you mean?

619
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,790
Who else is sour?

620
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,550
Pear juice.

621
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,150
Miss, what are you doing?

622
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,060
My desk is too small.

623
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,310
So I want to make a new one.

624
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,350
Can't you see? I'm cutting wood.

625
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,270
But you look like

626
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,950
you're killing the wood.

627
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,910
This wood is infuriating.

628
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,140
What happened?

629
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,790
Li Qingfeng

630
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,310
went to the lake with Miss Zhao this morning.

631
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,910
They went to the lake together?

632
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,910
Sir, stop it.

633
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,310
Don't you see her upset?

634
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,630
I'm not upset.

635
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,100
Not at all.

636
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,750
You two, don't waste my time here.

637
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,740
Get back to work.

638
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,150
Right.

639
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,310
I'll make porridge for you.

640
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,550
I'm off!

641
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:41,670
Come on!

642
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,950
Why are you still here?

643
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,030
Master,

644
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,430
don't be mad.

645
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,710
They're having a lake tour. So what?

646
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,790
They're having fun.

647
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,150
We can too.

648
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,310
Do you have to fold it so neatly?

649
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,750
Miss Zhao,

650
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,390
I know what you mean.

651
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,310
Since we knew each other,

652
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,190
every time you go to Wood Feather,

653
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,070
I know what you go for.

654
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,990
But I must be honest with you that

655
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,670
I'm not into you at all.

656
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,910
That's very straightforward.

657
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,750
Please forgive me.

658
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,030
I won't.

659
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,430
Sorry to offend you.

660
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,750
Aren't you afraid that I will withdraw my investment?

661
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,710
If you insist,

662
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,310
I can't stop you.

663
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,870
I really appreciate it that

664
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,750
you helped Wood Feather in times of need.

665
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,870
I’m very grateful

666
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,980
and I will return the favor.

667
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,350
How are you gonna do it?

668
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,310
How about

669
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,790
a renovation of the Zhao Mansion?

670
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,350
For what?

671
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,430
Li Qingfeng.

672
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,870
I know I can’t force love.

673
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,630
But I asked you out today

674
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,510
to keep each other company.

675
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,630
If you're not into me, we can work on it.

676
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,190
But you turn me down immediately.

677
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,350
Is it because you like someone else?

678
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,590
Miss Chen, right?

679
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,190
Does that matter?

680
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,950
What's so good about her?

681
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,150
She's prettier than me?

682
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,950
She's an architect while I'm not?

683
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,820
Or she's the one who stays with you every day?

684
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,630
Or something else?

685
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,580
The girl I love

686
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,830
will never compare herself with anyone else.

687
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,750
Can't you just say something nice to me?

688
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,030
To be honest,

689
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,510
I have no idea how to do that.

690
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,230
Miss Zhao,

691
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,950
I'll take my leave.

692
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,190
Li Qingfeng.

693
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,510
It's so beautiful here.

694
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,110
Well done.

695
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,110
What is this?

696
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,540
Why do you give me a gift?

697
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,230
This is not a gift, Master.

698
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,820
Princess Zhaohe.

699
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,030
To be honest,

700
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,430
this bracelet

701
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,190
is a gift from my mother for her future daughter-in-law.

702
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,270
Me?

703
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,790
I remember when I was little,

704
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,070
Madam Meng rarely saw me.

705
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,750
Did you steal it?

706
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,350
I...

707
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,070
Fine. Please take it back.

708
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,470
What a nice view!

709
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,020
Master, why don't you understand

710
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,590
my love for you?

711
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,310
I like you

712
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,230
ever since I was 9.

713
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,270
Nobody wanted to play with me.

714
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,750
You were my only friend.

715
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,230
When my father punished me,

716
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,030
you were the only one who protected me.

717
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,070
Everyone thinks I'm hopeless,

718
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,070
But you never give up on me.

719
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,910
That's why I want to marry you.

720
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,150
I would say the same thing to His Majesty.

721
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,910
Even though you're gonna punish me for this,

722
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,790
I don't care.

723
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,790
I love you even if you put me in jail.

724
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,750
I will tell everyone there that I love you.

725
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,830
Then after they are beheaded,

726
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,470
they'll go to the underworld and spread the word for me there.

727
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,150
I love you, no matter what.

728
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,230
I just love you.

729
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,790
Stop, stop, stop.

730
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,940
Think about it.

731
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,230
Is it

732
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,550
really love?

733
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,110
Then what is love?

734
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,550
In my opinion, love

735
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,710
is about rapport at first sight.

736
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,390
Two people in love are soulmates

737
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,620
who are truly connected to each other.

738
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,030
They find each other and love makes them complete.

739
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,190
Understand?

740
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,630
I do.

741
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,630
I think we are a perfect match.

742
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,030
Master, you are my soulmate.

743
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,910
You complete me.

744
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,510
You don't understand at all.

745
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,190
Being each other's soulmate should be a mutual feeling.

746
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,350
You think I'm your soulmate.

747
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,870
But I don't think you're mine.

748
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,310
That's very blunt.

749
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,550
That's right.

750
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,020
I see you as my brother.

751
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,710
No, Master.

752
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,630
Do you like Li Qingfeng...

753
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,510
It has nothing to do with him, Meng Yuanxu.

754
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,510
I can’t force myself to love you.

755
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,590
I treat you as my family,

756
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,909
my friend and brother.

757
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,989
That's why I've been helping you.

758
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,469
But between us,

759
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,780
there is no love.

760
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,630
Slow down.

761
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:26,790
Here.

762
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,430
It's not bitter now, right?

763
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,870
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

764
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,390
Pleasure.

765
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,750
It’s all my fault.

766
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,230
If I hadn't been that drunk,

767
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,710
I wouldn't have let you go and jump into the pond.

768
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:39,950
Don't say that.

769
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,030
You're good at swimming, too?

770
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,270
No.

771
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,860
Do you know?

772
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,510
They eloped.

773
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,070
I'm sure they'll be grateful to you

774
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,230
for the rest of their lives.

775
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,670
It's all thanks to

776
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,310
Miss Chen and Mr. Li.

777
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,270
If Miss Chen hadn't found out that Mr. Li was worrying for Miss Liu,

778
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,510
we wouldn't have gone to Huan Cai House.

779
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,950
Maybe I was too drunk to tell.

780
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,950
I've known Qingfeng for so long.

781
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,790
Why didn’t I see he’s worried?

782
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,470
No.

783
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,230
Miss Chen likes Mr. Li.

784
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,830
You're inviting butterflies here.

785
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,390
What?

786
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,190
Look up.

787
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,150
Have you seen him?

788
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:46,950
No.

789
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,350
Let's go.

790
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,990
Looks like they haven’t escaped from Lin’an yet.

791
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,470
This is a hard choice.

792
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,390
Good luck with that.

793
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,270
Tell me.

794
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,230
Did we do it right?

795
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,270
It's not you and me who decide whether it's right or wrong.

796
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,470
I hope they think we are right.

797
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,950
Then no matter how hard it is,

798
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,180
they're still be happy together.

799
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,910
Were you happy with the lake trip with Miss Zhao?

800
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,950
I said what I wanted to say.

801
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,190
Of course I was happy.

802
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,510
What you wanted to say?

803
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,190
That's right.

804
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,710
What you wanted to say...

805
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,350
Young master.

806
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,710
Father?

807
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,310
Huan Cai House is done.

808
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,310
How dare you

809
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,590
renovate Liu Tong’s work?

810
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,750
I was just doing my job as an architect.

811
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,190
This is...

812
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,110
Miss Chen.

813
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,460
The deputy architect of Wood Feather House.

814
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,150
Deputy architect.

815
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,940
You look familiar.

816
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,230
Which craftsman team did you work with before?

817
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,150
Before?

818
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,270
I didn't work before.

819
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,470
If there's nothing else you have to say,

820
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,310
we'll go back now.

821
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,590
We haven't seen each other for nearly half a year,

822
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,670
and you have nothing to say to me?

823
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,310
I have nothing to say to you, either.

824
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,470
But since I saw you two together by the lake,

825
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,980
I need to tell you that

826
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,150
you should take your girlfriend

827
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,270
back home to visit us,

828
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,670
so that we can check it out for you.

829
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,110
I don't need anyone to check my girlfriend out for me.

830
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,070
Ridiculous!

831
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:19,230
Parents' opinions are crucial.

832
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,700
People would judge her!

833
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,600
Uncle.

834
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,950
Well...

835
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,430
She's not my girlfriend.

836
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,190
I don't need to tell you

837
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,630
who my girlfriend is in the first place.

838
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,230
Don't you interfere in my decisions for my own life.

839
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,070
The tea you make is as bad as ever.

840
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,950
Let's go.

841
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,940
Uncle, thank you for the tea.

842
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
[Wood Feather House]

843
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,590
Come on. Let's eat. Let's eat!

844
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,670
Eat.

845
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:53,710
Eat.

846
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,550
Why don't you eat?

847
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,030
Luo, I’m going back to my room.

848
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,060
Enjoy your meal.

849
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,790
Miss.

850
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,870
I'm not hungry, either.

851
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,430
Enjoy.

852
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,070
I have no appetite.

853
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,270
What's wrong with them?

854
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,150
Let's eat.

855
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,230
Architect Chen.

856
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,590
Go back to your room.

857
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,470
The bowls and chopsticks I gave you

858
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,670
are not used?

859
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,790
Actually, uncle really cared about you.

860
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,310
I don't know what misunderstanding you and your father have,

861
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,110
but I got his point.

862
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,260
♫The wind stops in the story of the flowers♫

863
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,680
♫Waiting for someone to listen♫

864
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,750
♫The moon is hidden in the infinite night sky♫

865
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,910
♫Waiting for someone to find♫

866
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,080
♫I'm caught in an endless space of time♫

867
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,910
♫You're my star♫

868
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,790
How can I unlock it?

869
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,430
Let me help you.

870
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,490
♫Every word♫

871
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,240
♫is unheard of yet familiar♫

872
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:37,620
♫As if we know each other so well♫

873
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,070
What is this?

874
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,710
Since it's a lock,

875
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,710
I have to lock something.

876
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:43,180
♫The wind chases the moon for a thousand miles♫

877
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,360
♫Write the most romantic verse of your life♫

878
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,190
♫I never anticipated that you would be there♫

879
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,370
♫My heart skips a beat♫

880
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,320
♫I don't know where to start♫

881
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,360
♫Don't know where to go♫

882
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,090
♫The moon has heard the wind rise♫

883
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,790
Who?

884
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,870
