This is my wife, Jiang, but we're not officially married.

Mr. Liao.

61
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,750
Is the wind in this house always like this?

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,470
No, no, no.

63
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,750
Before my wife died,

64
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,590
I had never seen such a strange wind here.

65
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,190
It's not a strange wind.

66
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,990
As long as a house has broken windows and doors,

67

the wind will come in.

68

Besides, the Red River is right across the house.

69
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,030
So the wind along the river is brought into the alley

70
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,990
and then enter this house.

71

Is there any other sound in the wind?

82
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,670
The crying of a baby.

The crying sound is gone.

89

These things.

105

Why didn't Mr. Liao throw them away?

106

He just left them here.

doesn't love his deceased wife at all.

109
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,230
Otherwise, he wouldn’t have found another woman.

110
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,990
Don't.

111
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,140

Don't say that.

Hongdou's sister?

Yes.

160
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,590
She stayed in her hometown of Jinling before.

161
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,590
After she heard about the death of Hongdou,

162
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,950
she came to Lin'an.

163
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,870
To be honest,

164
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,070
my inn

165
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,990
was originally called Hongdou Inn.

166
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,429
It was named after my deceased wife.

167
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,390
After her death,

168
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,870
I changed the name,

169
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,630
but no one would come.

170
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,470
Then how can you sustain your business?

171
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,550
I'm going to sell it.

172
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,110
But I know

173
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,430
no one will buy it.

174
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,550
As long as the problem of my house can't be solved,

175
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,550
neither the inn nor the house would find any buyers.

176
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,550
So,

177
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,270
the house renovation is my top priority now.

178
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,350
Mr. Li.

179
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,750
You have seen the house.

180
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,670
What do you think?

181
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,150
We can take this job.

182
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,870
That's great. That's great.

183
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,390
When can you start?

184
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,750
Mr. Liao,

185
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,230
do you have any specific requirements for the renovation?

186
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,750
Mr. Li...Speaking of which,

187
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,110
I do have a request.

188
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,150
Go ahead.

189
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,700
Before,

190
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,070
a fortuneteller told me

191
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,590
to seal off the main room.

192
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,470
That's ridiculous.

193
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,630
The main room is the center of the house.

194
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,990
All renovated work is built around it.

195
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,790
Well,

196
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,470
if Mr. Liao insists,

197
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,790
I'd rather pay 200 taels of silver as compensation

198
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,230
and you can find someone else to do it.

199
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,230
No, no, no.

200
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,220
Mr. Li, we can talk.

201
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,670
Fine. Don't seal it off then.

202
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,590
But

203
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,830
I have to make it clear.

204
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,030
If a craftsman

205
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,110
or anyone of you

206
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,750
has an accident during the construction,

207
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,830
don't hold me accountable.

208
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,870
Are you cursing us?

209
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,270
No, no, no.

210
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,070
That's not what I meant.

211
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,390
Mr. Liao was very blunt,

212
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,100
but he's trying to make things clear beforehand.

213
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,230
There's nothing wrong with it.

214
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,230
Right.

215
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,630
That's what I meant.

216
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,150
Yes.

217
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,790
Please have some tea.

218
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,750
Have some tea.

219
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,990
Mr. Liao, don't worry.

220
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,830
Things like that will definitely be written in the contract.

221
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,150
So you won't be responsible for any accident.

222
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,510
I have no further requirements then.

223
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,870
You're in charge of the work.

224
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,990
I won't interfere.

225
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,150
Really?

226
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,030
To be honest,

227
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,350
as long as the work can be completed smoothly,

228
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,510
that'll show my house is clean and not haunted.

229
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,110
Thank you.

230
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,390
Then if things go well,

231
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,620
I'll be able to sell the house at a low price.

232
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,260
In that case,

233
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,950
I don't have any more requirements.

234
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:06,830
OK.

235
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,030
Deal.

236
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,030
Tomorrow, I will start the drafting.

237
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,110
Let the craftsmen enter the yard

238
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,150
and get ready.

239
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,590
Once I finish the drafting in three days,

240
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,750
we'll start working.

241
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,020
[Wood Feather House]

242
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,190
Here it is.

243
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,090
[Liao's Mansion]

244
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,750
Here it is.

245
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,510
It's Liao.

246
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,350
No, I can't do it.

247
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,510
I can't do it.

248
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,030
This?

249
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,750
No, no, no.

250
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,990
Is this OK?

251
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,020
Yes, that's more like it.

252
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,270
OK. OK.

253
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,430
Let me tell you.

254
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,990
I've learned some awesome skills.

255
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,030
Today, you can measure wherever you want.

256
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,190
I'll protect you.

257
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,870
Nothing will go wrong.

258
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,790
Something's wrong with the wind.

259
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,740
What's wrong?

260
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,190
It is said that every time before weird things happened in this house,

261
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,990
the wind would blow here

262
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,630
just like this.

263
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,270
Although it's sunny outside,

264
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,630
it's windy here.

265
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,270
There was no such wind the other day.

266
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,630
I thought the rumors

267
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,830
were nothing but nonsense.

268
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,710
But the wind just now made me feel so scared.

269
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,150
No way.

270
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,270
Mr. Luo.

271
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,110
Mr. Luo.

272
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,710
Go on with your work.

273
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,510
All right.

274
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,830
Here.

275
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,270
Actually, the wind is quite cool.

276
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,340
Where are we going to measure today?

277
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,670
The main room.

278
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,550
The main room.

279
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,310
Follow me.

280
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,150
Did you hear anything?

281
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,190
I don't think so.

282
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,910
That's good. That's good.

283
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,550
Tell me if you hear it.

284
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,870
Mr. Luo. Don’t be afraid.

285
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,710
We're right behind you.

286
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,110
I...I'm not afraid.

287
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,380
Miss Han.

288
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,430
Don't worry.

289
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,580
As long as I'm here,

290
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,590
I will protect you.

291
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,510
And...Luo.

292
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,350
And Luo too.

293
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,430
I think

294
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,310
you just want to protect Sister Han, right?

295
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,190
Luo.

296
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,390
Luo. What are you talking about?

297
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,390
Everybody in the Wood Feather House

298
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,470
treats you as our own sister.

299
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,390
Don't worry.

300
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,510
As long as I'm here,

301
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,110
I will protect both of you.

302
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,670
What...What's wrong?

303
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:55,670
Don't move.

304
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,340
Wait for me.

305
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,100
What...What's wrong?

306
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,110
Are you okay?

307
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,300
I think I hit my foot. Are you okay?

308
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:01,870
How is it?

309
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,790
Are you alright?

310
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,700
Tell me!

311
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,910
I don't think it really hit me.

312
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,470
Be careful.

313
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,670
Niaoniao.

314
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:16,750
Luo.

315
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,110
Bad news!

316
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,870
Something happened.

317
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,750
Luo.

318
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,630
This...

319
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,350
What's going on?

320
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,470
Ask yourself.

321
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,590
Luo.

322
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,310
Luo.

323
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,790
Li Qingfeng.

324
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,430
I told you

325
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,830
we shouldn't take this work.

326
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,070
Now you're happy, huh?

327
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,790
Mr. Meng.

328
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,420
What?

329
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,510
Did I say something wrong?

330
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,430
What's the point of saying that now?

331
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,350
Besides, it's not Qingfeng's fault.

332
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,870
When we voted,

333
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,590
he didn't force any of us.

334
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,220
You are his best friend.

335
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,230
Of course you defend him.

336
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,230
I won't.

337
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,110
Speaking of which, it’s my fault.

338
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,830
I failed to protect them.

339
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,430
When we entered the backyard,

340
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,870
I felt a cold wind coming.

341
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,270
But at that time, I thought it would be fine,

342
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:22,910
so...

343
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,670
Wang Sheng, what do you think?

344
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,460
I was not there when the accident happened.

345
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,990
But three days ago,

346
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,470
when we first went to the house of Liao,

347
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,110
I felt like

348
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,390
someone was watching us secretly.

349
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,030
But Mr. Luo

350
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,630
and Mr. Liao were too loud,

351
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,950
I couldn't hear very clearly.

352
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,710
I could only tell that someone was outside the window.

353
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,310
But I didn't find anything suspicious after that.

354
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,910
So you think it's some kid of a conspiracy?

355
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,270
Just like Architect Li,

356
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,390
I don't think there are ghostsm either.

357
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,470
Mr. Luo.

358
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,110
After you brought Luo and Miss Han out,

359
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,670
did anyone else enter?

360
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,430
No.

361
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,030
All the workers went on strike immediately.

362
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,350
No one would go in after that.

363
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,150
Wait.

364
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,910
Niaoniao and Luo were hit by this.

365
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,790
This is Yangzhou pine wood.

366
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,069
In a house over 30 years old

367
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,990
without any repair,

368
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,750
it's likely that the roof can be broken at any moment.

369
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,270
But look here.

370
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,310
It doesn't look like it's broken naturally.

371
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,630
Looks like it was cut off by a sharp weapon.

372
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,630
In other words,

373
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,950
somebody did this on purpose.

374
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,870
Love is like doing business.

375
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,070
You should pull off some tricks when necessary.

376
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,710
Maybe there are traps elsewhere.

377
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,030
Let's take a look around.

378
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,510
Be careful.

379
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,900
Miss Chen.

380
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,550
Come here and have a look.

381
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,310
What's wrong?

382
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,830
Something's wrong here.

383
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,670
Where?

384
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,430
Over there.

385
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,430
Be careful.

386
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,510
Miss Zhao, help!

387
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,590
Are you all right?

388
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,430
Langyue, are you hurt?

389
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,070
I'm fine.

390
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,350
But you...

391
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,430
Are you stupid?

392
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,030
I don't want you to get hurt.

393
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,910
We’d better go back

394
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,950
Let's see if you're hurt.

395
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,830
I'm fine.

396
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,150
Wait.

397
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,950
What are you looking for?

398
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,190
You haven't recovered yet and now you're injured again.

399
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,670
You mean

400
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,620
someone had already

401
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,950
set up a trap on the shelf.

402
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,350
But how did that person know

403
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,830
when we would get there?

404
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,110
They just wanted the shelf to fall down,

405
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,590
and created a weird incident.

406
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,870
As for hitting us, it was just a coincidence.

407
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,630
What about the wood?

408
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,110
Do you have any clue?

409
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,510
The wood seemed to be broken naturally.

410
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,910
But it's close to the roof.

411
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,430
If someone went to the roof,

412
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,780
they could break the wood under the bricks easily.

413
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,630
It's not difficult to do.

414
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,110
I also asked Wang Sheng.

415
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,350
With his internal force,

416
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,310
he can easily break the wood with bare hands.

417
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,630
That makes sense.

418
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:33,630
But

419
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,990
do you have any evidence?

420
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,620
If we want to find out the truth,

421
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,430
we must check the roof ourselves.

422
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,790
If the bricks there were moved,

423
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,630
we'll know the truth.

424
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,150
By the way,

425
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,550
there's one more thing to find out.

426
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,670
One more thing?

427
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,390
Wang Sheng arrived in time yesterday.

428
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,950
Although he said he arrived

429
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,350
because he knew I would visit Liao's house at night,

430
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,510
somehow

431
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,620
I think he's overworried about Langyue.

432
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,630
Bro,

433
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,790
you don't need to be jealous of him.

434
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,070
Seriously,

435
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,430
Wang Sheng is really suspicious.

436
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,110
But Miss Chen

437
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,350
is even more so.

438
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,630
What do you mean?

439
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,830
You can't see it clearly because you like Miss Chen.

440
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,660
If Wang Sheng’s suspicious,

441
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,860
It must have something to do with Miss Chen.

442
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,430
I see.

443
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,350
Bro,

444
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,670
you are getting deeper and deeper into this.

445
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,150
You must have known what happened last night.

446
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,950
But it's exactly because of what happened last night

447
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,430
that I'm sure

448
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,430
this is a conspiracy,

449
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,630
instead of any supernatural force.

450
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,390
So, the renovation will continue.

451
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,420
Continue?

452
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,790
After the accident,

453
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,190
very few craftsmen would work for us.

454
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,350
I can't find

455
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,430
any.

456
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,150
Try to find as many as you can.

457
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,780
This time, we won't work anywhere else

458
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,870
but the main room.

459
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,430
Please get ready now.

460
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,750
I'll make a drafting of the interior renovation tomorrow.

461
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,670
As long as we can do a good job in the main room,

462
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,430
the rumor will be proved invalid.

463
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,670
I'm afraid no craftsmen dare to work for the main room renovation.

464
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,510
Pay them higher salary,

465
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,420
and they'll come.

466
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,390
If you can't do it,

467
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,590
Luo Ye will.

468
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,790
So you just don't give up, huh?

469
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,910
Can you do it or not?

470
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,110
Okay, I'll do it.

471
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,510
If another accident happens,

472
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,110
I'd like to see how you'll handle the consequences.

473
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,230
Miss Han, are you feeling better?

474
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,110
It's just a scratch.

475
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,070
It's not serious at all.

476
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,390
If you need anything, just tell me.

477
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,060
How about this, Luo Ye?

478
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,310
Go with Miss Han to see Mr. Liao

479
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,630
to get the manufacturing materials of the main room when it was built.

480
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,150
I need that for my drafting.

481
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,430
OK.

482
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,750
In that case,

483
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,550
my injury won't affect me.

484
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,590
You don't have to accompany me.

485
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,710
Weird things keep taking places.

486
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,990
Even if you are not injured,

487
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,350
you can't act alone.

488
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,590
I'll go with you.

489
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,310
Wang Sheng.

490
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,020
Thank you for guarding the house of Liao.

491
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,950
But you'd better keep watch in secret.

492
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,390
Tell me if anything goes wrong.

493
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,110
Where's Architect Chen?

494
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,270
Architect Chen.

495
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,590
This is

496
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,990
a wheelchair shop drawing I managed to draw these days.

497
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,550
Go to the market and buy a small wagon

498
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,100
before you make a wheelchair out of the wagon based on this drawing.

499
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,230
Then Luo

500
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,830
doesn't have to stay in bed all the time.

501
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,790
By the way,

502
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,430
you don't have to work with me these days.

503
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,870
Just take good care of Luo.

504
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,070
Meng Yuanxu will bring a famous doctor

505
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,070
to check on Luo.

506
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,390
I'm sure she will recover soon.

507
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,820
Do you have any more questions?

508
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,550
Come and have a look.

509
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,670
Sugar-coated haws.

510
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,910
Sugar-coated haws.

511
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,430
Wait.

512
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,670
Sir.

513
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,150
Give me two big ones.

514
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,750
OK.

515
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:09,670
I can do it myself.

516
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,190
Let me do it.

517
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:10,990
OK. Please.

518
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,910
I want this.

519
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,150
Take it.

520
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:17,910
Thank you.

521
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,110
Sugar-coated haws.

522
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,660
It's for you.

523
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,070
No thanks.

524
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,590
I...I don't want to eat it.

525
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,470
Miss Han,

526
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,830
look at this.

527
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,270
They are full, round and bright.

528
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,110
You really don't want to take a bite?

529
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,470
If you don't,

530
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,700
I will.

531
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,030
Come on.

532
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,310
It's so sweet.

533
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,790
This is for you.

534
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,390
Take it.

535
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,270
Come on.

536
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,500
Thank you.

537
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,750
Come on.

538
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,270
You...

539
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,310
What's wrong with you?

540
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,870
Why are you crying?

541
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,910
The last time I ate it

542
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,380
was five years ago.

543
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,710
Since you like it very much,

544
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,830
why haven't you eaten it for five years?

545
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,750
My father said sugar-coated haws

546
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,670
were snacks for kids.

547
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,110
Ever since I worked with him,

548
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,390
he never treated me as a little kid.

549
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,830
Once he found out that I ate sugar-coated haws,

550
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,910
and asked me to throw them away.

551
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,950
After I threw them away,

552
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,070
he asked me to spit out the haws inside my mouth.

553

[Rice Wine]

554
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,230
That's why you ran away from home?

555
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,270
Sort of.

556
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,310
That's ridiculous!

557
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,630
Life is hard enough.

558
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,310
If you can't live as you please,

559
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,750
doesn't that make your life even harder?

560
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,470
Don't...Please don't cry.

561
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:33,950
Let's go.

562
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:36,630
Let's go.

563
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,510
Does it hurt?

564
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,310
Meng Yuanxu,

565
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,430
remember to call Dr. Lin.

566
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,630
Only he won’t tell my brother

567
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,950
about what I'm doing outside the palace.

568
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,780
Also,

569
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,590
the small wagon.

570
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,230
You must buy the one I told you.

571
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,270
Don't buy a more expensive one,

572
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,030
otherwise I may fail.

573
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,670
Don't worry. I keep everything you said in mind.

574
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,700
But I need to remind you of something, Master.

575
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,510
Luo is already injured.

576
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,550
You must take care of yourself.

577
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,150
Li Qingfeng is stubborn. Let him do the work himself.

578
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,910
Stop doing stupid things with him.

579
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,710
Fortunately, Wang Sheng went with him last night.

580
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,910
Otherwise, the fire would have spread.

581
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,630
I thought you were going to tell me something really serious.

582
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,350
I got it. Go ahead.

583
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,070
Come back soon.

584
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,070
I'm not done yet.

585
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,070
Even if you intend to do anything dangerous,

586
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,150
do it with me.

587
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,190
Don’t do everything with Li Qingfeng.

588
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,190
I really don't understand.

589
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,830
What makes Li Qingfeng better than me?

590
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,870
In the Wood Feather House, I'm the only one who can protect you.

591
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,390
You know that?

592
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,430
I got it.

593
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,390
You're the best. You're the only one who can protect me.

594
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,310
Go ahead.

595
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,990
You're nagging like an old man.

596
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,830
I'm off then.

597
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,110
Miss, I agree with Mr. Meng.

598
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,110
You can't take risks anymore.

599
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,830
They way you talk

600
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,670
is exactly

601
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,230
like Meng Yuanxu.

602
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,430
How is it?

603
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,390
Let me see your face.

who are you?

607
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,230
I'm Luo Ye,

608
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,310
the owner of Wood Feather House.

609
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,270
Miss Han is our supervisor.

610
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,550
We met before.

611
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,510
I remember you.

612
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,660
Mr. Luo, Miss Han.

Nice to see you, Miss Qinghe.

I'm here for Mr. Liao

615
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,710
to discuss the reconstruction of the main room

616
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,820
and ask for some information.

617
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,470
Would you please take us to him?

618
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,110
You're going to renovate the main room?

619
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,430
Yes. Is there a problem?

620
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:23,870
Nothing.

621
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,030
It’s just that brother-in-law was frightened last night.

622
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,140
The doctor just left.

623
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,030
He's not in a stable state now.

624

Last night?

625
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,110
She was a nuisance when she was alive.

626
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,990
I don’t know what sins you committed in your previous life

627
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,110
to marry such a jinx in this life.

628
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,580
Easy. Easy.

629
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,110
Stop it, okay?

630
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,830
She's got the upper hand now.

631
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,230
There's nothing we can do about that.

632
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,750
If she hears you,

633
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,790
she will come to knock at our door at night again.

634
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,390
I don't want that.

635
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,790
Who is it?

636
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,630
Brother-in-law, Mr. Luo from Wood Feather House wants to see you.

637
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,550
Send him in.

638
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,950
Excuse me.

639
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,510
If this is not the right moment to talk,

640
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,350
we can wait outside.

641
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,470
No, no, no.

642
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:07,870
Well,

00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,390
Mr. Luo, don’t misunderstand us.

644
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,150
My back got hurt.

645
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,150
So she's helping me with it.

00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,580
Come in. Please have a seat.

647

OK.

648
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,910
Qinghe, everything is fine here.

649
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,990
You can leave now.

650
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,110
Mr. Liao.

651
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,670
I remember you said that

652
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,060
Qinghe didn't live in Lin'an before.

653
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,110
Why is that?

654
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,350
Qinghe and Hongdou

655
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,310
are originally from Jinling.

656
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,630
Hongdou moved to Lin'an

657
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,950
with me.

658
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,950
And Qinghe stayed alone in Jinling.

659
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,460
After Hongdou passed away,

660
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,310
she came here from Jinling.

661
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,790
Her parents

662
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,990
died early.

663
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,070
I was worried about her living on her own in Jinling.

664
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,310
So I let her stay in the inn for the time being to help me.

665
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,950
After all,

666
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,150
I’m her only family now that Honghou's dead.

667
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,230
It's my duty to take care of her

668
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,430
Mr. Liao, it's so kind of you.

669
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,590
So,

670
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,870
Qinghe is from Jinling.

671
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,100
Then where are you from?

672
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,110
I'm from the north.

673
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,550
I was working so hard here in Lin'an for more than ten years

674
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,990
before I bought my mansion and this inn.

675
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,630
It's not easy to make a living away from home.

676
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,390
Mr. Luo.

677
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,550
What brings you here?

678
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,870
Did anything go wrong in the house?

679
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,990
I came here

680
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,070
to ask you

681
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,070
about the construction drawing of the main room.

682
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,230
Our architect

683
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,430
needs it for his drafting.

684
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,950
In that case,

685
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,670
no problem.

686
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,870
I'll get it for you later.

687
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,510
By the way,

688
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,950
I heard from Qinghe that

689
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,590
you had an accident last night.

I think we should...

861
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,140
I don't think we should discuss this anymore.

862
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,830
Why not?

863
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,830
We are architects,

864
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,150
not government officials

865
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,070
or wizards.

866
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,870
Anything that's irrelevant to work

867
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,590
shouldn't be our concern.

868
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,430
Li Qingfeng, you're so stubborn!

869
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:45,950
No.

870
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,950
Actually, you're asking for trouble.

871
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,100
Not only do you ask for trouble for yourself,

872
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,270
you want to drag us with you into trouble.

873
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,990
I know that

874
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,190
this work is quite unusual.

875
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,430
But we have already taken it.

876
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,710
If you don't want to do it anymore,

877
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,310
you don't have to.

878
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,430
Even if I'm the only one left,

879
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,270
I'll finish the work myself.

880
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,390
I won't leave you alone.

881
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,710
For Luo,

882
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,470
I won't give up.

883
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,870
♫The wind stops in the story of the flowers♫

884
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,670
Nice work.

885
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,310
♫Waiting for someone to listen♫

886

♫The moon is hidden in the infinite night sky♫

887
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,670
Is this wheelchair better than me?

♫Waiting for someone to find♫

889
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,990
It's comfortable with this angle.

890
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,710
♫I'm caught in an endless space of time♫

891
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,670
Since you're the one who made it, you should give it a go first.

892
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,520
♫You're my star♫

893

896

♫As if we know each other so well♫

897
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,590
Sit tight.

898
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,550
I feel like I'm a patient.

899
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,800
♫The wind chases the moon for thousands of miles♫

900
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,910
Pushing a healthy person in a wheelchair.

901
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,270
I look like your servant.

Well, boy. Do your job.

00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,790
Your'll be rewarded if I'm happy with it.

905
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,470
Where are you going, Miss?

906
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,810
♫I never anticipated that you would be there♫

907
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,230
Le Lake .

908
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,270
No problem.

909
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,990
♫My heart skips a beat♫

♫Don't know where to go♫

916

♫The moon has heard the wind rise♫

918
