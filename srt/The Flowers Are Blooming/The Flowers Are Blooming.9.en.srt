4
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,710
It doesn't hurt, right?

5
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,950
Luo.

6
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,550
Recently I have to

7
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,229
to draw draftings for Architect Li.

8
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,190
Let Meng Yuanxu push your wheelchair.

9
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,830
Do you have any places you want to go these days?

10
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,830
Tell Meng Yuanxu.

11
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,030
He will take you there.

12
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,350
Jing Ci Temple?

13
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,350
Go to Jing Ci Temple first.

14
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,220
Luo was badly injured in that house.

15
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,830
There must be evil spirit on her.

16
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,950
We must worship Buddha no matter what.

17
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,060
For safety.

18
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,669
Don't bother.

19
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,580
Mr. Lin's medicine is very effective.

20
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,870
In a few days,

21
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,190
I'll be able to walk again.

22
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,710
I think

23
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,910
it'll work.

24
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,310
But you can go to Lingfeng Temple, Shaoxing Temple

25
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,630
and Faxi Temple.

26
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,550
Why do you go to the remote Jing Ci Temple?

27
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,350
Master, you don't understand.

28
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,950
Jing Ci Temple is located on the hillside.

29
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,590
It's hard for people to go up or down the hill.

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,910
So it tests the sincerity of the people worshiping Buddha.

31
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,870
As the saying goes, if you wish really hard, maybe you'll get what you want.

32
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,780
Since we are going to pray for Luo’s safety,

33
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,390
we should let the Buddha see our sincerity.

34
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,390
Since it's so inconvenient,

35
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,950
maybe Luo doesn’t need to go there in person.

36
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,230
Master is right.

37
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,430
Luo should stay in the yard.

38
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,470
You and I go to pray for her.

39
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,510
Luo.

40
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,590
You can rest at home.

41
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,230
But Miss...

42
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,020
Mr. Li also got minor injuries.

43
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,510
I’ll invite them to come with us.

44
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,910
I...

45
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,350
No.

46
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,230
Mr. Luo.

47
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,270
Sincerity.

48
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,140
We've climbed the mountain and offered the incense.

49
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,030
If this is not called sincerity, it's not worth it.

50
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,270
Let's go.

51
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,790
Please bless Luo.

52
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,390
Luo will recover soon.

53
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,630
Bless Luo to recover soon.

54
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,060
I hope that everything goes well in Wood Feather House.

55
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,190
Bless Luo to recover soon.

56
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,510
Wood Feather House can be safe and smooth.

57
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,910
Bless Luo to be able to jump soon.

58
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,430
Bless everyone healthy. Very healthy.

59
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,710
Bless the wellbeing of the people of the Xiao Dynasty.

60
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,630
Bless His Majesty healthy.

61
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,350
Please bless us.

62
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,990
Sir,

63
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,750
please keep these eight amulets.

64
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,709
Thank you, Master.

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,550
I'll ask for another marriage amulet.

66
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,470
Marriage amulet is also called mandarin duck amulet.

67
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,310
There are two of them.

68
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,460
One for the man. The other for the woman.

69
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,190
They'll love each other after wearing it.

70
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,590
I have never heard of it.

71
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,590
What?

72
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,190
Xu said

73
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,750
his was from Jing Ci Temple.

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,190
Only your temple has it in Lin'an.

75
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,990
Some folk warlocks

76
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,670
like to give away this kind of amulet.

77
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,420
But Jing Ci Temple doesn't have any of it.

78
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,590
Xu was cheated.

79
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,430
Since you mentioned it,

80
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,150
I’ll say one more thing.

81
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,590
You are all lovers.

82
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,670
It’s fate and man’s will.

83
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,710
Your marriage will come true.

84
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,070
Take care.

85
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,950
Be careful.

86
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,270
Be careful. Be careful. Mr. Luo.

87
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,230
A little further.

88
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,070
Move forward.

89

This stone is stable.

96
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,630
Stand still.

97
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,950
Stand here. Don’t move.

98

No, I can walk by myself.

102
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,510
That's right. She can walk by herself.

103

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,170
♫Just let it pass by♫

175
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,900
♫The moon has seen my hair get lifted by the wind♫

176
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,900
♫It also knows what I hope most for the lengthy life♫

177
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,240
♫I have no courage to guess our ending♫

178
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,520
♫From dark night to dawn♫

179
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,910
♫Stars have sunk into the sea♫

180
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,930
♫And I only want to belong to you♫

181
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,070
Let's assume you were poisoned, too.

182
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,310
My sister.

183
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,950
No. Look at you.

184
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,550
You came out to get some fresh air in the middle of the night?

185
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,150
Brother.

186
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,630
I really can't let it go.

187
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,270
What? What?

188
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,670
If you really

189
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,390
If you really can't let it go,

190
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,030
just cry.

191
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,350
Here.

192
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,470
I made all these.

193
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,790
And give everyone one of them.

194
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,590
Li Qingfeng is so arrogant.

195
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,070
It's easier for him to be targeted by evil spirits.

196
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,070
Master is always with him.

197
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,070
It's too dangerous.

198
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,030
Sir.

199
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,190
You're still the same as when you were young.

200
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,190
When I was young?

201
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,350
Yes.

202
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,700
Have you forgotten

203
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,710
the time you and Miss in the Ministry of Works?

204
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,950
Yes. Together with you.

205
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,350
You followed Master the second time she came here.

206
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,750
At that time, you treated me as your enemy.

207
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,950
In order to play with Master,

208
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,950
I fought with you a lot.

209
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,950
I still remember it clearly.

210
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,790
Although you don't stop me now,

211
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,430
Li Qingfeng is between us now.

212
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,750
It's done.

213
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,710
Look.

214
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,630
Arrange the order and mark.

215
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,950
We can notify everyone to return to work tomorrow.

216
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,950
Brilliant.

217
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,390
If you take out every part separately,

218
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,830
it seems to be traditional.

219
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,060
But when they're combined, it's harmonious and unified.

220
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,190
It's so neat and beautiful.

221
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,510
This design is my own style.

222
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,150
Your style?

223
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,150
I remember you said

224
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,830
the Gold Building does not match your style.

225
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,670
And you criticized it as worthless.

226
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,470
I don't understand.

227
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,150
If it's not your style,

228
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,750
whose will it be?

229
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,550
You've seen it.

230
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,830
Me?

231
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,590
The gambler of the Gold Building?

232
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,830
My father.

233
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,350
Uncle?

234
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,710
What kind of misunderstanding is there between you two?

235
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,870
No misunderstanding.

236
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,550
But I don't want to see him.

237
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,870
I don't want to see his work.

238
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,830
Listen to me.

239
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,630
Father and son can't be strangers.

240
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,630
You should

241
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,350
go back to see your father more.

242
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,790
What if he

243
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,790
wants me to take you back to see him?

244
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,230
Again?

245
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,030
Luo.

246
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,670
Master, Miss.

247
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,230
Why are you here?

248
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,350
Sit down.

249
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,270
Master. Why are you blushing?

250
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,350
You...

251
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,590
It's because it's too stuffy in the room.

252
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,510
So I went to Luo for some fresh air.

253
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,950
Really?

254
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,430
What are you doing?

255
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,790
We're making a peach wood sword.

256
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,950
I'm making a copper cash sword for him.

257
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,510
I told you to find the craftsman.

258
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:42,990
But you're still here

259
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,710
and doing all this.

260
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,950
Architect Li has drawn the drafting.

261
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,910
We can return to work tomorrow.

262
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,510
You can't do this anymore.

263
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:50,830
Okay.

264
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,500
Miss Chen.

265
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,030
Miss Zhao! Miss Zhao!

266
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,990
Luo. Sit down.

267
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,220
Miss Zhao,

268
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,590
you've recovered?

269
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,830
I've recovered.

270
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,950
Thank you for your concern.

271
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,350
Li Qingfeng just finished the drafting and you came.

272
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,790
Your nose is so sharp.

273
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,390
But you are

274
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,780
always around Miss Chen.

275
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,630
It must be very convenient for you to frisk.

276
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,830
Why does it make me feel uncomfortable

277
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,350
when hearing what you just said?

278
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,820
No, little girl.

279
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,310
You mean I'm a dog?

280
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,900
She was just kidding.

281
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,950
Don't take it seriously.

282
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,190
I was not just kidding.

283
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,830
What do you mean?

284
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,190
Of course I envy you since you're in a favored position to get close to her.

285
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,550
If you're jealous,

286
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,710
you can move in.

287
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,510
This proposal is quite good.

288
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,310
Then you can move in.

289
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,910
Today.

290
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,590
Do you need my help?

291
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,230
Miss Zhao, you must be kidding.

292
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,630
Our Wood Feather House is so shabby.

293
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,990
How can you get used to living here?

294
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,470
Miss Chen is used to living here.

295
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,750
I can get used to it.

296
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,870
I was joking.

297
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,150
I'm busy with my family affairs.

298
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,990
I can't just

299
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,710
move in the Wood Feather House and ignore other affairs.

300
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,310
By the way, where is Li Qingfeng?

301
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,870
He's at Wood Feather Pavilion.

302
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,190
I'm leaving.

303
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,660
Why are you still here?

304
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,150
I told you to find the craftsman team.

305
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,110
Luo,

306
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,190
I'll leave the rest to you.

307
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,230
OK.

308
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,350
Tell me.

309
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,750
What's wrong with your face?

310
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,430
My face?

311
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,350
You should care about your legs.

312
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,790
You.

313
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,510
Goodness.

314
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,870
If you can't do it, don't force yourself.

315
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,670
Tomorrow is the first day of returning to work.

316
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,750
I'll do your job.

317
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,900
You don't need to go.

318
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,910
Just because it's the first day of returning to work,

319
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,550
I should go.

320
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,550
Besides,

321
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,390
after Mr. Lin's treatment these days,

322
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,190
I almost recover now.

323
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,670
Look.

324
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,710
Take a good rest today.

325
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,630
Okay?

326
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,190
We'll see how is your leg after we get there tomorrow.

327
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,110
If your leg still hurts,

328
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,060
just don't force yourself.

329
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,870
I won't agree.

330
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,950
Okay.

331
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,070
All right. You're the best.

332
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,310
Why are you back?

333
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,110
Miss Zhao,

334
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,670
Miss Chen said you've finished your drawing.

335
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,030
What are you doing?

336
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,590
I'm having fun.

337
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,030
Having fun?

338
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,590
You call this having fun?

339
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,700
Wood mechanism has nothing to do with work.

340
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,990
It's my hobby.

341
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,230
It's just for fun.

342
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,710
OK.

343
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,830
Let's not talk about this.

344
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,350
I heard you're returning to work tomorrow.

345
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,990
That Liao Mansion is so evil.

346
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,750
I can find some masters for you

347
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,070
to help you with your work.

348
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,750
If so,

349
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,830
the rumors of Liao Mansion will be getting worse.

350
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,750
We can't do this.

351
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,350
Right.

352
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,190
But as the owner,

353
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,310
I have to do something at this moment.

354
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,270
Miss Zhao.

355
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,830
Leave it alone.

356
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,870
Actually, I'm here to thank you.

357
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,790
Thank me?

358
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,550
If it weren't for you,

359
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,430
I would have died.

360
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,830
You're welcome, Miss Zhao.

361
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,550
I would do that

362
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,990
for anyone else from Wood Feather House.

363
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,430
I hope

364
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,430
I've never heard the noble words you just said.

365
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,030
Do you feel uncomfortable

366
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,829
because of my presence?

367
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,700
A little.

368
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,180
I really envy Miss Chen.

369
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,830
Miss,

370
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,270
I have something to ask you.

371
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,660
It may be a little disrespectful.

372
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,590
But I still want to ask.

373
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,590
We are on good terms.

374
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,630
Tell me what you don't dare to ask.

375
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,510
Don't scare me.

376
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,630
You...

377
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,350
Are you in love with Architect Li?

378
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,620
Why do you ask that?

379
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,940
Keep your voice down.

380
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,460
Recently, your relationship with Mr. Li

381
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,150
is different.

382
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,030
Besides,

383
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,030
when Miss. Zhao said she would move in,

384
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,590
your reaction was...

385
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,230
You're asking for a beating.

386
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,950
Do you want to be beaten? Please spare me.

387
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,950
I dare not.

388
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,670
All right, let me tell you.

389
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,190
I only tell you.

390
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,590
Don't tell anyone else.

391
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,830
I'm afraid other people than Mr. Meng,

392
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,510
everyone can see it.

393
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,980
Is it so obvious?

394
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,430
It's not obvious.

395
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,830
Just a little.

396
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,670
Hush. Hush.

397
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,770
[Liao's Mansion]

398
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,110
Come. Be careful.

399
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,870
Wait, wait, wait.

400
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,110
Come on.

401
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,070
One for each.

402
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,340
Here, Luo.

403
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,110
Thank you.

404
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,710
Miss Han.

405
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,350
Well.

406
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,390
Give me one.

407
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,230
Come on.

408
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,310
The more the better.

409
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,350
Wang Sheng.

410
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,350
I don't need it.

411
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,590
Forget it then.

412
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,110
Don't think you're great because you're good at martial arts.

413
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,030
No matter how great you are, can you be better than the hostess here?

414
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,710
Mr. Meng.

415
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,070
Let's not talk about it.

416
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,230
Li Qingfeng, you don’t want it, do you?

417
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,070
OK, master.

418
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,110
This is yours.

419
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,750
Take it.

420
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,830
Don’t be like Wang Sheng and Li Qingfeng.

421
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,590
Look.

422
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,110
Look what?

423
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,990
Are these the craftsmen you found?

424
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,350
Yes, they are.

425
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,950
What's wrong?

426
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,390
No.

427
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,550
I've found 18 people.

428
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,630
Why are there only three?

429
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,950
What about the others?

430
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,830
Yes. Where are the others?

431
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,030
Wake up.

432
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,180
Get up.

433
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,190
The officer is here.

434
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,990
What about the others?

435
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,340
Yes. Officer.

436
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,100
Yesterday, you took 18 of us

437
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,870
to see the scene.

438
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,230
Yes, but...

439
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,790
It went well, didn't it?

440
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,830
You all said yes.

441
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,630
What's going on now?

442
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,580
Nothing happened in the first place.

443
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,990
But on our way back,

444
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,190
Zhang, who was telling jokes,

445
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,030
suddenly had a stroke and fell on the ground.

446
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,030
After we took him home,

447
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,190
Zhang couldn't get off the bed.

448
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,790
His wife hired a few doctors.

449
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,220
Later, she invited another doc to check it out.

450
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,110
They can't tell anything as well.

451
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,860
Ridiculous!

452
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,310
So they don't want to take this job anymore.

453
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,710
They asked me

454
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,340
to return the deposit,

455
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,470
and to apologize to you.

456
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,550
Do you think

457
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,870
I care about the deposit?

458
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,990
It's about credibility.

459
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,230
Credibility. Do you understand?

460
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,870
Qingfeng.

461
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,510
What should we do now?

462
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,110
Just let the three do it.

463
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,620
I never believe

464
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,870
the existence of ghosts and gods.

465
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,990
What are you looking at?

466
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,030
I did all these

467
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,790
just for you

468
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,030
cowards.

469
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,110
I want you to have some confidence.

470
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,270
I didn't expect it to be like this.

471
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,110
You really let me down.

472
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,190
Do you believe that

473
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,780
no one would dare to

474
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,830
hire them anymore in Li'an city?

475
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,180
You three, contact them now.

476
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,790
I need to

477
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,030
see them all in 2 hours.

478
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,950
Except for the one who had a stroke.

479
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,070
Let him use the money to get treated.

480
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,230
I'll investigate this matter thoroughly.

481
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,030
Officer.

482
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,830
We are not familiar with them.

483
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,510
Please don't make it difficult for us.

484
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,300
No need.

485
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,750
The initial renovation scale is not large.

486
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,950
Only the main house.

487
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,390
These three people

488
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,510
and us

489
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,630
are enough.

490
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,590
Besides,

491
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,860
thank you for coming as scheduled.

492
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,870
After the work,

493
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,230
I'll pay you another wage.

494
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,870
Thank you. Officer.

495
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,710
Only the three of them. And us?

496
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,070
Is it enough?

497
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:51,870
Yes.

498
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,630
Get back to work.

499
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:54,830
OK.

500
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,350
Let's go.

501
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,110
Although we don't have enough people,

502
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,390
but we have to work.

503
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,630
Because only in this way

504
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,110
can we stop the public from spreading rumors.

505
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,830
Then we can recruit craftsmen.

506
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,540
So I hope you can understand.

507
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,190
Everyone should work hard.

508
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,390
Stop nagging.

509
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,110
Just tell me.

510
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,230
What should I do?

511
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,950
Officer.

512
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,190
Luo and you take the craftsmen

513
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,470
to repair the walls and mow the grass in the yard.

514
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,180
All weeds, bricks and stones

515
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,950
should be cleared away.

516
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,390
Luo, take care of yourself.

517
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,830
Thank you for your concern.

518
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,870
Don't worry.

519
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,030
I'm here.

520
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,230
I won’t let Luo get tired.

521
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,230
Be careful.

522
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,230
Don't worry.

523
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,630
Master, if anything happens to you,

524
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,710
call me immediately. I will protect you.

525
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,310
Luo.

526
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,870
Thank you for helping me.

527
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,230
Be careful.

528
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,700
You two.

529
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,390
The rest

530
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,190
is the renovation of the main hall and the bedroom.

531
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,310
This is the renovation draft.

532
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,790
Everyone,

533
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,110
today,

534
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,350
members of Zi Yan Opera House are here to congratulate

535
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,390
the returning work ceremony of Wood Feather House.

536
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,870
After a moment,

537
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,660
our leading actress Su Huanjing will

538
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,590
perform Love of Butterfly by Shang tone.

539
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,870
If you want to enjoy it,

540
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,510
you can go in the mansion to watch.

541
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,710
Free of charge.

542
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,790
Everyone, please.

543
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,150
Good morning, everyone.

544
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,710
Let me introduce.

545
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,190
This is

546
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,350
the leading actress of Zi Yan Opera House, Miss Su.

547
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,340
I invited her to perform for you as my congratulation.

548
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,190
She'll perform Love of Butterfly by Shang tone in the courtyard later.

549
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,550
While you're working,

550
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,070
you can take a look.

551
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,830
So it wouldn't be so boring and exhausting.

552
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,630
Zhao Yi'ning.

553
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,550
Good for you.

554
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,430
You managed to invite Su Huanjing.

555
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,030
I’m the boss of Zi Yan Opera House.

556
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,180
Why can't I invite her?

557
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,670
OK.

558
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,350
Half Lin'an City is almost yours.

559
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,190
It's the first day of work. The more the merrier.

560
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,150
Miss Zhao, I know what you want.

561
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,620
But when we work,

562
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,910
we need to be very focused.

563
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,510
So, please ask them to go back.

564
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,590
Look, this is our architect.

565
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,070
See? He’s hard to serve.

566
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,870
Li Qingfeng, I’m being kind.

567
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,110
You see,

568
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,630
there were supposed to be 18 people today. Only three are left.

569
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,180
We can't afford any more accidents.

570
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,990
Otherwise, the rumor about the mansion getting worse

571
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,990
is exactly what the spreader wants.

572
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,910
On the contrary,

573
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,950
with so many people working with us,

574
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,790
I believe that the person who spread it

575
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,750
dare not to act rashly again.

576
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,110
OK. It's the first day of work.

577
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,030
It's good to have fun.

578
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,030
Fine.

579
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,270
Miss Su, please perform in the front yard.

580
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,070
How about that?

581
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,350
You only listen to Miss Chen.

582
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,070
Come on. Please.

583
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,910
Don't go. Don't go.

584
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:17,950
Let's go. Let's go.

585
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,470
Be careful.

586
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,870
Put it there. Put it there.

587
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,030
Be careful.

588
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,110
Let me do this.

589
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,550
After tiding it,

590
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,310
this mansion is getting more and more clean.

591
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,470
Rumors will be scotched.

592
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,070
Am I right, Mr. Liao?

593
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,910
Yes.

594
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,750
I really appreciate that.

595
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,900
Thank you.

596
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,150
The preliminary

597
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,150
is done today.

598
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,150
Right, Qingfeng?

599
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,350
This is just a preliminary plan.

600
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,470
The follow-up is the key part. Don't slack off.

601
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,310
At least we're safe these days.

602
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,550
Nothing happened.

603
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,230
If we need more people,

604
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,150
we can hire some to work.

605
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,950
That's great. That's great.

606
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,150
But the sooner it is done, the better.

607
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,350
It might be tiring these days.

608
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,950
It's too early to say finishing it.

609
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,470
Miss Zhao, what do you mean?

610
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,620
The Zhang who had a stroke on his way home

611
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,350
fell asleep safely after the treatment last night.

612
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,710
But he didn't wake up this morning.

613
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,070
Dead?

614
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,550
He's not dead, but it's almost the same.

615
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,190
What happened?

616
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,550
He became a living dead.

617
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,830
He can still breathe.

618
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,020
But he's unconscious.

619
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,340
Did other doctors go to see him?

620
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,270
I asked all famous doctors in Lin'an.

621
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,350
They all said that unless a miracle happens,

622
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,270
otherwise, he will never wake up again.

623
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,190
This disease, in the medical literature,

624
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,790
I remember it's called

625
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,390
catalepsy.

626
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,270
But not everyone

627
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,950
is as knowledgeable as Miss Chen.

628
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,910
Now it's all over the city.

629
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,030
They said Zhang saw the white shadow in the mansion.

630
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,540
He was so scared that his body was stiff,

631
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,830
and can't wake up again.

632
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,830
Now,

633
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,030
the story is getting more complicated.

634
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,550
So now, let alone hire new craftsmen,

635
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,230
I'm afraid the three of them wouldn't come here again.

636
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,710
Well, Mr. Li,

637
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,070
what should we do?

638
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,310
If he really saw the white shadow...

639
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,110
I mean

640
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,910
if someone dressed up as the white shadow,

641
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,230
Zhang was probably murdered by him on purpose.

642
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,550
Murdered on purpose?

643
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,260
Why did the murderer want to kill Zhang on purpose?

644
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,510
If all the previous things were done by humans,

645
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,150
the purpose of killing Zhang

646
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,190
is to confirm

647
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,430
the rumors of this mansion.

648
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,110
From the result of the discussion on the street,

649
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,830
that's possible.

650
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,550
But what is his purpose?

651
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,350
Why did he hurt an innocent man?

652
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,300
Mr. Liao, have you offended anyone?

653
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,030
I...

654
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,670
He may not offend anyone.

655
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,990
Maybe it was because someone with ulterior motives

656
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,950
wanted to lower the price of Mr. Liao's mansion.

657
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,100
That's why he did this.

658
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,590
No.

659
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,830
Not a human.

660
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,350
It's "she".

661
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,230
It must be her.

662
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,310
It's Miao Hongdou. It's Miao Hongdou.

663
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,430
Mr. Liao.

664
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,350
Miao Hongdou, it must be Miao Hongdou.

665
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,390
Miao Hongdou.

666
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,150
Come out!

667
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,710
Come out if you dare!

668
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,220
Come out!

669
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,790
Mr. Liao, calm down.

670
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,030
How can I calm down?

671
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,430
I can't stand it anymore.

672
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,310
I can't stand it anymore.

673
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,870
We'll figure out the truth.

674
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,590
But we still need your cooperation

675
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,860
to complete the "play".

676
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,390
How can I cooperate?

677
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,070
Yes, Wang Sheng.

678
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,630
Can you finish your words in one go?

679
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,110
I see.

680
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,070
Now you understand again?

681
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,790
If we want to scotch all kinds of rumors,

682
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,390
the landlord's moving back is the most effective way.

683
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,430
Yes.

684
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,750
I'll move back?

685
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,340
No, no, no.

686
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,950
I can't move back.

687
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,190
Yes.

688
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,310
If that person wants to prove the rumor,

689
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,990
Mr. Liao's moving back

690
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,260
is what that person cannot tolerate.

691
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,670
He will definitely show up.

692
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,110
Then we’ll wait for him.

693
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,630
That's a good idea.

694
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,590
I'm afraid it's not a human.

695
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,950
Did you hear me?

696
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,190
I can't move back.

697
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,870
Mr. Liao.

698
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,110
If you want us

699
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,190
to keep doing this work smoothly,

700
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,630
then we must solve the problem.

701
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,510
What are you doing?

702
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,350
Mr. Liao, do you trust us?

703
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,710
I do.

704
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,950
OK, then listen to me.

705
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,390
Just move back.

706
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,870
Don't be afraid. It'll be fine.

707
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,630
Miss, no one would come, right?

708
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,060
Relax. So many people are here.

709
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,990
There's nothing to be afraid of.

710
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,550
Coming.

711
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,110
Oh my god, it's really a female ghost.

712
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,190
Did you see that?

713
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,830
That's qing gong.

714
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,350
Whose qing gong is as masterly as that? It's... flying...

715
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:53,670
If you don't believe me,

716
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,350
let's make a bet.

717
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,470
Well...

718
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,830
Fine, I'm not afraid.

719
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,900
Come on.

720
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,340
Excuse me.

721
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,350
Where is the ghost?

722
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,990
Are you mistaken about that?

723
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,910
How could it be?

724
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,510
How could we mistake it at the same time?

725
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,630
Maybe she's already inside.

726
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,990
Impossible.

727
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,350
Around the house,

728
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,630
there are small bells put by us everywhere.

729
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,990
Unless he opens the roof directly.

730
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,230
Oh no, Li Qingfeng.

731
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,950
Liao Shisan.

732
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,380
Give me back my life!

733
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,750
Don't let her run away.

734
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,750
Qinghe.

735
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,550
How could it be you?

736
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,310
It's you, little lady, who acts like a ghost.

737
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,590
Do you know how many people you've hurt?

738
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,380
It turns out

739
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,990
you're scaring other people in this mansion.

740
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,230
It's me.

741
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,780
Why did you do that?

742
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,070
I want revenge!

743
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,550
Revenge?

744
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,390
Which one of us has a grudge against you?

745
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,230
It must be Mr. Liao.

746
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,950
Luo! Miss Han!

747
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,710
I'm sorry.

748
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,830
Your injuries were

749
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,590
caused by me.

750
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,190
It's really you.

751
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,990
What about the bookshelf? You did that too?

752
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,070
I designed it, but I didn't do it.

753
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,190
I didn't expect you to come at night.

754
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,790
Who else could it be?

755
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,510
Maybe it was an accident.

756
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,270
But..

757
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,910
What about the carpenter Zhang?

758
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,510
I didn't do that to him.

759
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,230
It was just a coincidence.

760
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,550
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

761
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,750
I just want to create some small accidents

762
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,670
to make them shrink back.

763
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,150
As for Miss Han and Miss Luo's situation,

764
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,670
I didn't control it well.

765
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,710
I still feel guilty.

766
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,950
Qinghe, I don't blame you.

767
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,430
Since the first time I met you,

768
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,390
I felt very close to you.

769
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,950
Although you don't talk much,

770
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,310
But I can feel that you're not a bad person.

771
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,350
Thank you. Luo.

772
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,550
Tell us if you have any difficulties.

773
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,430
We will help you.

774
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,270
Luo is right.

775
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,550
Miss, if you really have your reasons,

776
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,830
you can tell us.

777
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,750
All of us will help you.

778
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,190
Yes.

779
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,469
If you feel wronged,

780
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,670
I will make it right for you.

781
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,389
But don't make up and lie to us,

782
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,750
or I won't forgive you.

783
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,590
I was planning to pay with my life tonight.

784
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,270
But unexpectedly...

785
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,469
Pay with your life?

786
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,310
Yes, my sister.

787
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,510
My sister was killed by Liao Shisan.

788
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,590
How could this happen?

789
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,190
My sister suffered a lot.

790
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,350
She was pregnant several times but miscarried.

791
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,150
Liao Shisan thought my sister as a jinx.

792
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,710
He abandoned her and had an affair with Jiang.

793
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,030
You jinx!

794
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,310
Making a fuss, huh?

795
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,429
Making a fuss?

796
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,949
I must be blind.

797
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:55,830
Why did I marry you?!

798
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,670
Let me tell you. Miao Hongdou.

799
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,030
I will marry Jiang,

800
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,230
no matter what you do.

801
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,620
Are you going to divorce me?

802
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,470
You're right.

803
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,190
I want to divorce you.

804
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,430
If it weren't for the property

805
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,670
you inherited from your dead parents,

806
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,070
how could I marry

807
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,630
a willful woman like you?

808
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,110
That doesn't matter.

809
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,070
If you can bear a baby boy for my family,

810
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,350
maybe I can bear to spend more years with you.

811
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,310
But you can't.

812
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,510
If you can't give birth, you can only blame yourself.

813
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,150
Jiang can do it?

814
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,310
Let me tell you.

815
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,750
Even without Jiang, I will divorce you.

816
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,150
OK. We can get a divorce.

817
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,030
But you won't get my money.

818
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,710
I won't give it to you even if you kill me.

819
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,550
You won't? You won't?

820
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,270
You...

821
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,990
You won't?!

822
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,270
You won't?! You won't?!

823
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,590
Liao Shisan

824
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,390
beat my sister up every few days.

825
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,630
He also had an affair with Jiang...

826
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,230
He also had an affair with Jiang

827
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,300
in front of my sister.

828
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,270
One day, my sister can't bear it anymore.

829
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,150
She argued with them.

830
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,150
Liao Shisan was so angry.

831
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,550
Then he killed my sister.

832
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,070
Where are you going?

833
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,030
To your heart.

834
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,190
Where are you going?

835
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,270
Yes, go to my heart.

836
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,670
Go to my heart, go to my heart.

837
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,950
What are you doing here?

838
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,110
Why I'm here?

839
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,070
Go to hell!

840
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,470
Didn't I tell you?

841
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,230
As long as you give me your property,

842
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,230
I can divorce you.

843
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,510
Otherwise, I'll beat you every day.

844
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,150
As I said,

845
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,870
you can't get my money.

846
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,510
Fine.

847
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,630
I'll sell the mansion and the inn.

848
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,270
By then, all the money will be transported back to Jinling.

849
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,980
You'll never get the money.

850
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,230
What did you say?

851
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,470
What did you say?

852
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,820
What did you say?

853
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,390
Beat her!

854
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,070
You jinx! How dare you hit me?

855
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,110
Give it to me. Give it to me.

856
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,470
Give it to me. Strike her to death.

857
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,630
Give it or not?

858
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,430
Give it or not?

859
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,350
He wanted to occupy the inn and the mansion.

860
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,390
No.

861
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,790
Liao Shisan said the mansion and the inn

862
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,430
were earned by them together.

863
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,870
He's shameless. He lied.

864
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,430
But you came to Lin'an

865
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,230
after Hongdou passed away.

866
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,030
How did you know that?

867
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,950
Liao Shisan's evil deeds

868
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,620
were written in the letters from my sister.

869
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,380
As for his murder of my sister,

870
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,390
I learned it

871
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,990
once I eavesdropped on his conversation with Jiang.

872
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,630
If you know the truth,

873
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,670
why didn't you report it to the police?

874
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,670
Yes, just call the police.

875
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,950
I'll put him in jail.

876
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,110
If what you said is true,

877
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,870
I'll behead him.

878
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,980
I'm afraid there's no evidence.

879
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,630
Yes, I have no evidence.

880
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,550
That's why I came up with this idea.

881
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,590
Firstly,

882
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,270
the mansion and the inn won't be sold,

883
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,510
so their wedding will be canceled.

884
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,150
Secondly, I wanted to scare him to death.

885
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,390
Even if I can't scare him to death,

886
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,550
I will find a chance to take revenge.

887
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,980
I'll kill him for my sister.

888
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,670
After my parents passed away,

889
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,830
she was the only family I have

890
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,870
in the world.

891
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,790
But Liao Shisan

892
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,270
lied to her.

893
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,750
She took the property left by our parents

894
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,460
and went to Lin'an with him.

895
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,590
But she didn't know

896
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,190
Liao Shisan is a scumbag.

897
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,350
He hung around in brothels and casino every day.

898
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,990
My sister was really blind.

899
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,710
So she ended up like that.

900
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,430
Do you think I should take revenge?

901
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,390
Should I?

902
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,270
So in order to take revenge,

903
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,070
you learned martial arts.

904
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,350
When I was nine,

905
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,110
she planned to take me to Lin'an.

906
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,910
But Liao Shisan thought I'm a drag,

907
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,510
and left me to the neighbors.

908
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,830
Uncle used to be a martial artist.

909
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,070
They raised me and taught me martial arts.

910
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,630
My sister sent me some money every month,

911
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,150
but was beaten by Liao Shisan because of this.

912
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,590
Liao Shisan is so cruel.

913
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,150
How about this?

914
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,470
I will ask my father to

915
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,670
arrest Mr. Liao.

916
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,020
He will confess after being tortured.

917
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,030
I've heard that Mr. Meng is an upright man.

918
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,790
He will never allow

919
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,350
you to torture him.

920
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,990
What should we do?

921
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,510
We can't arrest him without evidence.

922
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,230
Do you want him to be at large?

923
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,550
Miss,

924
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,750
your sister has passed away for over a year.

925
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,310
It's a bit difficult for us

926
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,230
to find evidence.

927
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,990
But we can find another way.

928
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,110
Let him confess himself.

929
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,850
