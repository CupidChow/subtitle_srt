[Episode 7]

4
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,630
I can't believe that after all these days,

5
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,580
you still haven't left the city yet.

6
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,310
Yun was the head of the Imperial Guards.

7
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,590
We tried to elope,

8
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,300
and my father asked the imperial guards to find us in the name of military law.

9
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,310
General Yan Guang has made a big deal out of it

10
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,550
and intended to capture Yun and subject him to military punishment.

11
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,270
They've been looking for us across the city.

12
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,990
We just can't get out of here.

13
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,310
Yun and I

14
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,470
were almost captured by the Le Lake.

15
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,350
They've followed us here

16
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,310
and cordoned off all exits

17
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,110
within the perimeter of five miles.

18
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,910
At this moment, Yan Guang and his men are searching for us.

19
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,510
I think they will find where we are within two hours.

20
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,870
Two hours.

21
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,990
It's a serious crime to harbor military criminals.

22
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,110
My father can't even protect them.

23
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,230
Meng Yuanxu, what about some compassion?

24
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,829
Please take care of Yun for me.

25
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,300
I'll go and check it out.

26
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,550
Once I find an opportunity,

27
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,990
we'll leave immediately.

28
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,230
You just said

29
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,150
the Imperial Guards are going all out to catch you.

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,870
If you just go out like this,

31
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,790
they'll find you right away.

32
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,550
That's right, Brother Zhou.

33
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,190
But we can't just stay here and do nothing.

34
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,110
If it's time for us to depart forever tonight,

35
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,750
remember,

36
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,310
with you in my life,

37
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,350
I have no regrets.

38
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,190
What are you talking about?

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,750
You're both fine now.

40
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,510
You can either hide somewhere or leave this city.

41
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,750
We will definitely find a solution.

42
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,590
Qingfeng, do you have any idea?

43
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,470
They can hide for a while,

44
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,820
but not for ever.

45
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,390
We have to find a way to send them out of the city.

46
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,470
What's so hard about that?

47
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,860
Li Qingfeng, Luo Ye, Wang Sheng and General can work together.

48
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,710
And I'll be the commander.

49
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,790
It'll be easy to for us to break through the siege, right?

50
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,790
That's too risky.

51
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,829
Mr. Meng, you underestimate the Imperial Guards.

52
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,910
They can't get out of the city so easiy.

53
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,870
We have to find another solution.

54
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,470
Is there a better way now?

55
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,870
They can't escape even if they have wings.

56
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,310
They don't need wings to fly!

57
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,710
This is a sky lantern.

58
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,660
Master, you can put a prayer note on it.

59
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,420
But General is as strong as a bull.

60
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,430
I'm afraid he's not able to fly even with sky lanterns covered all over his body.

61
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,149
Miss Chen, you mean

62
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,190
we should make a sky lantern that can carry people?

63
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,029
It's a pine lantern.

64
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,270
I read about it

65
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,110
in an old book.

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,470
In ancient times, there was a person called Qing Qi Niang,

67
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,390
who made this lantern.

68
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,990
Li Qingfeng, do you know it?

69
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,350
I've heard about it.

70
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,070
It was made for military use before.

71
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,950
Are you sure this pine lantern

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,830
is strong enough to carry people?

73
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,670
I tried to make one before.

74
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,700
But

75
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,670
I didn't have the right material for the hot-air balloon

76
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,909
and therefore didn't finish it.

77
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,430
I remember that.

78
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,909
you asked me to find

79
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,670
pig skin, silk and linen.

80
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,150
So you were trying to make a sky lantern!

81
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,390
The hot-air balloon of this lantern

82
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,790
should be made with light and airtight materials.

83
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,950
If we replace the materials you tried

84
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,909
by using grease paper and silk,

85
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,550
it may work.

86
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,750
Silk is light and grease paper is tight.

87
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,790
That's a good idea.

88
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,830
Why didn't I think of it?

89
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,230
Let's do it then.

90
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,030
There's no time to lose.

91
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,430
Let's make it work.

92
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,220
Get out of the way!

93
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,150
Here.

94
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,140
Move!

95
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,230
It's rising.

96
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,750
We made it.

97
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,430
The big light rises!

98
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,590
I can't believe we made it.

99
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,390
What big pine lantern?

100
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,750
Mr. Luo, can’t you put it in a nicer way?

101
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,350
How nice do you want me to name it?

102
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,140
The ancient book that recorded the lantern is incomplete.

103
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,550
And I didn't finish the one I made before.

104
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,750
So it doesn't have an official name.

105
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,750
But now that you made it, we should give it a name.

106
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,870
There are sky lanterns.

107
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,190
Why don't we call it moon lantern?

108
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,430
No, no, no.

109
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,830
Without Qingfeng,

110
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,790
we wouldn't have made it.

111
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,190
So let's call it breeze and moon lantern.

112
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,190
No.

113
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:52,870
Why not?

114
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,310
I said no.

115
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,750
Why?

116
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,350
All right.

117
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,470
Stop arguing.

118
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,990
We made this lantern for Miss Liu.

119
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,660
I don't care about other things.

120
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,030
Mr. Luo is right.

121
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,030
You helped too.

122
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,510
And I don't want to take advantage of you.

123
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,550
Then let's call it

124
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,070
light moon lantern.

125
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,110
Alright.

126
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,950
Light moon lantern. That's a good name.

127
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,510
Are they ready?

128
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,510
They will be soon.

129
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,860
OK.

130
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,430
Then let's send them out of the city.

131
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,909
Do whatever it takes

132
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,470
to find them!

133
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,470
Yes, sir!

134
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,230
Find them!

135
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,430
You two go over there.

136
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,310
These imperial guards are determined

137
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,550
to catch Miss Liu and General.

138
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,390
What if we get caught?

139
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,550
Don't worry.

140
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:49,710
They have no evidence against us.

141
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,990
Everything will be fine.

142
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,190
Besides, I’m here.

143
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,750
I will protect you, Miss Han.

144
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,350
Give me your hand.

145

What are you doing?

146
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,950
We have to pretend to be Miss Liu and General.

147
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,180
So we should put up a good act.

148
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,430
Come on.

149

Excuse me. Come on.

General Zhou, why didn't you surrender earlier?

You don't have to end up like this.

For what?

344
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,390
Are you stupid? There's a river outside.

345
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,870
The closest water is right outside the gate.

346
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,470
If you don't open the gate now, the fire will get worse!

347
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,180
Mr. Meng is right.

348
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,940
Open the city gate. Come on.

349
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,110
Let's go.

350
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,830
Wait.

351
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,870
The water level of the river is too low.

352
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,270
I'll find a few buckets and ropes.

353
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,590
I know where they are. Follow me!

354
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,110
Hurry up. Come on.

355
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,220
Let's go together.

356
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,390
You guys, come with me.

357
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,070
Hurry up.

358
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,430
According to Architect Li's instructions,

359
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,820
there are two horses waiting for you

360
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,750
three miles from the southwest of the city.

361
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,190
Please say thank you

362
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,870
to Architect Li, Miss Chen

363
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,030
and every one in Wood Feather.

364
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,830
We're indebted to you and will return the favor.

365
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,910
Take care.

366
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,390
Let's go.

367
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,870
Li Qingfeng.

368
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,750
Do you flirt with every girl you meet?

369
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,230
If you're referring to Miss Zhao,

370
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,190
just say it.

371
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,109
If I really asked about her.

372
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,150
would you tell me the truth?

373
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,430
It's true that dark dust follows the horse.

374
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,589
And moon light shines on thee.

375
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,630
The lantern is going to land.

376
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:32,990
Let's go.

377
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,830
Hurry up. This way.

378
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,030
Come on!

379
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,830
Over there.

380
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,310
Good.

381
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,110
Very good.

382
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,950
Your Excellency, they're not the ones we're looking for.

383
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:02,990
Arrest them!

384
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,350
Why did you arrest us?

385
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,430
Why?

386
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,630
Because you

387
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,990
harbored the criminals and helped them escape, which is a crime as well.

388
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,750
You're better at lying. Talk to them.

389
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,550
No, I can't. I...

390
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,030
What are you talking about?

391
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,550
You must be kidding.

392
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,150
We are just carpenters

393
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,750
and good citizens.

394
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,310
You can't frame us.

395
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,670
How dare you!

396
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,470
Your Excellency, don't.

397
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,030
We have no evidence.

398
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,670
You've planned very well for their escape.

399
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,950
How dare you accuse me of framing you?

400
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,270
This is outrageous.

401
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,550
He is right.

402
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,790
The only thing we did wrong

403
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,190
is that we took the lantern,

404
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,230
and something went wrong about it.

405
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,030
So

406
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,550
we accidentally left the city.

407
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,030
If you want to convict us because of that,

408
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,390
arrest us then.

409
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,230
Your Excellency,

410
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,700
they are stalling us here.

411
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,020
If we go back now,

412
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,230
maybe we still have a chance to find Miss Liu and General Zhou.

413
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,790
Let's go.

414
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,430
Your Excellency.

415
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,020
If you are to go back,

416
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,430
take us with you.

417
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,910
Since you love to go out of the city so much,

418
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,950
just stay here.

419
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,230
Your Excellency.

420
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,780
Stop pretending.

421
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,980
I'm not.

422
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,510
It’s getting late and we're in the wild.

423
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,670
What if there are predators

424
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,110
or villains here?

425
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,990
What if we're killed here?

426
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,780
In that case, the predators will eat me

427
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,310
and villains will kill me first.

428
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,470
Stop it!

429
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,300
Don't jinx it.

430
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,030
Let's go.

431
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,030
Where are we going?

432
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,990
To find an inn.

433
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,710
There's no inn here!

434
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,470
Then we'll have to spend the night in the wild.

435
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,470
In the wild?

436
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,420
It's so cold. I'm not gonna sleep here.

437
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,390
It's not that cold.

438
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,550
Or we can sleep in a cave

439
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,470
together.

440
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,110
I'm not going to sleep in a cave.

441
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,780
Come on.

442
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,950
No!

443
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,310
Let's go.

444
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,550
I’m leaving.

445
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,270
Li Qingfeng.

446
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,470
What are you doing?

447
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,790
Listen.

448
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,790
They'll definitely ask us

449
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,310
what happened last night.

450
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,390
You can tell them everything

451
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,790
except the fact that we were sleeping in a cave.

452
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,750
You must keep it a secret.

453
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,020
Just tell them that we stayed in a post.

454
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,550
We don't have to do that.

455
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,510
Just do as I say!

456
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,710
You're so annoying.

457
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,790
Coming.

458
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,780
Breakfast.

459
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,950
This is...

460
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,030
Luo always prepares breakfast for you.

461
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,310
But we just came back.

462
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,110
I'm afraid that you don't have anything to eat.

463
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,390
So when I had breakfast,

464
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,950
I dropped by to buy you porridge and pastries.

465
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,390
Porridge and pastries.

466
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,550
That's a light meal.

467
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,790
Did you really drop by to buy these?

468
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,670
Hurry up and eat.

469
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,110
I'm going back to work.

470
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,390
Wait.

471
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,030
These are from Zhang's restaurant in North Street.

472
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,230
It's my favorite

473
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,390
within five kilometers.

474
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,790
Luo often buys food from there for me.

475
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,790
But I remember

476
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,990
the restaurant you like is in South Street.

477
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,790
So did you really drop by to buy these?

478
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,790
If you want to show your care for me,

479
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,300
be bold

480
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,550
and be frank.

481
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,390
Also,

482
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,990
the chairs and hairpins you gave me.

483
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,670
And these

484
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,110
bowls and chopsticks that can't be broken.

485
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,390
It's quite obvious.

486
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,910
But you're still reluctant to say it.

487
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,670
Also,

488
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,950
the breakfast you bought.

489
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,870
A bowl of porridge and a few pastries.

490
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,390
Why didn't you buy more?

491
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,300
They are not enough

492
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,310
and make you look petty.

493
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,190
Too much breakfast can cause stomach disease.

494
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,110
I'm not talking about stomach disease.

495
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,230
I've never been nice to anyone.

496
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,310
I don't know what to do exactly.

497
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,190
So,

498
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,710
if you are unhappy with anything I do,

499
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,150
just let me know.

500
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,030
I will keep it in mind.

501
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,030
Never been nice to anyone.

502
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,020
That's so sweet.

503
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,150
All right, all right. I got it.

504
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,870
Shall we eat the breakfast together?

505
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,710
You're back, Miss!

506
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,270
Mr. Li.

507
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,310
Sorry.

508
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,910
The door was open, so...

509
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:30,510
Miss, why is your lipstick...

510
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,830
It's...

511
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,190
What is this?

512
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,750
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

513
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,390
I thought you did it on purpose.

514
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,900
Go! Get out! Get out!

515
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,910
What's wrong?

516
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:50,790
You...

517
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,790
Stop it.

518
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,230
Is it better this way?

519
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,750
That's what happened.

520
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,790
After sending Miss Liu and General out of the city,

521
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,470
I found the horses for them.

522
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,150
But I don't know where they went after that.

523
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,630
They must be heading for the border.

524
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,950
For them,

525
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,350
escaping is just the beginning.

526
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,350
More problems await them when they arrive at the border.

527
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,070
Our help is only the first step.

528
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,470
What will happen in the future

529
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,100
is up to them.

530
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,070
Qingfeng.

531
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,150
Qingfeng?

532
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,630
Alright.

533
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,780
Anyway,

534
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,070
we live up to

535
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,750
Miss Liu’s trust.

536
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,590
They also live up to

537
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,990
their love for each other.

538
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,350
That's enough.

539
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,830
Mr. Luo is right.

540
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,430
I always believe that lovers

541
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,750
will live happily ever after.

542
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,910
No difficulties and obstacles

543
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,940
will do them apart.

544
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,550
They are happy together.

545
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,460
But I spent the whole night putting out the fire.

546
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,750
I had to pay the compensation and went home to receive punishment.

547
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,980
This is so not fair.

548
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,070
Mr. Meng,

549
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,990
we couldn't have made it without you.

550
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,820
Stop it.

551
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,910
Let me ask you.

552
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,310
You and Master were outside the city last night.

553
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,510
Where did you stay?

554
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,230
That's right.

555
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,150
After we talked about Miss Liu and General,

556
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:10,790
let's talk about

557
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,150
our two architects.

558
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,590
Where did you

559
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,350
stay last night?

560
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,590
- An inn. - A post.

561
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,910
Li Qingfeng.

562
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,940
You are an adult.

563
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,700
You can't even distinguish between an inn and a post?

564
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,390
Are you sure it's not a post?

565
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,630
It’s both an inn and a post.

566
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,340
Is there such a thing?

567
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,510
Of course there is.

568
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,670
All right. All right.

569
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,310
Anyway,

570
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,670
it's good that nothing went wrong.

571
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,150
Miss Liu's project

572
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,030
is officially done now.

573
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,390
Next, I will find

574
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,230
another project for us to do.

575
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,950
I will find

576
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,830
a work that'll bring us easy money.

577
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,580
Go out and knock on the door.

578
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,390
I'm not going out.

579
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,310
Let me ask you.

580
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,390
Last night,

581
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,270
nothing happened between you and my master?

582
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,150
Let's have a man-to-man talk.

583
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,030
What do you mean by

584
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,830
a man-to-man talk?

585
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,590
You'll answer what I ask you.

586
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,310
I always answer

587
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,670
the questions you ask me.

588
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,710
So you are a man.

589
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,100
No!

590
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,550
Actually, I only have one question.

591
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,790
Li Qingfeng, did you...

592
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,550
Did you already do it

593
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,670
with my master?

594
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,910
No.

595
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,710
Really?

596
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,870
I knew it.

597
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,910
I'll tell you what.

598
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,950
I've been having a crush on my master since I was nine.

599
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,110
She's the love of my life.

600
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,870
No one can take her away from me.

601
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,270
You have every right to pursue your love.

602
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,550
But Architect Chen is not a wood,

603
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,660
or a doll.

604
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,470
She's not an object for people to fight for.

605
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,950
Her happiness should be decided by herself.

606
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:06,830
Right?

607
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,270
If that's all you have to say,

608
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,230
you can continue to pursue your love,

609
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,270
or do some homework on architecture.

610
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,150
I'm busy.

611
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,940
Anyway, I won't stop here.

612
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,870
I don't care

613
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,750
if you like her or not.

614
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,390
I don't give a damn about it!

615
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:24,950
Wait.

616
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:26,990
Close the door.

617
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,710
I'm taking today off.

618
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,550
I'd like to go to Yi Mu Restaurant.

619
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,230
Then go for it.

620
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,110
What are you doing here?

621
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,150
There are poetry, paintings and wine there.

622
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,630
So?

623
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,070
I want to invite you there with me.

624
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,070
Bro, you're acting weird today.

625
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,950
I'm serving you wine.

626
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,830
What's weird about that?

627
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,390
No.

628
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,150
You must have something to say, right?

629
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,500
Nothing.

630
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,070
I've been too busy with work recently

631
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,270
to talk with you guys.

632
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,150
I just want to catch up.

633
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,990
Speaking of that,

634
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,110
my dad's seventh concubine just gave birth to another girl.

635
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,990
My dad was so happy.

636
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,590
Stop, stop, stop.

637
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,390
Who wants to know that?

638
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,670
Let's get to the point.

639
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,950
I want to know

640
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,310
which girls you're courting now

641
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,790
and how you do it.

642
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,830
In that case,

643
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,110
we have plenty of stories to tell.

644
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,670
I've had a crush

645
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,030
on the daughter of Lord Cao.

646
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,070
The second daughter of Lord Sun in Xiaonan City.

647
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,430
I like her a lot.

648
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,630
Miss Qin

649
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,630
is really...

650
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,830
Miss Zhou...

651
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,470
It's love at first sight.

652
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,630
Love at first sight?

653
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,460
Haven't you seen the daughter of Lord Sun?

654
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,550
One by one, please.

655
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,910
Let me tell you

656
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,630
a love story that takes place in Jing Ci Temple.

657
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,190
The mountains are both far and near.

658
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,910
The water is both deep and shallow.

659
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,390
Well done.

660
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,790
I thought you could only draw houses.

661
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,870
This is a place I go in my free time.

662
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,710
So I draw things other than houses here.

663
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,310
I want to draw it too.

664
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,900
You're halfway through the painting.

665
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,390
Let me finish

666
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,270
the rest.

667
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,910
You mean

668
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,870
we're gonna finish the painting together?

669
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,830
Can't we?

670
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,510
But I've never done this before.

671
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,540
If you had done it with someone else,

672
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,910
I wouldn't do it in the first place.

673
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:09,750
OK.

674
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,830
I'll prepare ink for you.

675
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,070
Alright.

676
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,430
My fish

677
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,350
will die from overfeeding or fatigue because of you.

678
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,910
Why don't you just go and talk to Li Qingfeng?

679
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,070
Leave my fish alone, okay?

680
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,110
No. Don't!

681
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,910
Everybody treats me

682
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,870
as if I were the star and the moon

683
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,550
and the most precious thing.

684
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,140
I like Li Qingfeng so much,

685
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,190
but he refused me yesterday.

00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,670
You can't

860
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,670
make the decision for all of us.

861
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,550
That's not fair.

862
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,310
It's better to vote.

863
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,100
Right, Mr. Luo?

864
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,310
Yes, I agree.

865
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,950
Then I don't think we should take the job.

866
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,060
Same here.

867
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,470
One, two, three.

868
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,790
Only three votes.

869
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,110
From three men.

870
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,310
It sounds interesting.

871
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,510
I'm going with you tomorrow.

872
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,540
Can I, Li Qingfeng?

873
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,950
You're not gonna refuse me again, are you?

874
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,670
You're a member of Wood Feather.

875
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,790
You can go as you please.

876
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:13,790
Hey.

877
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,270
I don't understand.

878
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,590
Isn't the story bloody

879
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,390
and scary enough?

880
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,110
You...

881
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,620
Why do you still want to take the job?

882
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,430
All right.

883
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,390
We're going to check the Liao Mansion tomorrow.

884
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,150
By the way,

885
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,470
in view of your concerns,

886
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,150
we'll leave at noon

887
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,830
when the sun shines bright.

888
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,070
You...

889
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,830
Luo, let’s go.

890
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,550
If it's not scary enough,

891
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,060
I can tell you something scarier.

892
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,230
I think it's scary enough.

893
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,510
I think so too.

894
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,990
A little bit.

895
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,270
See?

896
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,470
Even Wang Sheng finds it scary.

897
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,790
That's right.

898
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,350
So only the three of us...Hey!

899
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,260
Where are you going? You traitor!

900
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,790
They're not afraid, huh?

901
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,790
It's not that they're not afraid,

902
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,110
they're simply stupid.

903
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,740
No.

904
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,790
Mr. Meng.

905
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,380
They are reckless.

906
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,790
But we can’t afford to follow suit.

907
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
You mean...

908
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,510
I should pretend to be sick tomorrow and stay here?

909
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,070
Then Master will laugh at me for the rest of my life!

910
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,060
Besides,

911
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,150
for the sake of Master,

912
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,390
I must go, even if it's the hell.

913
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,830
No matter what,

914
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,670
I must protect her.

915
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:27,950
Right.

916
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,710
I must protect them.

917
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,110
What do you mean?

918
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,070
Mr. Meng.

919
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,550
Follow me.

920
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,830
