(10th year anniversary special,
3 Meals A Day Light)

2
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:47,256
It's that house, isn't it?

3
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:52,135
(Pyeongchang where potato flowers
bloom in July)

4
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:57,016
Yum.

5
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:58,856
Yes.

6
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:04,496
(A delicious meal made of love)

7
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:06,496
Yum.

8
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:08,176
(They are excited
because they're together)

9
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:10,656
This is well-fermented.
So delicious.

10
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:13,496
(They spend a fun time together)

11
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:19,576
(Chuja Island that gets a lot
of sunlight in August)

12
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,336
I got something!

13
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,576
(Feeling the thrill)

14
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:28,056
(and freshness from summer)

15
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:34,456
(The 3 Meals Family enjoy
their time on the island)

16
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:42,776
(September, the month when
the wind blows)

17
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:45,456
(Mount Jiri Rest Area)

18
00:01:45,576 --> 00:01:46,696
I guess they are here.

19
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:51,816
(This time, they are meeting up
at the rest area)

20
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,536
Oh?

21
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:56,736
(Haejin arrives in glasses)

22
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:01,655
(Next is Seungwon)

23
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:03,816
(Nice to meet you)

24
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:05,536
What is he? A cowboy?

25
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:06,936
Look at his shoes.

26
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:10,976
(Cha-boy is dressed up today)

27
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,096
(The main highlight)

28
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,376
What do you know about fashion?

29
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:17,896
- What?
- How are you?

30
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,296
You don't mind wearing
long sleeves now.

31
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,456
(It's been 3 weeks
since they met)

32
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,616
Why...

33
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:26,856
Why are you so dandy these days?

34
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:28,056
Really?

35
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,896
The glasses are a dandy style.

36
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,336
Why is that so?

37
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,536
I use these often.

38
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:37,856
I guess the season has changed.

39
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:40,536
I think it is changing.

40
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:43,896
(The heat is slowly going away)

41
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:48,176
(A season of warm sunshine)

42
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,416
Are we going somewhere?

43
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:54,176
Where do you think we will go
on your final shooting?

44
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:58,176
(Why are they gathered at
Mount Jiri Rest Area?)

45
00:02:58,296 --> 00:02:59,536
Mountain village?

46
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:01,456
We're going to Mount Jiri.

47
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,976
We are?

48
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,856
We'll go to a house that is
located in Mount Jiri

49
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,336
and film the last episodes
for '3 Meals A Day Light.'

50
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:14,536
(It is located between
Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do)

51
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:20,376
(Mount Jiri)

52
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:26,176
(This time, we are at
a green mountain)

53
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:32,136

and you'll see a flowing valley)

54
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,056
(Namwon)

55
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:40,896
(Time goes by slowly)

56
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:46,816
(That's why nature stays there)

57
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:49,896
(The story that will happen here)

58
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,376
This is amazing.

59
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:55,536
(Enjoy the sound of nature
during the day)

60
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:57,776
The stars are out.

61
00:03:57,896 --> 00:03:59,336
Wow.

62
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,456
This is so beautiful.

63
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:05,016
(They can enjoy stars
in the sky at night)

64
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:09,016
(The story of 3 Meals Family
in a mountain village)

65
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:11,776
Why did you soak it in vinegar?

66
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:16,456
(As usual, there are
small sparks flying too)

67
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:21,096
(The things they will taste
in Mount Jiri)

68
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:27,216
(Chef Cha's food that is
made with love)

69
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,656
This is so delicious.

70
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:31,656
You collected a lot?

71
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:33,616
(This much)

72
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:36,816
(Enjoy nature)

73
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:39,056
Three-story Stone Pagoda
at Baekjangam.

74
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:40,616
First floor.

75
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:41,936
Second floor, third floor.

76
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,456
Must you really count?

77
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:48,736
(They also spend time
enjoying nature)

78
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,176
This is mind-blowing.

79
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:53,616
When else will we come here?

80
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:55,736
This is wonderful.

81
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:58,696
Longing

82
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,176
makes me sing

83
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:04,016
the pain in my heart.

84
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,455
- Tears...
- Stop it.

85
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:09,856
(They've had a unique harmony
for the past 10 years)

86
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,335
(Their story begins now)

87
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:15,896
You can go there now.

88
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,576
We need to look around
the town. It's a necessity.

89
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:21,776
- We definitely need that.
- You have everything there...

90
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:23,856
We would still look around
even if it's not necessary.

91
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:26,936
We need to buy makgeolli
in Mount Jiri too.

92
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:29,656
(Their makgeolli tour continues
from Pyeongchang)

93
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,776
Makgeolli is a must-have in fall.

94
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,736
There is a brewery in this area.

95
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,256
Yes.

96
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:39,816
(They will stop at the town
before going to their house)

97
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:43,056
How do we get there from here?

98
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,576
(Their vehicle from here
back home)

99
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,696
(Introducing their new car)

100
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,216
Why are we suddenly
using this car?

101
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,856
(Flustered by the luxurious SUV
after their Ferrari)

102
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,856
We're comfortable with
the Ferrari.

103
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:55,816
This is too much.

104
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:59,576
You're driving up the mountain.
So this is for safety.

105
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:00,696
But...

106
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,335
Isn't this too much?

107
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,616
(Unfamiliar luxurious treatment)

108
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,176
Okay.

109
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:14,056
(They put their bags in first)

110
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:18,896
(They head to town
to do grocery shopping)

111
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:32,656
(From Mount Jiri Rest Area
to Macheon-myeon)

112
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,176
What have you been up to?

113
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:37,256
Me? I've been very busy.

114
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:38,856
Why?

115
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:41,256
(Seungwon had a busy schedule)

116
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:42,896
You must've been busy
because of promotions.

117
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:46,176
(He is busy due to promotions)

118
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:48,496
What about you?

119
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,456
I've been at theaters.

120
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,536
(Theater?)

121
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:54,776
I started acting in theaters
in Cheongju.

122
00:06:55,696 --> 00:07:00,096
The troupe has been active
for the past 40 years.

123
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:06,056
I thought about it
and I think it's meaningful.

124
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,256
So, I agreed to it and
am practicing there.

125
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:12,376
I doubt it was an easy
decision for you to make.

126
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:13,936
I will watch you.

127
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:15,496
I have to.

128
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:17,496
When is it in October?

129
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:21,376
(They matched schedules
and he actually went)

130
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,376
But

131
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,576
we came in the morning

132
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:31,176
in long sleeves
and it wasn't too bad.

133
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:35,736
There are a few places
in the south

134
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,696
that are still experiencing
a heat wave.

135
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:41,416
Well, a heat wave is okay

136
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:44,256
but not a heat tsunami.

137
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,856
What are we having for lunch?

138
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:48,616
I'm planning to cook jjajangmyeon.

139
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:51,016
- Really?
- Yes.

140
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,416
You will actually
make your own jjajangmyeon?

141
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:54,336
Yes.

142
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:56,256
You have the ingredients?

143
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,256
That's why we're going
to go shopping and buy pork.

144
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:01,936
- What about noodles?
- We have kalguksu.

145
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,216
We can use that.

146
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,056
What do we need?

147
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:09,456
Onion, pork, squash, potatoes.

148
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,256
- Yes.
- That's all we need.

149
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:13,256
I'm already drooling.

150
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:16,016
Sprinkle on some chili flakes.
Oh my goodness.

151
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,376
(Chef Cha plans his menus
even without being told to)

152
00:08:19,496 --> 00:08:21,216
This must be it.

153
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:24,536
(Where will they stop by
to get groceries?)

154
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:28,496
(Macheon-myeon,
Hamyang-gun, South Gyeongsang-do)

155
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,816
There's Black Pork Village too.

156
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:37,376
(Mount Jiri is famous
for black pork)

157
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:42,896
(There are signboards of
black pork everywhere)

158
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:47,456
They only sell meat here.

159
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:48,816
It's very clean.

160
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:51,776
Hello. Hello.

161
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,816
We'd like to have pork sirloin

162
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:55,976
to make jjajang.

163
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:57,896
We'll have 400 grams of meat.

164
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:00,536
Please cut them into small pieces.

165
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,456
This looks good too.

166
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:09,896
(After looking at fresh meat)

167
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,896
(Peeking)

168
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,056
(Peeking)

169
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:14,536
Anything else you need to buy?

170
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:17,296
Well, we can grill this.

171
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:20,816
(Good meat makes him
want to grill it)

172
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,776
My goodness.

173
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,855
Let's have samgyeopsal for dinner.

174
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:27,496
- That works.
- Yes, let's grill that.

175
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:28,576
- Okay.
- Okay.

176
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:30,576
Then eat it with kimchi.

177
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,136
Alright! Oh!

178
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:36,855
(They have a cauldron lid
back home too)

179
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,776
Great.

180
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:42,176
(He bought pork belly
for them to grill too)

181
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:45,056
We can use the lid for grilling.

182
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:46,216
Thank you.

183
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,216
(They have bought pork)

184
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:50,536
This is it.

185
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,656
I think this place
has a long history.

186
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,615
My goodness.

187
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,056
Hello.

188
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:58,696
(They need to buy makgeolli)

189
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,256
Since 1933.

190
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,536
This place will soon
be 100 years old.

191
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:04,696
How many bottles?

192
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:06,696
Maybe around 3 to 4 bottles?

193
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,456
Please give us 5 bottles.

194
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:11,376
(They bought 5 bottles
of makgeolli)

195
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:13,456
Why did you even ask?

196
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:18,416
(One-way communication)

197
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:23,976
(They have even bought makgeolli)

198
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:29,376
(Now, it's time to go home)

199
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,376
The makgeolli looks good.

200
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:40,456
(They shopped at Gyeongsang-do
and go home to Jeolla-do)

201
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:45,896
(They drive through the road
that is covered in green)

202
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:50,656
This car is very stable.

203
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:58,176
This car is not bumpy at all
even on mountainous roads.

204
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:04,496
Look at the green.

205
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,296
It feels good to have
lots of green around us.

206
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:12,456
I've been seeing
only buildings every day.

207
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:16,016
I used to hate nature back then.

208
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:19,216
- You like it now?
- Yes, I do.

209
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:22,656
It means you're getting younger.

210
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:24,216
Right?

211
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:26,776
Am I really getting younger?

212
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:31,216
How old was I back then?

213
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:33,855
(After laughing
and chatting away)

214
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:36,096
Is this it? Looks like it.

215
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:38,496
- Where? There?
- Yes.

216
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,176
This is a mountainous path.

217
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:44,216
(They go up the steep road)

218
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,376
We're going deep into
the mountains.

219
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,496
(A village where golden and ripe
paddies welcomes them)

220
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:54,976
The paddy field has turned golden.

221
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,696
(It is turning into
the color of fall)

222
00:11:58,615 --> 00:11:59,696
- Look at that.
- The grain?

223
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:01,056
Grain!

224
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,735
Why does this seem
so different now?

225
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:05,656
I suddenly crave toasted bread.

226
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:08,656
(He loves it too)

227
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:12,296
(They climb up the mountain
by the paddy field)

228
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,855
This looks nice.

229
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:18,136
(They have arrived home)

230
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:20,536
This is the place.

231
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:23,696
The yard is spacious.

232
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:33,176
(Somewhere deep in
the foot of Mount Jiri)

233
00:12:34,216 --> 00:12:38,256
(3 Meals House welcomes them
with its green gate)

234
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,496
(After driving through the gate)

235
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:42,735
(There is a vast yard
that Seungwon and Haejin love)

236
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:47,896
(There is a porch where
they can enjoy the view)

237
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:51,016
(When you enter the house)

238
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:54,176
(Spacious living room)

239
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:59,696
(There are small rooms that
embrace nature)

240
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:08,536
(On one side of the yard)

241
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:16,016
(Vegetable patch that grows
under the sunlight in Mount Jiri)

242
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,576
(If you sit on the swing
by the vegetable patch)

243
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:23,616
(You can enjoy a beautiful view)

244
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:28,256
(3 Meals House is a place
to enjoy Mount Jiri)

245
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,096
This place is around 400 meters
above sea level.

246
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,056
What about our rice?

247
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:34,856
Wouldn't it have effects
on our rice too?

248
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:38,816
(It would affect the rice to
be mushy or dry)

249
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:42,056
I was understanding back then
since it was your first time

250
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:45,856
but if you fail again, it means
something is wrong with Haejin.

251
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:48,736
We are 420 meters
above sea level.

252
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:51,696
(They are now 420 meters
above sea level)

253
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,736
First off,
let's check out the rooms.

254
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:59,336
(Once they enter the house)

255
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:02,376
(There is a spacious living room)

256
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,056
(Room 1, 2 and 3)

257
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,096
Which room do you want?

258
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:07,696
- Any room is fine.
- Choose one.

259
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,136
(Peeking)

260
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:11,376
You can have this room.

261
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:14,496
(Haejin will use the biggest room)

262
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:18,376
(Although the room Seungwon chose
is smaller in size)

263
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:23,456
(He gets a window
in the direction of Mount Jiri)

264
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:26,416
We should bring our things in.

265
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:27,896
Let's take our things.

266
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:32,976
(They take their things
from the car)

267
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,376
(Audio equipment)

268
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:38,856
What's the matter?

269
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:40,576
My goodness.

270
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,256
I thought this was my bag.

271
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:46,176
(He always jokes around)

272
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:50,976
(He found his real bag
and brings it to his room)

273
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:59,856
(Haejin starts
by unpacking his clothes)

274
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:04,976
(Seungwon who has begun
to transfer his items)

275
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:07,056
The fridge too...

276
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:09,016
- What?
- Check the fridge too.

277
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:11,416
(He stops unpacking when
he heard about the fridge)

278
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,536
(He checks the fridge right away)

279
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:17,216
This is amazing.

280
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:19,536
(Seungwon is happy
with the fridge)

281
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:22,576
(He starts by organizing
the refrigerator)

282
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:26,496
(Haejin who is done
changing his clothes)

283
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:28,296
Oh.

284
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,936
- Why?
- Your working clothes.

285
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,976
These are
the most comfortable clothes.

286
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:36,056
(All black shadow look)

287
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:39,976
(The first thing Haejin does)

288
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:43,696
Your instinct tells you that.

289
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,536
(Garlic instinctively summons him)

290
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:48,656
We always need garlic.

291
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:54,656
(He starts
by soaking garlic in water)

292
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,176
(He leaves it in the water
for a moment)

293
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:00,576
(He naturally goes to the bricks)

294
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:05,776
(His instinct tells him
to make a brazier)

295
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:08,096
(Looking around)

296
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:11,056
(He places the bricks
at a suitable spot)

297
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:15,416

(3 Meals A Day mode is on)

300
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:26,336
Magical things happen
once you come here.

301

(Dandy Yoo and Cha-boy
disappear in a moment)

302
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,616
(Equipment team, cooking team)

303
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:42,296
(They know what to do right away)

304
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:45,576
(After doing
their respective work)

305
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:47,256
Hello.

306
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:49,256
(The teams seem to always
bump into one another)

307
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,896
Seems like you have
something to do here.

308
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:52,656
This is my usual job.

309
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:54,736
(The equipment team is always
making a brazier)

310
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:56,816
(The cooking team is always
preparing the ingredients)

311
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:58,376
What are you having
for your first meal?

312
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:00,136
- What did you ask?
- What's your first menu?

313
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:02,376
Jjajangmyeon.

314
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:07,016
(He is peeling an onion
for jjajangmyeon)

315
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:12,096
(He cuts off only
the ends of a squash)

316
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:16,376
(Peel potatoes)

317
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:20,656
(Wash the prepared vegetables)

318
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:24,576
(Put them aside)

319

(Equipment team which has
finished building braziers)

320
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,496
(He looks at the soil closely)

321
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:38,296
(Shovel?)

322
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:40,376
I should do it here.

323
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,526
(He flattens the soil)

324
00:17:56,526 --> 00:18:01,006
(And stacks more bricks)

325
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:06,926
(Another two)

326
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,526
(What did he get from the porch?)

327
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:15,126
(Seasoning rack that
he made with Youngwoong)

328

(Seungwon of the cooking team)

331
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:33,246
Do people add that
to jjajangmyeon?

332
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,366
I'm preparing the meat that
we will eat later.

333
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:40,606
(This which is now being soaked)

334
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:44,086
I bought leg bones too.

335
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,686
- Leg bones?
- Yes.

336
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:48,166
What for?

337
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:49,966
We can make rice cake soup

338
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:52,406
for one of our meals.

339
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:54,886
I can make the broth
and keep it for later.

340
00:18:56,526 --> 00:19:00,246
(Leg bones and brisket)

341
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:02,566
(Soju)

342
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,686
Right now, I'm draining blood
from the meat.

343
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:12,006
(Soaking meat in soju and water
gets rid of the gamey smell)

344
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:17,886
(Haejin who is getting
the height right)

345
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,126
You're making that for me?

346
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:23,086
That's great.

347
00:19:24,086 --> 00:19:27,766
(He is done making
the seasoning rack)

348
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:30,566
Honey.

349
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:31,926
Something refreshing.

350
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,406
(They are reminded of something
refreshing after doing their work)

351
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:36,566
Shouldn't we have that now?

352
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:38,726
- Don't you think so?
- It's because...

353
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,526
(All ingredients have been washed)

354
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,646
The one from earlier...

355
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,606
How do I say this?

356
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,446
- I know what you mean.
- The one that was filtered.

357
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:51,646
(They know what it is
without saying in detail)

358
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:53,686
I'm curious about its taste

359
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:55,246
here.

360
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:59,926
(While Seungwon prepares
the filtered one)

361
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:03,606
(Haejin prepares the cups)

362
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,486
Come here.

363
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,766
(They are seated on the porch)

364
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:14,686
I think it'll be delicious.

365
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:17,285
(Time to have
the refreshing filtered one)

366
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,606
It's refreshing.

367
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:23,086
(Gulping)

368
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:26,766
Not bad.

369
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,926
(They love it)

370
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,206
It's not bad.

371
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:34,045
(He gets seated comfortably)

372
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,846
I think our makgeolli tour
is a success.

373
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:39,446
This is tasty.

374
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,126
(After quenching their thirst)

375
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:44,285
That is Cheonwangbong Peak
of Mount Jiri.

376
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:47,285
(Now they get to enjoy the view)

377
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,526
Over there is Namwon.

378
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:53,006
- Where is Namwon?
- Over there.

379
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:53,846
(Our house)

380
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:57,045
(Cheonwangbong Peak is over here)

381
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:01,766
(On the right side is Jeolla-do)

382
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:07,166
(On the left side
is Gyeongsang-do)

383
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:09,486
Where is Hwagaejangteo Market?

384
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:12,805
(Hwagaejangteo Market is nearby)

385
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:15,086
But...

386
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:17,285
if we're going
to explore this area,

387
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:20,526
it will look just like
any other market.

388
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,526
You can find everything there.

389
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:26,846
It's amazing.

390
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:28,486
(He is flustered)

391
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:30,926
(He can't hold back his laughter)

392
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:33,326
You're going to make bone broth?

393
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:36,366
I can make lots of broth
using that.

394
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:39,246
We can use that as a welcome
drink.

395
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,846
(Welcome drink)

396
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,086
After making that,

397
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:45,045
we can have seolleongtang
for breakfast.

398
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:48,285
Gomguksi for lunch.

399
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:51,766
- And for dinner...
- We will have rice cake soup.

400
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:53,846
We'll make everything with that.

401
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:57,045
You'll use the broth
in all dishes?

402
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,805
Yes, we should do that.

403
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,086
You'll exercise, won't you?

404
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:11,566
(Haejin's thighs
caught his attention)

405
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:13,886
I've been working out too.

406
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:16,446
- Are you bragging?
- I've been exercising too.

407
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,285
(Bragging about his lower body
that he has worked out)

408
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:20,805
(He is bragging)

409
00:22:20,926 --> 00:22:22,366
Wow...

410
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:25,406
(Clear tan lines)

411
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:27,045
Do you think I wore shoes or not?

412
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,206
You did!

413
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:35,246
Shall we get started?

414
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:37,006
What's the time now?

415
00:22:37,126 --> 00:22:41,406
(It's currently 12:55PM)

416
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,086
What will you do now?

417
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:46,045
(It's time to get moving)

418
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:50,126
(He will boil the brisket and
bones that have been soaked)

419
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:52,886
We'll use one brazier
to make jjajang

420
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:55,606
and the other to boil noodles.

421
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:57,726
Do you need one or two fires?

422
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,366
(He needs two)

423
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:00,886
Let me wash that first.

424
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,886
Yeolmoa is dirty.

425
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:07,006
(Prove that it has been working
hard from Pyeongchang to Chuja)

426
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:10,846
(Mr. Yoo cleans it)

427
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:13,646
(While Mr. Yoo cleans Yeolmoa)

428
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,366
(Chef Cha cuts the vegetables)

429
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:20,886
(Lunch menu:
Jjajangmyeon and dumplings)

430
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,966
(Lots of vegetables
to be added to jjajangmyeon)

431
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:27,206
(Next is squash)

432
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:32,406
(Cut the yellow squash into cubes)

433
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,606
(Next is onion)

434
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:44,805
(Lots of onion, a must-have
ingredient in jjajangmyeon)

435
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:50,285
(There are lots of ingredients)

436
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:53,486
(Mr. Yoo is done cleaning Yeolmoa)

437
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:55,805
(He dries it under the sun)

438
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,086
(It is clean despite
looking the same)

439
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:01,766
(He gets ready for the next task)

440
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:03,526
It's hot, isn't it?

441
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:04,846
Yes, it is.

442
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:07,166
(Worried about Haejin
who is under the hot sun)

443
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:08,966
(Mosquitoes whirring)

444
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:10,086
Okay.

445
00:24:10,206 --> 00:24:12,246
(The first mosquito communicator
in Korea)

446
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:14,126
(Peeking)

447
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,486
- That's for jjajang?
- Yes.

448
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:19,686
- It uses lots of onions.
- Yes.

449
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:21,766
The sauce is all about
the flavor from the onion.

450
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:24,966
(After the flavor of onion)

451
00:24:25,086 --> 00:24:27,886
(Add the flavor of potatoes)

452
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:34,006
(Haejin is washing the mesh
under the tap water)

453
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:39,486
(He is making JABAJO)

454
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:40,886
(Laughing)

455
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:46,006
I'm very thorough, am I not?

456
00:24:46,606 --> 00:24:47,566
What is this called?

457
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,285
I told you that this is
called JABAJO.

458
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,526
What is it called?

459
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:52,566
JABAJO.

460
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:54,886
(Both are giggling)

461
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:55,926
(Hehehe)

462
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,446
The name is...

463
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:58,805
(Giggling away)

464
00:24:58,926 --> 00:25:00,526
Isn't it very honest and innocent?

465
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:01,606
(He loves it)

466
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:03,886
(Haejin's items are given names
that are innocent and direct)

467
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:07,966
(It begins with Hyungbae
in Jukgul Island)

468
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,846
(It has powerful energy)

469
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:16,006
(White Pillar
is created in Pyeongchang)

470
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:21,086
(Yeolmoa which has
different names)

471
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:23,086
(And JABAJO too)

472
00:25:23,206 --> 00:25:25,646
(Cube lots of potatoes too)

473
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:34,206
(All the ingredients that will be
added to jjajangmyeon are ready)

474
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,166
(Chef Cha's list of tasks)

475
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,806
(Prepare ingredients
for jjajangmyeon)

476
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:40,006
- Shall I start one fire?
- Yes.

477
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:41,846
(Haejin gets ready to start
a fire at one brazier)

478
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:43,646
(Seungwon gets ready
to cut the cabbages)

479
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:45,646
The garlic...

480
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:47,166
Is that enough?

481
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:49,606
No, we need this much.

482
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:50,686
(In shock)

483
00:25:50,806 --> 00:25:52,406
(This is not the time for him
to start a fire)

484
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:54,006
I have to soak even more.

485
00:25:57,046 --> 00:25:59,206
(Add more garlic to be soaked)

486
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:01,486
There's a lot to do.

487
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:04,246
(He adds vinegar to the garlic)

488
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:07,206
(He quickly starts the fire)

489
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:10,526
(The wood catches fire right away)

490
00:26:12,526 --> 00:26:14,406
(He naturally uses newspaper)

491
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:19,286
(Chef Cha starts to cut
the cabbages)

492
00:26:21,926 --> 00:26:24,286
(The location of the basin
makes his job more efficient)

493
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:33,606
(Cuts the Chinese cabbage
into half)

494
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:39,966
(Cuts it into big pieces)

495
00:26:40,486 --> 00:26:42,766
(He is done slicing
Chinese cabbage in a jiff)

496
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:48,766
I have to peel the garlic soon.

497
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:51,086
(Garlic is needed for kimchi,
jjajangmyeon, gomtang, etc.)

498
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:53,286
(He starts peeling garlic)

499
00:26:54,606 --> 00:26:56,926
(Struggling)

500
00:26:57,686 --> 00:26:59,206
(Gives up)

501
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,646
(It is hard to peel garlic as they
haven't been soaked long enough)

502
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:03,686
(He changes the garlic)

503
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,086
(He peels the garlic on one side)

504
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:08,726
(On the other side is
Seungwon salting Chinese cabbage)

505
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:11,966
(Salt Chinese cabbage)

506
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:14,646
(Leave it on one side so that
it gets salted)

507
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:18,846
(Then, prepare flour paste)

508
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:26,206
(Mix water and flour well)

509
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:31,206
(After stirring it)

510
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:34,606
(The flour paste is ready)

511
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:43,006
(Prepare flour paste)

512
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:45,606
(Let the paste cool down)

513
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,046
(This is what Haejin is doing)

514
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:53,726
(He has been peeling garlic
for the past 10 minutes)

515
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,766
(He continues to peel garlic)

516
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:04,846
(He peels garlic while Seungwon
goes everywhere)

517
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:11,766
(Haejin is locked in
the torturous pit of garlic)

518
00:28:11,886 --> 00:28:14,766
(When will he be free?)

519
00:28:14,886 --> 00:28:16,166
(He checks the time)

520
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:19,806
(Current time is 2:30PM)

521
00:28:20,206 --> 00:28:22,406
(On the other hand, Chef Cha...)

522
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:28,286
(Place the leg bone and
brisket into a cauldron)

523
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:33,566
(Pour in enough water to cover
all of it)

524
00:28:33,686 --> 00:28:36,966
(Boil leg bone and brisket)

525
00:28:37,446 --> 00:28:39,326
(Instead of Haejin
who is peeling garlic)

526
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:42,686
(he adds more firewood himself)

527
00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:46,286
(Equipment team peels garlic and
the cooking team adds firewood)

528
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,806
(Natural crossover from being
together for 10 years)

529
00:28:49,526 --> 00:28:50,726
(Peeking)

530
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:52,246
The fire is small?

531
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:54,926
(He leaves the garlic
for a short moment)

532
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:57,326
(He is back in
equipment team mode)

533
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:00,886
(He adds more firewood
after checking on the fire)

534
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:06,326
(He goes back to the garlic)

535
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,006
Hey...

536
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:11,846
My goodness.

537
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:15,046
Garlic... My gosh, the garlic.

538
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,726
(It's funny yet sad and
makes Seungwon feel sorry)

539
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:19,206
I have to peel them, anyway.

540
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:27,966
The fire...

541
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:30,166
Can you make the fire
just a little bigger?

542
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:32,006
I will once the flame
gets bigger.

543
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:33,406
- From now?
- Yes.

544
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,846
(He stands up again)

545
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,286
I'm confused right now.

546
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:42,246
(He is in charge of
the fire for a moment)

547
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:45,126
(And then is in charge
of garlic after that)

548
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:46,526
Listen up.

549
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:49,246
You can just prepare garlic
to make kimchi for now.

550
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:52,766
Please peel another 10.
That's all.

551
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:55,926
(They decided to peel just enough
garlic for kimchi)

552
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:59,646
(A special measure to save
Haejin from this torture)

553
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:01,526
(Flour paste that he left
to cool down)

554
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:05,326
This is perfect.

555
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:06,766
It's amazing.

556
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,006
(The flour paste
makes Chef Cha happy)

557
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:12,686
(He puts it in the fridge)

558
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,846
(He gets chunjang to make jjajang)

559
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,806
I'm sweating now.

560
00:30:20,446 --> 00:30:21,286
I'm sweating.

561
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:23,206
(He starts to sweat as
he is moving busily)

562
00:30:23,846 --> 00:30:25,686
(He prepares ingredients
to make jjajang)

563
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:28,806
(And goes to the fridge again)

564
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:33,686
(Clank)

565
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:36,566
What is that sound?

566
00:30:36,686 --> 00:30:38,566
(Why is he the only one who
enjoys something cold?)

567
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:40,646
- What sound is that?
- I just got a text.

568
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:42,326
(Talking nonsense)

569
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:44,886
(Even he finds it funny)

570
00:30:45,006 --> 00:30:45,846
Do you want one?

571
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:47,086
No.

572
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,766
- Really?
- Yes.

573
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:50,526
(Now he can drink it with ease)

574
00:30:50,646 --> 00:30:51,886
Did you really get a text?

575
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:53,126
(He appears with
a refreshed voice)

576
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:54,406
No, I opened one bottle.

577
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:56,366
(After telling the truth)

578
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:59,246
(He joins Haejin
to peel the garlic)

579
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,486
Stop peeling now.

580
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:08,086
- This is enough?
- Yes, you can stop now.

581
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:10,766
(Only the garlic needed for kimchi
has been prepared)

582
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,806
(Finally, he is free from garlic)

583
00:31:13,926 --> 00:31:15,766
(and he is back
in front of the fire)

584
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:17,686
I have to peel the garlic...

585
00:31:17,806 --> 00:31:19,366
(And start a fire)

586
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:22,486
There are no boundaries now.
That's how the world is today.

587
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:23,806
The boundary has
to be blurry as well.

588
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:24,886
Yes!

589
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:26,086
We need to be free of boundaries.

590
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:27,686
I should not think that

591
00:31:27,806 --> 00:31:29,886
I'm only part of the equipment
team.

592
00:31:30,006 --> 00:31:31,966
(Explaining with
his veins popping)

593
00:31:32,086 --> 00:31:35,486
That is an old way of thinking.
Don't think that way.

594
00:31:35,606 --> 00:31:38,886
(Even '3 Meals A Day' has joined
the generation of melting pot)

595
00:31:39,006 --> 00:31:41,406
(Both the chef and equipment team
wear gloves)

596
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:43,886
Boil it here and throw out
the water.

597
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:44,886
It's not boiling?

598
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:46,886
(The broth is boiling
when they check on it)

599
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,486
(Throw out the first batch
of water to get rid of impurities)

600
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:52,566
(It gets rid of the smell
and removes more blood)

601
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,166
(He pours in water again)

602
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:58,086
I guess you add enough water
since the meat is floating.

603
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:01,206
(You should add water that is
5 times more than the weight)

604
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,246
(He adds more firewood
to the brazier with a cauldron)

605
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:12,086
(He does the dishes in
the most uncomfortable posture)

606
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:15,446
Because we have JABAJO...

607
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,566
- It makes life easier, right?
- Yes, it does.

608
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:20,886
You know what should be done.

609
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,006
(JABAJO fulfills
its role perfectly)

610
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:24,206
Is the fire big?

611
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:27,886
The big one? It definitely is.

612
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:29,686
You can put it over there.

613
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:31,766
- Put what?
- Bulmoa.

614
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:34,046
(The name suddenly changed)

615
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:38,206
(He sets up the Yeolmoa,
not Bulmoa)

616
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,366
(He makes sure that
it is set up properly)

617
00:32:41,486 --> 00:32:45,726
Not everybody can set up Yeolmoa
when it is first used.

618
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:47,406
A member of the equipment team
has to do it.

619
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:50,086
(Yoo Haejin: 3 Meals Steel's head,
developer, and creator of Yeolmoa)

620
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:52,006
(Giggling)

621
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:56,326
I think the flower pattern
has been flattened so much.

622
00:32:56,446 --> 00:32:58,966
(The petals are flattened)

623
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:01,526
Yes, that's why you need
someone from the team.

624
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:04,966
(He brought the tool that is
used only by the team members)

625
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:08,246
(He forces the petals back up)

626
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,126
You're using a hoe?

627
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,686
Although it looks like a hoe,

628
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,326
this is a necessary tool
that we need in our team.

629
00:33:15,446 --> 00:33:16,846
This might look like a hoe...

630
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:19,686
(This might look like a hoe
but it is not)

631
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,846
So you need
a special tool for this?

632
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:25,606
Yes, the angle

633
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:28,286
makes a big difference in
how efficient it is.

634
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,566
(He did nothing)

635
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:34,046
(He's trying to get
the right angle)

636
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,366
(Tough job of being part of
the team)

637
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,406
(While the headquarters worker
is setting up Yeolmoa)

638
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:44,766
(Chef Cha is still very busy)

639
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:49,286
(He is making slurry
to be added to jjajangmyeon)

640
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:54,006
(Mix a ratio of 1 starch
and 1 water to make slurry)

641
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:57,966
(Slurry is a must to make
jjajang sauce thick)

642
00:33:58,086 --> 00:34:00,246
(After making slurry)

643
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:04,566
(He gets ready
to stir-fry jjajang)

644
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:08,366
(Pour canola oil on chunjang)

645
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:13,166
(Yeolmoa is ready with
the touch of the worker)

646
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,446
Is this chunjang?

647
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:18,966
I have to stir-fry this.

648
00:34:20,046 --> 00:34:22,246
(The perfect angles have
concentrated the fire)

649
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:25,366
(It is getting hot now)

650
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:29,326
(Stir-frying chunjang gets rid
of the smell and dryness)

651
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:31,286
(of chunjang and gives it
a more savory flavor)

652
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:36,566
Yeolmoa is created just
to make Chinese cuisine.

653
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:38,686
(The headquarters worker
is proud)

654
00:34:47,006 --> 00:34:50,086
(He places the fried chunjang
in a bowl)

655
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:55,726
(He gets the vegetables
that he has cut)

656
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:57,606
Is this too much?

657
00:34:58,126 --> 00:34:59,646
I think I prepared too much.

658
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,446
(Pouring them in)

659
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:03,885
Hold on.

660
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:05,806
(A lot)

661
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:07,966
(This is more than usual)

662
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:09,326
Who are you?

663
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:11,446
We should reduce it.

664
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:13,326
Is it because of
'Yoo Quiz on the Block'?

665
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,405
(Many netizens have been saying
that Seungwon is not generous)

666
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:20,046
(He did say on that show that
he cooked in large amounts)

667
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,966
(He walks the talk)

668
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,326
This won't take long to cook.

669
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:30,526
(He suddenly started running)

670
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:33,606
(He quickly gets the pork)

671
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:36,446
(Nobody is running after him)

672
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:40,526
(He adds a bit more canola oil)

673
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,206
(Stir-fries it on strong heat)

674
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:48,526
(Staring)

675
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,925
Don't you think that
you need more chunjang?

676
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:51,966
No, that is enough.

677
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:53,646
I will add chunjang now.

678
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:56,086
(He hasn't added chunjang)

679
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:58,526
Here it is.
We need to add chunjang.

680
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:00,646
(The chunjang that
he stir-fried earlier)

681
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:03,166
Why? You're suspecting me
of being someone irresponsible?

682
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,446
Yes.

683
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:07,286
(You hurt my feelings, honey)

684
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:10,286
(He adds stir-fried chunjang)

685
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:12,606
Give me that.

686
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:13,966
In this bowl,

687
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:16,006
pour in some water and
give it to me.

688
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:17,446
It's hot.

689
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:21,686
(The color starts to change
after chunjang is added)

690
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:24,206
Just pour it in. Pour it all in.

691
00:36:24,326 --> 00:36:26,246
(Add in lots of water)

692
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:28,566
(There are still a lot of
ingredients)

693
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,326
Just add more water.

694
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,526
This smells like jjajang.

695
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:37,206
(Pour in more water so that
it's covered in water)

696
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:44,006
This smells wonderful.

697
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:48,206
(The tasty smell of jjajang
has started to spread)

698
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:55,326
I think many Samsung workers near
the National Assembly eat this.

699
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,166
(Giggling)

700
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:01,166
You should make jokes
when things get tough.

701
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,806
That was a good one.

702
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:07,206
(He tastes it)

703
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:10,846
(Adds chicken bouillon powder)

704
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:13,366
(Add sugar)

705
00:37:14,486 --> 00:37:16,686
(While Chef Cha gets
the next ingredient)

706
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:19,806
(Haejin naturally takes the ladle)

707
00:37:21,526 --> 00:37:23,526
(A bit of MSG)

708
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:27,086
(Finally, oyster sauce)

709
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,405
We have to let it simmer
for a long time.

710
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:30,806
(Just let it simmer since
it has been seasoned well)

711
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:35,646
(He adds more firewood
so it can simmer well)

712
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,246
(They get time to themselves
while they let it simmer)

713
00:37:42,686 --> 00:37:44,885
(This is what Haejin is doing)

714
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:48,806
(I am hungry)

715
00:37:53,206 --> 00:37:54,246
What is the time now?

716
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:55,486
It's 3:10PM.

717
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,646
(A lot of time has passed)

718
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:02,286
(The jjajang is boiling)

719
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,646
- It is boiling well.
- Yes, it is.

720
00:38:05,286 --> 00:38:07,246
(Add slurry)

721
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:11,566
(He stirs it while checking
the state of the jjajang)

722
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:13,686
(Adding it bit by bit)

723
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:19,446
There's not enough slurry.

724
00:38:19,566 --> 00:38:21,646
(The jjajang is still
not thick enough)

725
00:38:23,726 --> 00:38:25,486
(He puts the wok aside)

726
00:38:25,606 --> 00:38:27,206
(And makes slurry)

727
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:28,846
This smells great.

728
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:31,046
(I'm hungry)

729
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:33,166
(Adding more and more slurry)

730
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:41,326
(I'm hungry)

731
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,006
(Staggering)

732
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:47,646
(They are both
losing their energy)

733
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:51,846
(But now, it looks thick)

734
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,086
(Tasting it again)

735
00:38:59,726 --> 00:39:00,846
This is done.

736
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:04,246
(Make jjajang)

737
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:05,806
I can just leave this here.

738
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:07,486
Okay.

739
00:39:08,966 --> 00:39:10,806
This looks perfect.

740
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:14,046
(Since the jjajang sauce is ready)

741
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,405
(Let's cook the noodles)

742
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:21,686
First off, add water.

743
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:27,046
(I hope you boil quickly)

744
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:28,726
This and ripe kimchi?

745
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:30,366
Yes, let's have those.

746
00:39:30,486 --> 00:39:32,046
While we're at it,

747
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,086
shall we have fried eggs too?

748
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,246
That sounds good.

749
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:37,046
We need to make dumplings.

750
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,286
Dumplings?

751
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:40,006
We should've made dumplings first.

752
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:42,166
(Both braziers are in use)

753
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:44,046
We should have made
dumplings first.

754
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,446
I'll just put this down.

755
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:49,806
(He puts the water to cook
noodles aside for now)

756
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:57,405
(Chef Cha quickly gets
eggs and dumplings)

757
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:01,086
(Dumplings are a must
with jjajangmyeon)

758
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:04,366
(Quickly cuts them
with a pair of scissors)

759
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:07,686
Look at this.

760
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,566
They use one whole shrimp!

761
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:12,925
This is the real
whole shrimp dumpling.

762
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:21,006
(He filled the pan with dumplings)

763
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,925
(He covers the pan with a lid
so they cook quickly)

764
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:29,246
We just have to cook noodles
after this, don't we?

765
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:30,486
Yes.

766
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:32,486
(I have to endure a bit longer)

767
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,806
(The dumplings have turned
golden brown)

768
00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:47,885
(He pours some water in it
and covers it with a lid)

769
00:40:48,006 --> 00:40:50,006
To make sure that the filling
is cooked well too,

770
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:52,086
you need to cook it using vapor.

771
00:40:52,206 --> 00:40:54,286
The steam will cook the dumplings.

772
00:41:00,206 --> 00:41:04,286
(Crunchy outside and moist inside)

773
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:08,646
Honey.

774
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,006
I'm making fried eggs.

775
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:11,166
- Don't.
- Why?

776
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:12,646
I'm hungry.

777
00:41:12,766 --> 00:41:14,326
(I'm suffering right now)

778
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:16,246
- Let's just eat.
- Okay.

779
00:41:16,366 --> 00:41:17,846
(So hungry)

780
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:21,486
(The dumplings are ready)

781
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,726
(Grill dumplings)

782
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:28,326
(The water to boil noodles
is back)

783
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:33,446
(They use kalguksu to eat
with jjajang sauce)

784
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:38,606
(Chef Cha's simple jjajangmyeon
made using kalguksu)

785
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,606
(He plates the fried dumplings)

786
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,086
This is hot.

787
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:51,726
(All that's left is to taste it)

788
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:53,966
Wow.

789
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:56,206
(Face of anticipation)

790
00:41:56,326 --> 00:41:58,246
Yum! Yum! Here!

791
00:41:58,366 --> 00:41:59,606
Try it.

792
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:02,646
This is tasty.

793
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:03,925
Try it.

794
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:05,806
(Hungry Haejin tastes it too)

795
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:11,606
(It is still hot)

796
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:13,206
It is seasoned to perfection
even without dipping.

797
00:42:13,326 --> 00:42:15,046
They have been seasoned.

798
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,526
This is tasty.

799
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:19,846
(After getting rid of his hunger
through dumplings)

800
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,885
(It's time to set up the table)

801
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:30,766
(He takes out ripe kimchi
from the fridge)

802
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:34,766
(He cuts the kimchi
into bite sizes)

803
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:43,686
(Danmuji is a must
with jjajangmyeon)

804
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:48,286
(Pour lots of vinegar
over the danmuji)

805
00:42:48,885 --> 00:42:51,925
(Have you forgotten about me?)

806
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:58,526
What is this?

807
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:00,846
(They save it together)

808
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:04,526
(The water is boiling
in the blink of an eye)

809
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,526
(Are the noodles cooked?)

810
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:13,086
Let's eat now.

811
00:43:13,206 --> 00:43:14,925
(Finally, the noodles are cooked)

812
00:43:15,046 --> 00:43:17,806
(Cook noodles)

813
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:22,166
(What's left is to rinse
the noodles in cold water)

814
00:43:23,086 --> 00:43:25,486
The jjajang has cooled down.

815
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:27,726
(He only rinses it slightly
as the sauce has cooled down)

816
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,086
(Slippery)

817
00:43:30,846 --> 00:43:32,086
(His slipper broke)

818
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:33,566
My goodness.

819
00:43:34,206 --> 00:43:36,206
(The spirit of being bare footed)

820
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:39,846
(We should complete the task
we're working on)

821
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:40,885
Okay, this is done.

822
00:43:41,006 --> 00:43:42,846
(Chef Cha prioritizes their meal
instead of his slippers)

823
00:43:42,966 --> 00:43:46,046
(Mr. Yoo realized what happened
to the slipper)

824
00:43:46,646 --> 00:43:48,846
(Running)

825
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,046
Chef Cha.

826
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,646
(The prince is here to save
Cha-derella whose slipper broke)

827
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,086
(They are wearing
the same slippers now)

828
00:44:06,486 --> 00:44:07,806
Thank you.

829
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:10,286
(Cha-derella is grateful
towards the prince)

830
00:44:12,126 --> 00:44:13,925
(He hops in an elegant way
like a prince would)

831
00:44:14,286 --> 00:44:16,246
(Cha-derella is excited
upon wearing new slippers)

832
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:20,166
(He is back to being Chef Cha)

833
00:44:20,846 --> 00:44:21,726
Now, the bowl...

834
00:44:21,846 --> 00:44:23,806
(They just have to plate
the jjajangmyeon now)

835
00:44:32,246 --> 00:44:34,806
(While Chef Cha
plates the noodles)

836
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:36,806
(Haejin gets the jjajang sauce)

837
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:39,206
As expected.

838
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:42,086
(They have perfect teamwork)

839
00:44:48,006 --> 00:44:51,606
(Pouring a generous amount
of jjajang sauce)

840
00:44:53,006 --> 00:44:55,885
- Is this done?
- Yes, it is.

841
00:44:57,006 --> 00:45:02,405
(Chef Cha's jjajangmyeon that
is in yunijjajang style)

842
00:45:03,006 --> 00:45:06,405
(Crunchy yet moist
whole shrimp dumpling)

843
00:45:06,526 --> 00:45:08,166
(Spicy kimchi)

844
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:10,405
(Sour danmuji)

845
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,925
(Their first meal
in Mount Jiri is complete)

846
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,126
Bon appetit.

847
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:20,486
(He takes chili powder first)

848
00:45:20,606 --> 00:45:22,606
Give me some chili powder too.

849
00:45:23,206 --> 00:45:25,885
(The chili powder adds
more spiciness to it)

850
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:27,966
- More?
- No, that's enough.

851
00:45:28,086 --> 00:45:29,885
I need to add vinegar.

852
00:45:30,006 --> 00:45:32,326
(Haejin loves to add vinegar
to his jjajangmyeon)

853
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:34,126
(Seungwon doesn't like
to add vinegar to his)

854
00:45:52,925 --> 00:45:54,606
I...

855
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:56,566
(He tastes it first)

856
00:45:56,686 --> 00:45:59,326
I thought kalguksu wouldn't
be suitable but it's good.

857
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:00,846
(Yes, it is)

858
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,326
(Kalguksu noodles suit
jjajang sauce well)

859
00:46:04,446 --> 00:46:05,726
This is tasty.

860
00:46:09,486 --> 00:46:11,286
This tastes like something
served in a Chinese restaurant.

861
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:12,566
Really?

862
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:20,286
You went through a lot.

863
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:21,846
You had to start the fire...

864
00:46:21,966 --> 00:46:23,405
Good job.

865
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:27,446
(This tastes better
because he worked hard)

866
00:46:34,326 --> 00:46:36,526
(A butterfly visits them
because of the jjajang smell)

867
00:46:37,286 --> 00:46:40,166
(He tastes the crunchy
fried dumplings too)

868
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:43,006
One whole shrimp.

869
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:52,606
This is perfect.

870
00:46:53,405 --> 00:46:55,726
(He re-energizes
with jjajangmyeon)

871
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,806
Have you made this before?

872
00:46:57,925 --> 00:46:59,446
Did we eat jjajangmyeon before?

873
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,286
No, we didn't.

874
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:04,885
(This is their first time to make
their own jjajangmyeon together)

875
00:47:05,006 --> 00:47:06,846
This requires
a lot of effort to make.

876
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:07,726
Much more than expected.

877
00:47:10,486 --> 00:47:11,446
The pork is tasty too.

878
00:47:11,566 --> 00:47:13,526
This pork is delicious.

879
00:47:13,646 --> 00:47:15,766
It's usually tough
but this one is tasty.

880
00:47:15,885 --> 00:47:16,925
Yes, it is tender.

881
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:35,206
This would've been good
with rice too.

882
00:47:35,326 --> 00:47:36,326
I agree.

883
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:37,566
Nice.

884
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,126
Great.

885
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:41,686
The view is beautiful too.

886
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:46,766
(Let's enjoy the view together)

887
00:47:49,206 --> 00:47:51,686
You just have to let it boil.

888
00:47:52,405 --> 00:47:55,686
(Leg bones and brisket
have been boiling for 2 hours)

889
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,086
What is the brisket for?

890
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:59,925
We can tear the brisket
to make rice cake soup

891
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:02,326
or even gomtang too.

892
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,726
(It can be added
to a variety of dishes)

893
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:09,806
For the bones, we will add
more water and let it boil.

894
00:48:09,925 --> 00:48:12,806
Add a bit more firewood
so we can let it boil.

895
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:17,885
(They continue eating after
Seungwon gives a briefing)

896
00:48:20,246 --> 00:48:21,046
Honey.

897
00:48:21,446 --> 00:48:22,885
(He still has a lot to say)

898
00:48:23,006 --> 00:48:25,206
(The fire is weak but still there)

899
00:48:25,326 --> 00:48:28,086
Let's stir-fry kimchi
over that fire.

900
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:32,366
(They will stir-fry ripe kimchi
and make new kimchi)

901
00:48:42,526 --> 00:48:44,166
That was a good meal.

902
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:45,566
Finally,

903
00:48:45,686 --> 00:48:46,806
- we can rest.
- I feel better now.

904
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:51,046
(They are full
and have taken a break)

905
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:52,846
We will make samgyeopsal later?

906
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:55,405
(They talk about dinner
right after having lunch)

907
00:48:55,526 --> 00:48:58,446
We will grill kimchi
with samgyeopsal.

908
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:00,126
Now,

909
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:02,766
I'll take a break
and start making kimchi.

910
00:49:03,885 --> 00:49:06,925
(Let's rest for now)

911
00:49:08,885 --> 00:49:11,766
It will ferment anyway.

912
00:49:11,885 --> 00:49:13,486
It will still ferment
even if we leave it.

913
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:15,206
Let's have baek-kimchi.

914
00:49:15,326 --> 00:49:16,486
- Baek-kimchi.
- Yes.

915
00:49:16,846 --> 00:49:19,206
(Let's take a break
before making kimchi)

916
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:21,686
(No, they are not resting)

917
00:49:21,806 --> 00:49:23,566
(But they said they would)

918
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:27,405
(Haejin takes some firewood
despite saying he wants to rest)

919
00:49:30,405 --> 00:49:32,925
(Seungwon pours more water
into the bone broth)

920
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:35,766
(Nobody is resting)

921
00:49:35,885 --> 00:49:37,646
(He scoops out fat from the broth)

922
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,686
We are cooking this
with brisket right now.

923
00:49:40,006 --> 00:49:42,766
(They have to remove the fat
continuously due to the brisket)

924
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:46,246
(The broth has been simmering
for quite some time)

925
00:49:47,006 --> 00:49:49,326
(He can't leave the broth)

926
00:49:49,885 --> 00:49:51,966
(After checking on the broth)

927
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:55,526
(He goes to the tap
to do the dishes)

928
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,526
(He doesn't know how to rest)

929
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,885
(Haejin who is humming)

930
00:50:05,566 --> 00:50:07,885
(After choosing his
working song CD)

931
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:11,286
(He appears with a CD player)

932
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:12,326
Leave that be. I'll do it.

933
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:13,286
No, I'll do it.

934
00:50:13,405 --> 00:50:15,086
- I'll do it.
- I can do it.

935
00:50:15,206 --> 00:50:16,486
(They are arguing over who
should do the job)

936
00:50:16,606 --> 00:50:17,925
You should stir-fry kimchi.

937
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:21,326
(The music starts playing
as they fight about the dishes)

938
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:24,926
('The Sound of Silence' by
Simon and Garfunkel)

939
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:28,286
(The Sound of Silence)

940
00:50:28,406 --> 00:50:30,246
Just stir-fry the kimchi.
I'll do this.

941
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:32,966
(Their argument continues)

942
00:50:33,086 --> 00:50:34,926
(Background music that is
not suitable for the situation)

943
00:50:35,046 --> 00:50:36,526
(A silent touch)

944
00:50:36,646 --> 00:50:37,766
- Okay.
- Get up.

945
00:50:40,606 --> 00:50:42,166
I can't believe
you played this song.

946
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:43,926
It's Simon and Garfunkel.

947
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:47,526
(Chef Cha leaves as he can't
overcome Haejin's pestering)

948
00:50:52,246 --> 00:50:54,486
Of silence...

949
00:50:54,606 --> 00:50:57,406
(Finally, they have
a moment of silence)

950
00:50:58,486 --> 00:51:01,006
(Seungwon is in front
of the fire again)

951
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:04,846
(Now, it's time
to add more firewood)

952
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,606
(Familiar fanning)

953
00:51:08,286 --> 00:51:09,966
(He is in equipment team mode)

954
00:51:10,086 --> 00:51:12,126
(Back to being cooking team mode)

955
00:51:13,486 --> 00:51:17,006
(Chef Cha is about
to make stir-fried kimchi)

956
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:23,006
(He cuts them into smaller pieces
so it's easier to stir-fry)

957
00:51:23,886 --> 00:51:27,046
(Pour in some perilla oil)

958
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:30,166
(Pour a generous amount
of sesame oil in too)

959
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:34,006
(Stir-fry on low heat)

960
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:37,286
(He slowly goes to the broth)

961
00:51:41,326 --> 00:51:44,006
(It's time
to take the brisket out)

962
00:51:46,726 --> 00:51:48,246
(Let the brisket cool down)

963
00:51:49,126 --> 00:51:51,366
(Start stir-frying kimchi again)

964
00:51:53,766 --> 00:51:56,766
(When the kimchi starts
to turn yellow)

965
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:59,446
(pour in water)

966
00:51:59,566 --> 00:52:01,126
(Adding water gets rid of
the sour taste in kimchi)

967
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:03,166
(and helps it cook well
which makes it tastier)

968
00:52:03,926 --> 00:52:05,326
(Add some sugar)

969
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:08,006
(Sprinkle lots of chili powder)

970
00:52:08,686 --> 00:52:11,486
(Now, it's time to just
let it simmer until it boils down)

971
00:52:13,126 --> 00:52:15,486
(The fire gets stronger)

972
00:52:15,606 --> 00:52:18,446
This is not an easy task.

973
00:52:18,566 --> 00:52:22,166
Taking care of the fire is tough.

974
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:25,566
(The equipment team
has difficult tasks)

975
00:52:29,326 --> 00:52:31,966
(Fanning two braziers is tough)

976
00:52:34,006 --> 00:52:35,406
- It's going well?
- Yes.

977
00:52:35,526 --> 00:52:38,926
(It is stir-frying well)

978
00:52:43,406 --> 00:52:44,286
Why?

979
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:46,366
(Encore)

980
00:52:46,486 --> 00:52:48,606
(Full of laughter)

981
00:52:48,726 --> 00:52:51,406
(Not laughing)

982
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:56,486
Did contractors come

983
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,086
to this house today?

984
00:52:58,206 --> 00:52:59,006
What's the matter?

985
00:52:59,126 --> 00:53:01,486
It felt like several people
were here.

986
00:53:02,006 --> 00:53:03,846
(Endless dishes to wash today)

987
00:53:03,966 --> 00:53:06,086
Maybe around 20 people?

988
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:09,206
(This time he is stuck
in the torturous pit of dishes)

989
00:53:10,406 --> 00:53:11,406
It's a lot, isn't it?

990
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,406
A lot.

991
00:53:15,846 --> 00:53:20,006
(But he is not lonely
because there is music)

992
00:53:20,326 --> 00:53:24,166
('Are You Lonesome Tonight'
by Elvis Presley)

993
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:27,606
This was very common
back in those days.

994
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:30,166
They add a recital in the song.

995
00:53:30,286 --> 00:53:31,806
(1960s style of ringing rap)

996
00:53:31,926 --> 00:53:34,606
(The next song has the same style)

997
00:53:34,926 --> 00:53:39,126
('Kiss and Say Goodbye'
by The Manhattans)

998
00:53:44,206 --> 00:53:47,046
(He doesn't know the lyrics)

999
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,406
(Give)

1000
00:53:52,526 --> 00:53:54,166
(and take)

1001
00:53:54,286 --> 00:53:55,886
And I miss you.

1002
00:53:56,006 --> 00:53:58,406
(He never misses the best part)

1003
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:02,486
This sounds like
Korean-style lyrics.

1004
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:03,726
Yes, that's right.

1005
00:54:03,846 --> 00:54:05,806
(Perfect for the Korean soul)

1006
00:54:08,006 --> 00:54:10,846
Say goodbye.

1007
00:54:15,006 --> 00:54:16,806
(Ad-lib is a must)

1008
00:54:16,926 --> 00:54:19,806
How did we end up knowing
all these songs? Right?

1009
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:22,926
(A list of nostalgic pop songs
that they know very well)

1010
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:25,526
But honestly...

1011
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:29,606
(These songs were played often
on radios in the 80s and 90s)

1012
00:54:29,726 --> 00:54:32,766
We heard these songs in
'Lee Jonghwan's Night Disco Show.'

1013
00:54:32,886 --> 00:54:35,446
(Copying the opening)

1014
00:54:35,566 --> 00:54:36,806
Then...

1015
00:54:36,926 --> 00:54:40,486
DJ Lee Jonghwan will make
a remark right at that moment.

1016
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,086
(Late Lee Jonghwan was a
guest DJ on 'Night Disco Show',)

1017
00:54:44,206 --> 00:54:46,926
(a radio show that lasted from
1 April 1981 until 23 July 1989)

1018
00:54:47,566 --> 00:54:50,046
(When the opening song plays)

1019
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,926
Hello. I am Lee Jonghwan.

1020
00:54:53,326 --> 00:54:57,806
'This is my first time
to have you in my life.'

1021
00:54:57,926 --> 00:55:00,206
When a show was on air,

1022
00:55:00,326 --> 00:55:03,366
we would record it on a tape

1023
00:55:03,486 --> 00:55:05,406
to listen to it
over and over again.

1024
00:55:06,406 --> 00:55:09,846
(They are immersed
in their memories for now)

1025
00:55:10,486 --> 00:55:13,486
We used to write down lyrics
of pop songs in Hangeul before.

1026
00:55:13,606 --> 00:55:15,926
Yes. 'We are the World' too.

1027
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:19,406
Welcome to time.
Let me hear a certain call.

1028
00:55:19,526 --> 00:55:20,606
We wrote something like that.

1029
00:55:21,766 --> 00:55:24,846
(It's like an English listening
test with some Korean language)

1030
00:55:25,286 --> 00:55:28,046
(After being immersed
in their memories)

1031
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:31,926
(The time when stir-fried kimchi
is complete has come)

1032
00:55:33,726 --> 00:55:36,326
(He transfers stir-fried kimchi
into a glass container)

1033
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:43,846
(Sprinkle sesame seeds
as the final touch)

1034
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,606
I can tell it's tasty
based on the smell.

1035
00:55:46,606 --> 00:55:48,846
(Stir-fried kimchi is done)

1036
00:55:48,966 --> 00:55:51,886
(Haejin is almost done
doing all the dishes)

1037
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:53,126
Honey.

1038
00:55:53,246 --> 00:55:54,686
This is the last one.

1039
00:55:54,806 --> 00:55:58,126
(A tough pan to wash
is given to Haejin)

1040
00:56:00,206 --> 00:56:02,846
(After doing the dishes)

1041
00:56:04,606 --> 00:56:08,086
(The sky has started
to become dark)

1042
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:13,126
But...

1043
00:56:13,246 --> 00:56:15,286
The sun has started to set
when the dishes are done.

1044
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:17,006
It's time to eat dinner.

1045
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:18,966
What is this?

1046
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:21,446
What is this?

1047
00:56:22,766 --> 00:56:23,806
What is this?

1048
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:25,606
(An unexpected door cut)

1049
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,046
(Embarrassed)

1050
00:56:29,366 --> 00:56:31,606
(This mosquito net was set
to avoid mosquitoes entering)

1051
00:56:31,726 --> 00:56:33,206
(He was about to enter
after lowering his head)

1052
00:56:33,326 --> 00:56:34,246
What is this?

1053
00:56:34,366 --> 00:56:36,246
(We've never seen this kind
of precious scenes in 10 years)

1054
00:56:36,366 --> 00:56:38,366
(So we will show you the shot
from various angles)

1055
00:56:39,206 --> 00:56:41,286
(It was meant to block
only mosquitoes)

1056
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:43,486
This...

1057
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:46,046
(He damages the mosquito net
and enters the house

1058
00:56:47,686 --> 00:56:49,846
(He gets excited since
the dishes are almost done)

1059
00:56:50,846 --> 00:56:53,286
(He rinses the basin)

1060
00:56:54,086 --> 00:56:55,766
(Cleaning up the area)

1061
00:56:55,886 --> 00:56:56,846
Honey.

1062
00:56:56,966 --> 00:56:59,446
Have you washed
the chopping board? Where is it?

1063
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:00,686
There's no chopping board here.

1064
00:57:00,806 --> 00:57:02,766
(Here it is)

1065
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:03,686
I believe there is one here.

1066
00:57:03,806 --> 00:57:04,726
Here it is.

1067
00:57:04,846 --> 00:57:06,086
What about the knife? Knife...

1068
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,206
- Knife.
- Don't give or search it.

1069
00:57:08,326 --> 00:57:10,126
(He finds things himself)

1070
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:12,886
(He rinses his feet that are
dirty from doing the dishes)

1071
00:57:15,126 --> 00:57:17,366
(We'll leave after
filming your foot)

1072
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:19,926
(Slightly embarrassed)

1073
00:57:20,046 --> 00:57:22,286
(You can clearly see the signs
of Chuja Island on him)

1074
00:57:22,846 --> 00:57:25,446
(After washing his feet clean)

1075
00:57:25,886 --> 00:57:29,926
(It means he is done with
doing all the dishes)

1076
00:57:31,606 --> 00:57:33,926
(Chef Cha who is about
to cut the brisket)

1077
00:57:34,526 --> 00:57:37,206
(He starts by cutting it
into big pieces)

1078
00:57:38,446 --> 00:57:41,246
(Then he shreds it into
small pieces with his hands)

1079
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:47,886
(Peeking)

1080
00:57:50,326 --> 00:57:51,126
Honey.

1081
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:53,806
What are you doing?

1082
00:57:54,926 --> 00:57:57,126
By the time I'm done with
the dishes, it's getting dark.

1083
00:57:59,766 --> 00:58:04,166
We will be able to rest one of
these days after doing this.

1084
00:58:04,286 --> 00:58:05,286
Yes, that's right.

1085
00:58:06,646 --> 00:58:09,486
(They work hard to rest
in the future)

1086
00:58:09,606 --> 00:58:11,686
Please help me with that.

1087
00:58:11,806 --> 00:58:13,526
Then, I can keep this
inside the refrigerator.

1088
00:58:13,646 --> 00:58:15,646
Are we going to make
braised meat with this?

1089
00:58:15,766 --> 00:58:17,326
Not this.

1090
00:58:17,446 --> 00:58:19,766
That is made using top round.

1091
00:58:19,886 --> 00:58:21,766
This is brisket. It's expensive.

1092
00:58:21,886 --> 00:58:23,446
I don't know since I'm dull.

1093
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,686
(He has a way with words)

1094
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:27,886
(He takes some)

1095
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:29,606
This is very tender.

1096
00:58:29,926 --> 00:58:31,206
(Amazed)

1097
00:58:31,326 --> 00:58:32,366
Do we add this to
seaweed soup?

1098
00:58:32,486 --> 00:58:33,766
Yes, seaweed soup and such.

1099
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:35,326
You know your food well.

1100
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:36,646
I can taste it.

1101
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:38,166
You know your food well.

1102
00:58:38,286 --> 00:58:40,686
This is so tasty perhaps because
you cooked it for a long time.

1103
00:58:40,806 --> 00:58:43,606
(Tasty brisket that is tender and
moist when boiled for a long time)

1104
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:46,206
(They will add that
to rice cake soup)

1105
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,766
(He keeps the shredded brisket
inside the refrigerator)

1106
00:58:56,606 --> 00:58:59,006
(Chef Cha quickly leaves the room)

1107
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:03,206
(He starts to make kimchi)

1108
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:07,726
(Cut green onions into four parts)

1109
00:59:08,726 --> 00:59:11,686
(Slice onion thinly)

1110
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,646
(Haejin who is in charge
of garlic)

1111
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:22,646
(Blend garlic and ginger)

1112
00:59:23,886 --> 00:59:24,726
Add that here.

1113
00:59:24,846 --> 00:59:25,806
Put everything in.

1114
00:59:27,806 --> 00:59:30,166
(The garlic is not falling down)

1115
00:59:30,806 --> 00:59:32,486
Just scrape everything.

1116
00:59:33,406 --> 00:59:37,006
(He uses a spoon
to scrape everything)

1117
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:41,406
(Scraping every single bit)

1118
00:59:42,086 --> 00:59:44,966
(It's time to season it)

1119
00:59:45,526 --> 00:59:47,366
(Fine chili powder)

1120
00:59:47,486 --> 00:59:49,526
(Coarse chili powder)

1121
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:52,486
(Sand lance extract)

1122
00:59:52,846 --> 00:59:56,166
(Anchovies extract)

1123
00:59:56,766 --> 00:59:59,606
(Plum extract)

1124
01:00:00,006 --> 01:00:02,686
(Salt)

1125
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:07,206
(Mix everything well)

1126
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:14,766
(Mince salted shrimp finely)

1127
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,366
(He makes a fancy turn
to make the kimchi)

1128
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:26,606
(Checks to see if
something is missing)

1129
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:34,126
Come here.
Please sprinkle in some salt.

1130
01:00:34,246 --> 01:00:35,126
Just a bit.

1131
01:00:35,246 --> 01:00:39,326
Salt. Yes, just a bit.

1132
01:00:39,446 --> 01:00:40,446
There's a spoon in it.

1133
01:00:41,726 --> 01:00:43,166
Yes, Give me one spoonful.

1134
01:00:48,206 --> 01:00:50,566
There's sand lance extract
over there.

1135
01:00:50,686 --> 01:00:51,686
This is sand lance extract?

1136
01:00:51,806 --> 01:00:53,566
Pour some in this.

1137
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:55,206
That's enough.

1138
01:00:55,646 --> 01:00:57,566
That small amount
makes a difference?

1139
01:00:57,686 --> 01:01:00,406
(Fascinated)

1140
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:02,006
Just add flour paste
and it's done.

1141
01:01:03,766 --> 01:01:07,526
(He takes the flour paste
that he kept in the fridge)

1142
01:01:08,846 --> 01:01:10,606
It's thick.

1143
01:01:12,246 --> 01:01:13,286
Let's add this much.

1144
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:17,246
(Add flour paste
and mix them well)

1145
01:01:22,606 --> 01:01:24,966
(He keeps the kimchi
inside a container)

1146
01:01:26,406 --> 01:01:30,006
(Finally, sprinkle sesame seeds)

1147
01:01:40,006 --> 01:01:42,686
(Chef Cha's cabbage kimchi
is done)

1148
01:01:43,246 --> 01:01:46,046
(He cleans the dishes that
he used to make kimchi)

1149
01:01:46,446 --> 01:01:47,246
What are you doing?

1150
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:48,486
I have to wash these.

1151
01:01:48,606 --> 01:01:49,246
Let me do it.

1152
01:01:49,366 --> 01:01:51,126
No, I'll do it.

1153
01:01:51,246 --> 01:01:52,326
I just have to wash these.

1154
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:53,326
This is all.

1155
01:01:53,926 --> 01:01:57,246
(Seungwon who is done
with the dishes in a jiff)

1156
01:01:58,326 --> 01:02:01,446
(He takes the ladle again
to check on the broth)

1157
01:02:03,726 --> 01:02:05,606
(He removes the fats that
are floating on the surface)

1158
01:02:06,326 --> 01:02:08,766
(Haejin who has opened
the door to the storage room)

1159
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:11,646
(He comes out with a metal rod)

1160
01:02:12,246 --> 01:02:13,606
(He takes a hammer)

1161
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:17,446
(Hammering)

1162
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:19,046
(Pouting)

1163
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:21,006
(Unhappy)

1164
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:22,246
(He puts the hammer away)

1165
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:26,566
(He gets a variety of tools)

1166
01:02:27,086 --> 01:02:28,446
What else are you making?

1167
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,899
(What is Mr. Yoo thinking
of making?)

1168
01:02:40,579 --> 01:02:42,979
(He cuts the end of the rod)

1169
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:45,979
(He bends it)

1170
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:49,019
I have no idea what that is.

1171
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:49,779
What?

1172
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,459
(It is impossible to tell
what he is making this time)

1173
01:02:52,579 --> 01:02:54,059
I'm just trying this out.

1174
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:57,419
(He places the rod
on the faucet?)

1175
01:02:57,539 --> 01:02:59,139
What is this? Remote control?

1176
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:01,979
So, when we do the dishes...

1177
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:05,339
(Water gushes out of the hose)

1178
01:03:05,459 --> 01:03:07,779
(This is his plan)

1179
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:10,019
(A product that will reduce
the usage of their waist)

1180
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:12,859
(Actually, Mr. Yoo who was
doing the dishes earlier)

1181
01:03:13,339 --> 01:03:16,059
(felt uncomfortable reaching out
to the faucet that's far away)

1182
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:18,819
(He stretches his hands to it)

1183
01:03:18,939 --> 01:03:20,579
(Staring)

1184
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:22,819
(Twists it again)

1185
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:27,379
(He got an idea
after thinking for a long time)

1186
01:03:28,019 --> 01:03:31,659
(He tries to reduce
the distance with a rod)

1187
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:33,979
(It keeps on dropping)

1188
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:35,339
(Taking a deep breath)

1189
01:03:35,459 --> 01:03:36,659
I hope this works.

1190
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:38,659
(It will be great if
he can fasten it to the faucet)

1191
01:03:38,779 --> 01:03:40,059
This will be so convenient.

1192
01:03:42,379 --> 01:03:45,059
(In the end,
he gets the green tape)

1193
01:03:45,899 --> 01:03:47,819
- Honey.
- Yes.

1194
01:03:47,939 --> 01:03:49,019
Let's have dinner.

1195
01:03:50,859 --> 01:03:51,739
Already?

1196
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:53,859
(They had jjajangmyeon
only 2 hours ago)

1197
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:55,179
I'm done.

1198
01:03:55,979 --> 01:03:56,779
It's ready.

1199
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:57,579
You made kimchi?

1200
01:03:57,699 --> 01:03:58,619
I did.

1201
01:03:58,739 --> 01:03:59,499
Good job.

1202
01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:01,019
(Feeling refreshed)

1203
01:04:03,379 --> 01:04:05,819
(He covers the end of the rod
with green tape)

1204
01:04:06,779 --> 01:04:09,659
(He places it on the faucet)

1205
01:04:10,979 --> 01:04:14,459
(Simulation)

1206
01:04:15,419 --> 01:04:18,019
We can use it easily like this.

1207
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:20,139
Let's fasten it now.

1208
01:04:20,259 --> 01:04:21,979
I'll fasten it.

1209
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:26,699
(He fastens it on the faucet)

1210
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:36,979
Even I find this funny.

1211
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:38,579
This is of low quality.

1212
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:40,779
(He is embarrassed to show
off his creation)

1213
01:04:41,259 --> 01:04:42,859
Do you know what inspired me
to make this?

1214
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:43,979
What?

1215
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:45,299
B...

1216
01:04:45,419 --> 01:04:48,179
Bus. The thing that is used
to open bus doors.

1217
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:50,739
(Doors are open)

1218
01:04:50,859 --> 01:04:52,899
(Doors are closed)

1219
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,939
The angle is slightly raised.

1220
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:00,979
Only something original
will have that kind of angle.

1221
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:02,419
You need to get this
from the headquarters.

1222
01:05:02,939 --> 01:05:05,579
(This angle is only possible
if made by the headquarters)

1223
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:07,699
Copies will not be able
to get that angle, will they?

1224
01:05:07,819 --> 01:05:09,139
Nobody can recreate this.

1225
01:05:10,779 --> 01:05:12,699
Shall I make this?

1226
01:05:12,819 --> 01:05:13,739
Mulmoa?

1227
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:15,339
It's because we get
to save water.

1228
01:05:16,419 --> 01:05:18,019
That is Bulmoa and this is Mulmoa.

1229
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:19,179
That is Yeolmoa.

1230
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:20,179
Yeolmoa.

1231
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:22,339
(Sad)

1232
01:05:22,979 --> 01:05:24,779
I'm confused because
I made a lot of things.

1233
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:30,659
(The collaboration between
equipment team and green)

1234
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:37,779
(The original's angle that
nobody can ever recreate)

1235
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:41,419
(It prides itself
on its classy finishing)

1236
01:05:45,739 --> 01:05:48,819
(Second product from
3 Meals Steel, Mulmoa)

1237
01:05:49,299 --> 01:05:51,939
You can just use it like this
when doing the dishes.

1238
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:53,379
(He explains how it is used)

1239
01:05:53,499 --> 01:05:54,699
Don't pull it too strongly.

1240
01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:55,539
Why not?

1241
01:05:56,899 --> 01:05:58,539
Then, you would need it fixed.

1242
01:05:58,659 --> 01:06:00,899
I will do it gently like this.

1243
01:06:02,419 --> 01:06:03,379
After that...

1244
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:05,859
Isn't this comfortable?

1245
01:06:05,979 --> 01:06:06,859
That is boiling.

1246
01:06:06,979 --> 01:06:08,899
(He wraps it up with a joke)

1247
01:06:09,019 --> 01:06:09,699
Great.

1248
01:06:09,819 --> 01:06:11,459
(He checks on the broth)

1249
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:14,819
- Let it boil longer?
- Just leave it be.

1250
01:06:14,939 --> 01:06:16,739
Just let it boil until
that fire dies out.

1251
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:17,699
Okay.

1252
01:06:19,379 --> 01:06:20,819
My goodness.

1253
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:23,459
It's 6:45PM?

1254
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,539
(They never stopped working
since they arrived)

1255
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:31,579
(It has started to get dark)

1256
01:06:32,979 --> 01:06:35,539
(The sun that was blinding)

1257
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:38,499
(is hiding behind the cloud)

1258
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:56,339
(It's nighttime in Mount Jiri)

1259
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:03,859
Squash.

1260
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:05,819
We just need squash?

1261
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:09,299
(It's time to make dinner)

1262
01:07:12,739 --> 01:07:15,419
(He turns on some music
before he starts the fire)

1263
01:07:15,819 --> 01:07:16,859
(He pulls the antenna)

1264
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:19,179
(He gets the antenna
to listen to the radio)

1265
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:21,979
(We can clearly hear
a familiar voice)

1266
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:24,139
(He places it on the wooden bench
to hear it clearly)

1267
01:07:24,979 --> 01:07:27,339
(He gets the items needed
to start a fire)

1268
01:07:27,459 --> 01:07:29,699
(Items: Newspaper)

1269
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:33,259
(Chair)

1270
01:07:33,379 --> 01:07:36,059
(Firewood)

1271
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:39,179
(Mr. Yoo's dinnertime routine
has begun)

1272
01:07:39,979 --> 01:07:42,979
(He starts with firewood)

1273
01:07:43,979 --> 01:07:44,819
(Empty)

1274
01:07:44,939 --> 01:07:46,699
(He gets more firewood)

1275
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:51,859
(A lot)

1276
01:07:51,979 --> 01:07:54,139
(He takes one more)

1277
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:02,379
(He adds another piece
of firewood)

1278
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:04,219
(He gets ready to tear
the newspaper)

1279
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:10,379
(It goes into the brazier)

1280
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:18,539
(He places the lighted match
into the brazier too)

1281
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:22,179
(Seungwon is standing in front
of the shelf with mushrooms)

1282
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:24,419
(Oyster mushrooms)

1283
01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:25,939
(One mushroom)

1284
01:08:26,059 --> 01:08:26,859
(Two mushrooms)

1285
01:08:28,179 --> 01:08:29,939
(Three mushrooms)

1286
01:08:30,059 --> 01:08:31,379
(He takes all of them)

1287
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:34,859
(He excitedly goes out)

1288
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:37,179
(He can't open the door)

1289
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:41,299
(He surprisingly steps out
in a cool way)

1290
01:08:41,419 --> 01:08:42,659
What are you doing?

1291
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:43,619
What are you doing?

1292
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:45,419
- You're starting a fire?
- You're making stew, aren't you?

1293
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,379
Yes.

1294
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:50,139
(Dinner menu: Black pork belly
with squash stew)

1295
01:08:50,499 --> 01:08:52,499
(He places the mushrooms
inside a basket)

1296
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:54,379
(Being wary of Seungwon)

1297
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:56,339
No, the opposite side.

1298
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,139
(He gets water if he twists
it in the opposite direction)

1299
01:08:59,539 --> 01:09:02,579
You should just use the faucet
if you're on that side.

1300
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:04,219
- Really?
- Yes.

1301
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:05,859
- Yes.
- But still...

1302
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:09,938
(Next up is time to prepare
the onion)

1303
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:10,978
Just...

1304
01:09:12,299 --> 01:09:14,019
I'm not adding meat
to the squash stew.

1305
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:15,139
Okay.

1306
01:09:15,978 --> 01:09:17,978
(He focuses on the onion again)

1307
01:09:18,938 --> 01:09:22,219
(He cuts and removes the peel)

1308
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:25,539
(He peels using his face)

1309
01:09:27,219 --> 01:09:28,499
(Struggling)

1310
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:31,978
(After rinsing it under water)

1311
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:39,379
(He cuts it
into bite-sized pieces)

1312
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:44,139
(Cut the mushrooms)

1313
01:09:46,299 --> 01:09:48,978
(After cutting the squash
into half)

1314
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,978
(Cut it vertically)

1315
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:58,459
(Cut it into slightly thick pieces
to add texture to the dish)

1316
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:04,619
(Slice chilies diagonally)

1317
01:10:07,978 --> 01:10:11,219
(All ingredients to make
squash stew are ready)

1318
01:10:11,339 --> 01:10:15,299
Hold on. We need lettuce,
don't we?

1319
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:16,739
Lettuce and sesame leaves.

1320
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:17,419
Okay.

1321
01:10:17,539 --> 01:10:19,779
Lettuce, sesame leaves,
chilies, garlic.

1322
01:10:20,779 --> 01:10:23,379
(Trudging to the vegetable patch)

1323
01:10:24,259 --> 01:10:26,499
(He harvests lettuce first)

1324
01:10:27,938 --> 01:10:28,978
(My goodness)

1325
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:36,259
Lettuce.

1326
01:10:36,379 --> 01:10:37,938
No, I don't need crown daisy.

1327
01:10:40,379 --> 01:10:41,699
He doesn't want crown daisy.

1328
01:10:41,819 --> 01:10:42,699
(He has the courage
to be hated)

1329
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:44,419
Is this Cheongyang? Or chili?

1330
01:10:44,859 --> 01:10:46,619
(Next is to harvest
Cheongyang or chili)

1331
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:48,379
(Pushing it sideways)

1332
01:10:48,898 --> 01:10:49,779
I can't see any.

1333
01:10:51,419 --> 01:10:53,699
(He moves to the next tree)

1334
01:10:54,419 --> 01:10:56,779
(Only Haejin
couldn't see the chilies)

1335
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:58,379
(He looks here)

1336
01:10:58,898 --> 01:10:59,739
(and there)

1337
01:10:59,859 --> 01:11:01,819
(And finally sees chilies)

1338
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,978
(Chili bonanza)

1339
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:07,379
(He takes everything)

1340
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:08,898
This smells amazing.

1341
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:12,779
(Finally,
he harvests sesame leaves)

1342
01:11:14,898 --> 01:11:17,978
(Seungwon pours water
into the wok)

1343
01:11:20,978 --> 01:11:23,579
(He places it on top of Yeolmoa)

1344
01:11:24,898 --> 01:11:27,579
(He takes a broth pan
and anchovies)

1345
01:11:28,739 --> 01:11:30,019
(He pours water into the pan)

1346
01:11:30,898 --> 01:11:32,779
(He removes the innards
of the anchovies)

1347
01:11:34,938 --> 01:11:36,179
(He puts them in)

1348
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:38,379
The lettuce...

1349
01:11:39,259 --> 01:11:40,859
Let me see how much
you have harvested.

1350
01:11:40,978 --> 01:11:42,339
(He checks on Haejin's homework)

1351
01:11:42,459 --> 01:11:43,059
It's not that good?

1352
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:44,619
Not bad.

1353
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:46,139
(He passes)

1354
01:11:46,259 --> 01:11:50,459
How are the lettuce, sesame
leaves, and chilies this summer?

1355
01:11:50,579 --> 01:11:52,779
(This time, he changes the song
into an unknown genre)

1356
01:11:53,499 --> 01:11:56,898
This would taste better if
we add vinegar to it.

1357
01:11:57,019 --> 01:12:01,139
(Washing vegetables with vinegar
will get rid of bacteria)

1358
01:12:01,259 --> 01:12:02,938
(He takes both garlic and vinegar)

1359
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:07,099
(And pours a generous amount
of vinegar)

1360
01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:08,579
(Mulmoa is used well)

1361
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,219
This is very easy to use.

1362
01:12:10,339 --> 01:12:12,019
(He is bragging
about what he made)

1363
01:12:13,019 --> 01:12:15,739
(He washes the vegetables clean)

1364
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,898
(He rinses the lettuce)

1365
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:22,339
(He adds more vinegar)

1366
01:12:23,179 --> 01:12:25,139
(Pouring in lots of vinegar)

1367
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:27,898
(Washing it hard)

1368
01:12:28,019 --> 01:12:29,619
(He is washing the vegetables
like doing the laundry?)

1369
01:12:30,699 --> 01:12:32,938
(While he peels the garlic)

1370
01:12:33,259 --> 01:12:35,978
(He soaks the vegetables
in vinegar mixed with water)

1371
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:39,059
(He rinses it again)

1372
01:12:40,179 --> 01:12:42,579
(Chef Cha is anxious due to
the long time washing vegetables)

1373
01:12:42,699 --> 01:12:43,978
That's done.

1374
01:12:45,019 --> 01:12:47,619
(He throws away the mixture
of vinegar)

1375
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:51,299
(And moves the vegetables
inside the basin again)

1376
01:12:51,898 --> 01:12:53,779
(Staring)

1377
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:57,259
(Being wary)

1378
01:12:57,898 --> 01:12:59,099
Did I rinse it too much?

1379
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:00,619
The water is green.

1380
01:13:04,059 --> 01:13:06,059
(The water is green?)

1381
01:13:06,699 --> 01:13:07,459
Why?

1382
01:13:07,579 --> 01:13:08,659
(Trying to understand
the situation)

1383
01:13:08,779 --> 01:13:12,019
You can't wash vegetables like how
Kwangsoo washes abalones.

1384
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:13,059
(Frustrated)

1385
01:13:13,179 --> 01:13:14,819
I think the vegetables
have lost their color.

1386
01:13:14,938 --> 01:13:17,499
All of them have wilted.

1387
01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:19,339
(He tries to resuscitate them)

1388
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:23,379
(He rinses them in water)

1389
01:13:24,139 --> 01:13:27,219
(He shakes the vegetables
to remove the water)

1390
01:13:29,019 --> 01:13:30,139
Done.

1391
01:13:36,219 --> 01:13:39,379
(He is about to plate up
the washed lettuce)

1392
01:13:40,139 --> 01:13:41,459
(Checking)

1393
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:43,139
Why are they like this?

1394
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:46,699
This...

1395
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:47,779
Nothing looks fine.

1396
01:13:48,099 --> 01:13:50,739
(The lettuce and sesame leaves
look wilted)

1397
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:52,978
What?

1398
01:13:53,739 --> 01:13:55,259
(He is quiet when
he hears Seungwon's question)

1399
01:13:55,379 --> 01:13:56,859
(Shocked)

1400
01:13:57,339 --> 01:14:00,379
Why did you soak those
in vinegar?

1401
01:14:00,499 --> 01:14:01,859
My goodness.

1402
01:14:02,579 --> 01:14:04,659
(Shock and fear)

1403
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:05,419
No...

1404
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:07,619
But...

1405
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:08,779
Why is it like this?

1406
01:14:08,898 --> 01:14:11,859
You shouldn't have bullied
the vegetables like that.

1407
01:14:11,978 --> 01:14:14,699
This is what I did back home.

1408
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:16,219
(Confused)

1409
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:19,019
(How does it taste?)

1410
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:21,179
(One more time)

1411
01:14:22,099 --> 01:14:22,898
How is it?

1412
01:14:23,019 --> 01:14:23,859
What?

1413
01:14:23,978 --> 01:14:24,938
It's okay.

1414
01:14:25,059 --> 01:14:27,339
(Although he said it's okay)

1415
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:28,579
This is bad.

1416
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:31,619
Is it okay?

1417
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:33,779
Don't worry yourself about it.

1418
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:37,179
(He gets rid of the evidence)

1419
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:40,179
How is it? You tasted it?

1420
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:45,699
These are like pickles.

1421
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:47,898
(Dumbfounded)

1422
01:14:48,579 --> 01:14:50,859
How much vinegar did you add?

1423
01:14:50,978 --> 01:14:52,259
You should use only
a couple of drops.

1424
01:14:52,379 --> 01:14:53,139
I did that.

1425
01:14:53,499 --> 01:14:54,859
(It's clear that he was lying)

1426
01:14:54,978 --> 01:14:56,219
My goodness.

1427
01:14:56,339 --> 01:14:56,779
You

1428
01:14:56,898 --> 01:14:58,059
just added lots of it, didn't you?

1429
01:14:58,179 --> 01:14:58,819
Yes.

1430
01:14:58,938 --> 01:15:00,539
(The sin of loving vinegar)

1431
01:15:05,099 --> 01:15:06,779
Are you a goat or something?

1432
01:15:07,499 --> 01:15:09,179
What should I do?

1433
01:15:09,299 --> 01:15:10,459
But this...

1434
01:15:11,339 --> 01:15:13,938
(He has no choice but
to finish this up)

1435
01:15:14,499 --> 01:15:15,739
Stop eating.

1436
01:15:17,339 --> 01:15:18,299
Listen up.

1437
01:15:19,379 --> 01:15:20,259
Just now...

1438
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:23,659
the water was very green.

1439
01:15:23,779 --> 01:15:25,579
I guess I scrubbed
the vegetables too much.

1440
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,379
(He only realized it much later)

1441
01:15:30,938 --> 01:15:32,419
(Giggling)

1442
01:15:35,379 --> 01:15:36,779
Let me taste one.

1443
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:41,938
(He tastes the pickled lettuce)

1444
01:15:42,499 --> 01:15:43,739
It is fresh.

1445
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:44,938
It is.

1446
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:48,259
The lettuce is still fresh.

1447
01:15:50,099 --> 01:15:52,179
But what happened?

1448
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:54,619
Why are you still eating them?
Are you a goat?

1449
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:58,499
Let's just have this as lettuce.

1450
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:00,859
Okay? Alright?

1451
01:16:00,978 --> 01:16:04,219
Let's turn this into lettuce.

1452
01:16:08,179 --> 01:16:09,579
Stop eating.

1453
01:16:10,619 --> 01:16:12,938
Are you eating your wrap
beforehand?

1454
01:16:13,059 --> 01:16:15,259
(Chef Cha goes to the fridge)

1455
01:16:15,379 --> 01:16:16,978
(He uses his height
to open the doors)

1456
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:19,898
(He takes out gochujang)

1457
01:16:20,339 --> 01:16:22,539
(He takes out other seasonings
too)

1458
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:27,299
(He puts the ingredients
in the rack)

1459
01:16:27,898 --> 01:16:29,659
(A lot)

1460
01:16:30,259 --> 01:16:31,978
(Next, fan it)

1461
01:16:33,139 --> 01:16:35,339
- Why? The fire is out?
- No, I want it to be bigger.

1462
01:16:35,459 --> 01:16:37,019
I'll make it a bit bigger
so it will cook faster.

1463
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:39,819
(Add more firewood too)

1464
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:42,779
(After he fans it with energy)

1465
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,978
(Add it to plain water)

1466
01:16:45,379 --> 01:16:48,019
(The broth is boiling)

1467
01:16:50,179 --> 01:16:53,419
(He removes the broth pack
and anchovies from the water)

1468
01:16:54,139 --> 01:16:56,419
(Add one ladle of gochujang
as the base)

1469
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,779
(Mix it well in the broth)

1470
01:17:01,539 --> 01:17:02,978
(Vegetables)

1471
01:17:03,339 --> 01:17:04,579
(Chili powder)

1472
01:17:05,419 --> 01:17:07,898
(Add the vegetables
that were prepared earlier)

1473
01:17:08,539 --> 01:17:11,499
(Chili powder that will make
it even spicier)

1474
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:18,379
(Pour in some anchovy extract
to make it more savory)

1475
01:17:19,379 --> 01:17:20,978
(A bit of salt)

1476
01:17:21,978 --> 01:17:23,579
How are you going to season it?

1477
01:17:23,699 --> 01:17:24,539
Salted shrimps.

1478
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:27,179
Yes. We need salted shrimp
when making squash stew.

1479
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:30,219
(He uses salted shrimp
to season the stew)

1480
01:17:30,339 --> 01:17:32,019
Wash that? Do you need me
to wash that ladle?

1481
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:35,619
(Haejin is back by the faucet)

1482
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:38,379
(Seungwon is in front
of the chopping board)

1483
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:41,539
(Slice Welsh onion diagonally)

1484
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:49,659
(He tastes it)

1485
01:17:53,099 --> 01:17:54,619
(He adds salt)

1486
01:17:56,978 --> 01:17:57,659
(Sniffing)

1487
01:17:57,779 --> 01:17:59,619
(He adds fish soy sauce)

1488
01:18:01,339 --> 01:18:03,379
(The squash stew has been
seasoned to perfection)

1489
01:18:04,779 --> 01:18:08,339
(Let it boil)

1490
01:18:17,938 --> 01:18:19,978
(He checks the fire)

1491
01:18:23,379 --> 01:18:25,139
(He waits behind Seungwon)

1492
01:18:25,259 --> 01:18:26,579
Give me that. I'll do it.

1493
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:28,739
(They change spots)

1494
01:18:29,499 --> 01:18:31,339
I can smell something spicy.

1495
01:18:31,459 --> 01:18:33,859
(It's time to add tofu after
letting it simmer for some time)

1496
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:37,099
(Wash tofu under running water)

1497
01:18:37,539 --> 01:18:39,539
(He cuts it in the box
instead of on the chopping board)

1498
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:44,579
(Add tofu into the red stew)

1499
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:48,339
We're going to have
samgyeopsal with this?

1500
01:18:48,459 --> 01:18:50,139
Yes. We can grill it here.

1501
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:51,819
We'll let this boil longer.

1502
01:18:52,859 --> 01:18:56,539
(While waiting for the stew
to simmer)

1503
01:18:56,938 --> 01:18:58,659
I stacked too many things here.

1504
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:01,739
(Taking things one by one)

1505
01:19:02,898 --> 01:19:06,339
(He organizes the plates
that they used for lunch)

1506
01:19:10,019 --> 01:19:12,978
(After Seungwon wipes
the table clean)

1507
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:21,499
(He scoops some gochujang
into a small bowl)

1508
01:19:22,779 --> 01:19:26,339
(He uses another bowl
for sesame oil)

1509
01:19:28,219 --> 01:19:30,499
(Sprinkle some black pepper on it)

1510
01:19:31,978 --> 01:19:34,419
(He takes both bowls
to the seasoning rack)

1511
01:19:35,179 --> 01:19:37,139
(Add some salt)

1512
01:19:39,819 --> 01:19:41,938
(1 spoon)

1513
01:19:42,059 --> 01:19:43,419
(2 spoons)

1514
01:19:47,938 --> 01:19:51,779
(The sauces to dip samgyeopsal
into are ready)

1515
01:19:52,978 --> 01:19:55,579
(Next is time to prepare
the black pork samgyeopsal)

1516
01:19:56,099 --> 01:19:59,978
(Cut it into smaller pieces)

1517
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:03,339
(Next, it's time to grill
samgyeopsal and kimchi)

1518
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:07,579
(Remove the stem and
put it back inside the container)

1519
01:20:10,659 --> 01:20:12,019
This will be done soon.

1520
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:16,379
(The simmered squash stew
looks appetizing now)

1521
01:20:18,579 --> 01:20:21,419
(Checks the flavor)

1522
01:20:21,978 --> 01:20:23,859
(Add a bit more water)

1523
01:20:23,978 --> 01:20:27,619
Honey, the fire...

1524
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:28,379
Make it bigger?

1525
01:20:28,859 --> 01:20:31,019
(It's because it's now time
to grill samgyeopsal)

1526
01:20:31,379 --> 01:20:35,179
I think we have to move
the fire over there.

1527
01:20:35,299 --> 01:20:37,139
Where? The smaller brazier?

1528
01:20:37,259 --> 01:20:39,699
This brazier is too big
for the lid.

1529
01:20:40,978 --> 01:20:42,259
(After getting the lid
to grill samgyeopsal on)

1530
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,978
Yes, it has to be like this.

1531
01:20:46,379 --> 01:20:48,139
(He puts it at one corner)

1532
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:51,779
(He removes the broth for now)

1533
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:56,699
I'll remove it now.

1534
01:20:58,259 --> 01:21:00,579
(He moves the firewood
to the other brazier)

1535
01:21:05,459 --> 01:21:08,019
(Lid)

1536
01:21:09,379 --> 01:21:11,059
(He covers the stew pot
with a lid)

1537
01:21:12,019 --> 01:21:12,819
Okay.

1538
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:16,179
(He places the lid to grill
samgyeopsal over the fire)

1539
01:21:17,259 --> 01:21:20,099
(Wipe it clean and it's ready
to grill samgyeopsal)

1540
01:21:20,579 --> 01:21:22,819
Now, this... Cha!

1541
01:21:22,938 --> 01:21:24,579
This is getting hot now.

1542
01:21:24,699 --> 01:21:27,819
(Getting hot)

1543
01:21:27,938 --> 01:21:28,819
Already?

1544
01:21:28,938 --> 01:21:29,938
Yes.

1545
01:21:30,059 --> 01:21:31,259
Shall I place it here later?

1546
01:21:31,379 --> 01:21:33,219
No, you can start grilling a bit
now.

1547
01:21:34,499 --> 01:21:36,339
I'll get angry if
we don't start now.

1548
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:37,619
Pour oil in first.

1549
01:21:38,619 --> 01:21:39,938
(He coats the lid with fat)

1550
01:21:41,179 --> 01:21:44,938
(Coat every spot)

1551
01:21:46,299 --> 01:21:47,579
Let me do it.

1552
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:48,978
(Change of member)

1553
01:21:49,099 --> 01:21:50,779
(Seungwon is cutting
kimchi into smaller pieces)

1554
01:21:50,898 --> 01:21:52,019
The fire is too strong.

1555
01:21:52,139 --> 01:21:53,299
This is too strong.

1556
01:21:54,259 --> 01:21:55,419
I'll be quick.

1557
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:58,819
(He cuts the kimchi quickly)

1558
01:21:58,938 --> 01:22:01,539
(He places black samgyeopsal
over the fire)

1559
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:15,339
This smells amazing.

1560
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:19,059
(He leaves the middle part empty)

1561
01:22:20,179 --> 01:22:21,619
(He places kimchi
at the empty spot)

1562
01:22:27,139 --> 01:22:29,059
The fire has to be bigger.

1563
01:22:29,179 --> 01:22:30,898
(The fire is weaker now)

1564
01:22:31,219 --> 01:22:33,459
This gets smaller faster.

1565
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:35,259
(Don't feel stressed)

1566
01:22:35,379 --> 01:22:37,859
(The fire manager
will solve it right away)

1567
01:22:40,139 --> 01:22:43,619
(The fire is bigger now)

1568
01:22:44,179 --> 01:22:45,978
(Haejin helps to flip
the samgyeopsal too)

1569
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:47,259
It takes time to cook

1570
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:50,859
because it is quite thick.
So let them cook longer.

1571
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:03,659
(Cut the thick ones into half)

1572
01:23:13,299 --> 01:23:14,539
Shall we mix the kimchi with meat?

1573
01:23:14,659 --> 01:23:17,139
No. Leave it in the middle
so it absorbs the fat.

1574
01:23:17,978 --> 01:23:21,299
(Kimchi tastes better after
it absorbs the fat)

1575
01:23:21,419 --> 01:23:23,179
Just let it cook a bit longer.

1576
01:23:50,938 --> 01:23:52,978
(They place the well-grilled meat
on a plate)

1577
01:23:55,179 --> 01:23:56,259
(He drops one by mistake)

1578
01:23:57,179 --> 01:23:58,379
(Such a waste)

1579
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:00,459
Meat... No.

1580
01:24:00,579 --> 01:24:01,299
Shall I plate the kimchi?

1581
01:24:01,419 --> 01:24:03,379
Kimchi first.
Plate them in the middle.

1582
01:24:03,499 --> 01:24:06,779
(Kimchi goes in the middle)

1583
01:24:24,019 --> 01:24:25,179
Done.

1584
01:24:27,579 --> 01:24:30,259
(Their dinner is ready)

1585
01:24:36,579 --> 01:24:41,059
(Just looking at samgyeopsal
can make people drool)

1586
01:24:44,859 --> 01:24:46,938
(Beside it)

1587
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:49,699
(Spicy squash stew)

1588
01:24:53,019 --> 01:24:57,859
(Wilted lettuce that was
soaked in vinegar)

1589
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:02,859
(Their delicious dinner is ready)

1590
01:25:02,978 --> 01:25:04,379
The lettuce...

1591
01:25:05,179 --> 01:25:06,779
Is it okay for us
to eat it like this?

1592
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:10,179
They are all wilted now.
What's wrong with it?

1593
01:25:10,978 --> 01:25:12,219
This lettuce...

1594
01:25:12,699 --> 01:25:15,299
(Take a few layers of lettuce
that I made)

1595
01:25:17,419 --> 01:25:20,259
(Dip samgyeopsal in gochujang)

1596
01:25:22,219 --> 01:25:23,819
(Add garlic)

1597
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:26,099
(And fit everything
into his mouth)

1598
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:27,779
(Yum)

1599
01:25:31,579 --> 01:25:35,219
(Seungwon wraps the meat
inside pickled lettuce)

1600
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:44,219
This is tasty.

1601
01:25:51,419 --> 01:25:55,499
(Add kimchi to meat)

1602
01:25:55,619 --> 01:25:56,659
(and more meat)

1603
01:25:58,219 --> 01:25:59,259
This is good.

1604
01:26:04,019 --> 01:26:06,299
This is amazing.

1605
01:26:06,419 --> 01:26:08,139
The meat is so tasty.

1606
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:11,539
(Dip the tasty meat
in the oil seasoning)

1607
01:26:15,259 --> 01:26:17,739
(Wrap grilled kimchi
and eat it in one mouthful)

1608
01:26:18,819 --> 01:26:20,659
(Hot)

1609
01:26:22,259 --> 01:26:25,379
(Seungwon picks two pieces
and dips them in salt)

1610
01:26:26,779 --> 01:26:29,779
(Grilled kimchi
in samgyeopsal fat)

1611
01:26:32,379 --> 01:26:35,179
Why is this so good?

1612
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:40,539
This is...

1613
01:26:40,659 --> 01:26:42,779
There is a difference in quality.

1614
01:26:43,179 --> 01:26:44,379
(Dipping it in the oil sauce)

1615
01:26:48,978 --> 01:26:51,019
(Nodding as it's tasty)

1616
01:26:51,779 --> 01:26:54,819
(Next is squash stew)

1617
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:00,659
I haven't had squash stew
in a long time.

1618
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:05,419
(Seungwon eats squash stew too)

1619
01:27:09,499 --> 01:27:10,619
(Yummy)

1620
01:27:14,779 --> 01:27:15,579
This is tasty.

1621
01:27:21,739 --> 01:27:22,978
This is very good.

1622
01:27:23,859 --> 01:27:26,699
This is not gamey at all.

1623
01:27:26,819 --> 01:27:29,659
(They are still praising
the black pork)

1624
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:33,499
(The pork is not gamey)

1625
01:27:35,779 --> 01:27:37,859
The meat tastes different.

1626
01:27:39,779 --> 01:27:41,579
This tastes very different.

1627
01:27:42,819 --> 01:27:44,659
You have to do it like this.

1628
01:27:44,779 --> 01:27:46,539
I don't know what this is.

1629
01:28:04,339 --> 01:28:06,779
I wasn't planning on eating dinner
but my goodness.

1630
01:28:14,339 --> 01:28:17,619
The problem with this is that
we eat it too fast.

1631
01:28:17,739 --> 01:28:19,739
(They are almost done
with dinner)

1632
01:28:20,299 --> 01:28:21,699
You're done eating?

1633
01:28:21,819 --> 01:28:23,419
- Huh?
- You're done?

1634
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:24,459
There is some left.

1635
01:28:24,579 --> 01:28:25,659
(Why?)

1636
01:28:25,779 --> 01:28:27,579
If you're done,
please make us fried rice.

1637
01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:28,739
(A very confident request)

1638
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:31,659
- Really? Fried rice?
- It's for us.

1639
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:32,859
Only if you're done eating.

1640
01:28:32,978 --> 01:28:34,459
Okay. I'll do that. Hold on.

1641
01:28:35,099 --> 01:28:38,139
(He starts by cutting
samgyeopsal into smaller pieces)

1642
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:41,539
(He adds rice to it)

1643
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:47,059
Please add this at the end.

1644
01:28:47,179 --> 01:28:48,699
(He passes laver flakes)

1645
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:52,499
It's because this is for us.

1646
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:53,339
Please make it with care.

1647
01:28:53,459 --> 01:28:54,819
Okay. I'll do that.

1648
01:28:56,579 --> 01:28:59,299
(First, he fries the rice)

1649
01:29:03,059 --> 01:29:04,819
(Sprinkle black pepper on top)

1650
01:29:05,379 --> 01:29:08,419
(Salt)

1651
01:29:12,898 --> 01:29:15,059
(Sesame oil)

1652
01:29:15,179 --> 01:29:16,219
(Eggs)

1653
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:18,739
(Pour sesame oil in first)

1654
01:29:20,059 --> 01:29:21,819
What is that?

1655
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:24,059
(Special service)

1656
01:29:28,379 --> 01:29:30,898
(Finally, he adds laver flakes
as requested)

1657
01:29:31,019 --> 01:29:31,978
This looks amazing.

1658
01:29:38,019 --> 01:29:38,779
Done.

1659
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:43,938
Okay.

1660
01:29:45,859 --> 01:29:47,099
Thank you.

1661
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:48,299
May you live a long life.

1662
01:29:49,019 --> 01:29:51,059
(Proud)

1663
01:29:51,938 --> 01:29:54,619
(He represents all staff
and takes the first bite)

1664
01:30:04,339 --> 01:30:06,779
This tastes as if he fried
every single grain.

1665
01:30:08,099 --> 01:30:08,978
This is a masterpiece.

1666
01:30:10,779 --> 01:30:14,499
(All staff take one bite)

1667
01:30:17,019 --> 01:30:17,779
This is tasty.

1668
01:30:18,339 --> 01:30:19,259
Did you try this?

1669
01:30:20,299 --> 01:30:26,259
(Black pork samgyeopsal that
is made by Chef Cha)

1670
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:27,499
This is very tasty.

1671
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:33,938
(Everybody is busy eating
their delicious dinner)

1672
01:30:35,459 --> 01:30:37,379
Anyway, what is for breakfast?

1673
01:30:38,179 --> 01:30:39,099
(He adjusts his glasses)

1674
01:30:40,379 --> 01:30:42,059
You said no breakfast.

1675
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:43,179
That's what you said.

1676
01:30:43,299 --> 01:30:44,019
Okay. Fine.

1677
01:30:44,139 --> 01:30:47,019
We can just cook rice cake soup
when our guest arrives for lunch.

1678
01:30:47,579 --> 01:30:48,539
Is someone coming tomorrow?

1679
01:30:49,938 --> 01:30:51,699
I bet someone is.

1680
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:52,699
Are you joking?

1681
01:30:52,819 --> 01:30:55,139
(Do you think our 10 years
of experience means nothing?)

1682
01:30:55,259 --> 01:30:57,139
So for breakfast tomorrow,

1683
01:30:57,259 --> 01:30:58,659
we can just have apples.

1684
01:30:58,779 --> 01:31:02,819
By the time we go grocery
shopping, our guest will be here.

1685
01:31:02,938 --> 01:31:06,579
Then, we can make gomtang
and rice cake soup.

1686
01:31:06,699 --> 01:31:09,219
Then we can just think about
what to make for dinner.

1687
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:10,459
Our guest would bring something.

1688
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:12,059
Just in case

1689
01:31:13,339 --> 01:31:15,059
that person is empty-handed,
send that person back.

1690
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:17,938
(This will be their first time
to refuse a gust)

1691
01:31:18,059 --> 01:31:19,898
If the guest is empty-handed,
we can make budae jjigae.

1692
01:31:20,019 --> 01:31:22,859
Yes, that works for sure.

1693
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:27,259
The next morning,
we can grill clams and such.

1694
01:31:27,379 --> 01:31:30,579
Not sure about lunch, though.

1695
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:32,978
(Super J's perfect plan)

1696
01:31:42,859 --> 01:31:45,459
(Haejin is on his way
to take a shower)

1697
01:31:46,699 --> 01:31:51,259
(He makes a sudden turn
and goes to the room)

1698
01:31:53,579 --> 01:31:55,379
Is this the guest's room?

1699
01:32:00,579 --> 01:32:03,259
(After checking out the room)

1700
01:32:03,379 --> 01:32:07,419
(He enters the shower room)

1701
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:11,978
Cha!

1702
01:32:13,259 --> 01:32:14,019
Cha!

1703
01:32:26,915 --> 01:32:27,915
Me?

1704
01:32:28,035 --> 01:32:30,155
(He can't hear Seungwon's voice)

1705
01:32:30,635 --> 01:32:33,635
(Haejin steps out after
taking a short shower)

1706
01:32:39,115 --> 01:32:42,514
(He attacks an insect
while drying his hair)

1707
01:32:44,554 --> 01:32:49,115
(Their long day has ended)

1708
01:32:50,715 --> 01:32:57,195
(The first night in Mount Jiri
gets deeper)

1709
01:33:07,195 --> 01:33:08,915
(While the house owners are away)

1710
01:33:09,035 --> 01:33:11,275
(Someone has arrived
while sighing?)

1711
01:33:11,915 --> 01:33:13,915
(The fourth guest of 3 Meals House
is Uhm Taegoo)

1712
01:33:14,035 --> 01:33:14,795
Taegoo!

1713
01:33:14,915 --> 01:33:15,995
(Stands up)

1714
01:33:16,115 --> 01:33:18,235
(Thankfully, Taegoo is familiar
with the house owners)

1715
01:33:18,355 --> 01:33:21,554
(However, this is his first time
at 3 Meals House)

1716
01:33:21,675 --> 01:33:23,675
(Running)

1717
01:33:23,795 --> 01:33:24,995
(He follows them around)

1718
01:33:25,115 --> 01:33:28,275
(There are times when
he looks adorable)

1719
01:33:28,395 --> 01:33:30,155
(Taegoo is cute)

1720
01:33:30,275 --> 01:33:31,474
How old are you now?

1721
01:33:31,595 --> 01:33:32,474
I'm 42.

1722
01:33:32,595 --> 01:33:33,715
(Wow)

1723
01:33:33,835 --> 01:33:34,715
Can you feel it?

1724
01:33:34,835 --> 01:33:36,115
(Taegoo doesn't feel like
he is 42)

1725
01:33:36,235 --> 01:33:37,514
(Request: Tear newspaper
into small pieces)

1726
01:33:37,635 --> 01:33:38,915
(Very tiny)

1727
01:33:39,035 --> 01:33:40,155
Are you joking?

1728
01:33:40,275 --> 01:33:41,875
(He is pounding garlic)

1729
01:33:41,995 --> 01:33:43,595
(He is peeling a potato)

1730
01:33:43,715 --> 01:33:45,835
(Taegoo is helping out
in his own unique way)

1731
01:33:45,955 --> 01:33:48,915
(All preparations are done!
It's Chef Cha time)

1732
01:33:49,035 --> 01:33:52,315
(Clean-tasting rice cake soup
in bone broth)

1733
01:33:52,435 --> 01:33:54,474
(Both the flavor and colors
make it perfect)

1734
01:33:54,595 --> 01:33:57,155
(Spicy stir-fried chicken stew)

1735
01:33:57,514 --> 01:33:59,035
(Chef Cha's fragrant
seasoned sesame leaves too)

1736
01:33:59,155 --> 01:34:00,315
(Yum)

1737
01:34:00,435 --> 01:34:01,155
(Yummy)

1738
01:34:01,275 --> 01:34:01,915
(This is tasty)

1739
01:34:02,035 --> 01:34:03,355
You finished your rice again.

1740
01:34:03,474 --> 01:34:06,315
(The best meal that reminds
them of homemade food)

1741
01:34:06,715 --> 01:34:08,835
For me, this year...

1742
01:34:08,955 --> 01:34:10,595
(He is unable to stop himself
from laughing)

1743
01:34:10,715 --> 01:34:12,355
The time I laughed the most...

1744
01:34:13,355 --> 01:34:17,955
(What caused Taegoo
to laugh the loudest?)

1745
01:34:18,275 --> 01:34:21,035
The time has come
for you to say something.

1746
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:23,435
You watched us before,
haven't you?

1747
01:34:23,554 --> 01:34:25,395
What do you think?

1748
01:34:32,995 --> 01:34:34,715
The things that I feel...

1749
01:34:36,595 --> 01:34:40,275
The pagoda was created
in the 1700s

1750
01:34:40,755 --> 01:34:44,315
but we're in the 2020s now.

1751
01:34:44,955 --> 01:34:46,315
It feels like

1752
01:34:47,075 --> 01:34:49,835
time flies very quickly.

1753
01:34:49,955 --> 01:34:53,915
However, nothing has
changed dramatically.

1754
01:34:54,035 --> 01:34:56,955
The people
who lived here back then...

1755
01:34:57,075 --> 01:35:01,235
How do I explain this?

1756
01:35:01,355 --> 01:35:02,995
They were here just temporarily
before moving on.

1757
01:35:04,395 --> 01:35:06,675
Just go now.

1758
01:35:06,795 --> 01:35:08,755
They disappeared not long
after staying here.

1759
01:35:20,554 --> 01:35:23,955
(10th year anniversary special,
3 Meals A Day Light)
