high up there)

Isn't this so convenient?

15

Only the original will get
that angle.

16
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,658
You need someone from
the headquarters.

17
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:16,779

on our way back.

110
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,709

Wouldn't it be perfect if we find
a place to eat noodles?

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,349
We can just slurp them in.

127
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,349

and is perfect as lunch.

128

(It's been a long time since they
chose to have the same dish)

- Have a nice day.
- Goodbye.

142
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,029
Shall we have barley rice instead?

143

Barley rice?

144
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,109
That sounds good.

145
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:23,229

00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:00,109
Yum.

176
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,309
This is tasty. It's delicious.

177
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,548
(They surprisingly found
a delicious restaurant)

178
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,869
You should add sesame oil
and mix them well.

179
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:10,349
Yes, please give us some.

180
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,069
It's on your table.

181
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:17,349
(Pouring savory sesame oil)

182
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,189
This is tasty.

183
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:23,109
(He decides to get more
before he finishes his food)

184
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:25,469
This is the original barley rice.

185
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:28,629
(Crunchy beansprouts)

186
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:30,829
(And seasoned julienned radish)

187
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:37,389
- The stew is tasty too.
- I told you so.

188
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:41,589
(They focus on barley rice
in silence)

189
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,269
This is very tasty.

190
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:45,949
This is wonderful.

191
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:49,629
(The savory doenjang jjigae
is a gourmet dish)

192
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:54,349
You should have sungnyung.
Scorched rice!

193
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:56,949
Yes, please give us some.

194
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:58,469
Thank you.

195
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:01,749
(They always have sungnyung
as their dessert)

196
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:06,668
We always eat scorched rice
in the morning.

197
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:11,269
We might not cook rice but
always have scorched rice.

198
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:14,389
This combination is familiar.

199
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,429
(Their favorite breakfast,
scorched rice and doenjang jjigae)

200
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:21,629
This is tasty.

201
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:24,309
(They had a satisfying meal at
a restaurant they just found)

202
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,029
That was a good meal.

203
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:28,509
(Now, it's time to go
to the snack place)

204
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:30,709
Hello.

205
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,548
(They visit the twisted doughnut
place that they saw earlier)

206
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,749
Do you have twisted doughnuts?

207
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:38,229
(Haejin buys a lot)

208
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:41,109
Yes, we need to buy that much
to share.

209
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:44,109
(He is generous enough to buy
for the staff too)

210
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:48,389
(They buy one small bag
of puffed rice)

211
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,589
We bought a lot.

212
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,469
That was great.
We had an amazing meal.

213
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:58,949
We made the right decision.

214
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,069
Did she say that she made
her own soybean paste?

215
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:07,269
The doenjang was amazing.

216
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:14,469
(The 3 Meals House is empty)

217
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:22,309
(Someone is approaching
from far away)

218
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:28,509
(This unfamiliar person)

219
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:35,589
(takes a turn at the corner
and heads to the empty house)

220
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:39,789
(This man who just entered
the yard)

221
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:41,229
Ha...

222
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:44,109
Gosh.

223
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:49,869
(He seems very nervous)

224
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:58,589
(He walks cautiously like
a cat at this unfamiliar place)

225
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:03,629
(He places his things
on the porch)

226
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:08,669
(After finding the courage to
take a couple of steps)

227
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:14,949
(He leans on the pillar)

228
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:20,589
(This person who doesn't know
what to do as he's nervous)

229
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,469
(Fourth guest on this show,
Uhm Taegoo)

230
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:28,389
(Eyes full of charisma)

231
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,389
(and a deep voice)

232
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:34,149
(An actor who leaves us
with a strong impression)

233
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:39,269
(Uhm Taegoo, the soldier
on 'A Taxi Driver')

234
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:40,469
(However)

235
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,949
Wait. What should I do?

236
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,429
(In reality)

237
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:51,669
(He is widely known
to be an introvert)

238
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:54,469
(From the first time we met him)

239
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,669
(Giggling)

240
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:59,149
(He forces himself to laugh
to hide his anxiety)

241
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,309
You'll see a beautiful view
when you sit at the house.

242
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:02,469
Take this time to rest well.

243
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:04,229
(Producer Na says that
to calm Taegoo down)

244
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:06,029
Thank you.

245
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:07,149
(Staring far)

246
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:10,989
(Looks like those words
were not effective)

247
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:14,269
(He is relying on both of
his knees)

248
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:15,989
(as he gets taken away)

249
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,029
Why? What is on your mind?

250
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,989
It's just that you keep on
filming me...

251
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:25,389
This is our job.
We can't stop doing this.

252
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,669
You have to accept that.

253
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:29,949
(An actor who feels shy
around cameras)

254
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,469
I don't know what I should do.

255
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:36,829
Shall I look around?

256
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:38,829
No.

257
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,589
(He decided to take a tour
around the house)

258
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:47,029
(He checks out the area
behind the house too)

259
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,629
(And the storeroom too)

260
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:53,469
What should I talk about?
I'm in trouble.

261
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,149
(His concern gets deeper)

262
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:01,829
(He tries
to look inside the house)

263
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:03,509
(Peeking)

264
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,789
I see.

265
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,109
(He closes the doors again
after saying one phrase)

266
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:12,749
(He goes back to his comfort zone
after looking around)

267
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:19,189
(Only the sound of grass bugs
fills this area)

268
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,869
- When they arrive,
- Okay.

269
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,669
you can just stay seated.

270
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:26,149
Who do you think will be
more excited to welcome you?

271
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:29,629
Oh...

272
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:31,149
(Gulping)

273
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:38,189
Firstly, I haven't met Haejin
in a very long time.

274
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:39,789
I think

275
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:42,869
he will be quite surprised.

276
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:45,669
You look pale. You are okay,

277
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:47,709
aren't you?

278
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:49,149
I...

279
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,749
Are you 100%?

280
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:54,229
I...Well...I'm fine.

281
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,589
(His hands tell us that
he is not okay at all)

282
00:16:57,589 --> 00:16:59,869
I was pretending to be fine

283
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:00,989
and I think I'm better.

284
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,789
Yes.

285
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:10,869
(While the secret guest
pretends to be fine)

286
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,149
(the residents have arrived
at the village)

287
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:18,349
(They have no idea
what is happening right now)

288
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:22,629
(They are happy to be home
after enjoying good food)

289
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:25,269
Wait. What is that? I think...

290
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:28,189
(Peeking)

291
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:29,949
I think someone is here.

292
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,663
(He can't open the door)

293
00:17:39,783 --> 00:17:41,423
I think someone is here.
He is over there.

294
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:42,583
Yes, someone is here.

295
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:45,823
(Taegoo stands up upon
hearing the sound of a car)

296
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:48,463
Isn't that Uhm Taegoo?
It's Taegoo!

297
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,703
- Taegoo?
- Yes.

298
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,463
- Oh.
- Taegoo is here.

299
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,703
(Seungwon and Taegoo filmed
'Night in Paradise' together)

300
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,743
(Haejin and Taegoo filmed
'A Taxi Driver' together)

301
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:58,863
Taegoo.

302
00:17:58,983 --> 00:17:59,983
Taegoo.

303
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:01,343
Oh!

304
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:03,783
Taegoo, take this. Come here.

305
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,543
(He runs to receive
great treatment as a guest)

306
00:18:06,663 --> 00:18:08,303
- Taegoo.
- Taegoo.

307
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:10,462
Nice to see you.

308
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,903
(Haejin and Taegoo haven't met
for a long time)

309
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,623
- Taegoo.
- Seungwon.

310
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:18,103
You came so early.
It's only 10...11AM.

311
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:18,983
I have to go to the washroom.

312
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:21,023
How did you know that it was me?

313
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:23,583
- I'm glad you're here.
- Thank you.

314
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,103
(Seungwon and Taegoo greet
one another warmly)

315
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:29,063
- Take these over there.
- Okay.

316
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:30,942
(He is fidgeting as there
are more things to carry)

317
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:32,263
Hold on...

318
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:36,462
(He carefully places
twisted doughnuts on the porch)

319
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,143
(And runs to get more things)

320
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:40,623
- Here.
- Okay.

321
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:42,702
- Just take these.
- Okay.

322
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,223
It's Taegoo.

323
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:46,983
- Aren't you happy to see him?
- I met him recently.

324
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:50,263
(Taegoo is much calmer now
as they have arrived)

325
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:52,303
I'm glad you're here, Taegoo.

326
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,343
- Taegoo.
- Yes.

327
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,623
Are those your things?

328
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,143
- Yes.
- Follow me.

329
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:59,743
(The owner helps his guest
to check in first)

330
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,863
(He opens the door, which
Taegoo peeked from, widely)

331
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:03,223
Thank you.

332
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,423
(Seungwon guides him to his room)

333
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,263
- This is your room.
- Okay.

334
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:08,143
- Put your things here.
- Okay.

335
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:12,663
Get changed
into something comfortable.

336
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:14,663
- Okay.
- Hold on, Taegoo.

337
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:16,743
Let me do this for you.

338
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,983
(He covers the camera
so Taegoo can change)

339
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:21,583
Thank you.

340
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:28,543
(Seungwon is happy to see
his close friend as a guest)

341

(He takes the pegs out of
his bag)

342
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:38,863
(And pegs the clothes
so they do not fly away)

343
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:41,423
(This is safer now)

344
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:46,143
(Taegoo has changed into shorts)

345
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:50,023
(Taegoo brings his slippers)

346

(And puts away his sneakers)

347
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:57,143
(Struggling)

348
00:19:58,023 --> 00:20:02,103
(He becomes shy again as
the hosts are not there)

349
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:06,303
(He relies on the pillar
once again)

350
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:10,343
(He is still unfamiliar with
3 Meals House)

351
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:11,743
Taegoo.

352
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:14,543
(He smiles again when
he sees Taegoo)

353
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:16,103
Taegoo!

354
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:21,383
It's not easy to see you as
a guest at a place like this.

355
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:24,063
Not at all.

356
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:25,462
How have you been?

357
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,103
I'm just the same.

358
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:28,183
- Just the same?
- Yes.

359
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:30,183
Your voice is the same too.

360
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,183
I'm so happy to have Taegoo here.

361
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,942
I'm glad Taegoo is here.

362
00:20:35,783 --> 00:20:37,303
- Taegoo.
- Yes.

363
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:38,983
What did you bring...

364
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:41,983
- Ah...
- He brought grapes for us.

365
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:45,263
You brought us Shine Muscat.

366
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:48,503
(Taegoo brought peaches
and Shine Muscat for them)

367
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,383
You can have these.

368
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:54,702
(Twisted doughnuts from the market
that Cha and Yoo bought for them)

369
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:57,903
(3 Meals House is full of love)

370
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,983
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Okay.

371
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:01,543
- You don't have to do this.
- Okay.

372
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:03,183
Thank you.

373
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,743
Have some, Taegoo.
Did you have breakfast?

374
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:07,103
No, I did not.

375
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:09,423
You didn't? You should eat then.

376
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:11,503
(They each have one doughnut)

377
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,223
Do you want one?

378
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:15,503
No.

379
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:17,383
Are you sure? It's delicious.

380
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,462
It's tasty since
it is freshly fried.

381
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,863
This scorched rice...

382
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:24,343
(All of these are scorched rice)

383
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:26,343
I usually eat this.

384
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:27,702
It is delicious.

385
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:30,823
(The second gift from Taegoo
is scorched rice)

386
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:32,503
Have a seat.

387
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:35,583
How have you been, Taegoo?

388
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:37,663
That went really well for you...

389
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:40,183
(The drama that Taegoo was in)

390
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:42,063
('My Sweet Mobster'
has finished airing)

391
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:43,583
You were amazing.

392
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,263
Thank you.

393
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:47,423
(Scratching)

394
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:49,143
Taegoo looks nervous.

395
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:51,543
I'll be fine soon enough.

396
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:53,783
I've never been here so...

397
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:55,743
- You don't have to say that.
- Okay.

398
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:58,063
If you don't like to talk,
we don't have to talk.

399
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,863
- You don't have to talk.
- Okay.

400
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:04,503
That is how things are here.

401
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,903
We just relax.

402
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,343
- I see.
- Just relax.

403
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:10,543
I think I'll slowly
feel more comfortable.

404
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,023
We are relaxed today.

405
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:19,223
Right? Very relaxing.

406
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:22,983
- What is the time now?
- It's 11AM.

407
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:26,663
Let's eat around 1 or 2.
Let's do that.

408
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,903
We can just eat slowly.

409
00:22:30,023 --> 00:22:35,063
(They went out early
to go to the market)

410
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:40,383
(So they decided to relax for now)

411
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:43,263
(Even the residents)

412
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:48,423
(are enjoying their free time)

413
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:58,623
We are very free.

414
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:03,183
(There's someone who doesn't know
how to relax)

415
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:06,303
(He gets something from
the shoe rack)

416
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:09,263
(Baseball glove?)

417
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:11,743
Taegoo, do you play catch?

418
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:13,103
Yes.

419
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:14,823
Taegoo, do you play baseball?

420
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:16,663
Yes, I do.

421
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:19,663
(They are suddenly
playing catch)

422
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:21,023
Good.

423
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:23,903
(Seungwon was a baseball player
until middle school)

424
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:27,063
(Taegoo's ball goes straight)

425
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:29,063
Wow.

426
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:32,263
You're good at tossing.

427
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:33,623
(After getting praised)

428
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:34,942
(he tosses the ball
with all his might)

429
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:36,303
My goodness.

430
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:38,423
(The ball flies high)

431
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,942
(Mr. Cha's super catch)

432
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,063
(Back-to-back super catch)

433
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:49,903
Taegoo, you used to be
a baseball player?

434
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:51,143
Back in elementary school, yes.

435
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,743
You were an athlete?

436
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:55,702
No, I just played with my friends.

437
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:57,863
(He was a neighborhood
baseball player)

438
00:23:57,983 --> 00:23:59,462
You're good.

439
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:02,623
First off, you can toss the ball.

440
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:03,942
(Laughing)

441
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:05,383
- He's good.
- Really?

442
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:08,623
- Taegoo is a good player.
- Give me that.

443
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:11,063
(He's a student from
Cha Seungwon Baseball Academy)

444
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,343
(Here comes Mr. Yoo)

445
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:18,263
(Short)

446
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:21,423
Let me try one more time.

447
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,383
(He warms up his shoulders)

448
00:24:24,223 --> 00:24:26,263
(He tosses it with all his might)

449
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:31,063
Is that a curve? It seems like it.

450
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:34,423
(He outs himself after
making a perfect toss)

451
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:37,143
(He just watches them
while seated)

452
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:40,183
(Nice catch)

453
00:24:41,503 --> 00:24:43,583
I'm sorry.

454
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:45,103
(He makes a wild throw)

455
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:47,423
I'm sorry.

456
00:24:47,543 --> 00:24:49,623
I think he's trying to kill me.

457
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:52,183
My hands are slippery.

458
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:57,063
Where is the ball?

459
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:59,143
(The ball goes out of
their yard because of the toss)

460
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:00,462
Oh! Yes!

461
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,183
It's right here.

462
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,663
(Bump)

463
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,023
(They stop playing catch
before they get hurt badly)

464
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:09,583
We haven't met in ages.

465
00:25:09,702 --> 00:25:10,863
You're good, Taegoo.

466
00:25:10,983 --> 00:25:13,263
Not at all.

467
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:17,903
(They are done exercising)

468
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:20,423
- Isn't it hot now?
- Yes, it is.

469
00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:21,663
Drink some water.
There's water over there.

470
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:24,823
Our water is over there.

471
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,903
(Chef Cha checks on
his bone broth)

472
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:35,303
(They boiled the bone broth
as soon as they arrived yesterday)

473
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:40,983
(They even controlled the fire
to boil it well)

474
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:46,462
(Even while making geotjeori)

475
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,663
(He rushes quickly with
chili powder to add more firewood)

476
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:52,383
(He doesn't stop fanning
even when frying kimchi)

477
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,583
(From the daytime)

478
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:59,303
(to the nighttime, they continue
to boil the broth)

479
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:02,463
(It is ready late at night)

480
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:05,223
(Chef Cha is back in front
of the broth)

481
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,943
(He removes the broth
from the brazier)

482
00:26:10,063 --> 00:26:14,463
(He brings it inside so that
it won't get wet by the dew)

483
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,783
Wow.

484
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:20,583
This is wonderful.

485
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:22,983
Let me boil this again.

486
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,863
(White bone broth that
was made with love)

487
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:30,263
(He will remove the layer of fat
before boiling it again)

488
00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:33,023
Have you heard about
our lunch menu?

489
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:34,023
I haven't.

490
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:35,863
We've been simmering this
for a long time.

491
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,143
Ah!

492
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:40,903
We will make rice cake soup
using this broth.

493
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:42,823
(Lunch menu: Rice cake soup
made of bone broth)

494
00:26:42,943 --> 00:26:45,183
Taegoo, you don't have any
allergies to that, do you?

495
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,983
I love it.

496
00:26:47,103 --> 00:26:49,023
(Thank goodness he is not
allergic to rice cake soup)

497
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,143
What have you been up to?

498
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:53,863
I've been exercising

499
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:55,063
and resting.

500
00:26:55,183 --> 00:26:56,063
Shall I do that?

501
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:57,663
No, it's okay.

502
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:01,023
Just leave it be and talk.

503
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:04,023
(He suffers even more from
being told to sit down and talk)

504
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:06,503
(He is seated for now)

505
00:27:06,983 --> 00:27:09,983
What interests you these days?

506
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,263
Well...

507
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:17,783
All you do is exercise?

508
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:20,543
After exercising...

509
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:23,823
I immediately came here

510
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,103
and loved the time I spent
traveling here.

511
00:27:28,783 --> 00:27:32,343
(They are back in silence
after a conversation)

512
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:33,743
'A Taxi Driver'?

513
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:36,343
(He starts a conversation
using their common memory)

514
00:27:36,783 --> 00:27:39,343
I didn't see you much back then.

515
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:41,543
You were amazing, Taegoo.

516
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:43,303
(They are the same person)

517
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:45,663
It was a great role.

518
00:27:45,783 --> 00:27:49,343
Even when I read the script,
I realized the role was great.

519
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:50,783
You pulled it off well too.

520
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,063
- Oh my.
- For real.

521
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:55,063
Thank you very much, Haejin.

522
00:27:57,223 --> 00:28:01,623
(They get awkward again
after the praise)

523
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:05,543
The sound of the birds
is very funny.

524
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:07,303
Hmm?

525
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:13,623
- Ah.
- Right?

526
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:17,343
(Imitating the bird)

527
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:20,223
(He is laughing as loud as he can)

528
00:28:20,343 --> 00:28:23,383
(While they laugh from
hearing the birds chirping)

529
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,423
(It's time for Chef Cha to check
on the geotjeori)

530
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:29,463
(He is just checking on
the fermentation stage)

531
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,023
(Right after he was done
making the kimchi)

532
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:36,063
(It has fermented this much
within a day)

533
00:28:37,503 --> 00:28:40,583
(He tastes it while feeling
excited and worried)

534
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:41,943
Did it ferment well?

535
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:43,783
We can have it with
our rice cake soup.

536
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:45,743
(Additional dish:
geotjeori that was made yesterday)

537
00:28:45,863 --> 00:28:49,383
(They decided to rest
until it's time for lunch)

538
00:28:49,503 --> 00:28:52,383
(Haejin decides to lie down
in his room)

539
00:28:52,503 --> 00:28:57,143
(Taegoo is left alone again)

540
00:28:57,263 --> 00:28:59,943
(He peeks into the room)

541
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:01,583
(He is about to remove
his shoes...)

542
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:04,343
(but then makes a U-turn)

543
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:07,063
(The place that is
more comfortable than the room)

544
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:10,663
(He hides by the pillar)

545
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:15,583
(He is anxious even
during their break time)

546
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:20,103
(Healing)

547
00:29:20,223 --> 00:29:22,703
(As soon as Seungwon
steps out of his room)

548
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:25,583
(He is attracted to him
just like a magnet)

549
00:29:25,703 --> 00:29:26,663
Why?

550
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:28,303
I was just going back and forth.

551
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:29,743
(He can't stop laughing
as he's happy to see Seungwon)

552
00:29:29,863 --> 00:29:31,263
Please give me that basket.

553
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:33,183
- Okay.
- Basket.

554
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:35,463
- The one on top.
- On top?

555
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,223
(He is suddenly given a job)

556
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,223
- Blue basket.
- Okay.

557
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:41,463
That...Give me that.

558
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:45,023
(Seungwon who doesn't know
how to rest goes to the patch)

559
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:48,663
(He shops for chilies
without hesitation)

560
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:51,103
I will help you.

561
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,263
Just get the sesame leaves.

562
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:54,743
(Even Taegoo starts to do work)

563
00:29:54,863 --> 00:29:56,983
Pick the big ones.

564
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:58,823
Okay.

565
00:29:58,943 --> 00:30:00,183
That one.

566
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:03,583
(He carefully plucks
one sesame leaf)

567
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:05,103
(Hesitant)

568
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:09,623
(He passes his sesame leaves
with both hands humbly)

569
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:13,063
(1 harvest, 1 humility)

570
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:17,303
(His left hand is busier than
the right hand that's harvesting)

571
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:20,703
Don't you think this is
not the right leaf?

572
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:23,503
Why are you working like this?

573
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:26,983
(The white leaf seems
to not be fresh anymore)

574
00:30:27,383 --> 00:30:29,663
Why did you not look
at leaves like this?

575
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:32,143
Ah...

576
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:40,143
(They are done shopping
for fresh sesame leaves)

577
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:41,743
Was he helpful?

578
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:43,623
He harvested a leaf
that was not fresh.

579
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:46,303
(The leaf that is not fresh
is in his hand)

580
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:48,023
Let me wash those.

581
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:51,143
Do it like this. See.

582
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,663
There was someone who scrubbed

583
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:57,063
the lettuce.

584
00:30:57,783 --> 00:31:01,423
(Me?)

585
00:31:02,183 --> 00:31:06,623
(He gives an explanation
to avoid getting pickled leaves)

586
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:09,303
(Wash the leaves one by one
with running water)

587
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:11,743
Taegoo, you can wash these now.

588
00:31:11,863 --> 00:31:14,823
(He lets the wilted leaf
go back to nature)

589
00:31:14,943 --> 00:31:18,463
(He washes his hands clean first)

590
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:23,223
(He washes the leaves
one by one)

591
00:31:23,703 --> 00:31:25,823
What do you have to do
with those sesame leaves?

592
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:27,103
I don't know.

593
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:32,423
(He doesn't know what
those leaves are for)

594
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:36,063
(But it seems like he is washing
his hands more than his leaves)

595
00:31:38,103 --> 00:31:40,383
(Hi)

596
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:42,303
(Surprised)

597
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:46,423
(Although he feels a bit
uncomfortable with the camera)

598
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:49,863
(He still washes the leaves
one by one)

599
00:31:52,463 --> 00:31:56,463
(What is Chef Cha going to do
with the sesame leaves?)

600
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,383
(Last night)

601
00:31:58,503 --> 00:31:59,983
This smells great.

602
00:32:00,423 --> 00:32:03,303
(Both of them are satisfied
with the state of the leaves)

603
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,983
It'll be great if we can make
pickled sesame leaves.

604
00:32:06,103 --> 00:32:08,343
(They decided to make
pickled sesame leaves)

605
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:10,903
(He starts by making
the seasoning for the pickles)

606
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:12,863
(He gets thick soy sauce
hidden deep inside)

607
00:32:12,983 --> 00:32:15,263
(Pour the soy sauce out)

608
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:17,983
(A bit more)

609
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:21,543
(Pour sand lance extract
to add more umami)

610
00:32:24,303 --> 00:32:26,223
(Lots of chili powder)

611
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:27,383
(Sugar)

612
00:32:27,503 --> 00:32:29,183
(Vinegar)

613
00:32:29,303 --> 00:32:32,343
(Here comes the washed
sesame leaves)

614
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:33,903
Leave those there.

615
00:32:34,023 --> 00:32:35,903
(This is a tower of
stacked sesame leaves)

616
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,023
Please peel these.

617
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:40,303
(Next task: Peel garlic)

618
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:45,143
(He removes the roots
and the part that's not fresh)

619
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,623
(Request to wash vegetables)

620
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:50,383
(He puts the garlic aside
for now)

621
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:52,783
(And washes the Welsh onions)

622
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:57,623
(While Assistant Uhm
washes the Welsh onion clean)

623
00:32:57,743 --> 00:33:00,463
(He continues to make
seasoning for sesame leaves)

624
00:33:00,863 --> 00:33:03,863
(Add sesame seeds and
sesame oil for savoriness)

625
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,223
(Add more chili powder)

626
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:08,223
(They are craving
something spicy today)

627
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:10,383
(This time, he delivers
the Welsh onions)

628
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:22,303
(Slice only the white parts
to add into the seasoning sauce)

629
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:26,983
(Assistant Uhm continues
his task to peel garlic)

630
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:31,503
(He seems to struggle
to hold the peel)

631
00:33:34,383 --> 00:33:35,583
What is it?

632
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:39,423
Has it always been hard
to peel garlic?

633
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:41,983
Yes, that's how it is.

634
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,103
That's why peeling garlic
has always been the hardest.

635
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,503
Honestly, that's the toughest.

636
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:50,903
(He only peeled two cloves)

637
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:53,383
(Next is chilies)

638
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:58,463
(He slices them too)

639
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:04,223
(And minces them)

640
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:06,383
(He adds the minced chilies
into the sauce too)

641
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:08,943
(He slices red chilies
diagonally as well)

642
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:09,503
Jeez.

643
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:11,303
(Slipping)

644
00:34:13,103 --> 00:34:15,663
(He minces them quickly)

645
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:18,743
(And adds them to the sauce)

646
00:34:19,343 --> 00:34:21,503
(Mix them well)

647
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:30,583
Let's add a bit more vinegar.

648
00:34:30,703 --> 00:34:32,863
(Adding more tartness)

649
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:34,103
Done.

650
00:34:34,223 --> 00:34:35,863
I just have to add more garlic.

651
00:34:35,983 --> 00:34:37,143
Yes.

652
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:42,303
(The amount of peeled garlic
has increased)

653
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:48,063
(He is getting rid of flies)

654
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:51,503
(This is the first time we see
Taegoo being proactive)

655
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,463
(After chasing away the fly)

656
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:57,463
(He is back to his usual
serious mode)

657
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:00,503
That's enough, Taegoo.

658
00:35:00,623 --> 00:35:02,503
(He is now free from
peeling any garlic)

659
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:05,263
(He will remove the ends of
the garlic and pound them)

660
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:08,663
- I will do that.
- Please do.

661
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:12,582
(He starts to pound the garlic
after peeling them)

662
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:20,103
(He's extracting the juice
instead of pounding the garlic)

663
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:24,983
You can do that.

664
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:25,983
Taegoo.

665
00:35:26,103 --> 00:35:27,303
(He is getting thirsty)

666
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:30,503
(Chef Cha's advice
motivates him further)

667
00:35:30,623 --> 00:35:33,303
(And this time he starts
to grind the garlic)

668
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:37,783
(He does that very quickly too)

669
00:35:40,863 --> 00:35:42,582
(Let me do that)

670
00:35:42,703 --> 00:35:44,223
(He lost his job)

671
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:48,823
(The garlic is getting minced
very quickly)

672
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:51,542
(This is how you pound garlic)

673
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:53,703
(The nicely pounded garlic)

674
00:35:53,823 --> 00:35:57,542
(is mixed into the sauce
and the seasoning is done)

675
00:35:57,863 --> 00:36:00,903
(It's time to coat
the sesame leaves with seasoning)

676
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:03,143
(He takes 3 leaves)

677
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:06,503
(And pours a generous amount
of seasoning sauce)

678
00:36:18,183 --> 00:36:21,263
(Sprinkle sesame seeds on top)

679
00:36:21,623 --> 00:36:27,623
(Third side dish,
pickled sesame leaves is done)

680
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:41,183
This is very refreshing.

681
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:42,943
Yes, it is.

682
00:36:48,103 --> 00:36:53,623
(That is when they feel
the refreshing wind of Mount Jiri)

683
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:04,423
(While enjoying
the refreshing wind)

684
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:08,223
(Taegoo continues to peel garlic)

685
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:12,343
(Chef Cha slowly gets ready
to make rice cake soup)

686
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,303
(It's time for the bone broth
to shine)

687
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:21,582
(He scoops the bone broth
into a pot to make the soup)

688
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:27,343
(He pours the leftover broth
into a container)

689
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:29,863
(and keeps it in the fridge)

690
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:33,143
(Finally, Taegoo is done
peeling garlic)

691
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:38,463
(Taegoo peeled approximately
80 cloves of garlic)

692
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:43,623
(He goes to the faucet
to get rid of the peels)

693
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:44,743
Oh.

694
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:48,383
(There is a mantis near
the faucet)

695
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:51,463
(He is nervous when
facing insects)

696
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:52,663
Oh no.

697
00:37:54,343 --> 00:37:57,903
(It is on top of
the organic waste bin)

698
00:37:58,023 --> 00:37:59,383
(He covers the insect
with the lid of the bin)

699
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:00,303
(Goodbye)

700
00:38:00,423 --> 00:38:02,863
(Flinching)

701
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:05,463
(He turns on the faucet
after shooing the mantis)

702
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:07,463
(He doesn't know how
to use Mulmoa yet)

703
00:38:07,582 --> 00:38:09,183
No, that's not how it's done.

704
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:11,343
Haejin made this.

705
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:12,542
(He uses Mulmoa)

706
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:15,183
- Oh.
- He made it.

707
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:19,823
(He can't stop looking at
this cutting-edge technology)

708
00:38:19,943 --> 00:38:21,263
Please put

709
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,062
this much water in this.

710
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:24,983
- Okay.
- Like that.

711
00:38:26,983 --> 00:38:30,623
(He will make new broth by
boiling the bones once again)

712
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:33,023
- Done.
- I'll carry that.

713
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,703
(Chef Cha removes
the heavy cauldron)

714
00:38:35,823 --> 00:38:37,903
Please get me the lid.

715
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:42,663
(Taegoo's step is between
a stride and a tiptoe)

716
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,143
(He takes the lid)

717
00:38:47,663 --> 00:38:48,943
Done.

718
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:53,823
(Haejin wakes up just on time
for lunch)

719
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:56,943
(He starts the fire
as soon as he wakes up)

720
00:38:57,062 --> 00:38:59,943
(Taegoo follows Haejin
to the firewood zone)

721
00:39:00,062 --> 00:39:02,863
Yes. It'll be better if I
assign you something, right?

722
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:04,223
- Yes.
- Carry those.

723
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,183
- These?
- Yes.

724
00:39:14,623 --> 00:39:17,183
Are we using the bigger
or smaller one?

725
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,863
- Both.
- You need both?

726
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:24,582
It's because I will boil this
to make bone broth again.

727
00:39:24,703 --> 00:39:26,023
(This is bone broth)

728
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:28,743
I can make egg garnishing
and rice cake soup here.

729
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:31,863
(Chef Cha has given
his briefing on the brazier)

730
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:33,863
(He takes the seasonings
that he needs)

731
00:39:33,983 --> 00:39:37,542
(And organizes them first)

732
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:40,503
(Haejin and Taegoo get ready
to start the fire)

733
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:41,823
Do you like camping?

734
00:39:41,943 --> 00:39:43,703
No, this is my first time.

735
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:45,383
- Really?
- Yes.

736
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:46,663
So, I don't know
how I should get this done.

737
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:51,503
I'll do it.
You can observe me from the side.

738
00:39:52,383 --> 00:39:54,582
- Shall I stack them like this?
- Yes.

739
00:39:55,423 --> 00:39:58,903
(They take turns to stack
the firewood)

740
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:01,863
- Here. The newspaper.
- Yes.

741
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,223
Do it like this.

742
00:40:04,343 --> 00:40:06,863
(He gives detailed guidance
to the beginner)

743
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:09,463
(He observes how Haejin
tears the newspaper again)

744
00:40:09,582 --> 00:40:11,863
(And tears it just as how
he was taught)

745
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:12,863
(Crumple it up)

746
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,823
(and passes it to Haejin)

747
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:21,303
(Extra small)

748
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:23,183
My goodness.

749
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,103
Are you joking?

750
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:30,663
(While the two of them
have fun starting the fire)

751
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:35,223
(Chef Cha starts to prepare
ingredients for the soup)

752
00:40:40,383 --> 00:40:42,183
(He slices a lot of Welsh onions)

753
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:46,582
(He moves the prettily sliced
Welsh onions into a bowl)

754
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:50,423
(Next, he prepares ingredients
to make egg garnishing)

755
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:53,623
(Two eggs)

756
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:57,983
(After stirring the yolk
and egg white diligently)

757
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,383
(The eggs are ready)

758
00:41:00,783 --> 00:41:04,143
(He wraps and leaves them aside
until it's time to cook them)

759
00:41:04,623 --> 00:41:07,663
What made you start acting?

760
00:41:08,143 --> 00:41:09,823
In the beginning...

761
00:41:12,623 --> 00:41:14,143
How did it start?

762
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,023
They made me act at the church.

763
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:22,263
(The first time Taegoo acted was
in a play by the church)

764
00:41:22,383 --> 00:41:25,263
After that, my friend said that

765
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:28,503
we should learn to act.
We were 18 back then.

766
00:41:28,623 --> 00:41:29,903
Your friend suggested that?

767
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:31,423
Yes, so I...

768
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:33,983
Did he say that because
he saw your talent?

769
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:36,783
No, he is very handsome.

770
00:41:37,383 --> 00:41:39,582
- He asked me to join him.
- So you did.

771
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:45,623
I started because I thought
that it looked amazing.

772
00:41:45,743 --> 00:41:47,703
Is he acting now too?

773
00:41:47,823 --> 00:41:49,343
He...

774
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:52,463
immediately started his studies
at an art academy.

775
00:41:52,582 --> 00:41:53,863
He isn't acting?

776
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:56,863
I registered to study
at an acting school.

777
00:41:56,983 --> 00:42:00,223
He is now working
as a designer.

778
00:42:00,703 --> 00:42:03,383
You should thank him.

779
00:42:03,503 --> 00:42:05,183
Is that so?

780
00:42:07,383 --> 00:42:09,943
When I think about it again,

781
00:42:10,062 --> 00:42:12,783
I think you are quite introverted.

782
00:42:13,582 --> 00:42:17,503
How did you decide to become
an actor when you're an introvert?

783
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:21,263
But when I'm with
my close friends,

784
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:23,183
I can talk a lot.

785
00:42:23,303 --> 00:42:25,663
I even love to joke around.

786
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:29,863
However, I think my shyness
makes people uncomfortable.

787
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:33,223
I don't want to make people
feel that way

788
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,303
but it just happens.

789
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:38,503
It gets even more awkward
if I pretend to feel at ease.

790
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,223
You don't have to force yourself
to do that.

791
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:42,943
How old are you now?

792
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:44,863
I'm 42.

793
00:42:44,983 --> 00:42:46,903
(Shocked)

794
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,223
Really?

795
00:42:49,863 --> 00:42:52,183
You look very young.

796
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,783
Thank you.

797
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:57,223
This is what I wanted to say.

798
00:42:57,343 --> 00:43:01,423
People change as they age.

799
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:03,503
That's why I asked your age.

800
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,343
However, you seem to have frozen.

801
00:43:07,943 --> 00:43:10,183
I did change a lot.

802
00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:12,943
You don't have to force yourself.

803
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:15,663
So, I'll just be true to myself.

804
00:43:15,783 --> 00:43:17,823
That's what we should do.

805
00:43:20,582 --> 00:43:22,703
I think it's done now.

806
00:43:22,823 --> 00:43:25,983
(The wood is on fire
as they chat)

807
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:28,463
(Seungwon is here)

808
00:43:28,582 --> 00:43:30,463
It is hot, isn't it?

809
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:31,623
Be honest.

810
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:33,983
- I'm sweating but I'm fine.
- His back is soaking wet.

811
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:37,103
I didn't know that Taegoo
is 42 years old.

812
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:38,943
You're not 42.

813
00:43:39,062 --> 00:43:40,582
I'm 42.

814
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:42,263
Really?

815
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:44,823
My goodness.

816
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,663
Taegoo.

817
00:43:47,783 --> 00:43:49,703
I think it's too much that
I am speaking casually with you.

818
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:52,582
Be mindful.

819
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:55,542
I'll do that in front of him.

820
00:43:55,663 --> 00:43:57,783
(He puts his hands together
in a humble manner)

821
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,062
My goodness.

822
00:44:01,143 --> 00:44:02,783
Why? What is it?

823
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:05,223
(Hesitant)

824
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:07,743
Just tell me.

825
00:44:07,863 --> 00:44:09,263
I'm happy.

826
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:10,343
(Shy Taegoo)

827
00:44:10,463 --> 00:44:12,023
This is happiness.

828
00:44:14,223 --> 00:44:18,062
(This time, he sets Yeolmoa)

829
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:21,703
(He starts cooking right away)

830
00:44:23,582 --> 00:44:25,823
(He places the pan coated
with oil over the fire)

831
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:27,943
Please get me gloves.

832
00:44:28,062 --> 00:44:29,542
Gloves?

833
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:31,103
Gloves...

834
00:44:31,223 --> 00:44:33,582
Gloves? They're over there.

835
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:35,582
(He works on the eggs
instead of telling where they are)

836
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,062
Gloves.

837
00:44:40,183 --> 00:44:41,463
Any gloves are fine.

838
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:42,823
Any gloves?

839
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:45,783
(Usually,
it's this kind of gloves)

840
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,663
(He searches the shoe rack)

841
00:44:47,783 --> 00:44:49,223
(But they're not there)

842
00:44:50,783 --> 00:44:51,703
(Hesitant)

843
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:54,423
(Chef Cha is now in front
of the brazier)

844
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:57,143
(Let's find them now)

845
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,343
(He found the gloves for pots)

846
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:02,183
(Will this be okay?)

847
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:07,062
(He takes them for now)

848
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:09,263
This...

849
00:45:12,263 --> 00:45:14,223
Seungwon, these gloves...

850
00:45:14,343 --> 00:45:15,783
Are they okay?

851
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,143
These gloves...

852
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:21,062
(It's time to pour in beaten eggs)

853
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:27,183
(He is frozen)

854
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:37,863
(He spreads the egg
into a thin layer)

855
00:45:37,983 --> 00:45:39,943
(Thankfully,
his gloves are accepted)

856
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:45,743
(He shakes the pan using
the gloves given by Taegoo)

857
00:45:47,062 --> 00:45:48,582
I can't control the fire.

858
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:50,023
I see.

859
00:45:50,143 --> 00:45:53,983
(That's the reason he has
to control the heat himself)

860
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:58,463
(He checks how cooked
the eggs are)

861
00:45:59,263 --> 00:46:01,582
(He cooks them again)

862
00:46:02,062 --> 00:46:04,343
(And saves the eggs
from the hot fire)

863
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:13,783
(He rolls the eggs to make sure
they are cooked until the inside)

864
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,062
We just have to put that
over the fire.

865
00:46:20,183 --> 00:46:21,903
- This one?
- Yes, that's right.

866
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:22,943
Without the ladle?

867
00:46:23,062 --> 00:46:25,663
Yes, put it on the fire
without the ladle.

868
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,783
(He puts the ladle aside)

869
00:46:28,463 --> 00:46:30,183
(And delivers the pot
to the brazier)

870
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:32,703
It's hot.

871
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:33,943
(Hopping)

872
00:46:36,743 --> 00:46:38,542
(Cha-derella goes in
after leaving his shoes)

873
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:41,903
(While Cha-derella
gets rice cakes)

874
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:46,103
(Prince Taegoo
organizes the shoes)

875
00:46:50,383 --> 00:46:53,343
(He prepares lots of rice cakes
enough for three people)

876
00:46:53,663 --> 00:46:56,582
(He soaks them in water)

877
00:46:57,542 --> 00:47:01,103
(And leaves them for a moment)

878
00:47:01,223 --> 00:47:03,183
(The brisket that
he prepared yesterday)

879
00:47:08,143 --> 00:47:10,263
(He adds one fistful of brisket)

880
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:15,223
(He seasons it with salt)

881
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:19,582
(Right before this becomes a
tasty meal using bone broth)

882
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,903
(Chef Cha is back at the porch)

883
00:47:23,263 --> 00:47:25,743
(He is preparing the egg garnish)

884
00:47:26,062 --> 00:47:30,863
(He slices it into
thin and uniform sizes)

885
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:33,903
(The duo who are in front
of the fire)

886
00:47:34,023 --> 00:47:35,263
Do you live alone?

887
00:47:35,383 --> 00:47:36,503
Yes, I do.

888
00:47:36,623 --> 00:47:38,023
You don't cook, do you?

889
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:41,623
- No, I don't.
- You usually get food delivered?

890
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:44,623
I don't. I would usually
eat one meal out.

891
00:47:45,383 --> 00:47:47,423
There are times I have
scorched rice for my other meal.

892
00:47:48,303 --> 00:47:51,263
I guess you love scorched rice.

893
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:52,823
What about you?

894
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:56,103
I don't cook often either.

895
00:47:56,223 --> 00:47:58,863
- It's not boiling?
- What?

896
00:47:58,983 --> 00:48:00,783
(Rushing)

897
00:48:01,103 --> 00:48:01,943
- Is it boiling?
- Not yet.

898
00:48:02,062 --> 00:48:03,582
- It's boiling?
- Not yet.

899
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:04,743
- Not yet?
- No.

900
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,943
(Equipment team takes charge)

901
00:48:06,062 --> 00:48:07,303
Come on.

902
00:48:08,143 --> 00:48:09,663
(He knows what
the problem is right away)

903
00:48:09,783 --> 00:48:11,103
- So...
- Why? What is it?

904
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:13,263
You need someone
from the headquarters.

905
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:14,983
This equipment is not used right.

906
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,703
Something is wrong?

907
00:48:17,303 --> 00:48:19,463
What is the matter?

908
00:48:20,343 --> 00:48:22,463
(Yeolmoa was placed
in the wrong position)

909
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:25,183
(He places it
in the right position)

910
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:29,542
(With the equipment set up
well, the fire is now efficient)

911
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:32,503
(Amazed)

912
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:34,223
So that is how it's done.

913
00:48:34,343 --> 00:48:35,943
(In awe)

914
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:38,943
That is how the technology works?

915
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:42,743
We need the technician from
headquarters to come over.

916
00:48:42,863 --> 00:48:45,383
That's why work is tough for me.

917
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:46,943
(The tough life of a technician)

918
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:49,743
(The broth starts to boil
with the touch of the technician)

919
00:48:50,183 --> 00:48:52,623
(He gets the minced Welsh onion)

920
00:48:53,103 --> 00:48:55,703
(And adds it to the bone broth)

921
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:57,783
We need Welsh onions.

922
00:48:58,783 --> 00:49:00,263
Eating that

923
00:49:00,383 --> 00:49:02,823
and kimchi will be so tasty.

924
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:06,383
(There goes the soaked rice cakes)

925
00:49:11,943 --> 00:49:13,263
That's a lot.

926
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,423
It is.

927
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:16,383
(This is one pot
of rice cake soup)

928
00:49:16,503 --> 00:49:19,743
(He pours the beaten egg
into the rice cake soup)

929
00:49:20,183 --> 00:49:23,503
(He adds it in by pouring it
in the pot in a circular motion)

930
00:49:24,303 --> 00:49:26,263
What must we do next?

931
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:29,623
We can garnish it with eggs
and laver flakes.

932
00:49:29,743 --> 00:49:30,983
That sounds good.

933
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:35,823
(He takes one rice cake)

934
00:49:37,903 --> 00:49:41,183
(He tastes it)

935
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:43,582
We need to let it boil longer.

936
00:49:45,823 --> 00:49:48,983
(The rice cakes still need time
to cook)

937
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,062
Let's let it cook using steam.

938
00:50:01,783 --> 00:50:04,183
(He plans to serve stir-fried
kimchi from yesterday too)

939
00:50:04,303 --> 00:50:05,223
Taegoo.

940
00:50:05,343 --> 00:50:05,983
Yes.

941
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,423
Please get me gloves.

942
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:08,623
Okay.

943
00:50:08,743 --> 00:50:10,783
There is an open door.

944
00:50:11,463 --> 00:50:14,263
(There are vinyl gloves here)

945
00:50:14,383 --> 00:50:16,023
(Glove?)

946
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:17,463
(Glove?)

947
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:18,623
(Glove for the pot)

948
00:50:18,743 --> 00:50:19,623
Not that...

949
00:50:19,743 --> 00:50:21,023
(This is not it?)

950
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,582
The door that is open?

951
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:24,743
The one at the bottom is open.

952
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:26,663
At the bottom.

953
00:50:26,783 --> 00:50:28,062
(Bottom? Open door?)

954
00:50:28,183 --> 00:50:29,062
At the bottom.

955
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:30,663
(Not under the porch)

956
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:34,023
I'll search for it.

957
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:34,943
At the bottom.

958
00:50:35,823 --> 00:50:36,903
(Ah)

959
00:50:37,023 --> 00:50:40,103
(He lies down)

960
00:50:40,223 --> 00:50:41,143
(Finally, he found the gloves)

961
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:42,783
(Ah)

962
00:50:42,903 --> 00:50:44,663
- How many do you need?
- One is enough.

963
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:48,583
(He prepares the glove so that
Seungwon can use it easily)

964
00:50:50,823 --> 00:50:52,983
(Sigh of relief)

965
00:50:53,463 --> 00:50:58,103
(Geotjeori that he made yesterday)

966
00:50:58,503 --> 00:51:00,863
(Stir-fried kimchi
that he made yesterday)

967
00:51:00,983 --> 00:51:03,623
Taegoo, please harvest
a few crunchy chilies.

968
00:51:03,743 --> 00:51:04,703
Over there?

969
00:51:05,143 --> 00:51:06,383
- At the patch.
- Okay.

970
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:08,183
The chilies...Honey!

971
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:09,383
Harvest some crunchy chilies.

972
00:51:09,503 --> 00:51:10,623
- Crunchy chilies?
- Yes.

973
00:51:10,743 --> 00:51:12,263
You mean foot chilies?

974
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:14,823
(Foot chilies)

975
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:16,263
(Taegoo gets a basket
to go to the patch)

976
00:51:16,383 --> 00:51:17,223
(Ugh)

977
00:51:17,343 --> 00:51:18,023
(Grunting)

978
00:51:18,983 --> 00:51:20,423
(Panting)

979
00:51:32,543 --> 00:51:34,623
We don't need much, do we?

980
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:35,783
- Five?
- We don't need much, right?

981
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:36,743
I think this is enough.

982
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:42,543
(He rinses them cleanly
under water)

983
00:51:44,983 --> 00:51:46,383
It's boiling well.

984
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:53,783
Do we have to wait until
the rice cakes are cooked?

985
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,543
Yes.

986
00:51:55,663 --> 00:51:57,663
It's fine even if it is not
completely cooked, isn't it?

987
00:51:57,783 --> 00:51:59,103
You don't mind that?

988
00:51:59,223 --> 00:51:59,903
No.

989
00:52:00,023 --> 00:52:01,623
Wait. Let me taste this.

990
00:52:04,303 --> 00:52:05,623
(Anticipation)

991
00:52:11,063 --> 00:52:13,063
Let's serve it now.

992
00:52:14,383 --> 00:52:15,423
Just scoop it out in that.

993
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:23,543
(Scooping generous amount of
rice cake into a bowl)

994
00:52:24,263 --> 00:52:26,623
(Egg on top)

995
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,943
(and some laver flakes
are used as garnishing)

996
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,663
(The rice cake is ready)

997
00:52:31,783 --> 00:52:35,503
(Introducing today's lunch)

998
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:40,463
(Two types of kimchi that are made
by Chef Cha)

999
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:43,823
(Crunchy geotjeori)

1000
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:46,863
(And umami packed
stir-fried kimchi)

1001
00:52:46,983 --> 00:52:50,343
(Fresh crunchy chilies too)

1002
00:52:50,463 --> 00:52:53,103
(The highlight of this meal)

1003
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:59,063
(Made using bone broth
that is simmered all day)

1004
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:06,943
(Clean-tasting rice cake soup
made with lots of brisket)

1005
00:53:08,183 --> 00:53:09,223
Bon appetit.

1006
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:12,983
If you want black pepper,
here you go.

1007
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:14,823
It's good with black pepper.

1008
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:17,063
(Sprinkling black pepper
as recommended by Chef Cha)

1009
00:53:17,623 --> 00:53:20,103
(Taegoo sprinkles
black pepper on his too)

1010
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:22,343
Try it. I hope it's good.

1011
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:23,743
Try it.

1012
00:53:28,423 --> 00:53:29,583
Obviously, it's good.

1013
00:53:31,183 --> 00:53:34,663
(Words are unnecessary to express
Chef Cha's rice cake soup)

1014
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:36,823
Try it, Taegoo.

1015
00:53:36,943 --> 00:53:39,583
(He tastes the soup first)

1016
00:53:39,703 --> 00:53:42,303
(And takes another sip)

1017
00:53:44,423 --> 00:53:45,583
This is very tasty.

1018
00:53:48,103 --> 00:53:49,783
(Wow)

1019
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:52,463
(He loves to see how
Taegoo enjoys his meal)

1020
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:56,543
(He takes a bite after listening
to their positive response)

1021
00:53:59,343 --> 00:54:00,703
This will be good with rice too.

1022
00:54:00,823 --> 00:54:02,063
- Right?
- Yes.

1023
00:54:02,863 --> 00:54:04,903
I just made this kimchi.

1024
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:16,783
This tastes perfect.

1025
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:29,143
He made this yesterday.

1026
00:54:29,263 --> 00:54:30,223
The kimchi?

1027
00:54:30,983 --> 00:54:32,463
It has fermented to perfection.

1028
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,463
(The geotjeori is fermented
perfectly within a day)

1029
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:42,863
(He tastes the stir-fried kimchi
that was made yesterday)

1030
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:54,383
(Chef Cha eats
stir-fried kimchi as well)

1031
00:54:55,263 --> 00:54:56,863
We made this yesterday.

1032
00:54:58,183 --> 00:55:01,383
(Both types of kimchi go perfectly
with the rice cake soup)

1033
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:06,263
(Taking a sip of
clean-tasting rice cake soup)

1034
00:55:06,383 --> 00:55:09,023
(Next is spicy geotjeori)

1035
00:55:09,463 --> 00:55:12,103
(He wraps the bite up with
crunchy chili)

1036
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:20,583
The meat here tastes great.
It is delicious.

1037
00:55:27,503 --> 00:55:30,583
We still get to eat a meal.

1038
00:55:34,403 --> 00:55:35,843
Look at Taegoo. He's pale too.

1039
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:37,083
He is.

1040
00:55:38,363 --> 00:55:39,883
(He eats the rice cake soup)

1041
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,763
(And checks his skin)

1042
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:43,163
Sunlight...

1043
00:55:43,283 --> 00:55:44,323
You're allergic to sunlight?

1044
00:55:44,443 --> 00:55:47,003
It's because I haven't been
under the sun for a long time.

1045
00:55:47,123 --> 00:55:48,363
You are a homebody too?

1046
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:49,763
I barely go out.

1047
00:55:49,883 --> 00:55:51,083
You don't go out either, do you?

1048
00:55:51,203 --> 00:55:52,283
Yes, he barely goes out.

1049
00:55:52,403 --> 00:55:53,243
What do you do at home?

1050
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:54,723
(This is Taegoo,
the homebody's daily schedule)

1051
00:55:54,843 --> 00:55:56,723
Don't you feel suffocated
when you're home?

1052
00:55:56,843 --> 00:55:57,923
I do get bored.

1053
00:55:58,043 --> 00:55:59,403
Really?

1054
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,403
You enjoy that?

1055
00:56:00,843 --> 00:56:01,563
(Taking a deep breath)

1056
00:56:01,683 --> 00:56:03,563
I don't enjoy it.

1057
00:56:03,683 --> 00:56:05,283
But I have nowhere to go.

1058
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,443
(He does not stay at home
voluntarily)

1059
00:56:08,563 --> 00:56:10,483
(But he still does something,
doesn't he?)

1060
00:56:10,603 --> 00:56:12,363
I do this and that.

1061
00:56:12,483 --> 00:56:13,323
Do you play games?

1062
00:56:13,443 --> 00:56:14,483
I don't.

1063
00:56:15,283 --> 00:56:17,723
(They want to know his daily life
but found nothing out)

1064
00:56:17,843 --> 00:56:20,323
Taegoo, you're not ordinary.

1065
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:23,043
(Not ordinary Uhm Taegoo)

1066
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:25,483
We're having
spicy braised chicken?

1067
00:56:25,603 --> 00:56:26,323
Yes.

1068
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:28,723
(Today's dinner is
spicy braised chicken)

1069
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,563
You're happy?

1070
00:56:29,683 --> 00:56:30,843
I love it.

1071
00:56:31,363 --> 00:56:34,443
(Their first meal with Taegoo
has ended)

1072
00:56:34,563 --> 00:56:37,323
(Since they are full)

1073
00:56:37,443 --> 00:56:39,763
(It's time to do the dishes
with Taegoo)

1074
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,323
(They carry the table
carefully together)

1075
00:56:43,963 --> 00:56:45,043
Let's put it here for now.

1076
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,923
(The table is placed safely
in front of the faucet)

1077
00:56:48,243 --> 00:56:51,123
(They pour all leftovers
in one bowl)

1078
00:56:51,243 --> 00:56:53,483
(And throw them out at one go)

1079
00:56:55,683 --> 00:56:57,203
It's easy to use
because it has a big lid.

1080
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:00,403
(He empties everything
in the bin)

1081
00:57:00,803 --> 00:57:02,123
This cleans everything nicely.

1082
00:57:03,643 --> 00:57:06,243
(He is done getting rid
of the organic waste)

1083
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:13,441
(It's time for them
to do the dishes)

1084
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:17,041
(While Chef Cha
cleans the kitchen)

1085
00:57:17,161 --> 00:57:18,961
Do you know
how to do the dishes?

1086
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:20,761
Yes, I do the dishes often.

1087
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:24,321
(Taegoo starts to do the dishes)

1088
00:57:24,961 --> 00:57:26,001
Move a bit more.

1089
00:57:26,121 --> 00:57:27,321
I'm fine.

1090
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:28,281
Please rest.

1091
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:31,641
(Haejin joins him so that
they can get it done quickly)

1092
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:33,481
(He is trying to adjust
the position of Mulmoa)

1093
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:35,281
That's uncomfortable for you.

1094
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:37,161
(Mulmoa is almost right in front
of Taegoo's face)

1095
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:39,241
- Come here.
- This is like a microphone.

1096
00:57:39,721 --> 00:57:43,921
(They are very considerate)

1097
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:47,881
(They find their own comfortable
spot and start doing the dishes)

1098
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:51,801
(He is in charge of soaping
the dishes)

1099
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:53,881
(He is in charge of rinsing)

1100
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:56,961
Looks like you do
the dishes back at home.

1101
00:57:57,081 --> 00:57:58,641
- You do it often.
- Doing the dishes...

1102
00:57:58,761 --> 00:58:00,001
I guess not.

1103
00:58:00,121 --> 00:58:01,241
(The knife is not soaped properly)

1104
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:03,481
(My goodness)

1105
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:05,081
I guess you don't.

1106
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:07,521
(He wants to be teased
continuously)

1107
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:11,041
(He cleans the knife that is
not too clean)

1108
00:58:11,161 --> 00:58:13,561
(This time, he is fully focused)

1109
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:16,281
(to make sure
nothing is missed)

1110
00:58:21,441 --> 00:58:24,321
(He wipes down the basin too)

1111
00:58:24,441 --> 00:58:26,921
(Haejin then rinses it cleanly)

1112
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:28,321
Done.

1113
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:29,841
(Taegoo's first time
doing the dishes is complete)

1114
00:58:30,201 --> 00:58:32,481
(He wets his feet with
cold water as well)

1115
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:35,321
(He wets Taegoo's feet too)

1116
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:37,241
(Feeling refreshed)

1117
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:43,321
(They let the dishes dry
under the hot sun)

1118
00:58:43,881 --> 00:58:48,241
(He takes a look at Mount Jiri)

1119
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:52,921
(A relaxing afternoon
with a refreshing breeze)

1120
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:57,161
(If you wonder if there are those
who are as busy as them)

1121
00:59:02,841 --> 00:59:03,601
We are free.

1122
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:05,041
- What?
- We are free.

1123
00:59:06,401 --> 00:59:08,961
(There are three people
who have become free)

1124
00:59:09,081 --> 00:59:10,601
Do you like marsh snail porridge?

1125
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:11,761
Marsh snail?

1126
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,761
No, I don't.

1127
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:14,321
- You don't?
- Why?

1128
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:16,201
I was thinking
of collecting marsh snails.

1129
00:59:16,321 --> 00:59:18,561
Then, we can have
some marsh snails.

1130
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,761
Okay. It'll be nice to get some.

1131
00:59:20,881 --> 00:59:23,001
Well, I thought of that
as we don't have anything to do.

1132
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:24,161
Okay, let's get marsh snails.

1133
00:59:24,281 --> 00:59:26,201
Or we can go and play gateball.

1134
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:30,281
(They decided to get marsh snails
from the chilling valley)

1135
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:32,601
Let's go there.

1136
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,641
Let's visit the pagoda.

1137
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:36,321
Yes, we can do that.

1138
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:39,881
(They decided to visit the
cultural site on the way there)

1139
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:42,881
(Let's get going
without hesitation)

1140
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:43,721
Okay.

1141
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:45,841
Type in Baekjangam.

1142
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:47,761
Back?

1143
00:59:47,881 --> 00:59:49,441
(He loves it)

1144
00:59:49,561 --> 00:59:51,721
(Taegoo is addicted
to Haejin's jokes too)

1145
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:54,681
(Searching on the navigation)

1146
00:59:55,121 --> 00:59:57,201
You're good, Taegoo.

1147
00:59:57,321 --> 00:59:58,281
(Embarrassed)

1148
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:02,681
(He sets out while receiving
lots of love)

1149
01:00:02,801 --> 01:00:05,161
Taegoo, do you love cars?

1150
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:07,041
I only have a license on paper.

1151
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:09,721
But I haven't driven much.

1152
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:11,521
What's your hobby, Taegoo?

1153
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,801
I didn't have any

1154
01:00:13,921 --> 01:00:15,681
but got hooked on exercising.

1155
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:16,921
- Exercise?
- Yes.

1156
01:00:17,041 --> 01:00:19,241
Do you still go to
the chueo-tang restaurant?

1157
01:00:19,361 --> 01:00:21,681
(Taegoo usually gets
chueo-tang after exercising)

1158
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:22,681
I still eat that until today.

1159
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:23,721
You like it?

1160
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:25,681
It's not that I love it

1161
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:27,361
It's a type of soup

1162
01:00:27,481 --> 01:00:29,921
and a place that I can park easily
on my way home.

1163
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:33,721
The restaurant is also spacious.
I can enjoy my meal comfortably.

1164
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:35,121
That's why I go there daily.

1165
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:38,201
You go there daily
the entire week?

1166
01:00:38,321 --> 01:00:39,881
One day, the owner asked me

1167
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:41,241
if it is tasty.

1168
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:44,201
He asked if I'm not sick of it.

1169
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:46,561
(That even resulted in him getting
the owner's attention)

1170
01:00:46,681 --> 01:00:47,881
Are you not sick of it?

1171
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:49,321
Do they change the side dishes?

1172
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:50,761
They are the same.

1173
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,601
One of the side dishes
is fresh tofu.

1174
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:56,201
When I eat that fresh tofu
after exercising...

1175
01:00:56,321 --> 01:00:57,361
They have that too?

1176
01:00:57,481 --> 01:00:58,401
I feel...

1177
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,841
- Good?
- I feel healthier.

1178
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:04,641
(Taegoo's go-to food after
exercising is chueo-tang and tofu)

1179
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,441
There it is.

1180
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:08,241
Baekjangam Three-Story Pagoda.

1181
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:09,921
It's the National Treasure 10.

1182
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,401
(Finally,
they found the signboard)

1183
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:15,681
Yes, it's amazing to be
the 10th national treasure.

1184
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:18,321
(He is driving peacefully)

1185
01:01:19,961 --> 01:01:20,961
(A bump)

1186
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:22,401
I'm sorry.

1187
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:32,489
(At the bumper after that)

1188
01:01:32,809 --> 01:01:33,889
I'm sorry.

1189
01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:34,969
(Clanking)

1190
01:01:35,089 --> 01:01:36,209
I felt nothing.

1191
01:01:37,169 --> 01:01:39,769
(This time, they are driving up
a road that is not smooth)

1192
01:01:40,169 --> 01:01:41,369
(Their whole body is moving)

1193
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,129
- I didn't feel anything.
- What? You felt something?

1194
01:01:43,249 --> 01:01:45,609
(He is embarrassed)

1195
01:01:45,729 --> 01:01:47,209
(He feels guilty for making
three mistakes consecutively)

1196
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,609
I can't believe that we can't
feel anything at all.

1197
01:01:49,729 --> 01:01:50,929
I didn't know that I was so dense.

1198
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:52,849
(They are sincere in
protecting Taegoo's feelings)

1199
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:55,969
I think we just drove on a stone.

1200
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:58,769
(He doesn't know what to do)

1201
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:00,929
You can't feel anything, can you?

1202
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:01,809
Me neither.

1203
01:02:01,929 --> 01:02:03,249
You felt nothing, did you?

1204
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:05,089
I thought I'd be able to feel it.

1205
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:07,729
(In the end, Taegoo decided
to just follow their skit)

1206
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,689
I was flustered that
I felt nothing at all.

1207
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:12,889
The bumper is a useless thing.

1208
01:02:14,009 --> 01:02:15,729
(This is what they see
as they chat and laugh together)

1209
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:18,529
(It is the green forest path
towards Baekjangam)

1210
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:19,849
I guess we're here.

1211
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,889
(Finally, they can see it)

1212
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:22,729
This is the place.

1213
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:24,769
Is that it? Is that the pagoda?

1214
01:02:24,889 --> 01:02:26,849
(Baekjangam Pagoda is right
in front of them)

1215
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:30,409
(At Baekjangam which is a
small temple in Silsangsa Temple)

1216
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:31,369
(is National Treasure 10 which is
a Three-Story Pagoda)

1217
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:32,769
It has been well-preserved.

1218
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:34,089
Yes, I agree.

1219
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:36,969
National Treasure Number 10.

1220
01:02:37,089 --> 01:02:40,489
You can still see
the pattern very clearly.

1221
01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:43,129
(Even the vivid patterns
are found on the elaborate stone)

1222
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:45,969
(are preserved well and became
known as a masterpiece)

1223
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:50,369
Daeungjeon Hall is magnificent.

1224
01:02:51,049 --> 01:02:52,369
When I look at this,

1225
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:54,689
the decorations and the structure
of this pagoda

1226
01:02:54,809 --> 01:02:57,409
are completely different from
ordinary pagodas.

1227
01:02:57,529 --> 01:02:58,249
Why?

1228
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:00,049
The height is 5 meters.

1229
01:03:00,169 --> 01:03:02,529
The base of the pagoda

1230
01:03:02,649 --> 01:03:04,289
is very low?

1231
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:06,409
However, the structure
on the first level

1232
01:03:06,529 --> 01:03:08,969
is very high as compared
to the size of its width.

1233
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:11,569
(Something is weird)

1234
01:03:11,689 --> 01:03:14,449
That's the reason the width
of this pagoda didn't change much.

1235
01:03:15,089 --> 01:03:17,129
The structure of the pagoda
is very unique.

1236
01:03:17,249 --> 01:03:20,249
That is your personal opinion
as you look at it, isn't it?

1237
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:21,489
Yes.

1238
01:03:21,609 --> 01:03:23,649
It's written right here.

1239
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,729
(He was actually just reading
what was on the information board)

1240
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:28,609
Your interpretation
is the same as theirs.

1241
01:03:28,729 --> 01:03:31,569
(Nodding as he is still
unaware of the real situation)

1242
01:03:31,689 --> 01:03:32,609
Seems like it.

1243
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:34,529
Let's go.

1244
01:03:34,649 --> 01:03:36,529
I went to Gyeongju on a school
trip.

1245
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:38,929
Gyeongju? Me too.

1246
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:41,329
Where did you go?

1247
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:44,249
I went to Gyeongju too
back in elementary school.

1248
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:45,569
Elementary school.

1249
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:48,049
This looks amazing.

1250
01:03:48,169 --> 01:03:50,689
Right? It looks magnificent,
doesn't it?

1251
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:53,249
It looks like it has been
carved on recently.

1252
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:58,169
(The pagoda looks even more
magnificent from up close)

1253
01:03:58,689 --> 01:03:59,969
First floor,

1254
01:04:00,089 --> 01:04:01,009
second and third floor.

1255
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:02,889
Must you really count it?

1256
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:05,849
(Well, it is called
the Three-Story Pagoda)

1257
01:04:05,969 --> 01:04:07,729
(Amazed upon looking at it)

1258
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:10,049
Look at the calyx on top.

1259
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:12,769
(They are amazed when they look
at it from the opposite side)

1260
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:14,329
Those looks like petals.

1261
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:18,769
(They are in awe upon looking
at it from various angles)

1262
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:20,449
What do you think?

1263
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:22,169
(Suddenly posing a question
to Taegoo)

1264
01:04:22,289 --> 01:04:24,529
It's time for you
to say something.

1265
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:27,249
You saw everything, didn't you?

1266
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:29,009
- Say something
- What do you think?

1267
01:04:29,129 --> 01:04:30,249
(He is facing a crisis because
of the sudden question)

1268
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:32,369
- Oh...
- What do you think of it?

1269
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:34,369
(Anticipating)

1270
01:04:34,489 --> 01:04:38,249
Although the pagoda
was built in the 1700s

1271
01:04:38,369 --> 01:04:42,409
and we are now in the 2020s,

1272
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:46,369
it feels like time
has passed by very quickly.

1273
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:49,169
There's not much difference.

1274
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:50,649
(Hmm)

1275
01:04:53,129 --> 01:04:55,889
Just go right now.

1276
01:04:56,009 --> 01:04:59,009
(The pagoda left a strong
impression on Taegoo as well)

1277
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:03,449
Let's go get marsh snails
and buy chicken later.

1278
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:05,689
(Let's go catch marsh snails)

1279
01:05:06,689 --> 01:05:11,249
As you said, we are here
just for a moment.

1280
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:12,729
Don't you feel that way too?

1281
01:05:12,849 --> 01:05:16,129
Yes, it was said that the pagoda
was built in the 1700s.

1282
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:19,449
(This is what they see
when they enter the alley)

1283
01:05:19,569 --> 01:05:21,809
(They enter Haejin's jogging path
at the stream)

1284
01:05:21,929 --> 01:05:22,689
(The spot to catch marsh snails)

1285
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:23,969
This is where I ran
in the morning.

1286
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:27,569
(This clear stream that flows
from Mount Jiri)

1287
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:31,329
(is the place where
marsh snails are living)

1288
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:34,609
(They live by eating the moss
that builds up on these rocks)

1289
01:05:34,729 --> 01:05:35,769
(Marsh snails are one of
the species of water snails)

1290
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:36,969
(and can be found mainly
at shallow freshwater)

1291
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:38,129
(They are mainly known
as water snails)

1292
01:05:38,249 --> 01:05:39,289
(and many other names)

1293
01:05:39,409 --> 01:05:40,689
(depending on the region)

1294
01:05:40,809 --> 01:05:43,769
(We collected marsh snails
at a place that we're allowed to)

1295
01:05:43,889 --> 01:05:44,769
I can see them.

1296
01:05:45,169 --> 01:05:47,329
(The trio has arrived at
the spot to collect marsh snails)

1297
01:05:47,449 --> 01:05:48,569
Let me see.

1298
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:54,969
I got one.

1299
01:05:55,089 --> 01:05:56,449
Really?

1300
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:58,169
This is empty.

1301
01:05:58,289 --> 01:05:59,889
(Some of the shells are empty)

1302
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:03,009
(Taegoo tries to look carefully
into the water as well)

1303
01:06:05,049 --> 01:06:05,769
You found any?

1304
01:06:06,289 --> 01:06:07,209
(Staggering)

1305
01:06:08,649 --> 01:06:09,489
I found one.

1306
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:11,409
Is this the spot
you mentioned about?

1307
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:12,849
They are over here.

1308
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:16,289
(He opens his eyes wide
to find marsh snails again)

1309
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:18,609
They are so tiny.

1310
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:21,369
You found any?

1311
01:06:21,489 --> 01:06:22,849
They are so tiny.

1312
01:06:22,969 --> 01:06:25,449
We don't have to take
the tiny ones.

1313
01:06:26,169 --> 01:06:27,649
(Where)

1314
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:29,969
(are the many marsh snails?)

1315
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:33,129
(His back is in pain
without gaining anything)

1316
01:06:33,529 --> 01:06:34,929
Perhaps someone caught everything.

1317
01:06:35,049 --> 01:06:37,849
(They found nothing
no matter how hard they try)

1318
01:06:37,969 --> 01:06:39,009
Shall we go somewhere else?

1319
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:40,969
Let's search this place.

1320
01:06:41,089 --> 01:06:42,569
Didn't someone search this place?

1321
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:46,089
It's best to go somewhere else
since someone came here.

1322
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:48,409
(Actually, the spot they 're at)

1323
01:06:50,489 --> 01:06:53,769
(It's where residents have come
to collect marsh snails)

1324
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:58,409
(They have gone high up there
from the place the trio are at)

1325
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:00,369
(We should quickly move
to a new spot too)

1326
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:01,329
It's deep here.

1327
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,409
I can see the snails.

1328
01:07:04,529 --> 01:07:06,209
(Thankfully, they found
the best spot for marsh snails)

1329
01:07:06,329 --> 01:07:09,569
(They stare closely)

1330
01:07:09,689 --> 01:07:11,129
There are many here.

1331
01:07:11,249 --> 01:07:13,489
(The haven for marsh snails)

1332
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:15,169
This is wonderful.

1333
01:07:15,289 --> 01:07:16,809
I found them here.

1334
01:07:16,929 --> 01:07:20,129
(They start
to collect marsh snails)

1335
01:07:21,249 --> 01:07:24,249
(Chef Cha is excited
to see marsh snails)

1336
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:26,809
(And this is where he heads to)

1337
01:07:26,929 --> 01:07:29,609
(The spot
where the residents are at)

1338
01:07:29,729 --> 01:07:32,449
(The tip from the experts)

1339
01:07:32,569 --> 01:07:33,609
You might fall.

1340
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:36,249
(He immediately squats down)

1341
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:41,089
(He is getting a 1-on-1 lesson
from the expert)

1342
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:43,489
This is a marsh snail, right?

1343
01:07:43,609 --> 01:07:44,289
Okay.

1344
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:46,129
(That helps him understand
everything right away)

1345
01:07:46,249 --> 01:07:49,329
(If you look at how people
actually collect marsh snails)

1346
01:07:49,689 --> 01:07:52,489
(The marsh snails are located
on top of the green rock)

1347
01:07:58,289 --> 01:08:01,249
(Collecting marsh snails
is easy and fun)

1348
01:08:01,609 --> 01:08:04,809
(Haejin and Taegoo who just
know the theory of collecting)

1349
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:09,809
(They have somewhat mastered
the skill of capturing snails)

1350
01:08:09,929 --> 01:08:12,969
(Mr. Ocean has become one
with the water)

1351
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,769
(He seems to be made for it)

1352
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:23,649
(He is getting faster)

1353
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:28,089
(He gets it without looking)

1354
01:08:30,049 --> 01:08:30,969
(Staggering)

1355
01:08:31,089 --> 01:08:33,369
(Taegoo is still trying to
collect marsh snails)

1356
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:35,849
(Instead of marsh snails)

1357
01:08:36,769 --> 01:08:40,049
(He is battling himself)

1358
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:42,249
(He focuses again)

1359
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:44,609
(and focuses on collecting
marsh snails again)

1360
01:08:44,929 --> 01:08:48,129
(He is definitely
the most passionate person here)

1361
01:08:51,409 --> 01:08:54,009
(He collects the marsh snail
that is hidden under the rock)

1362
01:08:57,609 --> 01:08:59,369
We are immersed in this now.

1363
01:08:59,489 --> 01:09:01,849
(The trio is immersed
in collecting marsh snails)

1364
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:07,889
(When their backs start to hurt)

1365
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:08,849
My back hurts.

1366
01:09:10,169 --> 01:09:11,409
How much did you get?

1367
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:14,769
You got a lot.

1368
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:16,249
I have almost the same amount.

1369
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:18,969
Hey.

1370
01:09:19,089 --> 01:09:20,129
Honey.

1371
01:09:20,249 --> 01:09:21,409
- Shall we get going?
- Let's go.

1372
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:22,449
- Let's go.
- This is enough.

1373
01:09:22,569 --> 01:09:23,529
Let's go, Taegoo.

1374
01:09:23,649 --> 01:09:26,289
(They have collected enough)

1375
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:28,329
I thought we wouldn't get any.

1376
01:09:28,449 --> 01:09:30,888
But we did get marsh snails.

1377
01:09:31,969 --> 01:09:34,769
(It's time to leave now)

1378
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:37,129
(They struggle to go up again)

1379
01:09:37,249 --> 01:09:38,649
(And stop)

1380
01:09:38,769 --> 01:09:40,769
(Addicted to
collecting marsh snails)

1381
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:44,489
(Taegoo starts collecting again
as he was trying to walk up)

1382
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:46,289
I can't stop looking.

1383
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:47,689
On our way up...

1384
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:50,649
It's because I can see them
on our way out.

1385
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:52,409
(They can't stop collecting
marsh snails that they see)

1386
01:09:52,529 --> 01:09:53,888
This is addictive, isn't it?

1387
01:09:54,888 --> 01:09:57,689
(Collecting marsh snails
is addictive)

1388
01:09:58,089 --> 01:10:01,888
(That is how they keep themselves
cool on a hot afternoon)

1389
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:06,409
(They drop by the mart
to buy fresh chicken for dinner)

1390
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:10,529
(He even bought red bean buns)

1391
01:10:10,649 --> 01:10:12,729
We have to eat this
when it's cold.

1392
01:10:12,848 --> 01:10:13,928
Taegoo.

1393
01:10:14,689 --> 01:10:17,209
(He cuts the bread into half
and gives a piece to Taegoo)

1394
01:10:17,769 --> 01:10:22,969
(They re-energize themselves
with red bean buns)

1395
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:27,729
(They head back home
to prepare dinner)

1396
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:29,409
Okay.

1397
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:32,049
- Good job.
- Good job.

1398
01:10:32,169 --> 01:10:33,449
(They go back home)

1399
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:38,209
We can just take a quick shower.

1400
01:10:38,329 --> 01:10:40,569
- If not, we'll catch a cold.
- Yes.

1401
01:10:42,289 --> 01:10:45,449
(They dry themselves after
being wet in the stream)

1402
01:10:47,089 --> 01:10:51,289
(And it's time for some rest)

1403
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:56,529
(Seungwon is out after
taking a shower)

1404
01:10:57,289 --> 01:10:59,249
(He organizes the clothes
that he wore)

1405
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:01,129
(Eh?)

1406
01:11:01,249 --> 01:11:03,089
(Traces of moss)

1407
01:11:03,209 --> 01:11:06,009
(His pants have taints of green)

1408
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:08,729
(He goes to the washroom
with his pants)

1409
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:11,928
(He washes them right away)

1410
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:14,769
(He squeezes the water)

1411
01:11:16,888 --> 01:11:19,888
(He lets the sun and wind
dry his pants)

1412
01:11:21,169 --> 01:11:24,729
(The clothes that are now
crisp and dry)

1413
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:27,928
(The smell of sunlight)

1414
01:11:28,049 --> 01:11:29,888
(He takes them back home)

1415
01:11:30,409 --> 01:11:32,969
(This must be done
after doing laundry)

1416
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,649
(Haejin is doing laundry)

1417
01:11:36,769 --> 01:11:37,689
You should take a shower.

1418
01:11:38,969 --> 01:11:40,609
(Seungwon is back out)

1419
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:41,729
What are you going to do?

1420
01:11:41,848 --> 01:11:43,089
You should rest.

1421
01:11:45,329 --> 01:11:46,129
That...

1422
01:11:46,249 --> 01:11:48,489
What clothes are those?

1423
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:50,569
This shows my devotion
towards cooking.

1424
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:54,049
(Clothing to show his
devotion towards cooking)

1425
01:11:54,489 --> 01:11:57,129
(The chef look emits
his determination)

1426
01:11:57,249 --> 01:11:58,888
You are devoted to laundry

1427
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:01,369
while I'm devoted to cooking.

1428
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:04,529
You know, we have that behind you.

1429
01:12:04,649 --> 01:12:06,569
The green thing...

1430
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,969
What is it called? Moss.

1431
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:11,249
I had a lot of moss on me.

1432
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,449
You just

1433
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:14,049
- wash it, right?
- Yes.

1434
01:12:14,409 --> 01:12:16,649
(He feels at ease upon hearing
the hand-washing expert's answer)

1435
01:12:17,809 --> 01:12:20,529
(He is almost done
with doing his laundry too)

1436
01:12:21,729 --> 01:12:24,129
(He hangs them)

1437
01:12:25,169 --> 01:12:28,049
(He takes his dry laundry)

1438
01:12:30,169 --> 01:12:33,888
(Their break time AKA
laundry time is over)

1439
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:37,769
(Dinner menu:
spicy braised chicken)

1440
01:12:37,888 --> 01:12:40,049
This, Taegoo.

1441
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:41,969
Use this

1442
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:43,409
to peel this.

1443
01:12:43,529 --> 01:12:44,369
Do it like this.

1444
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:45,489
You know what to do, don't you?

1445
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:47,129
You do, don't you?

1446
01:12:47,249 --> 01:12:48,489
(This means he is asking Taegoo
to help him peel potatoes)

1447
01:12:48,609 --> 01:12:50,209
This is how you do it.

1448
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:51,609
I can just peel these
after washing them, right?

1449
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:53,289
Yes, wash them first.

1450
01:12:54,689 --> 01:12:57,609
(While the new member of the
Cooking Team peels the potatoes)

1451
01:12:58,049 --> 01:13:00,129
(Chef Cha
is at the vegetable patch)

1452
01:13:00,249 --> 01:13:02,569
(Green onion)

1453
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:05,529
(and chilies are harvested)

1454
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:09,329
(They are then washed clean)

1455
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:13,888
(Looks like the Equipment Team
has started their job)

1456
01:13:15,569 --> 01:13:16,529
(Heavy cauldron)

1457
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:19,249
- That's heavy, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

1458
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:20,449
Haejin.

1459
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:22,329
(He runs towards Haejin
as he is worried)

1460
01:13:22,449 --> 01:13:23,489
Please take this one.

1461
01:13:24,809 --> 01:13:27,489
(The newbie takes the lid)

1462
01:13:28,689 --> 01:13:31,409
(When Haejin takes the cauldron)

1463
01:13:31,529 --> 01:13:32,649
(Wow)

1464
01:13:32,769 --> 01:13:34,369
- Isn't it heavy?
- Yes, it is.

1465
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,609
Let's rinse this.

1466
01:13:38,169 --> 01:13:41,329
(The newbie washes it clean)

1467
01:13:45,569 --> 01:13:46,769
Place it on that.

1468
01:13:46,888 --> 01:13:47,729
Over there?

1469
01:13:50,529 --> 01:13:53,009
(He places the cauldron
on the brazier)

1470
01:13:57,569 --> 01:14:01,449
(Haejin takes some
50 percent polished rice)

1471
01:14:02,089 --> 01:14:04,689
(After rinsing it lightly
for three or four times)

1472
01:14:05,928 --> 01:14:07,729
(He pours it into the cauldron)

1473
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:10,969
(Checking the amount of water
using his hand)

1474
01:14:11,649 --> 01:14:13,689
(Pour in more water)

1475
01:14:15,129 --> 01:14:19,289
(The amount of water decides
the success of this rice)

1476
01:14:22,089 --> 01:14:23,969
This looks a bit too much.

1477
01:14:25,609 --> 01:14:26,769
I can't tell.

1478
01:14:26,888 --> 01:14:27,969
(He adds a bit more water)

1479
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,009
This much.

1480
01:14:31,209 --> 01:14:31,928
(He turns around)

1481
01:14:32,049 --> 01:14:33,449
(Thinking hard)

1482
01:14:37,649 --> 01:14:39,969
(Adding a bit more water
for the third time)

1483
01:14:40,089 --> 01:14:42,689
(Detailed and serious about
measuring the amount of water)

1484
01:14:42,809 --> 01:14:45,489
(He is ready to cook
50 percent polished rice)

1485
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:49,289
(Taegoo is peeling potatoes)

1486
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:54,769
(Anxious)

1487
01:14:58,489 --> 01:14:59,289
(Oh!)

1488
01:15:01,489 --> 01:15:03,649
(Giggling)

1489
01:15:03,769 --> 01:15:05,888
(All he could do was to laugh
after dropping the potato)

1490
01:15:08,289 --> 01:15:10,289
(Searching)

1491
01:15:11,848 --> 01:15:15,049
(Taegoo is suddenly
searching for something)

1492
01:15:15,489 --> 01:15:17,009
What is it? Potato?

1493
01:15:17,129 --> 01:15:17,769
Potato?

1494
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,888
Do we have tongs?

1495
01:15:20,009 --> 01:15:21,569
Tongs? What for?

1496
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:23,449
Well...

1497
01:15:23,569 --> 01:15:26,049
I think it will make things fun.

1498
01:15:26,169 --> 01:15:27,329
We have tongs.

1499
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:34,649
(Taegoo who took a pair of tongs)

1500
01:15:34,769 --> 01:15:37,729
(He uses them to hold the potato)

1501
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:42,449
(He peels it quickly while
holding it with tongs)

1502
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:45,409
It looked very dangerous.

1503
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:51,649
(He is peeling the potato
safely and quickly)

1504
01:15:54,848 --> 01:15:58,329
(Chef Cha is cutting the chicken)

1505
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:02,289
(To give it a cleaner taste)

1506
01:16:02,969 --> 01:16:06,009
(He removes the skin that
has a lot of fat)

1507
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:07,969
(Onion)

1508
01:16:08,089 --> 01:16:10,169
(Carrot)

1509
01:16:10,289 --> 01:16:13,689
(and chilies are cut
into bite-sized pieces)

1510
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:16,969
Are you done with the potatoes?

1511
01:16:17,089 --> 01:16:18,369
Yes.

1512
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:20,009
You can pass them to me.

1513
01:16:23,249 --> 01:16:25,809
(He cuts potatoes that
were peeled by Taegoo)

1514
01:16:27,689 --> 01:16:31,289
(All ingredients to be added to
spicy braised chicken are ready)

1515
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:33,169
Honey.

1516
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:34,129
How is the rice...

1517
01:16:35,129 --> 01:16:37,209
You think the rice will be good?

1518
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:38,809
I don't know.
I'm not sure about today's water.

1519
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,888
We are quite high up.

1520
01:16:42,329 --> 01:16:43,928
I don't think that makes
a difference.

1521
01:16:44,049 --> 01:16:45,449
I think the amount of water
is what makes a difference.

1522
01:16:47,928 --> 01:16:52,169
(After measuring the amount
of water seriously)

1523
01:16:56,609 --> 01:17:00,888
(What's left
is to manage the fire)

1524
01:17:01,009 --> 01:17:01,888
(Wow)

1525
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,329
Honey.

1526
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:04,329
What is that?

1527
01:17:06,529 --> 01:17:09,609
(When the fire is too strong)

1528
01:17:10,009 --> 01:17:13,529
(The 50 percent polished rice
master removes some firewood)

1529
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:19,569
(Chef Cha takes the seasoning)

1530
01:17:20,489 --> 01:17:24,009
(And places them on
the seasoning rack)

1531
01:17:24,529 --> 01:17:26,329
Garlic and...

1532
01:17:26,449 --> 01:17:28,049
Taegoo, we have gochujang inside.

1533
01:17:28,169 --> 01:17:29,289
Please take that for me.

1534
01:17:32,089 --> 01:17:36,569
(Assistant Taegoo is doing
something for Chef Cha)

1535
01:17:43,009 --> 01:17:45,169
(He found garlic)

1536
01:17:45,289 --> 01:17:47,249
(And gochujang)

1537
01:17:50,369 --> 01:17:53,569
(He leaves the gochujang behind?)

1538
01:17:55,009 --> 01:17:57,969
(This is what he took out
with the gochujang)

1539
01:18:06,569 --> 01:18:08,249
(Yogurt)

1540
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:13,129
(He was thirsty)

1541
01:18:13,809 --> 01:18:16,928
(He goes back to work after
quenching his thirst)

1542
01:18:20,089 --> 01:18:23,169
(Haejin's focus is completely
on the rice)

1543
01:18:34,129 --> 01:18:37,169
(He has a solo tennis match)

1544
01:18:37,289 --> 01:18:40,809
(He is now back to work)

1545
01:18:41,449 --> 01:18:42,489
Taegoo.

1546
01:18:42,609 --> 01:18:45,289
Please get me cooking wine
and black pepper from there.

1547
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:49,569
(Adding black pepper,
cooking wine and minced garlic)

1548
01:18:49,689 --> 01:18:52,409
(to marinade the chicken)

1549
01:18:52,529 --> 01:18:55,409
(will get rid of the smell
and make it more tender)

1550
01:18:56,409 --> 01:18:58,249
(Season it with some salt too)

1551
01:18:58,369 --> 01:19:01,449
I'll pass this to you.

1552
01:19:01,569 --> 01:19:03,169
- Please pound them.
- Okay.

1553
01:19:03,289 --> 01:19:06,009
(Garlic is always needed)

1554
01:19:06,129 --> 01:19:09,729
(Chef Cha removes the end
and places them in the mortar)

1555
01:19:10,489 --> 01:19:13,529
(The assistant pounds them)

1556
01:19:15,369 --> 01:19:17,969
(Garlic that has been pounded)

1557
01:19:20,848 --> 01:19:23,848
(Massage the chicken so
it absorbs the garlic flavor)

1558
01:19:25,489 --> 01:19:27,409
(Staring)

1559
01:19:31,489 --> 01:19:32,209
(He stops)

1560
01:19:33,489 --> 01:19:34,169
(Hesitates)

1561
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:36,489
(He solves it himself)

1562
01:19:39,729 --> 01:19:42,329
(He waits and watches actively)

1563
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:48,369
(Watching in a cool-headed way)

1564
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:51,569
(Taegoo is helping Chef Cha
in his mind)

1565
01:19:51,689 --> 01:19:55,009
(Chef Cha cuts the green onion)

1566
01:19:55,129 --> 01:19:58,729
(He also adds three circles
of oil)

1567
01:20:00,449 --> 01:20:01,888
(And places the pan on the fire)

1568
01:20:02,009 --> 01:20:03,249
Wait.

1569
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:04,848
We have to do this.

1570
01:20:04,969 --> 01:20:06,129
I have to make these flatter.

1571
01:20:06,888 --> 01:20:08,848
(He is adjusting the sunflower)

1572
01:20:09,928 --> 01:20:10,888
(But they are being stubborn)

1573
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:12,289
- Done?
- No.

1574
01:20:12,689 --> 01:20:14,729
(He chooses to use
a more primitive item)

1575
01:20:16,569 --> 01:20:20,049
(He adjusts the sunflower
to the size of the wok)

1576
01:20:21,689 --> 01:20:23,569
(He places it)

1577
01:20:23,689 --> 01:20:26,369
(Yeolmoa is very versatile)

1578
01:20:27,169 --> 01:20:30,489
(He makes green onion oil
to give it better umami and smell)

1579
01:20:31,209 --> 01:20:33,529
(Cut chicken)

1580
01:20:33,888 --> 01:20:35,409
(Add them into the wok)

1581
01:20:42,689 --> 01:20:45,409
(The smell of green onion
that is sweet and pungent)

1582
01:20:47,089 --> 01:20:50,289
(Once they have been absorbed
by the chicken)

1583
01:20:54,209 --> 01:20:57,169
(Make the fire bigger)

1584
01:20:58,689 --> 01:21:01,329
(Add the cut vegetables too)

1585
01:21:01,888 --> 01:21:04,449
(Stir them so that
they get cooked evenly)

1586
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:06,969
(Add chili powder to it)

1587
01:21:12,289 --> 01:21:14,769
(Season it with soy sauce)

1588
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:19,609
(Scoop out a large amount
of gochujang)

1589
01:21:20,249 --> 01:21:24,449
(Adding sweetness and spiciness)

1590
01:21:25,529 --> 01:21:29,489
(Haejin checks on
the 50 percent polished rice)

1591
01:21:29,609 --> 01:21:30,169
(My gosh)

1592
01:21:30,289 --> 01:21:31,289
What is it?

1593
01:21:31,409 --> 01:21:32,289
Nothing.

1594
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:34,848
It is still very watery.

1595
01:21:36,888 --> 01:21:37,848
You didn't add water?

1596
01:21:37,969 --> 01:21:38,809
(Groaning)

1597
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,569
(Sighing)

1598
01:21:42,089 --> 01:21:44,249
(The chili powder container
flipped)

1599
01:21:45,769 --> 01:21:47,369
Thankfully, it flipped
inside this container.

1600
01:21:47,489 --> 01:21:48,729
But it flipped.

1601
01:21:48,848 --> 01:21:49,569
But still...

1602
01:21:49,689 --> 01:21:50,369
Hold on. This...

1603
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,049
Just hold it like that.

1604
01:21:52,169 --> 01:21:53,169
(He has a good idea?)

1605
01:21:53,289 --> 01:21:54,169
Yes.

1606
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:55,129
(He carries the whole container)

1607
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:56,329
(He flips it again)

1608
01:21:56,449 --> 01:21:57,569
- Amazing.
- That's a success.

1609
01:21:57,689 --> 01:21:58,609
Amazing.

1610
01:21:59,409 --> 01:22:00,489
I knew it.

1611
01:22:00,609 --> 01:22:03,529
(They managed to save
most of the chili powder)

1612
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:05,209
Pass me the chili powder.

1613
01:22:07,049 --> 01:22:09,529
(He adds more chili powder)

1614
01:22:09,649 --> 01:22:10,689
Taegoo.

1615
01:22:11,089 --> 01:22:13,809
(Add sugar too)

1616
01:22:14,449 --> 01:22:19,569
(When it starts to look like the
familiar spicy braised chicken)

1617
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:26,689
(Pour generous amount of water)

1618
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:31,009
(All that is left to do
is to wait)

1619
01:22:31,129 --> 01:22:32,649
That is more complex
than expected, isn't that?

1620
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:34,449
I feel so busy.

1621
01:22:34,569 --> 01:22:35,409
Right?

1622
01:22:35,969 --> 01:22:36,529
(Tapping)

1623
01:22:36,649 --> 01:22:37,888
(Oh? I see)

1624
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:42,089
We just have to tap Taegoo.

1625
01:22:42,209 --> 01:22:44,249
(Taegoo's surprised face)

1626
01:22:50,409 --> 01:22:54,689
(He cuts and adds Welsh onion)

1627
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:56,249
We just have to let it simmer.

1628
01:22:57,888 --> 01:23:00,489
(He looks at the sky
while waiting)

1629
01:23:05,249 --> 01:23:08,689
(The dark sky
is filled with clouds)

1630
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:15,089
(However, behind the clouds)

1631
01:23:16,169 --> 01:23:20,209
(The night sky in Mount Jiri
is filled with shiny stars)

1632
01:23:24,529 --> 01:23:25,769
- Taegoo.
- Yes.

1633
01:23:25,888 --> 01:23:27,729
Have you tried
50 percent polished rice before?

1634
01:23:28,049 --> 01:23:29,809
59 percent polished rice.

1635
01:23:29,928 --> 01:23:31,289
I never heard of it before.

1636
01:23:31,928 --> 01:23:33,649
- You never tasted it?
- No, I haven't.

1637
01:23:33,769 --> 01:23:35,289
Do you eat white rice back home?

1638
01:23:36,329 --> 01:23:37,769
I eat white rice.

1639
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:39,489
(The rice is dry now)

1640
01:23:39,609 --> 01:23:41,129
I have brown rice too.

1641
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:42,888
(The cooked rice)

1642
01:23:43,009 --> 01:23:43,769
Let me try this.

1643
01:23:46,249 --> 01:23:47,969
Try this.

1644
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,689
(He tastes to see if it is cooked)

1645
01:23:50,049 --> 01:23:52,809
(Taegoo's first time to taste
50 percent polished rice)

1646
01:23:53,689 --> 01:23:54,969
It's a bit rough

1647
01:23:55,089 --> 01:23:56,089
and shapeless.

1648
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:58,569
It's different from white rice,
isn't it?

1649
01:23:58,689 --> 01:23:59,569
It's like...

1650
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,009
I know it's rice

1651
01:24:02,129 --> 01:24:03,049
but it tastes like corn.

1652
01:24:03,169 --> 01:24:04,689
Rice that tastes like corn. Yes.

1653
01:24:04,809 --> 01:24:05,729
(It's his first time to know
about 50 percent polished rice)

1654
01:24:05,848 --> 01:24:07,009
It's like that.

1655
01:24:08,289 --> 01:24:10,329
(The chef tastes it too)

1656
01:24:14,489 --> 01:24:16,329
- Isn't it good?
- Today's is the best.

1657
01:24:16,449 --> 01:24:17,569
- Really?
- Yes.

1658
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:20,809
(Today's rice is the best so far)

1659
01:24:20,928 --> 01:24:21,928
I can't believe this.

1660
01:24:23,129 --> 01:24:24,209
This is amazing.

1661
01:24:26,888 --> 01:24:31,249
(The rice has been cooked
to perfection as well)

1662
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:36,209
(What's left is
the spicy braised chicken)

1663
01:24:40,848 --> 01:24:46,209
(The gravy is getting thicker)

1664
01:24:51,449 --> 01:24:53,489
(He tastes it)

1665
01:24:57,689 --> 01:25:01,169
(That is what we need now)

1666
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,689
(Spiciness)

1667
01:25:07,089 --> 01:25:09,529
(And some umami)

1668
01:25:10,209 --> 01:25:11,489
(Walking stealthily)

1669
01:25:12,928 --> 01:25:16,769
(Uhm Taegoo, 42 years old,
ladle holder)

1670
01:25:19,129 --> 01:25:22,169
(Using the ladle that
Taegoo was holding)

1671
01:25:23,409 --> 01:25:27,489
(To make sure all ingredients
absorb the seasoning)

1672
01:25:29,409 --> 01:25:33,449
(He mixes them and lets it simmer
until the gravy is thick)

1673
01:25:35,689 --> 01:25:36,888
We have to wait.

1674
01:25:41,289 --> 01:25:45,409
(Endless waiting)

1675
01:25:49,489 --> 01:25:50,329
- Taegoo.
- Yes.

1676
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:51,649
The ones you washed earlier.

1677
01:25:52,609 --> 01:25:53,928
The spoons and chopsticks.

1678
01:25:54,928 --> 01:25:57,888
(They set the table
while waiting)

1679
01:25:59,729 --> 01:26:01,409
Shall I take
some pickled sesame leaves?

1680
01:26:01,529 --> 01:26:02,489
Yes. Sounds good.

1681
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:07,848
(First time tasting
sesame leaves they made today)

1682
01:26:12,049 --> 01:26:16,049
(He gets some geotjeori too)

1683
01:26:23,089 --> 01:26:28,769
(And some stir-fried kimchi)

1684
01:26:29,969 --> 01:26:33,888
(He sets the table
on the wooden bench)

1685
01:26:36,689 --> 01:26:39,169
(Removes the lid)

1686
01:26:39,289 --> 01:26:40,809
Scoop some rice out first.

1687
01:26:44,529 --> 01:26:48,449
(50 percent polished rice
that is steaming hot)

1688
01:26:49,529 --> 01:26:51,729
This is how it is scooped.

1689
01:26:51,848 --> 01:26:53,689
(He scoops rice into a bowl)

1690
01:26:54,169 --> 01:26:55,609
This wooden spoon...

1691
01:26:56,569 --> 01:26:59,129
is perfect with this area.

1692
01:26:59,249 --> 01:27:00,209
This is Heungbugol.

1693
01:27:01,729 --> 01:27:04,049
That just crossed my mind too.

1694
01:27:04,169 --> 01:27:04,969
It's the image.

1695
01:27:08,928 --> 01:27:10,449
- But...
- Yes?

1696
01:27:12,888 --> 01:27:13,888
Heungbu...

1697
01:27:15,369 --> 01:27:16,569
was hit.

1698
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:20,169
(Heungbu ate rice that stuck on
his cheek after getting slapped)

1699
01:27:20,809 --> 01:27:22,689
Shouldn't he prioritize his child?

1700
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:24,049
(Oh? Rice?)

1701
01:27:24,169 --> 01:27:25,369
He should go to this child
just like this.

1702
01:27:25,489 --> 01:27:27,249
(A father would have given it
to his child)

1703
01:27:27,369 --> 01:27:29,569
- He was selfish?
- Yes.

1704
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:30,689
He ate it alone?

1705
01:27:30,809 --> 01:27:33,689
(Heungbu was being
reevaluated again)

1706
01:27:33,809 --> 01:27:36,129
What do you think, Taegoo?

1707
01:27:36,249 --> 01:27:37,609
About his proposal.

1708
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:39,569
I didn't hear anything.

1709
01:27:39,689 --> 01:27:41,689
I was busy carrying the rice.

1710
01:27:42,289 --> 01:27:45,129
(Sorry)

1711
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:49,769
(After it was left to simmer
for a long time)

1712
01:27:50,289 --> 01:27:53,169
(Spicy braised chicken is ready)

1713
01:27:57,089 --> 01:27:58,369
This looks wonderful.

1714
01:28:00,689 --> 01:28:02,329
It's heavy. You should
put that on the side.

1715
01:28:03,169 --> 01:28:03,928
Give me that.

1716
01:28:04,049 --> 01:28:05,409
No, I'm fine.

1717
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:17,888
(Assistant Uhm helps Chef Cha
in case it's heavy for him)

1718
01:28:19,609 --> 01:28:24,089
(Spicy braised chicken that
is boiling hot)

1719
01:28:24,209 --> 01:28:26,769
(has been served too)

1720
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:32,928
(Today's dinner is ready)

1721
01:28:33,489 --> 01:28:37,489
(The same dish with two flavors.
Stir-fried kimchi and geotjeori)

1722
01:28:38,089 --> 01:28:39,969
(Salty and spicy sesame leaves)

1723
01:28:40,329 --> 01:28:42,249
(Savory rice)

1724
01:28:44,609 --> 01:28:50,049
(The ingredients have absorbed
the seasoning from being simmered)

1725
01:28:50,169 --> 01:28:55,689
(Spicy braised chicken)

1726
01:28:59,009 --> 01:29:00,249
Please help yourself.

1727
01:29:01,888 --> 01:29:02,809
Thank you for the meal.

1728
01:29:02,928 --> 01:29:04,769
Bon appetit.

1729
01:29:04,888 --> 01:29:05,449
Shall I serve you the chicken?

1730
01:29:05,569 --> 01:29:07,089
No, let me do this for you.

1731
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:08,049
Okay.

1732
01:29:09,289 --> 01:29:13,169
(One bowl is served with care)

1733
01:29:13,289 --> 01:29:16,449
(He gets the precious drumstick)

1734
01:29:17,529 --> 01:29:18,769
Here you go.

1735
01:29:18,888 --> 01:29:19,609
You should eat that.

1736
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:21,609
Yes, you should eat
what you served.

1737
01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:22,809
I'll serve myself.

1738
01:29:22,928 --> 01:29:23,529
Yes, that's better.

1739
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:25,848
- I'll do it myself.
- Okay.

1740
01:29:28,049 --> 01:29:29,529
I understand how you feel.

1741
01:29:29,649 --> 01:29:31,249
(Thank you very much)

1742
01:29:32,009 --> 01:29:34,289
But the drumstick...

1743
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:35,729
No, you should eat that.

1744
01:29:35,848 --> 01:29:37,089
We have more over there.

1745
01:29:37,209 --> 01:29:38,769
I have my own part.
Just eat it.

1746
01:29:38,888 --> 01:29:40,129
(Taegoo gets the drumstick again)

1747
01:29:40,489 --> 01:29:42,969
(This is a common sight
when eating with parents)

1748
01:29:43,089 --> 01:29:45,649
(They will serve their own food)

1749
01:29:45,769 --> 01:29:46,569
Enjoy.

1750
01:29:47,729 --> 01:29:48,689
Thank you for the meal.

1751
01:29:48,809 --> 01:29:51,609
I'm adding a bit here.

1752
01:29:51,729 --> 01:29:52,848
Thank you for the meal.

1753
01:29:52,969 --> 01:29:53,888
Enjoy.

1754
01:29:54,649 --> 01:29:56,369
Enjoy.

1755
01:29:58,289 --> 01:30:01,009
(Taegoo doesn't start eating
right away)

1756
01:30:02,009 --> 01:30:04,489
(Haejin takes one bite)

1757
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:08,649
(And Seungwon takes one bite)

1758
01:30:09,049 --> 01:30:11,689
(Only then he eats his drumstick)

1759
01:30:13,009 --> 01:30:14,009
(Wow)

1760
01:30:15,848 --> 01:30:17,649
The chicken is really good.

1761
01:30:17,769 --> 01:30:18,848
It's tender.

1762
01:30:19,769 --> 01:30:22,209
Right? My goodness.

1763
01:30:22,329 --> 01:30:24,888
I think we let this simmer longer
than other food we made.

1764
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:27,489
I thought you were making broth.

1765
01:30:29,009 --> 01:30:32,289
(They simmered it for more
than an hour)

1766
01:30:34,089 --> 01:30:36,089
(You can easily grab the meat)

1767
01:30:36,209 --> 01:30:38,329
(even when you use chopsticks
when eating spicy braised chicken)

1768
01:30:39,169 --> 01:30:40,888
Eat up, Taegoo.

1769
01:30:41,928 --> 01:30:43,089
This is so good.

1770
01:30:44,928 --> 01:30:48,009
(He mixes rice with the gravy)

1771
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:55,049
(Yum)

1772
01:30:55,169 --> 01:30:55,928
This is good.

1773
01:30:59,848 --> 01:31:04,049
(Even carrots that have absorbed
the flavor from the seasoning)

1774
01:31:04,928 --> 01:31:06,928
I think making fried rice
out of this would be good too.

1775
01:31:07,049 --> 01:31:07,888
Yes, it is.

1776
01:31:12,529 --> 01:31:17,089
(This time, he eats
both carrots and sesame leaves)

1777
01:31:20,329 --> 01:31:23,369
(Haejin eats sesame leaves too)

1778
01:31:23,489 --> 01:31:24,529
(Yum)

1779
01:31:24,649 --> 01:31:25,289
(Yummy)

1780
01:31:26,169 --> 01:31:27,809
(A reaction that makes
the chef happy)

1781
01:31:27,928 --> 01:31:29,049
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

1782
01:31:30,969 --> 01:31:32,169
The leaves did not wilt either.

1783
01:31:32,289 --> 01:31:33,489
It's just right.

1784
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:38,129
(This time, he eats the geotjeori)

1785
01:31:38,249 --> 01:31:40,129
This has fermented further.

1786
01:31:41,249 --> 01:31:42,129
It's more fermented now.

1787
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:51,089
The rice is delicious.

1788
01:31:51,969 --> 01:31:52,888
It's very savory.

1789
01:31:57,529 --> 01:32:00,449
(Taegoo takes
a big mouthful of rice)

1790
01:32:03,289 --> 01:32:08,329
(He tastes the geotjeori that has
fermented for a day)

1791
01:32:08,769 --> 01:32:11,609
(Sesame leaves)

1792
01:32:12,409 --> 01:32:13,609
(Seungwon holds the leaf)

1793
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:14,969
Thank you.

1794
01:32:15,089 --> 01:32:17,289
- That is two leaves.
- I see.

1795
01:32:17,769 --> 01:32:19,689
Eat both.

1796
01:32:27,289 --> 01:32:28,969
(Yummy)

1797
01:32:29,089 --> 01:32:31,928
(It's so good that he hums
as he chews his food)

1798
01:32:34,169 --> 01:32:38,489
(A meal that brings happiness)

1799
01:32:43,609 --> 01:32:44,769
Thank you.

1800
01:32:44,888 --> 01:32:46,089
(Taegoo gets the last drumstick)

1801
01:32:53,489 --> 01:32:55,289
I love this rice so much.

1802
01:32:56,289 --> 01:32:57,769
This is my favorite rice.

1803
01:33:00,848 --> 01:33:03,249
I finished up my rice.

1804
01:33:04,769 --> 01:33:09,169
(A satisfying dinner that
makes him feel guilty)

1805
01:33:11,089 --> 01:33:12,169
(Wow)

1806
01:33:12,289 --> 01:33:14,449
Taegoo, you eat in a decent way.

1807
01:33:15,569 --> 01:33:16,969
- Why?
- The way he chews...

1808
01:33:17,089 --> 01:33:18,609
Yes, he is very silent.

1809
01:33:20,289 --> 01:33:21,289
This is so tasty.

1810
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:24,449
Hearing him talk like that

1811
01:33:24,569 --> 01:33:26,569
makes me want to speak
like him too.

1812
01:33:29,129 --> 01:33:31,169
Our volume is much lower now.

1813
01:33:31,289 --> 01:33:32,409
It's because...

1814
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:34,329
We're practically whispering now.

1815
01:33:34,449 --> 01:33:36,129
Taegoo finished his rice.

1816
01:33:36,249 --> 01:33:37,289
He was...

1817
01:33:37,649 --> 01:33:38,569
(This is how they usually talk)

1818
01:33:38,689 --> 01:33:41,649
'You're done eating?'
That is how we talk.

1819
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:44,049
Taegoo is done eating.

1820
01:33:44,169 --> 01:33:46,089
(This is their volume
when Taegoo is around)

1821
01:33:46,209 --> 01:33:48,369
'Is this how you eat?'
This is how we talk.

1822
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:51,129
'Taegoo, that's two pieces
of sesame leaves.' Like this.

1823
01:33:52,809 --> 01:33:54,969
When you act,

1824
01:33:55,089 --> 01:33:56,249
your eyes just shine.

1825
01:33:56,809 --> 01:33:57,689
For real.

1826
01:33:59,409 --> 01:34:01,649
You don't remember this, do you?

1827
01:34:01,769 --> 01:34:03,289
It was after the premier
of 'The Age of Shadows.'

1828
01:34:04,888 --> 01:34:06,689
At the after party,

1829
01:34:06,809 --> 01:34:08,649
there were tables on the rooftop.

1830
01:34:08,769 --> 01:34:10,888
- Yes.
- We bumped

1831
01:34:11,009 --> 01:34:13,169
into each other at the stairs.

1832
01:34:13,289 --> 01:34:15,449
This was what you told me.

1833
01:34:15,569 --> 01:34:16,449
'I knew you'd be this successful.'

1834
01:34:18,249 --> 01:34:23,009
That left a very strong impression
of you on me.

1835
01:34:23,129 --> 01:34:25,249
It's because back then

1836
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:27,529
there were people
who were criticizing me.

1837
01:34:29,329 --> 01:34:33,289
But after you said that to me...

1838
01:34:35,329 --> 01:34:38,009
That must have comforted you
and given you strength.

1839
01:34:38,769 --> 01:34:40,569
Anyway, only to me...

1840
01:34:40,689 --> 01:34:42,129
He only talks weirdly to me.

1841
01:34:42,249 --> 01:34:45,529
He is very kind to others.

1842
01:34:46,089 --> 01:34:49,089
(The dinner time with
candid conversation is over)

1843
01:34:49,209 --> 01:34:50,329
That was a good meal.

1844
01:34:57,809 --> 01:35:03,049
(Seungwon showers twice a day)

1845
01:35:03,169 --> 01:35:05,928
(This is what he uses
after taking a shower)

1846
01:35:08,329 --> 01:35:10,049
There's caviar in this.

1847
01:35:26,289 --> 01:35:27,569
My face is glowing.

1848
01:35:29,209 --> 01:35:30,489
Nice.

1849
01:35:33,129 --> 01:35:37,529
(Seungwon is done with
his skin routine)

1850
01:35:41,848 --> 01:35:44,689
(He sits in front of the TV)

1851
01:35:46,409 --> 01:35:49,009
(Taegoo is out
after taking a shower)

1852
01:35:52,009 --> 01:35:52,649
Goodnight, Seungwon.

1853
01:35:52,769 --> 01:35:53,529
Goodnight.

1854
01:35:53,649 --> 01:35:54,409
Go to sleep.

1855
01:35:55,689 --> 01:35:57,409
(Taegoo is tired as
he traveled far today)

1856
01:35:57,529 --> 01:35:59,888
(He goes to bed first)

1857
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:02,729
Are you there?

1858
01:36:04,369 --> 01:36:06,769
(Haejin is back from his walk)

1859
01:36:08,809 --> 01:36:11,169
(He joins Seungwon to watch news)

1860
01:36:12,049 --> 01:36:14,809
If you eat carbohydrates,

1861
01:36:15,489 --> 01:36:17,569
it means we have consumed
sugar too, right?

1862
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:21,289
(These days, they are interested
in controlling their sugar levels)

1863
01:36:21,928 --> 01:36:23,369
You have an interdental
toothbrush?

1864
01:36:25,089 --> 01:36:26,689
I heard we need to use it.

1865
01:36:26,809 --> 01:36:28,369
It's definitely better to do it.

1866
01:36:28,489 --> 01:36:31,129
(Their other interest
is oral care)

1867
01:36:32,169 --> 01:36:33,369
Do you have extra?

1868
01:36:33,489 --> 01:36:35,249
Hold on. I might have one.

1869
01:36:39,089 --> 01:36:41,769
Are you giving me a new
or a used one?

1870
01:36:41,888 --> 01:36:44,409
The used one stinks.
So it's good too.

1871
01:36:48,329 --> 01:36:49,569
This is a new one.

1872
01:36:49,689 --> 01:36:50,649
Thank you.

1873
01:36:52,569 --> 01:36:53,489
I'm going to bed.

1874
01:36:53,609 --> 01:36:55,649
Me too.

1875
01:36:55,769 --> 01:36:57,769
- Let's go to bed.
- Goodnight.

1876
01:36:57,888 --> 01:37:00,049
(All of them are going to bed)

1877
01:37:01,969 --> 01:37:09,009
(That is how they wrap up their
second day in Mount Jiri)

1878
01:37:09,129 --> 01:37:12,209

tranquil Mount Jiri)

(3 Meals House that is
filled with fun and laughter)

1880
01:37:15,809 --> 01:37:17,449
It looks like we're celebrating
our young master's birthday.

1881
01:37:17,569 --> 01:37:20,209
(They prepared yellow corbina meal
perfect for a nobleman's birthday)

1882
01:37:20,329 --> 01:37:21,848
I bought that but I'm afraid
that it has expired.

1883
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:23,049
(Expired?)

1884
01:37:23,169 --> 01:37:24,089
I'm afraid it might expire early.

1885
01:37:24,209 --> 01:37:25,769
(The things he worries about
makes others go crazy)

1886
01:37:25,888 --> 01:37:28,249
(There's something else
that makes Seungwon go crazy)

1887
01:37:28,369 --> 01:37:29,969
Are we going to Nogodan Peak?

1888
01:37:30,089 --> 01:37:32,529
(They go up to Nogodan Peak)

1889
01:37:32,649 --> 01:37:34,529
We will be walking for an hour.

1890
01:37:34,649 --> 01:37:36,489
(They warm up before going up)

1891
01:37:36,609 --> 01:37:38,769
(Taegoo, Seungwon and Haejin
have begun to walk up to the peak)

1892
01:37:38,888 --> 01:37:40,689
Why are you running?

1893
01:37:40,809 --> 01:37:41,489
Huh?

1894
01:37:41,609 --> 01:37:44,009
(They decided to walk but
Haejin starts to run)

1895
01:37:44,129 --> 01:37:45,089
(The staff give up filming him
because he is running?)

1896
01:37:45,209 --> 01:37:46,089
I can't run.

1897
01:37:46,209 --> 01:37:47,969
We never expected this.

1898
01:37:48,089 --> 01:37:51,369
(Taegoo runs with the camera
instead of the staff)

1899
01:37:51,689 --> 01:37:53,169
What is this?

1900
01:37:53,289 --> 01:37:54,209
Is this not the place?

1901
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:58,169
(What happened at Mount Jiri where
Haejin and the staff go missing?)

1902
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:00,169
We can't leave today, can we?

1903
01:38:00,289 --> 01:38:01,569
(It was a tough day that
makes them want to go home)

1904
01:38:01,689 --> 01:38:03,089
Seungwon, can you see the stars?

1905
01:38:03,209 --> 01:38:05,249

forget about their tough day)

- This is the reason we're here.
- Yes.

1909
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:16,769
I think we'll get to see
the Milky Way too.

1910
01:38:16,888 --> 01:38:17,769
Look up there.

1911
01:38:17,888 --> 01:38:19,529
(What view will they get on
their last day in Mount Jiri?)

1912
01:38:19,649 --> 01:38:21,169
What do you like, Taegoo?

1913
01:38:21,289 --> 01:38:23,888
I am technologically illiterate.

1914
01:38:24,009 --> 01:38:25,729
So I'm bad with technology.

1915
01:38:26,689 --> 01:38:27,729
I have a cavity.

1916
01:38:30,169 --> 01:38:31,369
I...No, it's okay.

1917
01:38:31,489 --> 01:38:33,489
Say it.

1918
01:38:33,609 --> 01:38:36,569
Honestly, before I came here,

1919
01:38:36,689 --> 01:38:37,689
I brushed my teeth.

1920
01:38:40,409 --> 01:38:41,529
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1921
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:42,928
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

1922
01:38:43,049 --> 01:38:44,249
You have potential.

1923
01:38:44,369 --> 01:38:45,409
You're pretty good.

1924
01:38:45,529 --> 01:38:46,969
I wanted to but then
it felt so chilly.

1925
01:38:47,089 --> 01:38:48,129
No.

1926
01:38:48,249 --> 01:38:49,249

Don't regret your decision
once you get there.

1928
01:38:53,569 --> 01:38:54,369
Good.

1929
01:38:55,409 --> 01:38:57,449
Brush your teeth, cavity.

1930
01:38:57,569 --> 01:38:59,689
- You brushed your teeth?
- Yes.

1931
