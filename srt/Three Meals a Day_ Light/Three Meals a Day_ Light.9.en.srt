at 3 Meals House in Mount Jiri)

3
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,770
(The last guest in
'3 Meals A Day Light,' Uhm Taegoo)

4
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,770
I'm glad you're here, Taegoo.

5
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,409
He is a bit nervous.

6
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,090
(Taegoo is very nervous)

7
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,450
Taegoo.

8
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,650
(He plays catch
with Seungwon and Haejin)

9
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,850
(He starts to relax
while learning what to do)

10
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,850
(Taegoo is very diligent
at learning his tasks here)

11
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,530
Is he helpful?

12
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,290
He is harvesting
something dangerous.

13
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,210
(He is putting in
lots of effort to learn)

14
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:11,050

Taegoo worked after his arrival)

00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,570
(They enjoy collecting
marsh snails)

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,690
(We get to see rare moments
of Taegoo's slapstick comedy)

18
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,810
First, second, third level.

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,730
Must you really count?

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,650
(They enjoy some free time
by visiting a temple nearby)

21
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,730
(Their fun time out is over)

22
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,530
What kind of fashion is that?

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,490
It shows my dedication
towards cooking.

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,489
(This is what makes
Taegoo watch him in awe)

25
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,570
(Seungwon's main dish that
shows his dedication to cooking)

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,370
That looks like a work of art.

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,810
(Hot and sweet spicy braised
chicken made with lots of effort)

28
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,209
Seungwon.

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,850
- You eat that.
- We'll eat what we scoop.

30
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,730
(Taegoo takes a big bite
of the drumstick)

31
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,769
This is delicious.

32
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,610
- It is good, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,610
(At the end of their meal in which
the food disappears in a jiff)

34
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,730
(They wrap up their day with
their dear friend, Taegoo)

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,090
(Cloud and fog cover
the foot of the mountain)

36
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,530
(The vegetable patch is
covered with morning dew)

37
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,130
(The third morning
has dawned on them)

38
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,770
(Current time is 6AM)

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,690
(Creak)

40
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,130
(The first to wake up is Taegoo)

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,050
(Closes the door quietly)

42
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,330
(He quietly closes his door
so it won't wake the others up)

43
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,970
(Walking quietly)

44
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,050
(He arrives in front of
the washroom in silence)

45
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,170

47
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,090
(Closing quietly)

48
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,450
(The door produces 0dB
when it is closed)

49
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,570
(This time, he stealthily walks
in front of the refrigerator)

50
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,690
(He opens the refrigerator)

51
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,650
(What did he take silently?)

52
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,290
(Yogurt which he drank
yesterday too!)

53
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:15,850
(Closing quietly)

54
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,210
(He quietly goes to this room
with a yogurt)

(Sound of him
removing the lid)

56
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,850
(Sound of him drinking)

57
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,810
(He drinks in his room to avoid
waking the others up)

58

(He comes out again
after drinking everything)

59
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,610
(Oh yes)

60
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,570
(He turns off the light)

61
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,410
(He quietly closes the door
and steps out)

62
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,770
(Taegoo who woke up early
goes out on a walk)

63
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,010
(After walking around
for a long time)

64
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,770
(Fog and clouds at the foot
of the mountain welcome him)

65
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,770
(He sees a puppy who lives at
the neighbor's house)

66
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,090
(Where are you going?)

67
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,330
Oh!

68
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,530
A frog!

69
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,290
(He brought his frog friend)

70
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,530
I have never seen a dog
and frog together.

71
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,170
So adorable.

72
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,610
Woah.

73
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,370
(He takes deep breaths)

74
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,290
They told me that they can
smell rice from here.

75
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,170
However, I can't smell it as I
try too hard to get a sniff.

76
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,810
(He goes further down to
find this savory smell)

77
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,569
Marsh snails.

78
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,610
(The water reminds him of
the snails they collected)

79
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:59,490
Hold on...

80
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,890
Why? What is it?

81
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,210
I didn't sleep at all
just to see marsh snails.

82
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,370
I think that wasn't funny.

83
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,449
(That was a joke?)

84
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,250
That's a drone.

85
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,970
(Smiling brightly)

86
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,850
(He feels more comfortable
on the second morning)

87
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,770
(There is a green view
that comes with his path)

88
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,170
(The paddy has ripened
and starts to bow)

89
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,810
(Colorful perilla flowers
are blooming too)

90
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,770
My neighborhood has
the same vibe as this place.

91
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,770
(Something feels familiar
at this new place)

92
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,009
(A beautiful morning path that
is enjoyed only by early risers)

93
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,730
(Back at home)

94
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,770
(Haejin is brushing
his teeth outside)

95
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,170
It'll be great to go to
Mount Jiri in this weather.

96
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,050
I think the peak we can
drive to is Nogodan Peak.

97
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,690
It won't be arduous
as we can drive up there.

98
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,010
No pain peak.

99
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,569
(He makes a morning joke
at this hour)

100
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,490
(He washes his face
after brushing his teeth)

101
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,010
(He goes back to his room
to get ready to go to work)

102
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,170
(Chef Cha gets ready
to go to work)

103
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:27,970
What are you doing?

104
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,009
How do I use this?

105
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,290
I can't use that.

106
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,730
(Seungwon is fascinated to see
Haejin using a tablet)

107
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,449
Just do this.

108
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,250
You can easily read from it.

109
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,450
But you can write on it too.

110
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,650
Just use this pen.

111
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,570
- You write using a pen?
- Yes.

112
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,490
(While they are suddenly
in a class to use a tablet)

113
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,570

(Rummaging)

125
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,730
(He takes a tray of eggs
outside)

126
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,090
Why do you wake up
so early, Taegoo?

127
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,410
Yes, I just wake up early.

128
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,930
(Clanking away)

129
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,690
(He is preparing breakfast
while making a ruckus)

130
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,570
(He starts by preparing
the tools needed to cook)

131
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,050
What are you going to cook
for breakfast?

132
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,610
Breakfast? Village meal.

133

(Break 4 eggs)

137
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,410
I'll throw those away.

138
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,250
(He is now the proactive
assistant to Chef Cha)

139
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,970
(Add eggs)

140
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,290
(Waiting)

141

(Mix the egg white and yolk well)

143
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,170

(Ballparks the amount
of water with his eyes)

145
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,290

146
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,330

Did you prepare
the chopping board for me?

159
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,810
(Laughing)

160
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,210
How do you know
that I'll need the chopping board?

161
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,650
(Taegoo can tell
what Chef Cha will do next)

162
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:40,490

prepared by Taegoo)

163

(He checks the cutlery cabinet)

170
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,930
(Assistant Uhm finds it
right away)

171
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,570
- I'm becoming helpful.
- Yes.

172
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,130
- Taegoo.

Wow.

178
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,770
The sun is so bright.

179
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,130
(The yard has no shade at all)

180
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,250
(Checks the cauldron that is
preparing their scorched rice)

181
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,410
(Thinking)

182
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,690
(He closes it)

183
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,370
The handle is hot.

184
00:10:54,729 --> 00:10:57,050
(The lid is hot as
it has been cooking)

185
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,050
(He does his task again
after putting on his glove)

186
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,050
(He only leaves enough rice for
scorched rice and keeps the rest)

187
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,810
(After pouring a generous amount
of water in the cauldron)

188
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,370
(He starts a fire)

189
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,610
(Chef Cha is preparing
the next dish)

190
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:30,010
(There is a bowl of bean sprouts
growing in the living room)

191
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,370
(He takes a lot to make
bean sprout soup and season them)

192
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,610
There are parts that are dirty.

193
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,690
Remove those part.

194
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,610
(Assistant Uhm's task:
Clean the bean sprouts)

195
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:49,370
(He starts by rinsing them clean)

196
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,410
(However, he is doing it
in a rough manner)

197
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,250
You have to be gentle.

198
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,650
Do it like this.

199
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,650
Gently.

200
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,370
I see,

201
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:07,130
(He starts to do it gently)

202
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,770
(He rinses them gently so
they do not get bruised)

203
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:18,170
(Chef Cha is back
at the refrigerator)

204
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,890
(What did he get?)

205
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:26,330
(Yellow corbina that
they bought from the market)

206
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,490
These yellow corbina look good.

207
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,770
This...

208
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,729
I thought time would be up
when I buy that.

209
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,090
(Time up?)

210
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,370
Early corbina deadline.

211
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,969
You're driving me nuts.

212
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,849
Ah...

213
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,170
(The time is up)

214
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,290
(They start to clean
the yellow corbina)

215
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,610
(Assistance by Assistant Uhm)

216
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,810
(Wash the clams with
cold water before preparing)

217
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,690
(Next, remove the fins
using scissors)

218
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,610
(He cleans the fish without
hesitation as he's an expert)

219
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,130
(Next is to remove the scales)

220
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,090
(Scratch the surface with a knife
gently and they will be removed)

221
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,170
(Wash in running water
and it's ready)

222
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,650
(Bring the cleaned yellow corbina
to the porch again)

223
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,970
(Wipe them dry)

224
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,690
(Scour the fish)

225
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,930
(Finally, season with salt)

226
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,850
(Leave it to marinade so
it absorbs the seasoning)

227
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,250
(Haejin is staring
at the brazier)

228
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,770
This...

229
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:45,946
The direction changed again.

230
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:49,386
(The direction changed?)

231
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:52,386
You need someone from
the headquarters here.

232
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,786
(The details are only known by
the headquarter's worker)

233
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:59,346
(He fixes it so that
it becomes efficient again)

234
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:03,346
(He spreads out the sides too)

235
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:06,706
(It has been installed well
with the touch of the worker)

236
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,986
(It's time to cook steamed eggs)

237
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,226
(On top of the fixed Yeolmoa)

238
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:11,946
(He places the earthen pot)

239
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:13,746
And for this...

240
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:17,706
(There's still something to fix)

241
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:20,586
(He uses a tool for experts)

242
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:23,746
(And fixes the petals
to the size of the earthen pot)

243
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:26,386
You're from the headquarters
but still stay here.

244
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:29,386
My owner pays a lot of attention
to this place.

245
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,626
(He is now promoting his item)

246
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:35,306
French people love this.

247
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:36,626
This?

248
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:38,346
Yeolmoi.

249
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,786
(Giggling)

250
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:42,026
Yeolmoi.

251
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,146
(It is made in France)

252
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,906
Does it mean your technicians
are from France too?

253
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:51,226
Yes but our owner focuses
on this place a lot.

254
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:53,626
(He was assigned to come
to Korea from France)

255
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:56,266
(The steamed egg is cooking
on top of Yeolmoa)

256
00:14:56,386 --> 00:15:00,026
(Stir continuously so that
the egg starts to clump)

257
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:01,266
It's hot.

258
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:05,186
(His hand is close to the fire
as the spoon is short)

259
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:11,146
(He suddenly looks around)

260
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:13,746
Here you go.

261
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,026
(All he needs right now
is a long spoon)

262
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:19,626
(Assistant Uhm
knows what is needed)

263
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:22,346
(Thanks to him, Chef Cha
can stand straight as he cooks)

264
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:25,906
(The steamed egg has now
turned yellow)

265
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,426
- Taegoo.
- Yes.

266
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:29,466
- Please get me the lid.
- Okay.

267
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:33,546
(When it is almost dry)

268
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:42,346
(Cover it with a lid
and let it cook on low fire)

269
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:44,666
Taegoo, please help with the fire.

270
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:47,426
It is not uniform.

271
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:51,546
(Taegoo is now part of
the equipment team)

272
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:55,026
(He adds more firewood)

273
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:58,306
(It starts to boil and
water starts to flow out)

274
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:01,666
(At that moment)

275
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,786
(Steamed egg is ready)

276
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:11,706
(Remove the steamed egg
from the fire)

277
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:15,306
(The cauldron is boiling too)

278
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,746
(We can see scorched rice boiling
between the steam)

279
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:28,906
(He removes the cauldron
to cook the next dish)

280
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:33,186
(Here comes the cauldron
to cook bean sprout soup)

281
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:35,186
We will cook that much
bean sprout soup?

282
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:36,906
(He laughs)

283
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:39,306
(This is too much soup
for three people)

284
00:16:39,426 --> 00:16:40,826
We can even swim in the soup.

285
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,866
I want to blanch
the bean sprouts first.

286
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:46,826
After blanching,
I will season them.

287
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,546
(Assistant Uhm is pounding garlic)

288
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:53,706
(The puffed rice that
they bought yesterday)

289
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,186
Aren't you hungry?

290
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:56,906
I'm a bit hungry.

291
00:16:57,026 --> 00:16:58,786
Do you want this?

292
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:01,226
- Ah...
- You must be hungry.

293
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:03,706
My goodness. Just a bit is enough.

294
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,786
(Both of his hands are full
of snacks)

295
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:08,666
Wow.

296
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:12,306
(He accidentally looks into
the camera while eating)

297
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:17,826
(He finishes up the snack)

298
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:22,186
(And focuses on pounding garlic)

299
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:25,346
(The cauldron is steaming now)

300
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,906
(Chef Cha brings
the bean sprouts over)

301
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:31,426
(While the water starts to boil)

302
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:36,706
(He starts by blanching
the ones to be seasoned)

303
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:43,546
(He prepares a basket
to scoop out the bean sprouts)

304
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:47,226
(When it has wilted a bit)

305
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:50,345
(Scoop everything out)

306
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:57,506
(Cool them down with
cold running water)

307
00:17:57,626 --> 00:18:00,986
(He prepares the ingredients
to season them)

308
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:02,706
(First is tree onions)

309
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:09,226
(Place them on top
of the bean sprouts)

310
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:11,906
(Next, add seasoning)

311
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:15,546
(Sesame oil)

312
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:18,345
(Minced garlic)

313
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:21,786
(Chili powder)

314
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,826
(Mix everything well so
they absorb the seasoning)

315
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,826
(Adding some saltiness)

316
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:32,626
(Adding some umami)

317
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:37,865
(Add more spiciness)

318
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:42,306
(Giving the chef's touch)

319
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:46,266
Okay.

320
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:53,546
(Assistant Uhm tastes
seasoned bean sprouts)

321
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,226
Ah.

322
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,386
This and...

323
00:18:58,506 --> 00:18:59,466
(Pause)

324
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:03,386
It's so good that I just need this
with rice as my meal...

325
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:05,506
(He completes his sentence
with his smile)

326
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,345
Is it bland? Is it okay?

327
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:10,466
It's amazing.

328
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:13,146
(The final touch is
nutty sesame seeds)

329
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,386
(Seasoned bean sprouts is ready)

330
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:19,586
(He keeps the dish in
the fridge for now)

331
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:22,865
(Chef Cha immediately gets ready
to cook bean sprout soup)

332
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,066
(He adds broth pack and anchovies
to add umami taste to the soup)

333
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:29,146
(When the broth has turned yellow)

334
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,666
(Remove the broth pack
and anchovies)

335
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,186
(Put in all of the bean sprouts)

336
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:45,345
(Being very generous)

337
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:55,706
(Add more umami flavor
using tuna extract)

338
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:59,226
(A spoonful of minced garlic)

339
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,746
(Tasting it now)

340
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,105
- How is it?
- Good.

341
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:14,546
After adding tuna extract,
it tastes amazing.

342
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,226
- Is it good?
- It's wonderful.

343
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:27,066
It's nice to see big slices
of Welsh onion.

344
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,386
Really?

345
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:30,906
(Welsh onion is
the cherry on top)

346
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,706
We have to let it boil
for some time.

347
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:40,186
(Let it boil so that
it tastes better)

348
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,706
(While the soup is boiling)

349
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,826
(He prepares the final dish,
grilled yellow corbina)

350
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,706
(He coats the plump yellow corbina
with generous amount of oil)

351
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:55,186
(They are now over Yeolmoa)

352
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:57,345
Looking at how he is
preparing our meal,

353
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,066
today seems to be a feast.

354
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:04,066

(Disappointed)

359
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:28,546
(It's time to grill
the other side)

(The yellow corbina
is sizzling right now)

361
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:43,786
(Sprinkle salt on it again
and let it grill)

362
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:59,026
(Grill them carefully
so they won't burn)

363
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:11,306
(Coat them with oil so that it is
crunchy outside and moist inside)

364
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:15,306
(Now, cover it with a lid)

365
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:20,266

and crunchy)

(Savory stir-fried kimchi)

370
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:36,266
It feels like we're celebrating
our young master's birthday.

371
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:39,226
Young Master Taegoo.

372
00:22:39,865 --> 00:22:43,105
(Master Taegoo is suddenly
getting a birthday feast)

373
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:47,826

instead of a cake)

374

(Checking the status
of the yellow corbina)

that were deep fried)

377
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:19,865
(Both sides of the yellow corbina
are crunchy now)

378

(Scoop bean sprout soup
into bowls)

381
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:43,186
(Scoop scorched rice into bowls
too)

382
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:49,306
(Plate grilled yellow corbina
onto a plate too)

383
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:57,266
(Set all dishes onto the table)

384
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:59,426

(The steamed egg
is no longer watery)

389

(They start to enjoy
their tasty breakfast)

390
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:41,386
(Everybody starts by taking
a scoop of steamed egg)

391
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:50,146
(Haejin takes a big mouthful
of steamed egg)

392
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,946
This is perfect with rice.

393
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:58,666
(There's no place for him
to put his steamed egg)

394
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:00,906
I'll get you a plate. Hold on.

395
00:25:01,026 --> 00:25:03,226
- Let me do it.
- Can I have a plate, please?

396
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,386

who knows this place well take)

397

This is very good.

402
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:28,146
(Next, he tastes
the bean sprout soup)

403
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,426
Wow.

404
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,946
This is very delicious.

405
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,426
(Haejin drinks the soup
directly from the bowl)

406
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:41,946

with just one sip)

per person)

412
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:04,586
Enjoy your meal, sir.

413

grilled corbina)

(He follows Haejin
and takes a piece of corbina)

417

(and a piece of kimchi)

418
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:26,266
This is good.

419
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:43,506
(Haejin and Taegoo are focused
on eating yellow corbina)

420
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:46,266
It's quite plump
with flesh, right?

421
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:48,306
That's true.

422
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,506
(Battling yellow corbina)

423
00:26:56,626 --> 00:26:59,346

(Plastic gloves)

425
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,786
(He suddenly puts on the gloves)

426
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:08,786
(He debones the fish
so it's easier for them to eat)

427
00:27:10,346 --> 00:27:13,506
(Thanks to him, they get
to enjoy their fish easily)

428

(Chef Cha takes the tail
after deboning the fish)

429

Amazing.

You did great too.

434
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,346
This is really delicious.

435
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:51,946
It's not easy to eat
one meal, is it?

436
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:54,666
But

437
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:56,946
it's fun.

438
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,426
(Laughing)

439
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:01,506
I knew that you would say
something special.

440
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:07,386
I feel good as it feels like
I'm getting healthier.

441

(Their satisfying meal at
Mount Jiri has ended)

442

We emptied our plates.

444
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:21,666
What shall we do after our meal?

445

After our meal?

446
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:26,226
Let's go to Mount Jiri.

447
00:28:26,346 --> 00:28:29,186
We have to go there
since we're here.

448
00:28:29,986 --> 00:28:32,306

a picnic at Mount Jiri quickly)

It feels good to be out.

456

(They drive through the forest
under the sun to go to Mount Jiri)

457
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:09,466
How do you feel, Taegoo?

458
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:11,666
I'm doing great.

459
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:13,106
(100 percent sincere)

460
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:15,706
Why am I suddenly excited?

461
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:16,786
(Giggling)

462
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:18,106
- Really?
- Yes.

463
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:20,306
I love going to places like this.

464
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:25,066
(The path to Mount Jiri
has turned green)

465
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:27,226
Places like this remind me
of Europe.

466
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,266
Places like this?

467
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:30,946
Those look like olive trees.

468
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,586
(Mount Jiri's scenery
is international)

469
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:37,146
That is the headquarters
for my team.

470
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,026
Yeolmoi.

471
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:40,826
(His company is actually
a French company)

472
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,146
You must've gone on many
business trips with Yeolmoa.

473
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:45,266
I'm usually there.

474
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:47,866
We have IKEYO too.

475
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,146
(Beautiful spontaneous exchanges)

476
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:52,586
- You're busy all year long.
- Yes, I am.

477
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,746
(Giggling and laughing away)

478
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:05,466
This path seems familiar.

479
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:08,786
(Somehow this part is familiar)

480
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:10,826
This is very familiar.

481
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:13,906
Is this Baemsagol?

482
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:17,346
I guess from this point onward,
we are in Baemsagol.

483
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:19,306
(Blinking)

484
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:22,266

are familiar with this place)

(The cool water that crosses
through Mount Jiri)

486
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:33,826
(It is windy like a snake,
hence the name Baemsagol)

487
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,426
(People soak their feet in
the clear waters of Mount Jiri)

488
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,426
(It's nice to go trekking through
the path along the valley)

489
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:47,426
(This is known as the best valley
in Mount Jiri)

490
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:50,546
It'll be nice to eat while
watching the water here.

491
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,786
Right?

492
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:53,746
(He keeps on wanting to talk)

493
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:55,266
(Cute)

494
00:30:57,706 --> 00:31:00,306
(Somehow he feels shy
and looks out the window)

495
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:05,586
(The car is driving under trees
full of phytoncide)

496
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:09,146
(He opens the window)

497
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:11,626
- How is the air now?
- It's great.

498
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:14,346
This is refreshing.

499
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:15,826
(Peeking)

500
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:17,866
(Winding down)

501
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,826
(Taegoo slowly opens
his window too)

502
00:31:21,186 --> 00:31:25,466
(Enjoying the fresh air of
Mount Jiri with eyes closed)

503
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:27,586
This feels like Mount Jiri.

504
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:32,266
(They continue to drive up
the windy road)

505
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:34,346

(1080 meters above sea level)

510
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:43,306
(They are closer to the sky now)

511
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:44,866
Here we are.

512
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,826
- This is the place?
- Yes.

513
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,146
(They arrived at a place
with clear surroundings)

514
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:54,786
(Seongsamjae Rest area,
1,100 meters above sea level)

515
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:58,106
(The highest spot you can
drive up in the mountain)

516
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,666
This is amazing.

517
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,506
Look. Can you see the peaks
overlapping one another?

518
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,866
(Mountains over here)

519
00:32:06,986 --> 00:32:08,386
(Mountains over there)

520
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:12,746
(This is how it feels to be
deep in the mountains)

521
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,746
The temperature is
20 degrees right now.

522
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:17,906
(Refreshing weather that is
neither cold nor hot)

523
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:19,106
Taegoo.

524
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:22,826
Look at that. Look down.
It is refreshing.

525
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,946
(The clear air feels better
with the refreshing breeze)

526
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,506
This is wonderful.

527
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:34,426
(No other fall can be as
refreshing as in Mount Jiri)

528
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,066
- How is this?
- Wow.

529
00:32:38,186 --> 00:32:40,986
This is amazing.

530
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:42,786
It's great, isn't it?

531
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:45,506
(They are very excited right now)

532
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:47,386
(Observatory deck)

533
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:51,466
(The trio are at
the observatory deck)

534
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:52,986
Wow.

535
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:56,266
Wow.

536
00:32:56,386 --> 00:32:57,586
Turn like this.

537
00:32:58,826 --> 00:32:59,986
Do this.

538
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:01,706
Like the bear.

539
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:03,546
(Father bear, baby bear)

540
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:06,186
This is amazing.

541
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,606
(Uhm Taegoo is confused)

542
00:33:10,126 --> 00:33:12,046
Look at that mountain over there.

543
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:18,966
(You can see the mountains
peaking over one another)

544
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:21,966
Do you prefer mountains or oceans?

545
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:23,406
(Thinking hard)

546
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:26,966
During my military service,
being in the mountains

547
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:28,846
made me feel like
I was imprisoned.

548
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:33,326
But after 15 years,

549
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:35,366
this is what I felt while
we were coming up here.

550
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:38,726
Mountains are amazing.

551
00:33:38,846 --> 00:33:43,206
(The mountain feels different)

552
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:46,606
I don't enjoy the mountains
that much.

553
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:49,486
(Seungwon is famous as someone
who doesn't go hiking)

554
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:51,766
(Winter of 10 years ago
in Manjae Island)

555
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:53,526
- Is the mountain high?
- What?

556
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:56,286
Is it high? If it is,
I'm hiking down halfway.

557
00:33:56,406 --> 00:33:58,166
This is exhausting.

558
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,246
I'm tired.

559
00:34:00,366 --> 00:34:01,566
(He usually gets annoyed)

560
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:02,766
How far are we going to go?

561
00:34:02,886 --> 00:34:04,526
I'm tired. Let's stop here.

562
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:06,286
It's right there.

563
00:34:06,406 --> 00:34:07,926
Let's go slightly further.

564
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,766
Let's rest.

565
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:11,486
We barely hiked.
Why do you want to rest?

566
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:17,206
Why must you go hiking?
Just looking is good enough.

567
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:19,326
He went hiking up there
while complaining.

568
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:20,446
My goodness.

569
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:22,206
Why must you bring me
to a mountain?

570
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:25,046
(The staff are well aware
of his preference)

571
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:28,126
Don't you feel like you want
to go higher?

572
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:29,766
Would you like to go...

573
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:30,846
How would we do that?

574
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:32,526
There is a path over there.

575
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:35,006
- Really?
- Is that it? Where is it?

576
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:38,166
You have to climb up a bit more.

577
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,686
(From Seongsamjae Rest Area)

578
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:44,486
(It takes around 1 hour
to climb up to the peak)

579
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:48,086
(You will see a peak with
a small stone pagoda)

580
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,446
(Banyabong Peak,
Cheonwangbong Peak)

581
00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:51,406
(A path that brings you to
the highest two peaks)

582
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,446
(The peak they are at is
the 3rd highest at 1,500m)

583
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:58,645
(The third highest peak
in Mount Jiri, Nogodan Peak)

584
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,645
How far must we walk?

585
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,086
- Approximately an hour.
- An hour?

586
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,006
(Haejin, the hiking lover,
has no expectations)

587
00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:08,406
(Taking a deep breath)

588
00:35:08,526 --> 00:35:10,766
Well, it's fine if we're just
going to walk.

589
00:35:10,886 --> 00:35:12,366
Why? You don't want to?

590
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,286
- You're going to walk?
- Let's walk slowly.

591
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,846
Sure, then.

592
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:17,685
We'll eat later anyway.

593
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:20,566
- You're going up?
- I'll just walk slowly.

594
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,046
You're wearing sneakers.

595
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:23,606
What's with my sneakers?

596
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,486
(The staff are flustered
by this unexpected reaction)

597
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:28,286
(I love mountains)

598
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:31,046
- What do you think? You're okay?
- I love it.

599
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:32,606
Your legs don't hurt?
Are you okay?

600
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:35,606
We can just walk back down
if it gets exhausting.

601
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:41,326
(Is he the same man who
used to hate mountains?)

602
00:35:42,526 --> 00:35:44,406
(Humming away)

603
00:35:44,806 --> 00:35:46,486
Isn't it wonderful that
this will be part

604
00:35:46,606 --> 00:35:47,846
of our memories?

605
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:52,486
(They entered the path to go
to Nogodan Peak of Mount Jiri)

606
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:56,326
(They start by walking slowly)

607
00:35:56,685 --> 00:35:59,526
- Ah.
- This feels good.

608
00:35:59,645 --> 00:36:02,486
(First feeling: Good)

609
00:36:03,486 --> 00:36:07,486
(Nogodan Peak course is suitable
for novices as well)

610
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:10,685
I guess many people hike here.

611
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:14,526
I can't believe how perfect
the weather is.

612
00:36:14,645 --> 00:36:16,526
(The cooling weather helps
with today's hike)

613
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:20,886
(He is still relaxed)

614
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:23,326
(On the other hand)

615
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:25,046
Aren't you happy
when we're just at home?

616
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:28,806
(There are people who suddenly
have to struggle)

617
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:31,966
(Running)

618
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:34,926
My gosh. Those are heavy.

619
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:37,766
(Worried about the staff
hiking up with their equipment)

620
00:36:38,165 --> 00:36:40,326
We can just walk slowly.

621
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:44,206
(They decided to walk slowly)

622
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:47,366
We have to check
your microphones first.

623
00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:50,366
(Staff have to stop Seungwon
because of his microphone)

624
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:53,685
This frequency isn't clear as
we're in a different area.

625
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:56,165
You're not doing this as
you're tired, are you?

626
00:36:56,286 --> 00:36:57,886
No, not at all.

627
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:01,046
(We're not taking a break)

628
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:04,165
(We are trying to fix
the problem right now)

629
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:09,526
(Working hard)

630
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:11,846
(Waiting)

631
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:17,685
Isn't this taking too long?

632
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:20,526
(Giggling)

633
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,406
(Done)

634
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:27,486
(The short rest...no,
the issue has been fixed)

635
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:31,326
- Hello.
- Hello.

636
00:37:31,926 --> 00:37:34,685
(They greet those who are
hiking too)

637
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:38,645
(They continue to walk forward)

638
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:42,685
(Panting)

639
00:37:43,046 --> 00:37:45,406
(The staff are getting tired)

640
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:47,006
(Sighing)

641
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,566
(One camera is out of focus)

642
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:52,886
(This is how Taegoo is doing)

643
00:37:53,886 --> 00:37:55,645
Please have some water.

644
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:57,806
(Taking care of the staff
at 0.1 decibels)

645
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:00,926
- Do you want some water?
- No, thank you.

646
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,286
(Why is he whispering
to the cameraman?)

647
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:06,086
(Giggling)

648
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:08,126
(Taegoo feels bad
for the cameraman)

649
00:38:09,366 --> 00:38:11,126
(Patting)

650
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:14,165
Let's take a short break.

651
00:38:14,286 --> 00:38:15,806
- Really?
- Yes.

652
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,846
I'm still feeling fine.
Why are we resting?

653
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:21,326
(It's time to check on
their heart status)

654
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:24,446
How are you feeling right now?

655
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:27,566
I'm at number 2 now.

656
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,766
My chest hurts.

657
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:32,126
(Self-diagnosing)

658
00:38:32,486 --> 00:38:35,446
I saw someone who has been
looking pale since earlier.

659
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:38,486
I think there was a staff
who looks pale.

660
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:41,726
How many kilometers
are left from here?

661
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:43,326
Let's walk for another kilometer.

662
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,126
To go to Nogodan Peak,

663
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:49,246
it takes 300 meters to go
to Munenggi.

664
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:52,206
Nogodan Shelter Area
is around 2.2 kilometers.

665
00:38:52,326 --> 00:38:56,046
We have walked for 1.4 km.

666
00:38:56,165 --> 00:39:01,086
Really? Then, let's walk to
the place that's 300 meters way.

667
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:04,645
(Even a 1,000 li journey
starts with one step)

668
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:07,366
I think he's going to faint
if we walk further.

669
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:09,645
- It's because of the equipment.
- Yes.

670
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:12,086
(Kim Seonwoo, audio director:
Has started to feel chest pain)

671
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:14,006
Okay. Alright.

672
00:39:14,806 --> 00:39:15,645
Okay.

673
00:39:15,766 --> 00:39:17,726
Put all those down
and take a short break.

674
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:22,366
(These look light but they
are actually 15kg)

675
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:25,846
(He just extended his waist life
thanks to that)

676
00:39:27,486 --> 00:39:31,086
I haven't walked for a long time.
This feels good.

677
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:33,526
Let's take a picture together.

678
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,645
(They take pictures
since they're resting)

679
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:41,206
(On Mount Jiri where people
would like to come once)

680
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:42,685
How is this?

681
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:44,766
Looks good.

682
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:46,926
I want this too.

683
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:49,406
- I'll send this to you.
- Thank you.

684
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:52,806
(While he's at it, he takes
a selfie with Taegoo too)

685
00:39:53,566 --> 00:39:54,766
My goodness.

686
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:57,446
(He doesn't know what to do)

687
00:39:58,685 --> 00:40:00,606
Honey.

688
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:03,286
(Hong Jeongpyo, main cameraman,
he has been left behind)

689
00:40:03,726 --> 00:40:05,286
(The missing staff are back)

690
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:06,846
- Honey.
- Yes.

691
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:08,526
Shall we hike a bit more
and go down?

692
00:40:08,645 --> 00:40:10,286
(Rest time is over)

693
00:40:10,406 --> 00:40:12,366
300 meters?

694
00:40:12,486 --> 00:40:16,206
1km is just right but to go to
the shelter...

695
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:20,726
Nogodan Pass is 1km away.

696
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:22,966
There is Nogodan Pass which is
1km away.

697
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:26,086
(But the easy path there
is as far as 2.6km)

698
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:29,966
(If you decide to go up
the stairs, it's only 1km)

699
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:34,086
I think this 1km path is
a bit uncomfortable.

700
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:35,726
(They will go up another 1km
after walking for 300 meters?)

701
00:40:35,846 --> 00:40:38,366
I think this path is tough.
Will you be okay?

702
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:40,846
(There is no end to these stairs)

703
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:44,406
- Let's look at the peak.
- Okay.

704
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,486
(They decided to go up
the shortcut to the peak)

705
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,086
You should go first.

706
00:40:51,286 --> 00:40:55,726
(They wait so that the staff
can go up slowly)

707
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,086
(Thanks to them, the staff
get to walk slowly)

708
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:03,526
(Now, there is a distance
between them)

709
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:06,606
We should get going too.

710
00:41:08,046 --> 00:41:10,886
(The trio starts to walk up)

711
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:14,366
(He is running?)

712
00:41:15,926 --> 00:41:17,606
You're going to run up the stairs?

713
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,645
(The gap between them...)

714
00:41:20,766 --> 00:41:22,446
Haejin is running up.

715
00:41:22,886 --> 00:41:24,046
(The audio director
who was relaxing)

716
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:28,886
(An unwelcome guest)

717
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:32,645
(Running)

718
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:36,846
(The cameramen start to run too)

719
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:38,685
(Staff 1 and 2)

720
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:44,685
(There are more running crew
on Mount Jiri)

721
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:49,286
(Even after running for
5km this morning)

722
00:41:49,886 --> 00:41:52,606
(The train is running again)

723
00:41:53,246 --> 00:41:54,566
- Taegoo.
- Yes.

724
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:56,685
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

725
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,286
- You're happy?
- Yes.

726
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:01,246
Why is he running?

727
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:02,966
Why is he running?

728
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:04,165
(But why?)

729
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:07,806
(It's because that is where
the path lies)

730
00:42:09,566 --> 00:42:12,046
(Even the staff join him
on his run)

731
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:13,806
(Groaning)

732
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,685
(The issue of towel dropping)

733
00:42:18,886 --> 00:42:22,006
(He tries to run after Haejin
as he doesn't want to lose him)

734
00:42:22,126 --> 00:42:23,486
This is the path.

735
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:29,286
(Haejin decided to go for
a path that is steep)

736
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:33,326
(Stone stairs which is
the hardest path to Nogodan Peak)

737
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:34,926
(There are more stairs ahead)

738
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:38,766
(This is a difficult path that
shortens the distance)

739
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:45,366
(Haejin continues to climb up
without hesitation)

740
00:42:46,086 --> 00:42:48,286
I guess this is how
the path will be.

741
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:52,086
(There is no end
to these stone stairs)

742
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:54,526
(In the end)

743
00:42:55,246 --> 00:42:57,645
(Zoom in)

744
00:42:58,486 --> 00:43:00,926
(He will soon bid farewell
to the cameraman's zoom in)

745
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:05,726
(The running train disappears)

746
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:07,566
(On the other hand)

747
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:10,086
This is the tough path
towards Nogodan Pass?

748
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:11,366
Yes.

749
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:15,046
(Seungwon and Taegoo start
the stone stairs too)

750
00:43:18,086 --> 00:43:20,766
(They meet staff that were
left behind at the stairs)

751
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:22,966
You should rest.

752
00:43:23,086 --> 00:43:24,806
Oh? Hey.

753
00:43:24,926 --> 00:43:26,086
Get some rest.

754
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:29,685
(There are fewer people
who are going up now)

755
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:33,446
(To make things worse)

756
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:38,926
(The camera angle gets further)

757
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:40,806
(Groaning)

758
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:42,806
This is not part of our plan.

759
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:46,286
(There is no end
to these stone stairs)

760
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:48,806
(The audio director is resting)

761
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:51,566
Please don't go to the end.

762
00:43:51,685 --> 00:43:54,766
I will never be left behind.

763
00:43:54,886 --> 00:43:56,486
It's okay to be left behind.

764
00:43:57,726 --> 00:43:58,966
(Screaming)

765
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:00,685
(Seungwon and Taegoo)

766
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:04,246
(Although they are not filmed
by any cameras)

767
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:05,246
This is refreshing.

768
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:08,726
(Taking deep breaths)

769
00:44:09,846 --> 00:44:13,046
(Looks like
they are going up fine)

770
00:44:13,886 --> 00:44:17,726
(One camera is lost after
Haejin went out of sight)

771
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:22,806
(Unexpected reunion)

772
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,366
If we walk
for another 20 minutes...

773
00:44:25,486 --> 00:44:27,526
No, it takes around 30 minutes
to arrive at the peak.

774
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:29,246
Over there?

775
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,246
Where?

776
00:44:30,366 --> 00:44:33,846
He said that it takes 30 minutes
to get to the peak.

777
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:34,726
(Current location)

778
00:44:34,846 --> 00:44:37,165
It'll be great if we get there.

779
00:44:37,286 --> 00:44:38,886
Over there.

780
00:44:39,486 --> 00:44:42,006
(The peak feels relatively close)

781
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,406
This is it.

782
00:44:43,526 --> 00:44:46,286
(Finally, we get to capture them)

783
00:44:46,406 --> 00:44:48,446
- Stone stairs.
- Tough path for 30 minutes.

784
00:44:48,566 --> 00:44:51,165
- Comfortable path for 40 minutes.
- Let's walk for 40 minutes.

785
00:44:51,286 --> 00:44:52,526
(No more stone stairs)

786
00:44:52,645 --> 00:44:55,766
It's tough because
those are stone stairs.

787
00:44:57,206 --> 00:44:58,366
You don't have to run after me.

788
00:44:58,486 --> 00:45:00,366
You're planning to run,
aren't you?

789
00:45:00,486 --> 00:45:03,206
(The running train still has
energy to run)

790
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,645
(There he goes again)

791
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:07,886
Hello.

792
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:09,685
Do you know why he is running?

793
00:45:10,246 --> 00:45:11,246
Sorry?

794
00:45:11,366 --> 00:45:12,606
Do you know why he runs?

795
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:14,446
- I don't.
- He wants to drink makgeolli.

796
00:45:14,566 --> 00:45:15,526
I see.

797
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:17,566
He has to do that much

798
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:21,246
to feel less guilty
when he drinks.

799
00:45:22,326 --> 00:45:24,606
(He exercises first
before he drinks)

800
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:28,726
(He is getting rid of
his sense of guilt)

801
00:45:29,366 --> 00:45:31,566
(What is so great
about makgeolli?)

802
00:45:32,206 --> 00:45:34,446
(Does it make one run endlessly)

803
00:45:35,286 --> 00:45:36,886
(This time, once again)

804
00:45:37,006 --> 00:45:38,886
(Goodbye)

805
00:45:41,726 --> 00:45:43,766
(He's gone)

806
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,165
(Seungwon and Taegoo)

807
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,326
(Wearing sneakers)

808
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:53,206
(They have been walking for
50 minutes in sneakers)

809
00:45:54,486 --> 00:45:56,165
- Are you okay?
- I'm great.

810
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,766
- This feels nice, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

811
00:45:59,685 --> 00:46:02,246
I haven't walked this much
in a long time.

812
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:04,366
Nice.

813
00:46:04,486 --> 00:46:07,206
(Unique charm of hiking that is
exhausting yet refreshing)

814
00:46:07,846 --> 00:46:09,006
That must be it.

815
00:46:09,886 --> 00:46:11,766
(Even Seungwon who
we trusted in)

816
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:12,886
That must be it.

817
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:15,006
(He starts to run)

818
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:16,406
(Ah)

819
00:46:19,806 --> 00:46:20,645
I can't run.

820
00:46:21,566 --> 00:46:22,446
Run!

821
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:26,526
Shall I carry this as I run?

822
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:32,326
(Sweet Taegoo carries the camera
for the staff instead)

823
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:34,086
(Excited)

824
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:36,886
(This is the reason
they are running)

825
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:42,486
(Stone tower that is
the symbol of the peak)

826
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:44,526
(Wow)

827
00:46:44,645 --> 00:46:45,406
This is it?

828
00:46:46,486 --> 00:46:47,966
(However)

829
00:46:48,326 --> 00:46:50,046
(Haejin who left earlier
is nowhere to be seen)

830
00:46:58,646 --> 00:46:59,206
Isn't this it?

831
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:01,326
I think it's over there.

832
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:02,486
Where is it?

833
00:47:02,846 --> 00:47:03,846
It's over there.

834
00:47:04,726 --> 00:47:05,765
Isn't that the place?

835
00:47:06,486 --> 00:47:08,285
I guess this is not it.

836
00:47:08,406 --> 00:47:09,126
Let's go there.

837
00:47:11,046 --> 00:47:12,446
Now I know why I thought
something is not right.

838
00:47:13,285 --> 00:47:16,486
(The real peak is over there)

839
00:47:17,846 --> 00:47:20,446
My goodness. This place...

840
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:23,926
We are close to arriving
at Nogodan Peak

841
00:47:24,046 --> 00:47:25,446
and there is a lizard here.

842
00:47:26,285 --> 00:47:27,126
(Panting)

843
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:28,406
What is that thing in the sky?

844
00:47:30,326 --> 00:47:31,206
That's a drone.

845
00:47:33,245 --> 00:47:35,606
(Haejin is done enjoying
the rare view)

846
00:47:36,366 --> 00:47:40,285
(The final spurt to arrive
at the peak)

847
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:42,686
(Panting)

848
00:47:42,806 --> 00:47:43,526
(Happy)

849
00:47:43,646 --> 00:47:44,486
Hello.

850
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:47,206
- Hello.
- Hello.

851
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:50,566
(Someone famous has arrived
at Mount Jiri)

852
00:47:51,046 --> 00:47:53,526
(He takes pictures
with hikers too)

853
00:47:56,646 --> 00:48:01,646
(The peak he has been aiming
for is in front of his eyes)

854
00:48:05,646 --> 00:48:08,326
(He passes by the ridges
of Mount Jiri)

855
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:11,606
(where vast scenery
is peeking at him)

856
00:48:12,606 --> 00:48:16,646
(He can't stop despite panting)

857
00:48:17,446 --> 00:48:18,966
(Yeah)

858
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:20,086
Nogodan.

859
00:48:21,646 --> 00:48:24,006
(Welcome)

860
00:48:25,926 --> 00:48:27,326
Nogodan.

861
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,846
It's 1,507 meters above sea level.

862
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:31,126
(Wow)

863
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,206
(Ha)

864
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:33,846
This is beautiful.

865
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:37,926
Amazing.

866
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:41,566
(The vast scenery makes them
forget about their labored breath)

867
00:48:48,566 --> 00:48:50,046
How do I say this?

868
00:48:52,726 --> 00:48:56,765
(A view that does not need words
to be described)

869
00:48:59,206 --> 00:49:02,606
(Shining green peaks
of mountains too)

870
00:49:04,285 --> 00:49:09,086
(The place where one's head
can touch the clouds)

871
00:49:10,966 --> 00:49:16,206
(Let's enjoy this view in silence)

872
00:49:22,245 --> 00:49:23,926
*On the other hand)

873
00:49:24,686 --> 00:49:26,046
(These two are exhausted)

874
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:27,606
(Sighing)

875
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:28,926
(Panting)

876
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:29,926
(Another pant)

877
00:49:31,846 --> 00:49:36,046
(They become silent at one point)

878
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:40,886
(They are about to reach
the peak as well)

879
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:42,245
(Ah)

880
00:49:43,006 --> 00:49:46,285
(They are walking along
the ridge Haejin ran through)

881
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:51,606
(They use up their final energy
to climb up the stairs)

882
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:55,966
(The peak they've been looking
forward to is right there)

883
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:02,926
(Looks like they don't even have
the energy to be excited)

884
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:05,086
(Ah)

885
00:50:06,806 --> 00:50:08,046
You ran non-stop?

886
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:08,726
Yes.

887
00:50:08,846 --> 00:50:09,966
(Wow)

888
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:13,765
But I think it's a good thing
that we decided to hike up.

889
00:50:14,966 --> 00:50:15,726
This is mind-blowing.

890
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,245
(Finally, they get to see
the green view)

891
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:23,245
It will be amazing if we can
paraglide from this space.

892
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:24,206
This is amazing.

893
00:50:25,406 --> 00:50:27,926
(A view that makes one feel fresh)

894
00:50:28,046 --> 00:50:31,046
(It is difficult yet doable
to climb up to Nogodan)

895
00:50:31,366 --> 00:50:34,046
(At the same time)

896
00:50:34,526 --> 00:50:35,806
This is amazing.

897
00:50:35,926 --> 00:50:37,126
Gorgeous.

898
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:39,046
(The staff are enjoying
the peak as well)

899
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:41,566
This is very moving.

900
00:50:43,726 --> 00:50:44,886
Why did they decide
to hike here?

901
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:47,846
I should have stopped
half way through.

902
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:48,686
Right?

903
00:50:48,806 --> 00:50:51,446
(Audio director has safely
arrived at the peak)

904
00:50:51,566 --> 00:50:53,726
(Reading the history of Nogodan)

905
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:56,086
This is where Hwarang trained?

906
00:50:57,966 --> 00:50:59,886
Is there a reason they have
to hike to somewhere high?

907
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:02,286
What is that place?

908
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:05,206
(They see a place located
on the south side of Mount Jiri)

909
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:07,646
Apgujeong-dong!

910
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:11,086
I think that's Gurye.

911
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:12,006
Gurye?

912
00:51:12,886 --> 00:51:14,006
(Gurye?)

913
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:17,446
(He keeps a distance from Haejin)

914
00:51:18,766 --> 00:51:20,686
We can actually see Seomjin River.

915
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:24,646
(Seomjin River is flowing
at the bottom of the mountain)

916
00:51:28,966 --> 00:51:33,966
(They enjoy the view longer as
they struggled to hike up here)

917
00:51:34,086 --> 00:51:36,326
We need to see the name.
So stand like this.

918
00:51:36,446 --> 00:51:37,246
(Compulsory to take
a picture at the top)

919
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:39,206
1, 2, 3.

920
00:51:41,726 --> 00:51:45,246
(That is the end of their hike
on Mount Jiri)

921
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:49,926
I was so excited when
I was running up here.

922
00:51:50,046 --> 00:51:51,326
- You were?
- Yes.

923
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:54,446
Your face is so sweaty.

924
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:58,926
(And)

925
00:52:00,606 --> 00:52:04,246
(The way down
is much more comfortable)

926
00:52:05,646 --> 00:52:08,726
I'm so glad to have you here.

927
00:52:08,846 --> 00:52:10,726
I'm very happy.

928
00:52:10,846 --> 00:52:12,726
So am I.

929
00:52:12,846 --> 00:52:15,526
I don't have much experience
being on variety shows

930
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:18,326
but it's my first time to be able
to heal on one.

931
00:52:18,446 --> 00:52:19,846
Usually, I'm just nervous.

932
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:24,886
I always feel a sense of shame
when I film a variety show.

933
00:52:25,006 --> 00:52:28,766
I feel frustrated with myself.

934
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:32,126
I felt like I was unable
to have a simple conversation.

935
00:52:32,246 --> 00:52:33,326
Really?

936
00:52:35,046 --> 00:52:40,366
I'm fascinated how people
enjoy seeing me like that.

937
00:52:40,486 --> 00:52:42,886
I don't even have to change
who I am.

938
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:45,166
That is what I like about you.

939
00:52:48,486 --> 00:52:50,646
I know you won't change,

940
00:52:50,766 --> 00:52:52,246
but you shouldn't either.

941
00:52:55,366 --> 00:53:03,966
(Perhaps Mount Jiri helped Taegoo
feel a bit more at ease)

942
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:14,286
(Their hike up Mount Jiri is over)

943
00:53:14,406 --> 00:53:15,326
The first restaurant?

944
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:18,846
(Looks like they saw
a restaurant on the way here)

945
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:21,366
We have to head towards
Baemsagol? This way?

946
00:53:21,486 --> 00:53:23,046
- Right turn?
- Yes.

947
00:53:25,406 --> 00:53:28,366
(They head to Baemsagol
to fill their stomachs)

948
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:34,886
(Just as expected after hiking,
they are tired in the car)

949
00:53:35,366 --> 00:53:37,726
(Taegoo who woke up at 6AM)

950
00:53:39,566 --> 00:53:41,606
(His eyes start to get heavy)

951
00:53:42,246 --> 00:53:43,126
Are you happy, Taegoo?

952
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:44,246
(Surprised)

953
00:53:44,366 --> 00:53:45,686
I love this.

954
00:53:47,126 --> 00:53:48,686
It was amazing.

955
00:53:49,566 --> 00:53:52,086
(He gets to overcome his crisis)

956
00:53:53,246 --> 00:53:54,726
Are you hungry, Taegoo?

957
00:53:54,846 --> 00:53:55,966
I...

958
00:53:56,086 --> 00:53:57,446
- You're a bit hungry?
- Yes.

959
00:53:59,526 --> 00:54:01,646
(Battling his eyelids)

960
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:06,046
(They enter the restaurant
they saw on the way up)

961
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:08,806
Fischer's Ragwort pancake?
Vegetable pancake?

962
00:54:08,926 --> 00:54:10,006
Vegetable pancake.

963
00:54:10,126 --> 00:54:11,326
(He answers his own question)

964
00:54:11,686 --> 00:54:13,086
(As for Taegoo)

965
00:54:13,806 --> 00:54:15,726
(He is not on pause)

966
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:17,206
What do you want to eat?

967
00:54:17,326 --> 00:54:18,686
Me?

968
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:20,646
I...

969
00:54:21,246 --> 00:54:23,606
(Taking a deep breath)

970
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:25,046
I'm not sure.

971
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:27,406
What kind of makgeolli is there?

972
00:54:27,526 --> 00:54:28,686
We have rice makgeolli.

973
00:54:28,806 --> 00:54:30,166
Yes, please give us that.

974
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,806
I just placed our order.
If I have to wait for you,

975
00:54:32,926 --> 00:54:34,366
I think it'll take an hour.

976
00:54:36,566 --> 00:54:41,726
(The makgeolli Haejin
was waiting for is here)

977
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:45,326
Good job, everybody.

978
00:54:47,006 --> 00:54:48,086
(Taegoo drinks water)

979
00:54:48,206 --> 00:54:50,326
(Seungwon drinks beer)

980
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:54,766
(Haejin empties his bowl
right away)

981
00:54:55,766 --> 00:54:56,726
(Oh)

982
00:54:57,886 --> 00:55:01,966
(The side dishes are served first)

983
00:55:04,646 --> 00:55:07,086
(Taegoo is about to cut kimchi)

984
00:55:07,966 --> 00:55:10,046
(Slow)

985
00:55:13,006 --> 00:55:14,246
Shall I cut it?

986
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:16,606
Let me do it.

987
00:55:16,726 --> 00:55:19,086
(The impatient one decided
to do it today too)

988
00:55:19,206 --> 00:55:20,126
Pass it to me.

989
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:22,606
(Fascinated)

990
00:55:24,206 --> 00:55:27,366
(He cuts kimchi deliciously)

991
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:31,126
(Ah)

992
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:33,206
This is very tasty.

993
00:55:33,326 --> 00:55:34,166
Try it.

994
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:37,126
(Yum)

995
00:55:37,246 --> 00:55:38,206
(Satisfied)

996
00:55:39,246 --> 00:55:40,686
Thank you.

997
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:46,126
(Vegetable pancake,
the main dish, is served)

998
00:55:47,966 --> 00:55:50,966
(Seungwon tries it first)

999
00:55:53,406 --> 00:55:54,566
This is tasty.

1000
00:55:55,806 --> 00:55:56,726
It's good.

1001
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:58,686
Try it. It's good.

1002
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:01,046
(Yum)

1003
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,046
(Yummy)

1004
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,286
It's very delicious, isn't it?

1005
00:56:04,246 --> 00:56:05,086
The chef is talented.

1006
00:56:05,206 --> 00:56:06,566
Definitely.

1007
00:56:08,526 --> 00:56:09,286
Have some, Taegoo.

1008
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:12,046
It's delicious.

1009
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:16,366
(Taegoo dips it in sauce
before eating it)

1010
00:56:20,686 --> 00:56:22,046
- Right?
- Yes.

1011
00:56:24,806 --> 00:56:28,726
(They become hungry
after hiking up the mountain)

1012
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:35,086
(They fill their stomachs with
a simple vegetable pancake)

1013
00:56:37,886 --> 00:56:40,686
(Patting)

1014
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:43,406
(Restless)

1015
00:56:43,846 --> 00:56:44,406
What?

1016
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,726
I'm just very happy.

1017
00:56:45,846 --> 00:56:47,686
(He habitually confesses his love)

1018
00:56:48,646 --> 00:56:49,846
You should pack your things.

1019
00:56:51,486 --> 00:56:55,366
(Taegoo has to go home
because he has to leave)

1020
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:00,046
(Sighing)

1021
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:03,246
My goodness.

1022
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:11,486
(They silently have a toast)

1023
00:57:13,486 --> 00:57:14,646
This place serves good food.

1024
00:57:15,446 --> 00:57:20,046
(They are going home)

1025
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:21,406
Okay.

1026
00:57:24,326 --> 00:57:26,006
(Thumb up)

1027
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:27,726
What is that?

1028
00:57:27,846 --> 00:57:29,326
It means we went there.

1029
00:57:30,006 --> 00:57:31,966
(He acts as if he just
hiked up Mount Everest)

1030
00:57:32,086 --> 00:57:33,366
Cook dinner for us, Producer Na.

1031
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:35,286
- Shall I?
- Yes.

1032
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:37,006
Cook budae jjigae for dinner.

1033
00:57:39,246 --> 00:57:43,246
(He checks on the broth to
make their dinner)

1034
00:57:43,846 --> 00:57:46,966
(Taegoo who had to drive
is back home too)

1035
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:49,766
Taegoo, you have to leave soon.

1036
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:50,686
You're late.

1037
00:57:50,806 --> 00:57:51,686
It's fine.

1038
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,686
(It's past 6PM now)

1039
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:56,966
I can start the fire
right now, can't I?

1040
00:57:57,086 --> 00:57:58,166
No, not yet.

1041
00:57:58,286 --> 00:58:01,246
(Seungwon and Haejin will
start cooking right away)

1042
00:58:02,126 --> 00:58:04,886
(Taegoo has to go back to Seoul)

1043
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:08,846
(He takes the clothes he hung
and gets ready to leave)

1044
00:58:09,566 --> 00:58:11,966
(He organizes the slippers
that he will use to go back)

1045
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:15,686
(He takes his things and goes in)

1046
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:18,846
Are we saying goodbye
to Taegoo now?

1047
00:58:19,286 --> 00:58:20,766
(Sighing)

1048
00:58:20,886 --> 00:58:23,366
I was very happy when
I saw Taegoo was our guest.

1049
00:58:23,486 --> 00:58:24,806
This feels amazing.

1050
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:28,126
We went up to the peak
because we have Taegoo with us.

1051
00:58:28,246 --> 00:58:29,926
It was good in many ways.

1052
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:35,446
(Taegoo changes out of his
clothes that are wet from sweat)

1053
00:58:35,966 --> 00:58:38,246
(Checking to make sure
he didn't leave anything behind)

1054
00:58:41,126 --> 00:58:42,806
You changed your clothes.

1055
00:58:42,926 --> 00:58:45,766
Taegoo, you have to peel
onions before you leave.

1056
00:58:45,886 --> 00:58:47,726
- Yes, that's right.
- Peel me two onions.

1057
00:58:47,846 --> 00:58:48,846
Okay.

1058
00:58:48,966 --> 00:58:51,046
- I forgot about that.
- You don't have time for that.

1059
00:58:52,086 --> 00:58:55,206
(They wanted to eat with Taegoo
but he has work to do)

1060
00:58:55,846 --> 00:58:58,366
(He returns the microphone)

1061
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:01,606
(Thanking even when
she has turned around)

1062
00:59:02,566 --> 00:59:03,166
What?

1063
00:59:03,286 --> 00:59:05,326
(He doesn't forget to thank others
until the last moment)

1064
00:59:05,686 --> 00:59:06,526
You're leaving?

1065
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:07,806
He's leaving now.

1066
00:59:08,766 --> 00:59:09,686
Good job.

1067
00:59:10,806 --> 00:59:12,246
He's leaving.

1068
00:59:12,366 --> 00:59:13,126
Good job.

1069
00:59:13,246 --> 00:59:14,366
Taegoo is leaving.

1070
00:59:17,446 --> 00:59:18,526
See you next time.

1071
00:59:18,646 --> 00:59:20,086
Let's do that.

1072
00:59:20,206 --> 00:59:21,046
Let's do that.

1073
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:27,646
(He hugs Seungwon)

1074
00:59:27,766 --> 00:59:29,206
You should get going.

1075
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:32,726
I'm not sure if you
had fun being here.

1076
00:59:32,846 --> 00:59:33,886
It was wonderful.

1077
00:59:34,846 --> 00:59:37,446
It was?
I'm glad you felt that way.

1078
00:59:37,566 --> 00:59:40,006
I hope you enjoyed your meal.

1079
00:59:40,126 --> 00:59:42,326
(Very satisfied)

1080
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:46,206
(The trio say their farewell
in Taegoo's tone)

1081
00:59:47,206 --> 00:59:48,926
Thank you for inviting me.

1082
00:59:49,046 --> 00:59:51,326
Thank you. Good job.

1083
00:59:51,446 --> 00:59:53,926
(He greets all staff)

1084
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:59,246
(It's now time to say goodbye
to Taegoo)

1085
01:00:01,046 --> 01:00:04,966
(He never stops saying goodbye
until he leaves)

1086
01:00:06,126 --> 01:00:08,126
- Those are your shoes?
- Yes.

1087
01:00:10,246 --> 01:00:12,326
You should go.
I'm glad you were here.

1088
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:14,366
(Greeting the staff outside too)

1089
01:00:15,326 --> 01:00:17,046
Did you get sunburnt from today?

1090
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:19,006
It must've been from yesterday.

1091
01:00:19,126 --> 01:00:21,206
(This is their final summer spent
with Taegoo for this year)

1092
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,326
Goodbye.

1093
01:00:22,446 --> 01:00:24,606
Goodbye.

1094
01:00:24,726 --> 01:00:25,566
Good job.

1095
01:00:37,046 --> 01:00:38,646
We have said goodbye
to another guest.

1096
01:00:44,046 --> 01:00:48,206
(It's just them at home
after seeing their guest off)

1097
01:00:48,966 --> 01:00:51,126
I wanted to get Taegoo
to peel onions for me.

1098
01:00:51,246 --> 01:00:53,526
- You're telling me to do it?
- Yes.

1099
01:00:55,446 --> 01:00:56,206
Give me the onions.

1100
01:00:56,326 --> 01:00:57,166
Onions.

1101
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,366
(Today's dinner menu)

1102
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:02,406
(They prepared bone broth
on their first day)

1103
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:05,326
We can even make
budae jjigae with that broth.

1104
01:01:05,646 --> 01:01:07,646
(Haejin is reminded of
budae jjigae)

1105
01:01:07,766 --> 01:01:09,486
Shall we have budae jjigae?

1106
01:01:09,606 --> 01:01:11,446
Really? Sounds good.

1107
01:01:11,566 --> 01:01:12,766
We never made budae jjigae before.

1108
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:15,166
(That is how they decided
to have budae jjigae)

1109
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:20,126
(Dinner menu: Budae jjigae)

1110
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:22,326
We just need this much. Just two.

1111
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:24,086
It's just for the two of us.

1112
01:01:24,206 --> 01:01:26,086
I'll just peel the onions.

1113
01:01:26,206 --> 01:01:27,166
This is not a big deal.

1114
01:01:28,486 --> 01:01:31,286
(The reliable assistant
starts to prepare the ingredients)

1115
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:35,366
(Chef Cha starts to make
the sauce for budae jjigae)

1116
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:38,966
(Pour in lots of thick soy sauce)

1117
01:01:39,646 --> 01:01:42,446
(He adds a lot of chili powder)

1118
01:01:43,446 --> 01:01:45,846
(Sea lance extract that
will add more umami)

1119
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:48,926
Let's peel the onions.

1120
01:01:49,046 --> 01:01:49,686
You're done?

1121
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,726
(He peels 2 onions quickly)

1122
01:01:52,406 --> 01:01:53,726
Don't get sick.
Here is your onion.

1123
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:55,446
There he goes again.

1124
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,886
(Add sugar too)

1125
01:02:00,486 --> 01:02:03,526
(Next is garlic that
Taegoo minced diligently)

1126
01:02:04,446 --> 01:02:07,526
(Add one big spoonful of garlic)

1127
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:11,246
(Add a bigger spoonful
of gochujang)

1128
01:02:11,846 --> 01:02:14,806
(Mix everything well)

1129
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:18,086
(Checking the taste)

1130
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:24,646
(Add more garlic and
chili powder to the sauce)

1131
01:02:26,246 --> 01:02:28,446
(Once it is mixed well)

1132
01:02:29,046 --> 01:02:30,926
(The sauce for budae jjigae
is ready)

1133
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:36,686
(Haejin is setting the radio
at the best spot)

1134
01:02:38,206 --> 01:02:42,126
(He gently adjusts the volume)

1135
01:02:43,446 --> 01:02:47,726
(He starts his duty as part of
the equipment team)

1136
01:02:50,926 --> 01:02:53,366
(Singing away)

1137
01:02:53,486 --> 01:02:55,326
The guitar is creating
beautiful music, isn't it?

1138
01:02:55,446 --> 01:02:56,846
My goodness.

1139
01:02:57,566 --> 01:03:00,086
(He loves to communicate)

1140
01:03:01,246 --> 01:03:05,566
(He will just reheat rice
they made last time)

1141
01:03:07,486 --> 01:03:12,086
(He enjoys his free time
and cleans dust from the firewood)

1142
01:03:12,846 --> 01:03:16,166
(Chef Cha is still busy as usual)

1143
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:19,846
(He takes various items
from the basket)

1144
01:03:20,886 --> 01:03:23,486
(They dropped by the mart on the
way back with Taegoo)

1145
01:03:23,606 --> 01:03:25,646
Do you have minced meat?

1146
01:03:28,246 --> 01:03:33,086
(They buy various ingredients like
ham and sausages for the stew)

1147
01:03:36,886 --> 01:03:40,486
(It's time to prepare
the ingredients he bought)

1148
01:03:41,246 --> 01:03:44,606
(He puts everything inside
the pot)

1149
01:03:45,686 --> 01:03:49,446
(Budae jjigae tastes better when
everything is boiled together)

1150
01:03:50,446 --> 01:03:54,086
(He slices the onion thinly)

1151
01:03:55,846 --> 01:03:58,926
(And places it
right on top of the pot)

1152
01:03:59,806 --> 01:04:04,126
(Cover the bottom of the pot
with onion to make it less greasy)

1153
01:04:05,046 --> 01:04:07,446
(Since he has added crunchy onion)

1154
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:12,846
(It's time to add ham and sausage)

1155
01:04:14,766 --> 01:04:17,806
(He adds square-shaped ham first)

1156
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:22,966
(He places them at different spots
so they absorb all seasoning well)

1157
01:04:24,606 --> 01:04:25,806
Yes, we have this too.

1158
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:28,166
You bought this here too?

1159
01:04:28,286 --> 01:04:31,406
Yes. I wasn't planning to add
that but since it's here, so...

1160
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:33,286
This is from Italy.

1161
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:36,886
(The neighborhood mart
has everything they need)

1162
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:39,726
I can smell the ham from here too.

1163
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:40,886
Yes.

1164
01:04:42,206 --> 01:04:44,606
(Next is imported sausages
that have a rich flavor)

1165
01:04:47,646 --> 01:04:50,006
(It's hard to open it)

1166
01:04:50,126 --> 01:04:50,886
Do you need my help?

1167
01:04:51,006 --> 01:04:52,246
Please open this for me.

1168
01:04:52,886 --> 01:04:56,246
(The equipment team has
to open packages too)

1169
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,806
(Sniff)

1170
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:07,046
(It's important to slice them
thinly to get the smell)

1171
01:05:10,726 --> 01:05:14,006
(Add lots of sausages
to make this look tasty)

1172
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:19,406
(Slice local sausages
as thin as the rest too)

1173
01:05:21,446 --> 01:05:24,566
(Next is minced pork)

1174
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:28,246
(Roll the meat into balls
and put them in the middle)

1175
01:05:29,646 --> 01:05:31,966
(The meat is in)

1176
01:05:32,086 --> 01:05:33,446
Honey, please take this.

1177
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:34,326
Give me that.

1178
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:38,846
(He gets to clean the porch
right away with Haejin's help)

1179
01:05:39,486 --> 01:05:42,326
(He adds in the baked beans)

1180
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:49,086
(This looks like a dish served at
a restaurant with the baked beans)

1181
01:05:49,966 --> 01:05:53,486
(A filling budae jjigae that does
not require other side dishes)

1182
01:05:54,206 --> 01:05:57,126
(But if something looks dull)

1183
01:05:57,846 --> 01:06:01,086
(He cuts the sandwich ham
into triangles)

1184
01:06:01,206 --> 01:06:02,726
(Square and circle)

1185
01:06:02,846 --> 01:06:06,166
(He likes diversity
in presentation)

1186
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,686
(Chef Cha makes sure both
the looks and taste are good)

1187
01:06:10,806 --> 01:06:11,806
Shall I start the fire now?

1188
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,166
Yes, go ahead.

1189
01:06:13,286 --> 01:06:16,246
(They just have to pour in
the bone broth and it's done)

1190
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:19,126
(Finally, Haejin is seated
in front of the brazier)

1191
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:23,286
(He can easily start a fire
as he cleaned it before)

1192
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:28,526
(He rolls the newspaper
and tosses them in)

1193
01:06:29,446 --> 01:06:32,446
(Since he has delivered
newspaper into the fire)

1194
01:06:33,886 --> 01:06:37,846
(The fire looks as nice as
a campfire)

1195
01:06:40,966 --> 01:06:46,046
(He stares at the fire
while listening to the radio)

1196
01:07:00,246 --> 01:07:04,246
(He raises his head and
enjoys the view from the yard)

1197
01:07:05,806 --> 01:07:11,246
(The sunset sky makes the view
of Mount Jiri even better)

1198
01:07:12,006 --> 01:07:13,126
Isn't the view the best
at this hour?

1199
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:14,166
- What?
- At this hour.

1200
01:07:14,286 --> 01:07:15,406
It's amazing.

1201
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,366
There is something about it.

1202
01:07:18,486 --> 01:07:20,966
There's something about this time.

1203
01:07:21,086 --> 01:07:25,366
Those directing go crazy
for this moment.

1204
01:07:25,486 --> 01:07:27,046
The light is beautiful.

1205
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,646
But it is very short.

1206
01:07:30,766 --> 01:07:34,326
(The dark sky slowly
turns scarlet)

1207
01:07:35,806 --> 01:07:40,446
(The sun is setting behind
the mountains)

1208
01:07:40,566 --> 01:07:42,926
We're the only ones left here?

1209
01:07:44,846 --> 01:07:45,606
Right?

1210
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,046
How does it feel to just be
the two of us?

1211
01:07:50,606 --> 01:07:52,526
Just set the stew.

1212
01:07:52,646 --> 01:07:53,606
What are we having with
the budae jjigae?

1213
01:07:53,726 --> 01:07:56,726
We can just have it
with the side dishes.

1214
01:07:57,486 --> 01:08:00,686
(It's time to place
the budae jjigae)

1215
01:08:01,046 --> 01:08:04,126
(The last thing to add before
putting it on fire is Welsh onion)

1216
01:08:04,646 --> 01:08:08,006
(He slices it into long pieces)

1217
01:08:08,686 --> 01:08:12,606
(He places them on the top)

1218
01:08:13,686 --> 01:08:17,486
(He removes the lid
to the bone broth pot)

1219
01:08:18,246 --> 01:08:20,646
(He removes the fat layer on top)

1220
01:08:20,766 --> 01:08:22,486
What did we use that for?

1221
01:08:22,606 --> 01:08:23,846
Rice cake soup.

1222
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:26,566
(He pours a generous amount of
broth that is made for 3 days)

1223
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:27,846
Let me carry that.

1224
01:08:31,846 --> 01:08:36,286
(Pour enough to just cover
the ingredients)

1225
01:08:37,726 --> 01:08:39,446
This looks good.

1226
01:08:39,566 --> 01:08:40,326
Okay. Put it over the fire.

1227
01:08:40,446 --> 01:08:41,246
Add a bit more.

1228
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:42,126
Why?

1229
01:08:42,246 --> 01:08:43,206
It might get dry.

1230
01:08:43,326 --> 01:08:45,246
(He adds another ladle)

1231
01:08:45,366 --> 01:08:46,366
Put it right now.

1232
01:08:46,486 --> 01:08:48,926
(The brazier that looks amazing)

1233
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:51,366
(Hot)

1234
01:08:52,726 --> 01:08:55,766
(Add cheese to make it
even more savory)

1235
01:08:59,846 --> 01:09:02,846
(Pour in the seasoning sauce
that he made earlier)

1236
01:09:10,006 --> 01:09:11,566
We just have to let it boil
and it's done, right?

1237
01:09:11,686 --> 01:09:13,485
Yes, we have to let it boil.

1238
01:09:13,606 --> 01:09:14,766
Let it simmer down.

1239
01:09:24,366 --> 01:09:27,406
(They just have
to let the stew boil)

1240
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:31,366
(Chef Cha goes in
to get their side dishes)

1241
01:09:32,766 --> 01:09:36,126
(There are many side dishes that
he made throughout their stay)

1242
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:40,846
(He takes out
3 side dishes container)

1243
01:09:40,966 --> 01:09:41,806
Ouch.

1244
01:09:43,126 --> 01:09:46,046
(He takes another big container
of kimchi)

1245
01:09:48,926 --> 01:09:52,406
(Even just the side dishes
would make him feel full)

1246
01:09:53,646 --> 01:09:58,606
(He will be serving seasoned
bean sprouts from this morning)

1247
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:02,525
(He tastes it again
before he serves it)

1248
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:07,646
(He sprinkles some salt
and mixes them well again)

1249
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,525
(These make us scream for rice)

1250
01:10:11,886 --> 01:10:12,806
Is it boiling?

1251
01:10:12,926 --> 01:10:14,766
Yes, it's boiling well.

1252
01:10:14,886 --> 01:10:15,926
Move the lid a bit.

1253
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,046
- Leave it open?
- Yes.

1254
01:10:18,126 --> 01:10:20,246
(Before the soup spills)

1255
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:23,286
(Remove the lid)

1256
01:10:25,286 --> 01:10:26,686
That looks delicious.

1257
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:28,485
Yes, it looks good.

1258
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:31,246
I think it looks delicious.

1259
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:38,846
(He plates the side dishes
while the stew is boiling)

1260
01:10:39,525 --> 01:10:41,126
How many plates do we need?

1261
01:10:41,246 --> 01:10:42,766
Another two.

1262
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:49,686
(Well-fermented geotjeori)

1263
01:10:51,485 --> 01:10:55,966
(Sesame leaves that have
absorbed the seasoning sauce)

1264
01:10:56,686 --> 01:11:01,206
(Lots of sesame leaves
that Haejin enjoys)

1265
01:11:03,646 --> 01:11:08,286
(He sets the side dishes first)

1266
01:11:08,406 --> 01:11:09,246
Those look good.

1267
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,126
Let's take a look.

1268
01:11:18,726 --> 01:11:20,726
(Ham in budae jjigae is salty)

1269
01:11:20,846 --> 01:11:22,966
(So taste it before adding
any extra seasoning)

1270
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:30,646
(The budae jjigae
has simmered down quite a lot)

1271
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:35,166
(He tastes the soup to see
if it needs more seasoning)

1272
01:11:35,286 --> 01:11:36,445
Done. Hold on.

1273
01:11:36,566 --> 01:11:37,846
(Looks like the flavors
have been simmered well)

1274
01:11:38,326 --> 01:11:40,966
(Adding more spiciness)

1275
01:11:41,525 --> 01:11:44,726
(Add more seasoning sauce)

1276
01:11:47,326 --> 01:11:51,006
We should add half ramyeon
noodles, shouldn't we?

1277
01:11:51,366 --> 01:11:53,886
(Ramyeon noodles are a must
in budae jjigae)

1278
01:11:59,286 --> 01:12:00,846
Give me the noodles.

1279
01:12:00,966 --> 01:12:03,246
We need to add it in now
so that the soup gets thicker.

1280
01:12:06,686 --> 01:12:09,766
(Just let it simmer
until the noodles are cooked)

1281
01:12:09,886 --> 01:12:12,126
Now, cover the pot.

1282
01:12:12,246 --> 01:12:13,126
Get the table.

1283
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,646
(They set the table as they
wait for the stew to be ready)

1284
01:12:17,326 --> 01:12:20,766
(See you in 3 minutes)

1285
01:12:21,966 --> 01:12:25,286
(They will have dinner at the
wooden bench with a nice view)

1286
01:12:27,485 --> 01:12:30,926
(Making spaces for the main dish)

1287
01:12:35,886 --> 01:12:37,246
- Is it done?
- Yes, take this.

1288
01:12:41,246 --> 01:12:42,246
Be careful.

1289
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:47,686
(He places the pot on the table)

1290
01:12:47,806 --> 01:12:48,926
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1291
01:12:50,126 --> 01:12:52,606
Put it here.
I'll remove everything for now.

1292
01:12:53,806 --> 01:12:54,646
Put it here.

1293
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:58,246
Yes.

1294
01:12:59,006 --> 01:13:01,966
(The table is full after
the main dish is set)

1295
01:13:02,646 --> 01:13:04,606
The dish is screaming that
it is budae jjigae.

1296
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,646
(Budae jjigae)

1297
01:13:09,246 --> 01:13:11,326
(They just have to serve rice)

1298
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:16,485
Done.

1299
01:13:19,286 --> 01:13:23,766
(4 types of side dishes
by Chef Cha)

1300
01:13:26,126 --> 01:13:29,445
(Rich-tasting budae jjigae
made with bone broth)

1301
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:38,886
(A filling meal of budae jjigae)

1302
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:39,886
Let me give you that.

1303
01:13:40,006 --> 01:13:41,406
No. Just this much.

1304
01:13:41,525 --> 01:13:43,886
(They serve the noodles first)

1305
01:13:46,246 --> 01:13:49,926
(Lots of ingredients)

1306
01:13:53,126 --> 01:13:54,046
Enjoy.

1307
01:13:54,886 --> 01:13:55,646
Thank you.

1308
01:13:55,766 --> 01:13:58,806
(He gives the bowl to
Chef Cha first as he worked hard)

1309
01:13:59,766 --> 01:14:03,766
(He scoops the noodles out
with his ladle too)

1310
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:05,926
This is our first time
to make budae jjigae, right?

1311
01:14:06,046 --> 01:14:06,726
Yes.

1312
01:14:08,566 --> 01:14:12,086
(He immediately eats the noodles
before it gets soggy)

1313
01:14:12,966 --> 01:14:15,445
(Haejin is searching for
something in the stew)

1314
01:14:15,566 --> 01:14:17,525
There's no kimchi in this?

1315
01:14:17,646 --> 01:14:18,846
I didn't add it.

1316
01:14:20,566 --> 01:14:23,606
(Chef Cha avoids adding kimchi to
stew after that accident)

1317
01:14:25,886 --> 01:14:27,206
I didn't add it in case
it becomes too tart.

1318
01:14:27,326 --> 01:14:28,445
(Chef Cha added lots of onions
instead of kimchi)

1319
01:14:30,046 --> 01:14:32,086
(Haejin starts with the soup)

1320
01:14:32,206 --> 01:14:33,926
I think
that story was interesting.

1321
01:14:34,046 --> 01:14:35,046
Which one?

1322
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:37,445
There are married couples
who fight every day.

1323
01:14:38,646 --> 01:14:41,246
Every day as they drink.

1324
01:14:41,366 --> 01:14:42,086
(Cheers)

1325
01:14:42,206 --> 01:14:43,366
'With you,

1326
01:14:44,766 --> 01:14:47,366
I've been able to be patient
right until this moment.

1327
01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:48,246
(Cheers)

1328
01:14:48,366 --> 01:14:49,406
But let's get divorced tomorrow.'

1329
01:14:49,525 --> 01:14:51,886
- But they keep on toasting.
- Really?

1330
01:14:52,006 --> 01:14:53,846
They never stop having a toast.

1331
01:14:53,966 --> 01:14:56,726
'We are separating?' 'Yes.'

1332
01:14:56,846 --> 01:14:58,966
That's what they talk about
but they never stop toasting.

1333
01:15:00,046 --> 01:15:02,366
(A serious talk about a couple
while drinking)

1334
01:15:02,485 --> 01:15:03,966
I think that's very funny.

1335
01:15:05,646 --> 01:15:08,606
(They eat while laughing)

1336
01:15:10,286 --> 01:15:13,525
(He eats ramyeon
with julienned green onion)

1337
01:15:14,286 --> 01:15:16,806
(He eats the round sausage too)

1338
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:17,766
What's certain is that

1339
01:15:19,445 --> 01:15:20,966
broth influences the taste
of this dish.

1340
01:15:25,406 --> 01:15:27,485
This is definitely richer.

1341
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,686
It's because we used good broth.

1342
01:15:28,806 --> 01:15:32,086
(Their budae jjigae tastes richer
because of the broth)

1343
01:15:44,525 --> 01:15:47,766
(They can't stop eating
after taking one sip)

1344
01:15:50,766 --> 01:15:53,206
(He eats the whole piece
of ham in one mouthful)

1345
01:15:53,326 --> 01:15:54,686
This is seasoned bean sprouts?

1346
01:15:54,806 --> 01:15:55,886
Yes, that's right.

1347
01:15:56,006 --> 01:15:58,046
(They didn't get to eat it
after seasoning it in the morning)

1348
01:16:03,606 --> 01:16:06,326
(Tasting Chef Cha's
crunchy bean sprouts)

1349
01:16:08,926 --> 01:16:11,445
(Eating
the well-fermented geotjeori)

1350
01:16:14,686 --> 01:16:15,525
This is delicious.

1351
01:16:21,846 --> 01:16:23,566
These sesame leaves are good.

1352
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:28,926
(He takes a piece of sesame leaf)

1353
01:16:30,606 --> 01:16:35,286
(He can taste how fragrant it is
when he eats it with rice)

1354
01:16:36,246 --> 01:16:39,166
(Adding a mouthful
of sesame leaves)

1355
01:16:40,246 --> 01:16:44,006
(He has a mouthful of budae jjigae
with four types of side dishes)

1356
01:16:44,806 --> 01:16:45,726
Delicious.

1357
01:16:46,846 --> 01:16:50,966
(A filling dinner after
their tough hike up the mountain)

1358
01:16:53,846 --> 01:16:55,206
No matter what...

1359
01:16:57,485 --> 01:16:58,086
(Cheers)

1360
01:16:58,206 --> 01:16:59,766
Dinner always tastes best when

1361
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:02,126
prepared and eaten
no matter what we do.

1362
01:17:02,246 --> 01:17:03,246
The mood is great too.

1363
01:17:05,326 --> 01:17:07,766
(They wrap up their day while
enjoying their relaxing meal)

1364
01:17:07,886 --> 01:17:09,326
Not forgetting having
some drinks as well.

1365
01:17:10,246 --> 01:17:11,046
This feels good.

1366
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:19,726
We're leaving tomorrow.

1367
01:17:21,445 --> 01:17:25,046
(This is their last night together
on a hot summer day)

1368
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:27,926
But I'm glad we went
to Nogodan Peak.

1369
01:17:28,046 --> 01:17:29,166
It was a good decision.

1370
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:33,206
Did Taegoo talk a lot
on the way down?

1371
01:17:33,766 --> 01:17:37,485
(Seungwon and Taegoo had a long
conversation while hiking down)

1372
01:17:37,606 --> 01:17:39,366
I guess he felt more comfortable.

1373
01:17:39,485 --> 01:17:40,166
That's good.

1374
01:17:40,286 --> 01:17:42,726
(Taegoo got used to being
with them quickly)

1375
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:45,006
You remember how he
was joking too?

1376
01:17:45,806 --> 01:17:50,126
(Taegoo seems more relaxed only
when his trip has almost ended)

1377
01:17:50,246 --> 01:17:52,646
I love seeing him that way.

1378
01:17:52,766 --> 01:17:54,126
He doesn't have to be
that way though.

1379
01:17:54,246 --> 01:17:57,766
It's so funny to see him
getting shy after making a joke.

1380
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,246
You're right.

1381
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:04,966
But he talks in a unique way.

1382
01:18:05,086 --> 01:18:05,846
Yes, he does.

1383
01:18:08,126 --> 01:18:10,806
- Yes.
- I like that.

1384
01:18:10,926 --> 01:18:12,286
He says what he feels.

1385
01:18:15,366 --> 01:18:18,286
Namgil sent a coffee cart too.

1386
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:19,286
Really?

1387
01:18:21,806 --> 01:18:22,966
I like Namgil too.

1388
01:18:23,086 --> 01:18:24,286
Yes, he's great too.

1389
01:18:26,646 --> 01:18:29,846
We'll see lots of stars tonight
since the sky is clear.

1390
01:18:31,126 --> 01:18:32,686
Today,

1391
01:18:32,806 --> 01:18:35,166
there will be many stars.

1392
01:18:37,766 --> 01:18:41,286
Today was an amazing day
for me.

1393
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:47,166
Let's wrap up our meal

1394
01:18:47,286 --> 01:18:48,886
and get ready for the next meal.

1395
01:18:50,246 --> 01:18:51,806
We still have some fire.

1396
01:18:52,846 --> 01:18:54,726
So can we cook
four packets of ramyeon?

1397
01:18:55,046 --> 01:18:59,046
(Some staff who went hiking
ended up missing their meal)

1398
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:00,646
Okay. I'll make those.

1399
01:19:00,766 --> 01:19:02,726
(Chef Cha decided to cook)

1400
01:19:02,846 --> 01:19:04,326
Should we add some eggs?

1401
01:19:04,445 --> 01:19:06,525
- I want the original version
- Okay.

1402
01:19:07,406 --> 01:19:11,206
(While Chef Cha fills
the pot with water)

1403
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:15,606
(Haejin makes the fire bigger)

1404
01:19:15,726 --> 01:19:17,366
The fire is amazing.

1405
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:19,166
The pot is going to melt.

1406
01:19:20,326 --> 01:19:22,726
(The fire spreads outside
the brazier thanks to Yeolmoa)

1407
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:23,566
This...

1408
01:19:23,686 --> 01:19:26,406
will make my CEO happy.

1409
01:19:26,525 --> 01:19:28,206
Call him.

1410
01:19:28,326 --> 01:19:29,766
No, I bet he is watching.

1411
01:19:29,886 --> 01:19:32,006
I want to see you
talking in French.

1412
01:19:33,126 --> 01:19:34,006
Yeolmoir.

1413
01:19:34,406 --> 01:19:37,566
He is abroad half of the year.

1414
01:19:37,686 --> 01:19:40,966
It's because he has to travel
between France and Sweden.

1415
01:19:41,086 --> 01:19:43,485
He travels a lot because of IKEYO.

1416
01:19:44,366 --> 01:19:45,406
He is busy.

1417
01:19:45,525 --> 01:19:46,886
He spends half of the year
in Europe.

1418
01:19:47,006 --> 01:19:50,485
He spends six months in Europe.

1419
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:54,606
(When the water is boiling)

1420
01:19:54,726 --> 01:19:57,806
(He adds the noodles first)

1421
01:20:00,206 --> 01:20:04,366
(Add the seasoning and other
ingredients at the right time)

1422
01:20:05,246 --> 01:20:06,406
This smells amazing.

1423
01:20:06,525 --> 01:20:09,046
(As it boils, a delicious smell
starts to spread)

1424
01:20:10,726 --> 01:20:12,445
(Last but not least)

1425
01:20:12,566 --> 01:20:15,166
(Let it cook with a touch
of Mount Jiri's breeze)

1426
01:20:15,286 --> 01:20:16,846
This is perfect for me.

1427
01:20:16,966 --> 01:20:17,766
Firm noodles?

1428
01:20:17,886 --> 01:20:19,406
Yes. I love it like this.

1429
01:20:19,766 --> 01:20:21,206
(He tastes the firm noodles)

1430
01:20:24,046 --> 01:20:25,966
- This is perfect.
- Let's remove it from the heat.

1431
01:20:26,086 --> 01:20:27,046
Where is it?

1432
01:20:27,606 --> 01:20:30,646
(Immediately prepare
the small table)

1433
01:20:30,766 --> 01:20:32,525
(Place the pot on top)

1434
01:20:32,646 --> 01:20:33,445
That looks good.

1435
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:35,966
You have to eat this right now.

1436
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:38,806
(Spicy ramyeon to wrap up
their day is ready)

1437
01:20:38,926 --> 01:20:39,806
Thank you.

1438
01:20:40,445 --> 01:20:41,006
Here.

1439
01:20:41,126 --> 01:20:43,126
(Their side dish with ramyeon)

1440
01:20:43,246 --> 01:20:46,686
(Chef Cha's geotjeori)

1441
01:20:46,806 --> 01:20:49,966
(A simple meal for them)

1442
01:20:50,686 --> 01:20:53,326
(An exhausting day from hiking)

1443
01:20:53,445 --> 01:20:56,086
(is wrapped up with a hot meal)

1444
01:20:56,726 --> 01:20:57,886
- How is it?
- It's spicy.

1445
01:20:58,006 --> 01:20:58,646
Spicy?

1446
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:00,686
It gets rid of the stress
from hiking up Nogodan, right?

1447
01:21:00,806 --> 01:21:01,766
It does.

1448
01:21:02,406 --> 01:21:04,326
(The one who is embarrassed from
being left behind)

1449
01:21:04,445 --> 01:21:07,126
- Go up to the peak next time.
- Okay.

1450
01:21:07,246 --> 01:21:08,726
I think I can do that
if I get to eat this.

1451
01:21:10,846 --> 01:21:13,766
(Get rid of their fatigue from
hiking up Nogodan with hot soup)

1452
01:21:15,445 --> 01:21:16,206
This is so delicious.

1453
01:21:16,726 --> 01:21:18,206
The kimchi has fermented well.

1454
01:21:18,326 --> 01:21:19,525
Right?

1455
01:21:20,046 --> 01:21:22,886
(Since the staff are now full
thanks to Chef Cha)

1456
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:26,286
(they taste it too)

1457
01:21:29,046 --> 01:21:30,686
This is different than
the one we had before.

1458
01:21:30,806 --> 01:21:32,246
I think I can taste beef.

1459
01:21:33,406 --> 01:21:35,926
I've been under a lot of
stress these days

1460
01:21:36,046 --> 01:21:37,445
but this gets rid of everything.

1461
01:21:38,046 --> 01:21:40,166
I can taste beef in this.

1462
01:21:53,566 --> 01:21:56,246
(Everybody has filled
their stomachs)

1463
01:21:58,606 --> 01:22:01,206
(Their final night in Mount Jiri
gets deeper)

1464
01:22:01,326 --> 01:22:03,686
Yes, there is a good method.

1465
01:22:03,806 --> 01:22:05,046
Wait. Where is it?

1466
01:22:06,846 --> 01:22:10,966
(Suddenly, Haejin removes
the brazier)

1467
01:22:11,686 --> 01:22:14,086
(He takes some firewood)

1468
01:22:14,206 --> 01:22:17,846
(and puts it over the fire
that is about to die out)

1469
01:22:20,646 --> 01:22:25,126
(He arranges it into the shape
of a pyramid so it burns)

1470
01:22:25,846 --> 01:22:28,646
(The first campfire at
3 Meals House is ready)

1471
01:22:29,326 --> 01:22:30,806
This is wonderful.

1472
01:22:30,926 --> 01:22:32,926
We've never used
the fire we started like this.

1473
01:22:34,606 --> 01:22:35,926
This is amazing.

1474
01:22:37,326 --> 01:22:40,086
(One of the tasks for
the Equipment Team)

1475
01:22:41,326 --> 01:22:44,326
(It is to start a fire using
a tiny flame from a match)

1476
01:22:44,445 --> 01:22:45,846
This is the sign
that we have begun.

1477
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:49,086
(Fire is the symbol that
it is time to have a meal)

1478
01:22:50,646 --> 01:22:54,846
(It turns 3 Meals House's yard
into a powerful kitchen)

1479
01:22:55,686 --> 01:22:59,646
(Their reliable cooking mate)

1480
01:23:00,445 --> 01:23:06,406
(They've struggled with it at
3 Meals House for 10 years)

1481
01:23:06,846 --> 01:23:07,886
I think this is ready.

1482
01:23:08,006 --> 01:23:10,926
(The brazier has always been
there to protect the yard)

1483
01:23:11,966 --> 01:23:13,726
I never knew that we'd be
using the fire in this way.

1484
01:23:13,846 --> 01:23:15,006
Right?

1485
01:23:15,126 --> 01:23:18,246
It takes a long time for us
to figure this out.

1486
01:23:18,366 --> 01:23:20,966
(Today, it is not a kitchen but
a fire to warm our body)

1487
01:23:21,806 --> 01:23:24,926
(They sit close to the hot fire)

1488
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:27,246
(while drinking romance)

1489
01:23:28,686 --> 01:23:30,086
This is wonderful.

1490
01:23:30,206 --> 01:23:31,366
The wrap-up is great.

1491
01:23:35,246 --> 01:23:38,326
(They enjoy refreshing night air
in silence)

1492
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:41,926
I don't feel hot at all.

1493
01:23:42,046 --> 01:23:43,806
What is the temperature?

1494
01:23:43,926 --> 01:23:44,566
Right now?

1495
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,806
It is around 20 degrees Celsius.
Just like at Nogodan Peak.

1496
01:23:46,926 --> 01:23:47,846
(The current temperature is
similar to Nogodan Peak)

1497
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:50,886
(They now feel the exhaustion)

1498
01:23:51,006 --> 01:23:53,886
(from hiking up Nogodan Peak)

1499
01:23:55,726 --> 01:23:57,366
We can't go home today, can we?

1500
01:23:59,086 --> 01:24:00,206
(He suddenly expresses
how he really feels)

1501
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:01,766
Everybody is gone

1502
01:24:01,886 --> 01:24:02,726
by tomorrow.

1503
01:24:02,846 --> 01:24:04,966
(The yard is empty)

1504
01:24:05,086 --> 01:24:06,485
We're not even in our room.

1505
01:24:06,606 --> 01:24:07,445
This place is empty.

1506
01:24:07,566 --> 01:24:09,966
All that is left is blood.

1507
01:24:11,006 --> 01:24:14,086
(They are done writing
a mystery novel)

1508
01:24:14,686 --> 01:24:18,206
(After staring into the fire
while chatting away happily)

1509
01:24:18,326 --> 01:24:19,086
This feels nice.

1510
01:24:21,046 --> 01:24:22,686
Look at the stars.

1511
01:24:22,806 --> 01:24:24,926
- Can you see the stars?
- Yes, I can.

1512
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:28,406
(Looks like there are many stars
in the sky)

1513
01:24:30,286 --> 01:24:31,406
Here too.

1514
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:33,286
- My gosh.
- There are so many stars.

1515
01:24:33,406 --> 01:24:34,445
(Wow)

1516
01:24:35,966 --> 01:24:37,126
(The shooting lights are
turned off for now)

1517
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:38,445
It's so beautiful.

1518
01:24:40,406 --> 01:24:41,766
(How does the sky look
in the dark?)

1519
01:24:41,886 --> 01:24:43,525
I feel like I am looking
at the Milky Way now.

1520
01:24:43,646 --> 01:24:44,566
Look up there.

1521
01:24:46,286 --> 01:24:48,766
(When we look at the dark sky)

1522
01:24:49,926 --> 01:24:52,046
(We get to see the stars
shining one by one)

1523
01:24:53,326 --> 01:24:57,166
(When our eyes adjust to
this darkness, we get to see more)

1524
01:24:57,286 --> 01:25:00,046
(The big and small stars)

1525
01:25:00,166 --> 01:25:03,485
(start to shine for one another)

1526
01:25:04,806 --> 01:25:10,246
(A magical scene
appears in front of us)

1527
01:25:15,046 --> 01:25:17,525
(Looks like the sky is made of
galaxies full of stars)

1528
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,246
There are so many stars.

1529
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:23,445
(It makes us stare at them)

1530
01:25:26,046 --> 01:25:28,046
(While looking at
the sky full of stars)

1531
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,366
There are stars everywhere.

1532
01:25:30,485 --> 01:25:31,846
This is the real Milky Way.

1533
01:25:31,966 --> 01:25:34,086
(We're making memories under
the sky full of stars)

1534
01:25:37,206 --> 01:25:41,726
(This night that is lit
by beautiful stars)

1535
01:25:42,886 --> 01:25:45,926
I finally feel better
after looking at the stars.

1536
01:25:46,046 --> 01:25:48,646
(Spending time with a long-time
partner is great happiness)

1537
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:55,046
Yoo, come here.

1538
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:56,766
Come here.

1539
01:25:57,286 --> 01:26:00,525
(They take a selfie
under the stars)

1540
01:26:00,646 --> 01:26:02,086
1, 2, 3.

1541
01:26:02,966 --> 01:26:05,046
(A picture under the
night sky of Mount Jiri)

1542
01:26:06,445 --> 01:26:09,686
These are all memories.

1543
01:26:09,806 --> 01:26:11,286
Please send that to me.

1544
01:26:11,406 --> 01:26:12,406
Yes, I will.

1545
01:26:12,525 --> 01:26:14,246
These are memories.

1546
01:26:15,966 --> 01:26:19,846
(They now have another page
made of memories)

1547
01:26:21,046 --> 01:26:22,606
This is very funny.

1548
01:26:22,726 --> 01:26:24,966
- Why?
- Just things like this.

1549
01:26:25,926 --> 01:26:27,686
When else can we do

1550
01:26:27,806 --> 01:26:28,766
something like this?

1551
01:26:28,886 --> 01:26:30,246
This is amazing.

1552
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:35,566
That star is your star

1553
01:26:35,686 --> 01:26:38,566
- That star is my star
- That star is my star

1554
01:26:39,606 --> 01:26:41,726
(There is a noraebang
in Mount Jiri)

1555
01:26:41,846 --> 01:26:44,566
(Suddenly, there is
a noraebang in Mount Jiri)

1556
01:26:44,686 --> 01:26:47,126
(They just hum to the melody
as they forgot the lyrics)

1557
01:26:47,246 --> 01:26:48,846
(Na-na-na)

1558
01:26:48,966 --> 01:26:51,126
(Na-na-na)

1559
01:26:51,246 --> 01:26:53,606
(This is a humming party)

1560
01:26:53,726 --> 01:26:55,286
(My gosh)

1561
01:26:55,406 --> 01:26:56,366
(My gosh)

1562
01:26:56,485 --> 01:26:58,206
- This feels great.
- Yes, it does.

1563
01:27:00,445 --> 01:27:01,326
When we're at a place like this...

1564
01:27:01,445 --> 01:27:04,006
A loving lover

1565
01:27:04,126 --> 01:27:07,525
holds my hand

1566
01:27:08,006 --> 01:27:10,646
(The 70s jukebox
can play suddenly)

1567
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:13,406
(Track 2 on Mount Jiri,
'Young Lovers' by SNU Trio, 1979)

1568
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:15,766
...calling us

1569
01:27:16,806 --> 01:27:18,566
(Going to the bridge)

1570
01:27:19,046 --> 01:27:22,606
This world...

1571
01:27:22,726 --> 01:27:24,246
(Immediately jump to the bridge)

1572
01:27:24,366 --> 01:27:26,606
Is it okay for you to
suddenly jump to that part?

1573
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:30,206
(They quickly wrap up
the noraebang in Mount Jiri)

1574
01:27:30,326 --> 01:27:32,525
Why? You're going to show me
some pictures? Please do.

1575
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:33,846
(The staff shows them a picture
of the stars)

1576
01:27:34,806 --> 01:27:36,566
You can see the stars clearly?

1577
01:27:36,966 --> 01:27:37,846
(Wow)

1578
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:39,886
Look at this.

1579
01:27:40,006 --> 01:27:41,246
(In awe)

1580
01:27:41,566 --> 01:27:42,686
You managed to do this?

1581
01:27:42,806 --> 01:27:43,806
(How does the picture of stars
taken by the staff looks?)

1582
01:27:44,246 --> 01:27:46,485
(Pictures of stars that was
taken using a cell phone)

1583
01:27:46,606 --> 01:27:48,445
This is unbelievable!

1584
01:27:49,445 --> 01:27:50,726
How did you
take pictures like this?

1585
01:27:50,846 --> 01:27:51,726
You can actually do this?

1586
01:27:54,846 --> 01:27:57,846
(Haejin's first time looking at
beautiful star pictures by phone)

1587
01:27:58,286 --> 01:28:00,206
- Your phone can do it too.
- I see.

1588
01:28:00,326 --> 01:28:02,485
- Shall I teach you?
- Yes.

1589
01:28:02,606 --> 01:28:03,926
I just learned how to do it too.

1590
01:28:04,046 --> 01:28:05,606
(Producer Na just learned
how to do it from his juniors)

1591
01:28:05,726 --> 01:28:06,566
Look at this.

1592
01:28:06,686 --> 01:28:07,366
Here...

1593
01:28:07,485 --> 01:28:10,485
(He immediately shares
the knowledge with Haejin)

1594
01:28:11,006 --> 01:28:13,726
(Explaining all the functions)

1595
01:28:14,606 --> 01:28:16,166
Make it as long as possible.

1596
01:28:16,286 --> 01:28:17,646
Yours is only for 10 seconds?

1597
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:20,846
Is it because this is
an old phone?

1598
01:28:21,286 --> 01:28:22,646
(Giggling)

1599
01:28:22,766 --> 01:28:24,445
Just try.

1600
01:28:24,926 --> 01:28:27,926
(He has been using this phone
for quite some time)

1601
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:30,846
He's taking pictures.

1602
01:28:31,686 --> 01:28:32,686
(Getting the right angle)

1603
01:28:33,646 --> 01:28:36,246
(Taking a picture for a long time)

1604
01:28:40,046 --> 01:28:41,566
(Still taking pictures)

1605
01:28:41,686 --> 01:28:43,726
This is taking ages.
What are you doing?

1606
01:28:43,846 --> 01:28:44,646
It doesn't work?

1607
01:28:46,286 --> 01:28:47,006
(Oh!)

1608
01:28:47,126 --> 01:28:47,806
My gosh.

1609
01:28:47,926 --> 01:28:49,646
This one...

1610
01:28:49,766 --> 01:28:51,086
What is this?

1611
01:28:51,646 --> 01:28:53,406
(What is the result of
Haejin's hard work?)

1612
01:28:55,606 --> 01:28:58,525
(Unknown orange hair?)

1613
01:28:58,646 --> 01:29:00,525
(The culprit is the fire)

1614
01:29:00,646 --> 01:29:01,166
Look at this.

1615
01:29:01,286 --> 01:29:02,126
What is it?

1616
01:29:02,246 --> 01:29:04,046
What is that?

1617
01:29:04,686 --> 01:29:07,206
(Although Haejin is a rookie
at taking pictures of stars)

1618
01:29:07,326 --> 01:29:10,286
You are an experienced person
at constellations.

1619
01:29:10,406 --> 01:29:11,926
(Haejin is knowledgeable
about constellations?)

1620
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:14,485
He has doctorate in astronomy.

1621
01:29:14,606 --> 01:29:15,886
(Yoo Haejin, PhD in Astronomy.
Studied somewhere in France)

1622
01:29:16,006 --> 01:29:17,606
What constellation is this?

1623
01:29:17,726 --> 01:29:19,126
(Suddenly, Dr. Yoo starts to
give a lecture on astronomy)

1624
01:29:19,246 --> 01:29:21,766
Their love for one another
will never happen.

1625
01:29:21,886 --> 01:29:23,326
That's why they are separated?

1626
01:29:23,445 --> 01:29:25,566
One is being jealous

1627
01:29:25,686 --> 01:29:27,006
about their relationship.

1628
01:29:27,126 --> 01:29:28,926
So, in a way,
everything is complete now.

1629
01:29:29,046 --> 01:29:30,766
What is the name
of this constellation?

1630
01:29:30,886 --> 01:29:32,006
Love Triangle.

1631
01:29:32,766 --> 01:29:34,886
(Actually,
it is a nonsense lecture)

1632
01:29:35,566 --> 01:29:36,686
You always talk nonsense.

1633
01:29:36,806 --> 01:29:38,846
The one over there...

1634
01:29:38,966 --> 01:29:40,086
That is a pheasant.

1635
01:29:42,646 --> 01:29:45,445
(Pheasant)

1636
01:29:45,926 --> 01:29:47,366
It does look like one.

1637
01:29:47,485 --> 01:29:48,966
Yes, it's a pheasant.

1638
01:29:49,086 --> 01:29:50,445
Like this.

1639
01:29:50,846 --> 01:29:52,926
(He's the first astronomer to
find the pheasant constellation)

1640
01:29:53,046 --> 01:29:53,686
Over there...

1641
01:29:53,806 --> 01:29:55,726
There are many stars
overlapping one another there.

1642
01:29:55,846 --> 01:29:57,326
- What are those?
- Those are Ripe Kimchi.

1643
01:29:59,206 --> 01:30:02,326
(Ripe Kimchi Constellation)

1644
01:30:02,445 --> 01:30:05,445
(He is a constellation maker)

1645
01:30:05,926 --> 01:30:06,726
Also...

1646
01:30:07,126 --> 01:30:08,406
(What else did he see?)

1647
01:30:08,525 --> 01:30:11,926
There is a big rectangular-shaped
space there, isn't there?

1648
01:30:12,046 --> 01:30:12,926
Yes, there is.

1649
01:30:13,046 --> 01:30:14,566
That is Mat.

1650
01:30:16,406 --> 01:30:19,166
(Mat)

1651
01:30:19,726 --> 01:30:21,606
(Dr. Yoo came up with
Mat Constellation)

1652
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:24,566
You'll be naming stars
all night long.

1653
01:30:24,686 --> 01:30:25,606
(That is how we have more
constellations unique to us)

1654
01:30:26,566 --> 01:30:28,566
(They are sad that this is
their last night together)

1655
01:30:28,686 --> 01:30:30,046
This is wonderful.

1656
01:30:31,366 --> 01:30:35,326
(Their night gets deeper until
the stars start to disappear)

1657
01:30:38,006 --> 01:30:41,485
(They put their sadness behind
and wait for tomorrow)

1658
01:30:42,846 --> 01:30:48,006
(They wrap up their last night
in Mount Jiri)

1659
01:30:48,126 --> 01:30:50,445
Let's pack our things after this.

1660
01:30:50,566 --> 01:30:52,166
(This is their final morning at
3 Meals House in Mount Jiri)

1661
01:30:52,286 --> 01:30:54,926
(Chef Cha has planned out
their final meal here)

1662
01:30:55,046 --> 01:30:57,286
(Stir-fried fern coated with
sesame oil and garlic)

1663
01:30:57,406 --> 01:30:59,966
(He prepares sour
seasoned chives quickly)

1664
01:31:00,086 --> 01:31:02,326
(Today's star is doenjang jjigae
made of bone broth)

1665
01:31:02,445 --> 01:31:04,886
(The final breakfast in Mount Jiri
is made up of various dishes)

1666
01:31:05,006 --> 01:31:05,726
(Wow)

1667
01:31:05,846 --> 01:31:06,886
This is so tasty.

1668
01:31:07,006 --> 01:31:08,166
- Not bad, right?
- Yes.

1669
01:31:08,286 --> 01:31:09,525
(Tasty food tastes good
when eaten in one mouthful)

1670
01:31:09,646 --> 01:31:11,246
I love this meal.

1671
01:31:11,366 --> 01:31:12,686
This is endless.

1672
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:14,166
(There's more)

1673
01:31:14,286 --> 01:31:15,046
We have more.

1674
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:17,126
(The dishes know that
they don't want to leave)

1675
01:31:17,246 --> 01:31:19,806
(Their final long journey
in 3 Meals House is over)

1676
01:31:20,525 --> 01:31:21,366
(Not long after that)

1677
01:31:21,485 --> 01:31:23,126
I never knew that this show
would end up in this direction.

1678
01:31:23,246 --> 01:31:26,326
(A studio recording for
'3 Meals A Day Light'?)

1679
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:28,445
(This looks like a cooking class)

1680
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:30,606
The fire
is not as good as Yeolmoa.

1681
01:31:30,726 --> 01:31:32,006
Hold on.

1682
01:31:33,126 --> 01:31:34,206
How do we cook rice with this?

1683
01:31:34,326 --> 01:31:36,246
(Special cooking show by these men
who are used to using a brazier)

1684
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:38,525
I can't let him control me.

1685
01:31:38,646 --> 01:31:39,926
I was scared.

1686
01:31:40,046 --> 01:31:41,286
(We start with their stories)

1687
01:31:41,406 --> 01:31:42,326
Haejin.

1688
01:31:42,445 --> 01:31:43,485
Please wash some lettuce.

1689
01:31:43,606 --> 01:31:45,046
Do you have vinegar?

1690
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,886
(Nobody can forget this episode)

1691
01:31:47,006 --> 01:31:48,366
I guess I can't fix my habit.

1692
01:31:48,485 --> 01:31:49,525
Did you do that
when you were younger?

1693
01:31:49,646 --> 01:31:51,886
Well, I'm still the same
even when I'm older now.

1694
01:31:52,366 --> 01:31:54,086
(They have great chemistry
to host this event too)

1695
01:31:54,206 --> 01:31:56,206
(A new side of
'3 Meals A Day Light')

1696
01:31:56,326 --> 01:31:58,525
(A new story that seems familiar
will begin)

1697
01:31:58,646 --> 01:32:01,566
The second thing I'm
most grateful about is

1698
01:32:01,686 --> 01:32:03,246
back from when we were
in Pyeongchang.

1699
01:32:04,646 --> 01:32:06,926
There was a very heavy wok.

1700
01:32:07,046 --> 01:32:09,326
I think it was when Youngwoong
was our guest.

1701
01:32:09,445 --> 01:32:10,646
I think I

1702
01:32:10,766 --> 01:32:12,525
was about to drop it.

1703
01:32:12,646 --> 01:32:14,445
Then he came to hold it.

1704
01:32:16,525 --> 01:32:18,485
I was so grateful for that.

1705
01:32:20,126 --> 01:32:22,766
Well, it's something like this.

1706
01:32:22,886 --> 01:32:27,206
The food might have fallen to
the ground if he didn't do that.

1707
01:32:27,326 --> 01:32:30,806
Back then,
I made a lot of mistakes.

1708
01:32:32,806 --> 01:32:36,046
So I wanted to do everything
I could to make things up.

1709
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:38,886
No, it wasn't a big deal.

1710
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:42,846
I'm grateful for things like that.

1711
01:32:54,566 --> 01:32:58,006
(10th year anniversary special,
3 Meals A Day Light)
